00-A2946-FM 4/13/04 11:43 AM Page vii ▲ Acknowledgments This project has been a gratifying publication to work on (since 1994, when it got under way), and I want to thank all the authors for committing their time and re- sources to see it come to fruition. D. Gentry Steele and the publication, market- ing, and editorial staff at Texas A&M University Press have greatly supported the project from the very beginning of our discussions, and they have also assisted me at each turn. Maureen Creamer Bemko did an excellent job of copyediting the draft manuscript. The revisions to the lengthy book manuscript were aided by comments by two anonymous peer reviewers, although I remain responsible for any omissions or errors. I am particularly grateful for the support of the executive committee and the board of directors of the Texas Archeological Society and for their permission to use materials in this book from the 1995Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society copyrighted to the society. Furthermore, I appreciate the efforts of many of the authors in either revising and significantly updating their papers, or in the case of thepapersbyMylesMillerandNancyKenmotsu;C.BrittBousman,BarryBaker, andAnneKerr;andRobertL.Brooks,Iamgratefulfortheirhardworkinprepar- ing new papers specifically for the book.

The prehistoric archeology of Texas began at least 11,500 years before the present (b.p.meaning, by convention, a.d.1950) (Table 1.1), in the Early Paleoindian period.1Depending upon the region and the archeologist, the Paleoindian period ended between 8,000 and 9,000 b.p.across Texas and was suc- ceeded by the Archaic period, with Early, Middle, and Late temporal subdivisions. Although a time of considerable diversity in lifeways, material culture, and behav- ior,theArchaicperiodshadmobilegroups across the state all characterized by a gen- eralized hunting-foraging economy. The Archaicperiodsendedbetween2,000and 1,000 years ago, and they are followed by Late Prehistoric cultures. In some areas, such as the High Plains, the upper Texas Coast, east Texas, and east-central Texas, archeologists also have defined Ceramic and/or Woodland periods that lasted from ca. 2,000 to 1,200 years ago (see Table 1.1). One of the more notable archeological characteristics of this period of time in these areas is the adoption of pottery by these particular aboriginal groups, and these groups also seem to have become more sedentary than other hunter-gatherer populations in Texas. The Late Prehistoric period began be- tween ca. 1,200 and 1,000 years ago and lasted until ca. 250 years ago in Texas (see Table 1.1), when Spanish and French colonists, traders, and missionaries began to settle across the area and write about Fig.1.3.

In spite of these difficulties, in many regions archeo- logical and historical research has estab- lished some linkages between the prehis- toric archeological record of tribes such as the Caddos, the Wichitas and affiliated groups, the Karankawas, the Querechos and Teyas of the Southern Plains, the Ju- manos, and the Mansos and Sumas in the western Trans-Pecos. The Tonkawas, long thought to have been prehistoric residents of Texas (see Newcomb 1961), are now known to have migrated into the state in thelateseventeenthcenturyandcoalesced with Native American groups that moved north from their original locations in northern Mexico (see summaries in New- comb 1993 and Prikryl 2001). Where helpful in providing different interpreta- tions of the prehistoric archeological rec- ord in several regions of Texas, chapters in this book will explore these archeologi- cal, ethnic, and cultural relationships. However, we begin first with a lengthy chapter that concerns the earliest inhabi- tants of Texas, the Paleoindians. These highly mobile groups lived in Texas more than 9,000 years ago, and perhaps as long as 11,500 to 12,000 years ago (see Table Fig.1.4. Selected important Paleoindian sites in Texas: 1.

In a com- pelling summary, Miller and Kenmotsu note significant periods of innovation and change throughout the prehistory of the Trans-Pecos, particularly in the western Trans-Pecos with the adoption of culti- gens by ca. 1500–1000 b.c.and the evi- dence for semisedentary settlements by ca. 2500 b.c., while eastern Trans-Pecos groups (with the notable exception of the La Junta district groups) never used culti- gens and maintained a mobile foraging lifestyle throughout the prehistoric era. The pace of change in the western Trans- Pecos accelerated in the Formative period (ca. a.d.200–1450) (see Table 1.1), and Fig.1.5.

The classification of projectile points remains one of the more dominant con- cerns of Paleoindian archeologists in Texas. While its importance should not be overstated, it is clear that the entire cultural-historical framework of Paleo- indian archeology is highly dependent on projectile point classifications. When projectile points are absent from a site, even with reliable radiocarbon dates the depth and breadth of the conclusions we can draw from such a site are limited. Fig.2.1.

Similar “Folsom-like” points were found at Dent, Colorado, in 1932 and at Miami, Texas, in 1934 (Fig.2.3). By Sep- tember, 1941, at a symposium held at Santa Fe, New Mexico, it was agreed that generalized Folsom would be called Clo- vis Fluted and true Folsom would be termed Folsom Fluted (E. Howard 1943; Krieger 1947a). The major difference be- tween Clovis Fluted and Folsom Fluted was the longer flutes, finer flaking, and thinner cross sections in Folsom Fluted points. It was also recognized that eastern forms similar to Clovis existed and these were called Ohio Fluted. The relative temporal positions of Clovis as older and Folsom as younger were not well under- stood until Glen Evans’s careful analysis of the stratigraphy at Blackwater Draw (J. Hester etal. 1972). Archeologists have retained the distinctions between Folsom and Clovis and between different forms ofClovissincethemid-twentiethcentury. Numerous Clovis and Folsom points have Fig.2.2. Folsom points from Lipscomb (after Hofman 1995). been discovered in Texas, and they have been recovered from excavated sites such as Miami, Lubbock Lake, Kincaid Shel- ter, Bonfire Shelter, Aubrey, Lipscomb, and Midland. Unfluted Projectile Points and the “Yuma Problem” Unfluted lanceolate projectile point typology presents a more difficult puzzle. E. B. Renaud’s (1931, 1932, 1934) intro- duction of Yuma as a type illustrates this quandary. Based on surface collections from northeastern Colorado near Yuma, Renaud (1931) described Yuma varieties with careful and precise attention to size, shape, and flaking morphology (Fig.2.4). These characteristics are the same basic set of observations used today, but Re- naud’s use of surface collections and his primary reliance on morphology instead of context prematurely led to a series of named types. Furthermore, Renaud (1932, 10) thought that Yuma forms preceded and were coeval with Folsom forms, although Figgins (1935) and Rob- erts (1940) suggested that Yuma points were manufactured after the production of Folsom projectile points had been discontinued.

Krieger amassed an impressive, at least for the time, set of quantitative data regarding metric dimensions, and he compared his results with those from other sites. It is clear that Krieger did not find the Yuma concept useful, and he ob- viously thought that the limited amount of variation he observed among the Plain- view projectile points provided strong evidence that this form was restricted in time and space. By 1954, with the publication ofAn Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology by Dee Ann Suhm etal., the acceptable variation for the Plainview type had stretched well beyond the original defini- tion. The size, flaking pattern, and shape of Plainview points had all been greatly expanded, and the type definition began to be applied indiscriminately. This trend began to be reversed a decade later with the introduction of Plainview Golondrina (golondrinabeing Spanish for swallow) as a variant of the Plainview type by LeRoy Johnson (1964) to distinguish projectile points he excavated from the Devil’s Mouth site in the Lower Pecos region (Fig.2.6). Johnson used the genus-species concept as a way to highlight the similari- ties and differences between Golondrina and Plainview points. By 1977, however, the genus-species approach had been dropped, and only the term Golondrina Fig.2.4.

This analysis narrowly defines Plainview points morphologically and thus clears away some of the typological confusion that has cluttered the type in the past. But as will be discussed in detail below, the temporal position of Plainview in the Southern Plains has been difficult to pin down. If the older dates, such as the 10,940 b.p.age from the Plainview site and the ca. 11,000 b.p.assays from Wilson-Leonard hold up, then the age of Plainview in the Southern Plains com- pares well with the age of Goshen-Plain- view in the Northern Plains (Frison etal. 1996). St. Mary’s Hall The specimens in clusters 10 and 11 are characterized by thicker stems than on other points, with moderately deep basal concavities (Fig.2.16). These points are from the St. Mary’s Hall site (Hester 1977b, 1978a, 1991a) in San Antonio, Levi Rock Shelter, bone concentration 3 in FA6-11 at Lubbock Lake, and predom- inantly from Unit II at Wilson-Leonard. The point from Levi Rock Shelter was previously called Plainview-Angostura, and the points from St. Mary’s Hall and Lubbock Lake were referred to as Plain- view points. However, now it is clear that these points are morphologically distinct from true Plainview, and with dates from two of the sites in the sample suggesting an age range between 9990 and 8700 b.p. (see a more detailed discussion below), these points have been distinguished ty- pologically as St. Mary’s Hall. It is likely that Kelly’s Miniature Plainview points (1983a) would fit within this class. Scottsbluff Cluster 15, characterized by wide, thick stems and very shallow basal con- cavities, contained three specimens, two of which are considered to be Scotts- bluff (Fig.2.17). Scottsbluff points have slightly formed shoulders that frame wide stems, and all come from Late Paleo- indian contexts at Wilson-Leonard (Bousman 1998a). The sample in this analysis was too small to examine all the variability possible in the Scottsbluff type, and a large sample with type site speci- mens would be more informative. Parallel-Sided Stem Within cluster 14 were four specimens from Wilson-Leonard that appear to have Fig.2.16. St. Mary’s Hall points from St. Mary’s Hall and Wilson-Leonard.

02-A2946 4/13/04 11:48 AM Page 34 34 / TEXAS PREHISTORY Summary The above section discusses the evi- dence for Texas Paleoindian projectile point typology. A number of distinctive morphological forms carry significant cul- tural-historical information. These forms include Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina-Barber, Wilson, St. Mary’s Hall, Dalton, Scottsbluff, Angostura, Berclair, San Patrice, Big Sandy, Lub- bock, and Thrall. With this larger array of more finely tuned point types it is pos- sible to begin the work needed to im- prove the chronological-stratigraphic range of these forms. Then, with greater confidence, researchers will be able to de- velop more anthropologically and behav- iorally focused analyses of Paleoindian archeology in Texas. Geological Stratigraphy and Site Descriptions The geological setting of the great ma- jority of Paleoindian sites can be easily summarized: most are surface occurrences and do not occur in a buried context. However, a few sites have been discovered Fig.2.24. Lubbock Lake map, areas 10 and 14 not shown (after E.

Sellards describes the playa deposits set into “red sandy clay bedrock” (1938, figs.3 and 5). The lowest playa fill was described as a fine silt colored by organic matter. The lower fill was overlain by a “loess stratum about 6 inches thick” (1938, 1002). Above the loess stratum was a silt similar to the lower fill, and the Clovis component and mammoth bone were in the bottom of this silt lens (1938, 1002–1003).

That the water was shallow is indicated by the thin layer of pond sedi- ment with broken and poorly preserved bones in the upper part and by the pres- ence of abundant fresh-water inverte- brates” (Sellards etal. 1947, 934). Sometime after 1945 the original pit was enlarged, and two additional pits were excavated. In the 1970s the original pit was filled with garbage. Holliday (1995d, 1997a) studied profiles that were visible during the 1980s and 1990s, and his descriptions provide a more detailed but, because of the contin- ued destruction and alteration of the site, limited view of the geological context of the Plainview site. Unfortunately, the bone bed was completely destroyed and/or covered over by the time Holliday began to work at the site. He suggests that the bone bed was sitting on a caliche bench formed by two earlier erosion events (Fig.2.33). The oldest and deepest channel that eroded one edge of the bench is filled with Stratum 1, a sand and gravel deposit. This channel is easily cor- related to the Sellards etal. (1947) basal unit. A second erosional event, possibly a later meander, is marked by a smaller channel filled with Stratum 1m deposits. This is an organic-rich, loamy, mud facies of Stratum 1. These deposits could be similar to those described by Sellards etal. as the “thin layer of pond sediment” (1947, 934). Overlying Stratum 1 are very thin, discontinuous, and contorted lenses of organic-rich mud. This is Stra- tum 2. Above Stratum 2 is Stratum 3 with lacustrine carbonate and eolian fa- cies, and it seals all the lower deposits and Fig.2.32.

Fur- thermore, Holliday (1997a, 109) ob- served Roberta Speer’s excavated blocks of bone removed by Sellards, and the bone was within a grayish-brown sandy loam above a gravel. Holliday (1999, personal communica- tion) believes that the bone bed is strati- graphically in and above Stratum 2m and above Stratum 1 and that the Stratum 2m radiocarbon assay is too young. Neverthe- less, Holliday illustrates the approximate position of the bone bed as being on the caliche bench and over Stratum 1m, and Fig.2.33. Plainview stratigraphy (after Holliday 1995d).

The stratigraphy was first described by Harrison (Harrison and Smith 1975; Harrison and Killen 1978) but has been re-described by Holliday (E. Johnson etal. 1982; Holliday 1997a). Holliday identified ten stratigraphic units and five soils (Fig.2.38). The basal units are a set of three fining-upward stratigraphic units that are capped by a soil (S1). Unit 1 is fluvial gravels and Fig.2.37. Golondrina hearth at Baker Cave (after Chadderdon 1983). sands. Above, Unit 2 has loams to silty clay loams that probably were deposited as overbank alluvium. The lowest soil correlates to Unit 3, a clay, and two ra- diocarbon dates indicate it is Pleistocene in age. Units 4, 5, and 6 comprise an- other set of fining-upward sediments that are also capped by a soil (S2). In the lower portion of this Ab3 horizon is a Plainview component, and below this (in a Bwb3 horizon) is the Folsom occupa- tion. Dates on organic matter in the soil and the bone date to the Early Holocene. Above this soil are three additional sets of sediments, each capped by a soil (S3, S4, and S5). Organic matter in S3 (Ab2 hori- zon) dates to the Middle Holocene, while organic matter in S4 (Ab1) dates to the Late Holocene. In many parts of the site, S4 (Ab1 horizon) and its associated depo- sitional units (Unit 8 and Unit 9) were removed by erosion, and Unit 10 directly overlies S3.

The oldest soil is the Somerset Paleosol, which dates to approximately 30,000 b.p.Late Pleis- tocene sand and gravel channel fills are inset unconformably against the Somerset Paleosol. Stratigraphically above and welded onto the Somerset Paleosol is the Perez Paleosol. This soil is Early Holo- cene in age and contains the Angostura component, with possible rock-lined cooking ovens. Above this are the Elm Creek, Medina, and Leon Creek Paleo- sols. These date to the Middle and Late Holocene and contain Archaic compo- nents. Late Prehistoric occupations were recovered in the modern surface soil. Fig.2.41. Richard Beene stratigraphy (after Thoms etal. 1996).

The Rex Rodgers site is in a terrace remnant within the Tule Creek canyon. Willey etal.

02-A2946 4/13/04 11:50 AM Page 47 PALEOINDIAN ARCHEOLOGY IN TEXAS / 47 will require the extensive use of AMS methods, but this alone is not enough. As the following discussion indicates, the most reliable chronologies come from those sites with good stratigraphic con- texts that have been intensively and chronologically sampled. These sites pro- duce a sequence of absolute dates in dif- ferent levels that act to constrain the en- tire sequence through time. No longer can we depend on sites that have only one or a few determinations. Along with tree- ring and coral calibration, stratigraphi- cally constrained assays provide the best method for determining the age and the time spans for events and periods during the Paleoindian stage. The recent extension of calibrated ages into the Paleoindian stage dramatically demonstrates that radiocarbon time is stretched and compressed on a calendrical time scale (Stuiver and Braziunas 1993; Fig.2.43. Difference between calibrated and radiocarbon years plotted on radiocarbon time scale. Stuiver and Reimer 1993; R. Taylor etal. 1996; Fiedel 1999).

02-A2946 4/13/04 11:50 AM Page 72 72 / TEXAS PREHISTORY The distribution of Clovis sites is spread throughout the entire state, sug- gesting that the Early Paleoindian groups occupied all regions during this well-rec- ognized period (see Fig.2.46b). Also, the number of Clovis sites is perhaps surpris- ing for this early period, but this distribu- tion is supported by Meltzer and Bever’s (1995) distributional study. Although Folsom/Midland sites ap- pear to be more common in the prairies and grasslands (see Fig.2.46c), they are unexpectedly common in east Texas (Story 1990). Many investigators have suggested that Folsom/Midland hunter- gatherers were specialized bison hunters (e.g., Hofman 1991b), but their occur- rence in east Texas, when the pollen data from east-central Texas indicates that woodlands would have been extensive (Bousman 1998b), suggests a more com- plex adaptation. The distribution of stemmed projectile points associated with Paleoindian occu- pations in the southern portion of the Fig.2.45.

The overall picture reflected by Texas Clovis assemblages is that while mam- moth hunting was certainly part of the Clovis subsistence repertoire, a broader range of animals was also exploited.

Campbell, who was Ray’s field assistant during the July, 1938, excavation, doubts that Clovis materials and the mammoth were in di- rect association (Campbell, 1978 letter to Thomas R. Hester). The fauna and Clo- vis point association, and thus the gener- ally accepted interpretation of McLean as a Clovis mammoth kill, must remain in serious question. Folsom/Midland Additional Early Paleoindian sites include those classified here as Folsom/ Midland. These assemblages include Lake Theo, Lipscomb, Lubbock Lake, Lub- bock Landfill, Scharbauer (Midland), and Shifting Sands. Two bone beds were excavated at Lake Theo in the Rolling Plains (Harrison and Smith 1975; Harrison and Killen 1978). The lower bed contained Folsom points in association withBison antiquus,and the upper bone bed is associated with an unfluted parallel-stemmed lanceolate point that was classified as Plainview. The Folsom/Midland component contained 524 bison bones from at least twelve ani- mals, and Harrison and Smith (1975,74) interpreted the site as a butchering station andcampsite,ratherthanakillsite,based on element representation, possible bone stacking, and the lithic assemblage. Age estimation of the bison suggested a late summer or early fall kill. Lipscomb is another key Paleoindian site, and it is cited widely in discussions of Folsom lifeways (Barbour and Schultz 1941; Hofman 1995; Hofman and Todd 1990, 1995; Hofman etal. 1989a, 1991b; Schultz 1943; Todd 1991; Todd Fig.2.48.

There, the articulated bones of an extinct bison were jacketed and removed in block form using paleontological excavation techniques. Upon further excavation in the laboratory, three Milnesand points were recovered from the skeleton. This site was crucial for documenting human associations with extinct faunas and for beginning to address the question of Paleoindian subsistence. While the Lone Wolf Creek projectile points are now classified as Plainview, it was not until two decades later that the Plainview type site itself was excavated. The Plainview site (41HA1) bison bed was discovered in 1933, and caliche quar- rying operations continued to expose more of the bed until 1941, when mining for the road-grade stone ceased (Speer Fig.2.49.

The degree of alveolar resorption between the two groups is roughly the same. The Wilson-Leonard Paleoindian had frequent pits and evidence of moderate to large striations on the teeth. The flattened tooth wear indicates either the consump- tion of hard, gritty foods, or long-term use of the teeth (Powell and Steele 1994), apatternsimilartothatofArchaichunters and gatherers.

In terms of population affinity, Steele (1998, 1453) noted that Wilson-Leonard II has shoveling of the upper incisors, a common trait in American Indian popu- lations but comparatively rare in Euro- peans.

Conical and wedge-shaped blade cores occur, but conical cores are the most common. The platforms on conical blade cores are roughly circular, prepared by the removal of broad but short flakes that often hinge (Fig.2.52). This hinging produces large central knots on the platform. Blade scars on the slides of the blade cores often are missing negative bulbs of percussion, sug- gesting to Collins that core platforms Fig.2.52.

Archeology is a historical science, and constantly improving chronological control of the past must remain a primary objective,but only as the framework for or- dering more substantive inquiries and find- ings.In this vein, much has been said about the validity and meaning of various temporal frameworks offered for central Texas prehistory. In spite of the use of terms such asphase,and the discussion of phases in ways suggesting they have eth- nic meaning, the foremost purpose of such constructs has been temporal order- ing of archeological material culture. These constructs are based largely on morphological (supposedly stylistic) trends in artifact forms and, as such, are archeological style periods,not unlike style periods (e.g., Victorian, Greek Revival, or Tudor) used by architects. Eileen Johnson (1987c, 1991) has suggested that some of our archeological style periods be called Fig.3.1. The central Texas archeological area (after Prewitt 1981). G&S Typesetters PDF proof

Documented sites are in open areas on various topographic features, along blufflines, in rockshelters, and in caves; site characteristics differ greatly, but they afford clues as to the function or functions of any given site, or to a component within a site (Table 3.1). In central Texas, the most common kind of site recognized is an accumulation of debris (burned rock, stone chipping residue, pottery sherds) and diverse utili- tarian objects (grinding stones, hammer- stones, unifaces, and bifaces), sometimes in great quantities.

The larger subarea is north and west of the scarp, on itsupside.Mostofthisisdissectedpla- teaulandofresistantlimestoneandthin uplandsoils,butdeeplyerodedcrystalline rocks—theCentralTexasMineralRe- gion—are present as well. The prevailing vegetation is oak and juniper savanna. Of roughly half the size of the larger subarea is the smaller subarea, south and east of the scarp, on its downside. This is part a b of the coastal plain, a region of relatively soft bedrock and deep soils. Most of this subarea is prairie with deep clayey soils, but a narrowstripalongitseasternmar- ginispost oak forest standing on deep sandy soils. Along the escarpment lies a great eco- tone (see Fig.3.4a) where natural condi- tions are transitional between the plateau to the west and north and the prairies to the east and south. More importantly, it is beneficial for humans to occupy an c d ecotone whence they can readily access contrasting resources in the adjacent Fig.3.3.Examplesoftheverycommonburnedrockmiddensandtheuncommonrockartpanels biomes and capitalize on the resource ofcentralTexas:a(upperleft),apristineburnedrockmiddeninBlancoCounty;b,burnedrock diversity of the transitional zone. middenandhearthinthestratifiedWileyWilliamssite,TravisCounty;c,typicalstructureofa burnedrockmidden(SuttonCounty);d(lowerright),pictographsatPaintRockinConchoCounty. Annual precipitation decreases from east to west across central Texas from near 100 cm to 55 cm. The primary water resources for pre-industrial peoples are streams and springs. Two river sys- tems, the Brazos and the Colorado, drain approximately 75 percent of the central Texas area (see Fig.3.4b); the remaining 25 percent is roughly equally divided into the catchments of the Nueces, San Anto- nio,andGuadalupeRivers(seeFig.3.4b). Generally, drainage is toward the south- east. Of the 281 springs documented for Texas, 139 (49 percent) are in the area, including both of the state’s very large springs (!100 cubic feet per sec- ond), and 12 of the state’s 17 large (10 to 100 cubic feet per second) springs (Brune 1975). Change, as it is everywhere, is and al- ways has been unrelenting across the land of central Texas. Wind, water, and gravity move earth material from place to place; lakes, streams, and springs flourish and fail; caves and rockshelters form, enlarge, degrade, and collapse. The delicate bal- ances between soils, climates, plants, and animals are ceaselessly being adjusted.

03-A2946 4/13/04 11:54 AM Page 106 106 / PRAIRIES AND PLAINS Landscape Evolution from Earthquakes to Earthworms Foremost among deficiencies in the methodology by which most of the cen- tral Texas archeological record has been built is an inadequate recognition of the dynamic nature of the physical environ- ment. Landscape evolution has profound implications for archeological inquiry. Issues of long-term changes in climate (Bryant 1977; Bryant and Shafer 1977; Bryant and Holloway 1985) and biotic communities (e.g., Dillehay 1974) have received considerable attention from archeologists, but these issues are like words without music when played against a static terrain. A few examples will illus- trate the importance of integrating arche- ological inquiry with an understanding of Fig.3.5. Site distributions in the basin of Robert Lee Reservoir; note paucity of sites on the in- landscape change—whether one is study- side of river bends (from Shafer 1967). ing a region or a single sit Most archeological surveys, until re- cent years, were conducted without the explicit objective of discovering buried sites (e.g., Shafer etal. 1964). Even though awareness of the need for subsur- face reconnaissance has increased (e.g., J. W. Saunders etal. 1992), much of our archeological data base was generated without this awareness and is significantly biased as a result. Corollary to discovering buriedsitesistherecognitionthatinsome areas landscape change has been sufficient to obliterate sites. The important point here is that geologic and pedogenic pro- cesses havenonrandomlyaltered, buried, and destroyed sites (e.g., Abbott 1995). Examples from different areas of central Texas are instructive. Fluvial Systems Simplified depictions of site distribu- tions from archeological surveys in three reservoirsalongtheColoradoRiverclearly illustrate one aspect of this bias. In two of the three project areas (Figs. 3.5 and 3.6), virtually no sites were recorded on the inside of bends in the river (Jackson and Woolsey 1938; Shafer 1967). In the third area (Fig.3.7), only a few sites, “ephemeral and not worthy of excava- tion” (M. Collins 1995, 368) were noted on the inside of bends (Texas Archeologi- cal Research Laboratory [TARL] files). Are we to infer that people almost never chose to live on the inside of river bends? No, I suggest we are to infer instead that Fig.3.6.

Alan Skinner (1974) found larger sites typically occurring along the main trunk of the Guadalupe River, with small sites being more characteristic of the tributar- ies. He interpreted this situation to reflect an Archaic settlement pattern with base camps on the large river linked to extrac- tive sites in the smaller valleys. However, this conclusion cannot be valid because the archeological record formed differ- ently along the main trunk and its tribu- taries. Exposed Early Archaic sites are extremely infrequent in the main Guada- lupe valley, probably because most of them are deeply buried in Late Holocene alluvium, whereas in the upper reaches of tributaries, where little deposition has oc- curred since the Early Holocene, compo- nents dating throughout the Archaic are present, often mixed together in multi- component sites on long-stable surfaces (M. Collins etal. 1990, 13–15). Finally, recent mapping and dating of allostratigraphic units in the valley of the Colorado River downstream from the Balcones Escarpment (Blum 1992) has shown that major changes have taken place in a much shorter time frame than previously inferred (e.g., Baker and Pen- teado-Orellana 1978).1During the cul- turally relevant past (ca. 12,000 b.p.to the present), four periods of Colorado River valley geomorphic history can be recognized, based on Blum’s findings (1992), as relevant to the formation of the archeological record in the eastern part of central Texas. At approximately twelve thousand years ago, the river had downcut in its older valley fill and was cutting into bedrock. High surfaces of the older fill (the Eagle Lake Alloformation that had Fig.3.7. Site distributions in the lower reaches of Marshall Ford (Lake Travis) basin; note that built up during the period between relatively few sites were mapped on the inside of river bends; sites 41TV208, 229, 240, 307, and 320 were tabulated in survey report as “ephemeral and not worthy of excavation” (M.

03-A2946 4/13/04 11:54 AM Page 112 112 / PRAIRIES AND PLAINS the ones that have been found and have not rigorously sought others. Also, it is common for gisements in central Texas to have denser cultural deposits in the upper layers and sparser ones at depth (e.g., as at the Landslide and Wilson-Leonard sites). I have no doubt that countless times the excavators of such sites stopped digging either when artifact counts dropped off or when a sterile deposit was encountered (see the account of the previous testing of the Camp Pearl Wheat site [M. Collins etal. 1990]). In those cases, any deeper components went undetected. Deep stratified sites, with one, several, or many isolable cultural components, have been documented since at least the 1930s (for example, the Merrell Site, ex- cavated in 1934 and 1935 [Campbell 1948] and Rob Roy, dug in 1938 and 1939 [A. Jackson 1939]), and a few have been important in the development of the local record (notably Youngsport, a Landslide, Kyle, Smith, Loeve-Fox, and b Jetta Court). Nonetheless, in spite of archeological work begun at least by 1918 (Pearce 1932b, 48), only about thirty-one gisements with one or more securely isolated archeological compo- nents have been reported in central Texas (Figs. 3.8 and 3.9a and b). I have characterized the components at these sites as having either very high or moderately high integrity on arbitrary and somewhat subjective criteria.

Twelve geological, palynological, or paleontological records (see Fig.3.9b) in and near the central Texas archeological area reflect a consistent but generalized environmental sequence (see Table 3.2). Alternating intervals of comparatively mesic or xeric conditions have been in- ferred by Bousman in the pollen se- quences from bogs in east-central Texas (M. Collins and Bousman 1993) and by Rickard S. Toomey from the vertebrate faunal record of Hall’s Cave (Toomey 1993; Toomey etal. 1993). The bog- pollen sequence is not well controlled chronologically; however, the available dates indicate relatively constant rates of sedimentation, from which Bousman in- terpolated the depicted sequence. Bous- man’s interpretation of the reported pollen data from Weakly and Boriack bogs considered the relative frequency of grass to arboreal pollens. In doing this, a climatically sensitive aspect of the pollen record emerges from the complete spec- trum that otherwise contains numerous taxa, of which the abundances are more likely reflective of localized conditions around the bogs. In Hall’s Cave a deeply stratified, abundant, high-resolution sequence of small animal remains was found. Toomey excavated 3.7 m into the fill of Hall’s Cave and recovered thousands of faunal Fig.3.9a.

03-A2946 4/13/04 11:54 AM Page 114 114 / PRAIRIES AND PLAINS and by three charcoal dates (Toomey 1993). Because of the large number of dates, the fact that the dates are almost perfectly stratigraphically consistent, and the generally high internal agreement be- tween radiocarbon ages determined on different chemical fractions of the same bone, this sequence can be considered one of the best-dated and most environ- mentally sensitive records in North America. Concern expressed by L. John- son and Goode (1994, 22) in regard to dates on the earthen fill of Hall’s Cave is clearly dispelled by the bone-organic chronology. When it is fully reported, the Hall’s Cave biostratigraphy will be a land- mark contribution to Quaternary studies. These pollen and faunal records both indicate an early xeric interval ending near 12,000 b.p.(closely correlating with the “Clovis Drought” noted in Haynes 1991) followed by a significant period of relatively mesic conditions. Each record then indicates a long Middle Holocene interval of relatively xeric conditions, whichwereslightlyamelioratedatroughly its midpoint. That the two records are not synchronous probably results largely, if not entirely, from inaccuracy in the ages interpolated for the bog-pollen se- quence. In general terms, the Middle Holocene xeric interval lasted approxi- mately five thousand years—close to half of the local prehistory. The effects of Middle Holocene aridity are seen widely in central Texas, often in the form of stream incision, but precise dating is of- ten difficult (see Abbott 1994). Late Holocene conditions returned to being more mesic. The pollen and faunal indicators are inconsistent only in the lat- est Holocene, when a final swing toward xericconditionsappearsintheHall’sCave fauna. Other than relatively small samples of the species (and, therefore, possible sampling error) on which Toomey based his interpretations, the inconsistency is not readily understood. It is possible, of course, that contrasting conditions could exist because the pollen record is from the easternmost edge of the area and the fau- nal record is from more nearly the west- ernmost edge.

The approximately five thousand years of the Middle Holocene xeric interval—43 percent of the record —are represented by only about seven- teen (22 percent) of the sixty-one compo- nents in Fig.3.9a. Downcutting of valleys occurred widely in the Middle Holocene, leaving former valley floors above the reach of most flooding and bringing deposition on these surfaces to a virtual halt. Major soils that formed on these long stable surfaces are documented over wide areas in the valleys of central Texas during the Middle Holocene, and many sites, especially burned rock middens, reside on those surfaces.Itisfromthesenumerous,highly visible, artifact-rich sites that much of the archeological record for the Middle Holocene has been derived.

Subsistence in Clovis times was based on diverse fauna (including large herbi- vores such as mammoth, bison, and horse as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, land tortoises, alligator, mice, badger, and raccoon). The diet presum- ably also included an array of plants (M. Collins etal. 1989b). A paved floor at Kincaid Rockshelter reflects a greater investment of labor than nomadichunterscouldaffordonafleeting habitation. (Enough stones, totaling more than two metric tons, were brought in from the nearby riverbed to cover 10 m2 of the muddy shelter floor [M. Collins 1990b; M. Collins etal. 1989b].) Caches of Clovis artifacts (in Texas and elsewhere in North America [M. Collins n.d.]) are suggestive of hunting and gathering rounds that returned groups to the same places more reliably than is the case with nomadic hunters of big game. Overall, the data indicate the Clovis lifeway to have been that of well-adapted, generalized hunter-gatherers with the technology to hunt big game but not to rely exclusively on it. Either their travels or their contacts with other groups en- abled them to acquire exotic stone from great distances. Ironically, more is known of these earliest Paleoindians than of those who came later. In contrast to Clovis lifeways, subsis- tence in Folsom times seems to have been more reliant upon specialized hunting of big game (bison). Sites with Folsom-age components in central Texas include Horn Shelter No. 2, Pavo Real, Wilson- Leonard, and Kincaid, the latter two of Fig.3.11.

They occur in a deposit dated between 9980 and 9500 b.p.at Horn Shelter No. 2 (Redder 1985) but remain undated at Kincaid (M. Collins 1990b). Everything about the fauna, as- sociated artifacts, and features (including a double burial) found with San Patrice (Brazos Fishtailed) and Dalton points at Horn Shelter No. 2 suggests an Archaic- like, hunter-gatherer cultural manifesta- tion (Redder 1985). For Fig.3.9a I have tentatively regarded this material as tran- sitional, between Early and Late Paleo- indian; future work or new finds will help clarify the picture. Three style intervals—Wilson, Golon- drina-Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall—are here proposed for the late subperiod of the Paleoindian period (see Fig.3.9a). These style intervals are moderately well defined at the Wilson-Leonard site (M. Collins 1998c; Masson and Collins 1995). The Wilson component is the better represented and is characterized as having corner-notched, Archaic-like Wil- son dart points (see Fig 3.12g) (Masson and Collins 1995; Weir 1985) in associa- tion with features, a burial, artifacts, and faunal remains more Archaic than Paleo- indian in appearance. Dates for this com- ponent are ca. 10,000 to 9650 b.p.(Mas- son and Collins 1995). The Archaic-like character continues for the Golondrina-Barber and St. Mary’s Fig.3.12.

03-A2946 4/13/04 11:55 AM Page 119 ARCHEOLOGY IN CENTRAL TEXAS / 119 For more than seventy-five hundred years the basic Archaic mode of life pre- vailed in central Texas. There are distinc- tive changes to be seen within the Archaic archeological record, but it is not clear how significant these changes really were at the times they occurred. It is clear, however, that in the broadest sense this long span represents a basic adaptation that was successful. A priority in the in- vestigation of the Archaic record is to bet- ter understand the fundamentals of that adaptation and to determine the signifi- cance of the variations seen over time and across space. In briefly reviewing the Archaic of central Texas, the cultural chronological framework proposed by L. Johnson and Goode (1994) is adopted with minor adjustments. The early part of the Archaic, from ca. 8800 to 6000 b.p., is here subdivided into the three projectile point style inter- vals: Angostura (see Fig.3.13b), early split-stem (see Fig.3.13e, f), and Martin- dale-Uvalde (see Fig.3.13g–k) (see also Fig.3.9a). Open camp sites (including Loeve, Wilson-Leonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Jetta Court, Youngsport, Camp Pearl Wheat, and Landslide) as well as a cave (Hall’s Cave) occupied at the far reach of daylight contain noteworthy components of the Early Archaic. Nu- merous dart points and Guadalupe tools attributable to the Early Archaic also are present in Kincaid Rockshelter, but in mixed contexts. It is unclear if the distributional data are representative, but a number of au- thors have noted a concentration of Early Fig.3.13.

The middle subperiod of the Archaic, from ca. 6000 to 4000 b.p., too, is fur- ther subdivided into three style inter- vals: Bell-Andice-CalfCreek,Taylor, andNolan-Travis (see Figs. 3.9a and 3.14b–g). The earlier two of these inter- vals reflect a shift in lithic technology from that which had prevailed earlier. Bell-Andice-Calf Creek and Taylor are thin, basically triangular bifaces with long thinning flakes emanating bifacially from the base; Taylor bifaces remain un- notched whereas Bell-Andice-Calf Creek bifaces are characterized by deep, narrow basal notches. All of these thin-bladed forms would serve equally well as knives or as tips of lances, spears, or darts. Im- pact fractures common on the Bell- Andice-Calf Creek forms attest to their use as weapon tips. Climate during the earliest interval (Bell-Andice-Calf Creek) was somewhat mesic. It was a time when bison were hunted, leading L. Johnson and Goode (1994) to surmise, correctly, I think (M. Collins 1994a, 94), that these thin bifaces were part of a specialized bison- hunting weaponry, probably brought to the region by peoples moving southwest- erly from the prairie, prairie margins, and woodlands west of the Ozarks (see Wyck- off 1995). A tantalizing hint of function- ally different sites is seen in this interval, with a greater diversity of tool forms oc- curring at the Landslide site than at the Barton site’s Bell-Andice component. Notable at Landslide are more wood- and bone-working kinds of tools and espe- cially milling equipment, which is absent from the Barton site. It seems apparent Fig.3.14.

In a very sub- jective sense, components of this interval seemtometoshowlessintensiveusethan that indicated at earlier-interval compo- nents, particularly those of the early split- stem interval. Perhaps greater mobility as- sociated with bison hunting is indicated. By the later Middle Archaic Taylor and Nolan-Travis intervals, bison have disap- peared from the record and more xeric climate conditions have returned. In fact, this transition culminates toward the end of the Nolan-Travis interval in what ap- pears from the record to have been the onset of the most xeric conditions ever experienced by humans in central Texas. Interestingly, Taylor and Nolan-Travis components again have the appearance of either long-term or intensive use, or both. Burned rock middens debut (best seen at the Wounded Eye site in Kerr County, where Taylor bifaces dominate the assem- blage recovered from a small burned rock midden). Another technological shift is seen in the production and morphology of Nolan and Travis projectile points, as they have comparatively thick and often narrowblades(especiallyonTravispoints) with stems and shoulders; distinctive beveling of the stems is characteristic of Nolan points. L. Johnson and Goode (1994, 26) suggest, as Prewitt (n.d.) had earlier sug- gested, that burned rock middens at this time were more frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol, which may havethrivedincentralTexasasconditions became drier. This practice does not nec- essarily signal an end to extraction of the more typical oak-savanna floral and fau- nal resources; it could be merely a shift in Fig.3.15.

Late Prehistoric Archeologists working in central Texas have not been able to clearly interpret the extent and importance of the material cultural change that occurred in the re- gion ca. 1200 b.p.This is the somewhat arbitrary break commonly made between the long Archaic period and its successor, the Late Prehistoric. Previously this was referred to as the “Neo-American Stage” (D. Suhm etal. 1954, 20) in the expecta- tion that all three defining traits (pottery, bow and arrow, and agriculture) would eventually be recognized. It now appears that generally for central Texas, only the bow and arrow appeared initially, pot- tery was added later, and agriculture (or, at least, the possession of tropical culti- gens) came last and was of quite minor importance. Because basic hunting and gathering subsistence continued, what is here called the Late Prehistoric has also been labeled the “Neo-Archaic” (Prewitt 1981) or the “Post-Archaic” (L. Johnson and Goode 1994). Two subperiods, early and late (see Fig.3.9), are here recognized in the Late Prehistoric (Jelks 1962); these corre- spond to the Austin and Toyah “phases” (I will continue to use the term “inter- val”) of long-standing use in the system- atics of the local prehistory (Prewitt 1981).

South Texas archeology is beginning to benefit from geomorphological re- search, especially in the terraces along the Rio Grande (M. Collins 1991c) and in the Rio Grande Delta (M. Collins etal. 1989a). Other studies were also carried out at Choke Canyon (Bunker 1982) and Loma Sandia (Holliday 1995b), but much remains to be done across the region. Evidence of climatic change in the re- gion is also hard to obtain. R. L. Robin- son (1982) used phytolith data from Choke Canyon Reservoir to offer a pat- tern of short- versus tall-grass occurrence through time, perhaps reflecting alternat- ing wet and dry episodes. While tree-ring coring has helped to give drought histo- ries for part of Texas since 1698 (Stahle and Cleaveland 1988), this procedure has had only preliminary application in south Texas (Gunn 1985). The history of archeology in southern Texas has been reviewed in detail by Mal- louf etal. (1977) and most recently by Black (1989a, 40–44). In essence, little work was done in the region prior to the late 1960s. Since that time, a number of important sites have been excavated (see, Fig.4.1.

I have also seen stratified sites at the mouths of ma- jor creeks emptying into the Rio Grande in Webb County; no excavations have been done at these sites. Cemetery sites are present in southern Texas and are rather common in the Coastal Bend. The Loma Sandia site (41LK28 [A.

Falcon Reservoir sites at the mercies of collectors and looters, and only a couple of devoted avocational archeologists have made the effort to document and scien- tifically record these burials. This fiasco at Falcon Reservoir, during low-water epi- sodes in the 1980s and 1990s, is evidence of the failure of the International Bound- ary and Water Commission to live up to its responsibility to protect archeological sites (although one minor survey was done by O’Neill etal. [1992]) on both sides of this reservoir. None of these kinds of sites were detected by the limited Falcon Reservoir salvage efforts in the early 1950s (e.g., Cason 1952), and de- spite state and federal laws and interna- tional treaties, motorboat looters have largely erased a critical archeological record. Other burial sites have been docu- mented in recent years. These include the Haiduk burial (Mitchell etal. 1984), with Late Archaic diagnostics at a site in Karnes County; several disturbed burials at the Shrew site (Labadie 1988); a burial in Lavaca County (Hester 1994a) with an associated Gahagan biface, reflecting trade with others in east or southeastern Texas; and a Late Prehistoric burial in Frio County (Hester etal. 1993b) with an associated Scallorn arrow point.

A petroglyph site is also reported by Smith east of Uvalde, just south of the Balcones Escarpment. At several sites, painted pebbles have been found. These pebbles and rock art are thought of as typical of Lower Pecos rockshelters (Shafer 1986). However, a number have now been documented at sites on the coastal plain in southern Uvalde and northern Zavala Counties (Fig.4.6; Hester 1977a; Ray Smith 1987, personal communication; records on file at TARL).

Landowners such as Radcliffe Killam of Laredo have made collections available for documentation (Bettis 1997), while some families have donated major collections for long-term curation and research (e.g., at TARL, the Bromley Cooper and Dr. Pat Riley collections). This type of dona- tion is to be especially encouraged. Cultural-Historical Framework The characteristics of the south Texas archeological record, and the comparative lack of intensive excavations, all contrib- ute to a chronology that remains poorly known. L. Johnson and Goode (1994) have offered a revised chronology for the central part of Texas, derived from more than seventy years of excavations and re- cent major research efforts that have yielded better stratigraphic and radio- carbon ages. Unfortunately, we cannot provide the sort of fine-tuned chronology forsouthernTexasthathasbeenproduced for central Texas. What can be offered at present is a general framework for the Fig.4.7.

Buried more than eight meters below the surface along Coleto Creek (and now in- undated by Coleto Creek Reservoir), ex- cavations on a ledge or bench deposit un- covered a hearth, an in situ chipping area, cores, two small pits, and an unfinished (or rejected) triangular biface; there were no projectile point diagnostics. Eight ra- diocarbon dates were obtained, averaging around 9500 b.p., although both earlier and later dates were obtained. Associated with the cultural material was a consider- able bone deposit of small mammals, rep- tiles, and amphibians. Detailed research by Kenneth Brown (1996) indicates that these animals were collected and eaten by human foragers, perhaps by what Brown suggests was a task group of women and children. The Berger Bluff fauna, as well as tiny snails obtained by water screening, is fully Holocene in character but con- tained some species that are no longer present in the area today. Three species of snails, now extirpated in the Coleto Creek/southern Texas area, are more typi- cal of colder waters or of marshes more typical of the eastern United States. Later Paleoindian patterns in southern Texas are represented by large numbers of projectile points (see Fig.4.9; Hester 1977b, 1987; Weir 1956). However, ty- pological problems abound in distin- guishing between Plainview (ca. 10,000 b.p.) and Golondrina (ca. 9000 b.p.[Hes- ter 1983]).

A better picture of the relationships among several central and south Texas Late Paleoindian types may be possible now that the Wilson- Leonard data have been analyzed and published (see M. Collins 1998c). Another Paleoindian type known from Devil’s Mouth (L. Johnson 1964) and Wilson-Leonard (Michael B. Collins 1995, personal communication) is also present in south Texas. This is the early stemmed or Wilson type (E. Turner and Hester 1993). Bettis (1997) reports one specimen from Webb County. Extremely common in southern Texas is the Angostura type (see Fig.4.9f, g). Recent excavations in the area of the Ap- plewhite Reservoir in southern Bexar County have uncovered a buried Angos- tura component radiocarbon dated to approximating 9800 b.p.(Thoms and Mandel 1992). This date is in line with thoseforAngosturafromWilson-Leonard (M. Collins 1995, personal communica- tion; M. Collins 1998a). Possibly related to Angostura is the early stemmed lanceo- late form (E.

My goal in offering these two concepts was to emphasize the broad cross-regional distributions of the index-marker projec- tile points of these horizons in the Texas- Mexico borderlands. In southern Texas, the early corner- notched horizon is the least well known. Itistypifiedbycorner-notcheddartpoints with recurved or notched bases. Typolog- ically, these would fit within the Martin- dale-Uvalde-Baker-Bandy continuum (Fig.4.11a–c; see also R. McReynolds 1993) and some specimens of the Gower type (Ricklis and Cox 1991). While points of this horizon are seen in collec- tions from the region (e.g., Hester and Whatley 1992), their site distribution is poorly understood. In the excavations at Choke Canyon reservoir, site 41LK51 yielded a Bandy-style point along with thin triangular bifaces and from a con- text 20 cm below a radiocarbon assay of 5130 to 4450 b.c.At Chaparrosa Ranch, points of this horizon are on high terraces overlooking Turkey and Chaparrosa Creeks. As noted above, settlement pat- terns for the Early Archaic are unknown; perhaps these peoples operated as small bands, highly mobile and wide-ranging because of the arid climate inferred for part of this time frame (W. McKinney 1981; Story 1985). McGraw and Knep- per (1983) in their survey of the East Chacon area found Guadalupe tools to be “water-proximate,” while the general Fig.4.12.

Based on my excava- tions in Uvalde County (at the La Jita and Smith sites [Hester 1971; Hester etal. 1989a]), it looks as if the early trian- gular form may first appear in the early corner-notched horizon and perhaps con- tinues into the later horizon. The early basal-notched horizon ex- tends from the southern Texas coast, across the Rio Grande Plain, and into c northeastern Mexico east of the Sierra a Madre Oriental (James B. Boyd collec- tion; Chandler and Kumpe 1993; notes b on file at TARL). A. Fox and Hester (1976) reported Andice points from 41VT17 in Victoria County, and in sev- eral papers inLa TierraBell. Andice points are noted as derived from surface contexts in south Texas (e.g., Chandler and Kumpe 1993; Hester and Whatley 1992). Ricklis and Cox (1991) report Bell points from the McKinzie site (41NU221) at the mouth of the Nueces River; these specimens, and three un- e stemmed points, are linked to radio- carbon assays of ca. 3600–3000 b.c. (see Ricklis, chapter 5, this volume). In general, the early basal-notched horizon likely dates in this rough time frame. Other recognizable traits of this horizon are large unifacial Clear Fork tools (Hes- ter and Kohnitz 1975), as well as smaller forms (G. Hall etal. 1982, fig. 79) and d f multinotched “eccentric” Bell/Andice specimens, found as far south as Falcon Reservoir (see Fig.4.12h; Hester 1990c).

Assemblages that include Middle Archaic materials (and those of both earlier and later peri- ods) from the middle Nueces drainage are published (Nightengale etal. 1989; P.

Many of the tubular sandstone pipes (Fig.4.16) found across south Texas may also date to this era (Chandler and Kumpe 1993; Hester 1969a). A buried and as yet unex- plored Middle Archaic component ap- pears to be present at 41ZV37 (Inman etal. 1995), with one radiocarbon date of 1880–1831 b.c.(Tx-8112-calibrated); a unifacial distally beveled tool (Clear Fork uniface) was associated with this component. Settlement patterns in the Choke Can- yon and Chaparrosa study areas, along with those at East Chacon (McGraw and Knepper 1983), suggest that Middle Ar- chaic open camp sites are to be found along present or former stream channels. In later Middle Archaic times, sites are present on floodplains, low terraces, and natural levees of present stream courses. Middle and Late Archaic sites in Starr County have been characterized by Nun- ley and Hester (1975, 13) as “gallery” (on terraces or arroyo banks) and “bower” (in hilly areas overlooking the arroyos and their tributaries).

Late Archaic The Late Archaic is better known, dat- ingfrom400b.c.toarounda.d.600/700. Several excavated components have been published or at least described in prelimi- nary fashion. For example, at 41ZV10 in western south Texas, Hester (1978b) found Shumla, Ensor (Fig.4.18a), Mar- cos, and Montell points stratigraphically below Late Prehistoric occupations. In- terestingly, the Marcos and Shumla points were in deposits below those con- taining Ensor and Montell. The Shumla type, best known from the Lower Pecos, is also a widespread marker of the Late Archaic in southern Texas. A very high percentage of the south Texas specimens are made of heat-treated chert (Hester and Collins 1974). Olmos bifaces, small triangular gouge-like tools with special- ized resharpening techniques, appar- ently date mainly to the Late Archaic although they may have continued to be used in Late Prehistoric times (see Fig.4.18d–h; see also Shafer and Hester 1971). At Choke Canyon, forty-four sites yielded diagnostics of the Late Archaic, including Ensor, Frio, Ellis, Fairland, and Marcos points. Sites have extensive de- posits of fire-cracked rock, both hearths and earth ovens (these continue from the latter part of the Middle Archaic), and grinding implements (manos, metates) are commonly found. These implements may reflect further intensification of the Fig.4.15. Sequence of distally beveled tools from Choke Canyon Reservoir (from G.

Late Archaic camp sites are almost al- ways located adjacent to present stream channels or adjacent sloughs (e.g., High- ley 1986; Kelly with Hester 1979; Mc- Graw and Knepper 1983; Warren 1986). There is clear evidence that in Late and Middle Archaic times lithic procurement sites were very common on high terraces and ridges containing Rio Grande gravels (Kelly with Hester 1979; Warren 1986) c a or Uvalde gravels (M. Davis 1992; Hester b 1975a). There is no doubt that these same chert resources were also used in Paleoindian and Early Archaic times (e.g., Berger and Associates 1989). In areas where these outcrops did not occur (e.g., McGraw 1979, 24), stream pebbles, grav- els, silicified wood, and quartzite were exploited. e Elsewhere in southern Texas, especially f d inWebbandLaSalleCounties,Desmuke, g Matamoros, and Catan points appear to be markers of the Late Archaic (see Fig.4.18b, c), along with Olmos tools. I suspect that we will eventually find (as the data suggest from 41ZV10) that the Late Archaic can be broken into two parts, or that it would be wise to use the concept of a “terminal Archaic” for sites with Ensor, Frio, Catan, and Matamoros h points in particular. This concept makes sense because these point types often show up in the early Late Prehistoric sites in the region (see Creel etal. 1979). Cemeteries may have continued to be used in this period, as they were on the Texas Coastal Bend (e.g., the Oso ceme- tery, 41NU2) and in Bexar County (41BX1; Lukowski 1988). However, iso- lated burials with grave goods provide other insights into burial patterns. On the lower Nueces, in the area of present Lake j Corpus Christi, a single burial associated i with Ensor points was found (Hester 1989c). In Karnes County, the Rudy Fig.4.18.

There may have been increased trade with central Texas in the Late Archaic. Large, small-stemmed bifaces (Fig.4.20a, b; see Hester and Green 1972) are found occasionally, such as a specimen from Frio County, and one with a cache of fifty bifaces (Fig.4.20c–g), many made of Ed- wards chert (M.

Large tri- angular bifaces (see Fig.4.19b) of Ed- wards chert are found in several areas of south Texas (e.g., the Riley cache [Fig.4.21]) (K. Miller 1993; see also Hester and Barber 1990). Late Prehistoric The Late Prehistoric in southern Texas has been extensively studied and reported (see summaries in Black 1986, 1989a; Highley 1986). It shares cultural patterns with central Texas to a certain extent, es- pecially in the occurrence of the Toyah horizon in the region (Black 1986). The earlier parts of the Late Prehistoric are less clear.

Further uncertainties about Late Pre- historic internal chronology are seen along the Rio Grande below Laredo. e Here, Starr points are common but un- dated.

Saunders and Hester 1993; see also Fox with Hes- ter 1979, fig. 17), is also mostly undated, but recent burials with associated Cara- cara points found at Falcon Reservoir have yielded calibrated radiocarbon ages that range from about a.d.1000 to 1400 (Boyd etal. 1997b).

04-A2946 4/14/04 12:22 PM Page 147 PREHISTORY OF SOUTH TEXAS / 147 favors the latter idea (see also Hester 1975b) and thus proposes the use of the term “horizon” when referring to Toyah manifestations. Supportive of Black’s argument is the presence of selected Toyah traits in con- temporary Late Prehistoric sites in parts of south Texas. For example, in the Chaparrosa Ranch area, along Tortugas Creek in Zavala County, and south into Webb, Zapata, and other counties, sites often yield Perdiz points, bone-tempered pottery, beveled knives, or some combi- nation of Toyah traits (e.g., 41ZV155 [Inman etal. 1998]). However, the whole Fig.4.25. Beveled knife forms in southern Texas (from K. Brown etal. 1982, fig. 22). Drawn by assemblage is not present at south Texas Kenneth M. Brown. Courtesy of Center for Archaeological Research, the University of Texas at San Antonio. sites, and often, bison is absent (or poorly represented) in the faunal list (e.g., 41ZV10 [Hester 1978a]). There are also sites like 41MC222 (Skillet Mountain No. 4 [G. Hall etal. 1986]), in the Choke Canyon area, that have produced bison (indeed, it appears to be a bison-butchering station) and bone-tempered pottery but have stemmed arrow points that are not Perdiz and an absence of beveled knives, end scrapers, and the like. Scallorn and Edwards points are present, however. I suspect that native peoples of Late Prehistoric times had adopted all or some of the traits of the central Texas Toyah, or even that central Texas hunting parties ventured onto the coastal plain (see Hes- ter and Parker 1970). The uneven diffu- sion of Toyah traits across the region indicates that they should be considered horizon markers and not part of a phase (L. Johnson 1987). The latter part of the Late Prehistoric, which includes Toyah, also has evidence of south Texas connections to a north- south Plains trade network. Recognizable Fig.4.26.

There is also the broad flat coastal plain east of the Sierra de Tamaulipas that could have been traversed by Huastecan merchants, or perhaps travel was by boat along the coast. MacNeish (1947) found what he termed Huastecan camp sites north of the Río Soto la Marina and near the Laguna Madre, only 250 kilometers south of the Rio Grande. What drew the Huastecans north to the delta? I believe it was the shell ornament production of the Brownsville Complex. We cannot yet re- solve the “chicken-or-the egg” dilemma of which came first—the shell beads or the Huastecs. Doubtless the hunters and gatherers making the prodigious num- bers of shell ornaments were after more than a few pots, obsidian flakes, and poor quality jadeite. There were surely other commodities that have not been pre- served. And, were the Huastecs only in- terested in the shell beads for themselves? Brownsville-styleOlivatinklers occur among the Huastecs (Ekholm 1944) and are depicted on Huastecan stone sculp- ture, and MacNeish (1947) states that Brownsville Complex shell ornaments are common in Huastecan sites. But are these ornaments from the delta or made by the Fig.4.29.

When subsurface Paleo- indian components are found intact in the region, they will represent terrestrial/ riverine rather than coastal adaptations. The Holocene Evolution of the Central Coast Environment The central coast is part of the broad Gulf Coastal Plain (Fenneman 1938), a nearly flat physiographic unit that rises very gradually from the coast to the in- terior. The surface geology consists of sandy clays and clayey sands deposited by major fluvial-deltaic systems during the Pleistocene interglacials. The most recent geological unit is the Beaumont Forma- tion, a thick accumulation of Pleistocene claysandsandsthatisthegeologicalfoun- dation of the present coastline. The Ingle- side unit of the Beaumont is a long, nar- row deposit of sandy clays, representing a Pleistocene barrier or strandplain; this de- posit overlies the main part of the Beau- montFormationalongthemodernstrand- line (L. Brown etal. 1976; Solis 1981). During the last glacial maximum, ca. 20,000 b.p., sea level was as much as one hundred meters lower than at present, since much of the global water supply was locked in massive continental ice sheets and extensive montane glaciers.

Because of the uncertain contexts of these dates, they are not listed in Table 5.1 or incorporated into the fol- lowing discussion. Unless otherwise indi- cated, all radiocarbon age ranges on shell presented below are corrected for the 13C fraction and dendrochronologically cali- brated at 1-sigma of error. Since charcoal dates are not significantly altered by 13C correction, they have been calibrated di- rectly from the uncorrected assay results. The Early Archaic The earliest demonstrable human oc- cupation and exploitation of the central coast shoreline, as noted above, can now be placed considerably earlier than once assumed. Numerous sites are currently assignable to the Early Archaic period, prior to the establishment of modern sea level stillstand and the emergence of the modern estuarine environment. Two ma- jor periods of Early Archaic occupation are indicated: ca. 7500–6800 b.p.and Fig.5.2. Map of the central coast area, showing locations of selected sites discussed in text. ca. 5800–4200 b.p.

Several artifacts, in addition to chert debitage, were recovered from a discrete shell stratum at 41SP156 on the north shore of Nueces Bay (Ricklis 1993a), with age ranges spanning the time interval be- tween5592and4614b.p.AGowerpoint from this stratum, mentioned above, may predate the dated shell deposit, although its position securely embedded within dense shell suggests it was (re)used by the people responsible for deposition of the shells. The distinctive barb section of an Andice point (see Fig.5.5f) probably pertains to this stratum; while it was found on the surface of a machine cut that transected the site, it appeared to have eroded from the dated shell stratum.

These sites (see Fig.5.2) were ac- tually parts of a single continuous cultural deposit that extended for several hundred meters along the top of the bluff over- looking the shoreline, prior to segmenta- tion by modern residential construction. At both 41SP43 and 41SP120, dense Late Archaic shell middens rest within a fine sand cumulic soil (Fig.5.9). The most abundant shell species are oyster, scallop, lightning whelk, quahog, sunray venus, and cross-barred venus (Chione cancellata). Overlying the Late Archaic shell deposits at both sites is an extensive deposit of Late Prehistoric cultural mate- rials. Fish bones and otoliths have been found in profusion in both Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components; the most common species are black drum, redfish, spotted seatrout, and Atlantic croaker. Also present are bones of white- tailed deer and, less commonly, other mammals and birds (see Ricklis 1990, 1996; Story 1968). A relatively long list of radiocarbon dates (eight from 41SP43 and fourteen from 41SP120) clearly indi- cates that the major occupation of the sites began shortly after 2000 b.p. The earliest evidence of Late Archaic occupation at Ingleside Cove is repre- sented by a thin but stratigraphically dis- crete lens of oyster and quahog shell at 41SP120 (Ricklis and Cox 1991). This lens was found near the base of the cu- mulic sandy soil at a depth of 1 m, and on quahog shells it produced a corrected Fig.5.11.

The increased economic importance of fishingatthistimecanprobablybelinked to the emergence of the modern estuarine environment. After the attainment of modern stable sea level ca. 3000 b.p., continuous barrier islands formed, seem- ingly reaching essentially their modern configuration ca. 2500–2000 b.p.Con- comitantly, broad back-barrier vegetated shallows emerged, providing extensive spawning and nursery grounds for the economically important fish species that have historically abounded in central coast bays and lagoons (e.g., Lorrio and Perret 1980; Matlock 1990; Perret etal. 1980; Reagan 1985; Sutter etal. 1986). The emergence of such broad, vegetated shallows led to the estuarine fish carrying capacity increasing considerably, and hu- man populations shifted to greater eco- nomic focus on fish procurement. There is some evidence to suggest that Fig.5.12. Bar graph showing numbers of otoliths per 10-cm excavation level, Mustang Lake major shoreline fishing camps such as site (41CL3).

This pat- tern, better documented for the Late Prehistoric period, is discussed below. The Late Archaic artifact assemblage consists of a rather wide array of items of stone, bone, and shell. Several types of flaked stone dart points pertain to the pe- riod (Fig.5.13). At the Kent-Crane site, most dart points can be assigned to either the Kent or Ensor types, and an examina- tion of the information presented by Campbell (1952) indicates that Kent points are more commonly found in the lower part of the midden, while Ensor points are better represented in the upper part. Since the base of the midden dates to ca. 2700 b.p., the Kent points fall at or somewhat later than that date. Kent points (and one specimen each of the Godley and Marcos types), were found eroding from the oyster midden at 41SP177, which produced a calibrated age range of 3156–2873 b.p.The Ensor points at Kent-Crane are presumably Fig.5.13.

Small cy- lindrical bird bone beads are also part of the assemblage. There is clear evidence for the use of basketry in the Late Archaic in the central coast. Basketry-impressed burned clay noduleshavebeenrecoveredattheTucker site (41NU46) near Corpus Christi, from a stratum with hearth charcoal dated to ca. 3000 b.p.(H. Smith n.d.; three char- coal dates from this stratum are listed in Table 5.1, nos. 40–42). Fragments of as- phaltum with basket impressions are re- ported from the Johnson and Kent-Crane sites on Copano Bay (Campbell 1947, 1952; Cox and Smith 1989), from the Late Archaic midden at 41SP120 (Ricklis 1990), and from the preceramic levels of the midden at Mustang Lake (Ricklis 1994b). In all cases, baskets appear to have been woven using a basic twining technique.

The Late Prehistoric, ca. 950–250 B.P. (A.D.1000–1700) Several changes mark the beginning of the Late Prehistoric period. As elsewhere in Texas (Hester 1975b, 1980b; Prewitt 1981, 1985; D. Suhm etal. 1954), rela- tively thick and heavy stone dart points give way to light, thin arrow points, sig- naling the replacement of the dart and atlatl by the bow and arrow. Ceramics, although possibly in very limited use in the terminal Archaic (see Ricklis and Cox 1991), become common during this pe- riod. On the basis of changes in major artifact form/types, as well as probable shiftsinsubsistencepatterns,theLatePre- historic can be divided into two subperi- ods (discussed below chronologically in terms of calendar years, due to temporal proximity to the Early Historic period). The Initial Late Prehistoric, A.D.1000–1250/1300 The beginning date for this period is based on findings at 41SP120, where the terminal Archaic is well dated to ca. a.d. 1000 and an initial Late Prehistoric com- ponent has produced, from a discrete stratigraphic unit, two dates on shells Fig.5.17.

Fritz (1975) found that Rockport ware sherds, with characteristic asphaltum surface treatment, were com- mon around Matagorda Bay but gave way toplainsandy-pasteand/orgrog-tempered ware, similar to the pottery of the upper Texas coast, in the Colorado River delta area. The southern limit of Rockport ware is essentially the northern shore of Baffin Bay; several sites there have pro- duced fairly abundant Rockport sherds, whereas only a few sherds have been re- ported from sites on the southern shore of the bay (see Hester 1969a; H. Smith 1984). The inland extent of Rockport pottery is only about forty kilometers from the mainland shoreline. Sites farther inland are invariably characterized by a predominance of bone-tempered plain- ware diagnostic of the inland Toyah phase or horizon (e.g., the Berclair site in Go- liad County [Hester and Parker 1970], Fig.5.19.

Around a.d.1250/1300, bison hunt- ing appears to have become a significant subsistence activity among central coast groups, as it did in inland Texas. Numer- ous small Rockport phase hunting camps have been documented within about forty kilometers of the mainland shoreline, pri- marily along the uplands overlooking stream valleys (e.g., Carlson etal. 1983; Ricklis 1988, 1990, 1996). Fish and shellfish remains are generally scarce or absent at these sites where the predomi- nant faunal remains are bones of deer and bison. Where faunal samples are adequate for determination of the relative impor- tance of various taxa, bison is found to have provided the greatest bulk of usable meat weight, with white-tailed deer as an important secondary meat source (Ricklis 1990, 1996). The repeated presence of Perdiz arrow points with bison bone at Rockport phase riverine camps (Ricklis 1990, 281–85) suggests that these sites date to or after ca. a.d.1250/1300, the generally accepted time of the appearance of the type across much of Texas (L. Johnson 1994; Mal- louf 1987; Prewitt 1981, 1985; Ricklis and Collins 1994; E. Turner and Hester Fig.5.22. Pottery types of the coastal Rockport phase (modification of typology in D. Suhm and 1993). This inference is supported by Jelks 1962; see Ricklis 1990, 1995a). Rockport Black-on-Gray I and II bear asphaltum-painted three radiocarbon dates from the Mellon decoration.

This pattern had significant ecological correlates (Ricklis 1988, 1990, 1992b, 1996). The largest economically impor- tant fish species, redfish and black drum, tend to aggregate in large numbers during their respective fall and winter/early spring spawning seasons, thus providing the kind of predictable and concentrated food resources required to support rela- tively large human groups.

The absence of dated, clearly discrete occupational components ca. 6800– 5800 b.p.and 4200–3100 b.p.suggest two time intervals, each lasting about a millennium, during which there was little shoreline occupation, or at least a signifi- cant reduction of occupation to the ex- tent that it is not clearly represented in the current radiocarbon chronology. As- suming that prehistoric peoples would ex- ploit a rich estuarine environment when and where it was available, we may infer that the two intervals of reduced shore- line occupation reflect a corresponding reduction in the exploitable biomass of central coast estuaries. Estuaries are one of the most produc- tive types of environments, rivaled in pri- mary biotic productivity only by tropical rainforests (Odum 1971; Whittaker 1975). They are, however, ecosystemi- cally fragile, insofar as high primary pro- ductivity and a rich food chain depend on certain crucial conditions. High pho- tosynthesis occurs in extensive, shallow, sunlit waters with relatively low turbidity. Extensive shallows are also crucial in that they supply large amounts of organic nu- trients through decay of aquatic vegeta- tionandmarshplants(Odumetal.1974). When the geometry of shallow-water es- tuaries is significantly altered such that the nutrient-rich shallows are destroyed or greatly reduced in area, there are corre- sponding negative effects on the biotic productivity of the entire ecosystem. On the Texas coast, for instance, artificial de- struction of shoreline shallows has been showntoreducepopulationsofshrimp— a major primary consumer and an impor- tant link in the estuarine food chain— by 80 percent and more (Mock 1966). Similarly, it has been documented that destruction of shoreline salt marshes Fig.5.24.

The Ceramic Period By definition, the Archaic period in southeast Texas ends with the introduc- tion of ceramics. It is generally accepted that pottery first appeared along the coast around two thousand years ago through diffusion of ceramic technology from Louisiana and/or the Lower Mis- sissippi Valley (Aten 1983, 1984; Shafer 1975a; Story 1990). The earliest upper Texas coast pottery thus has a Tchefuncte cast (see Aten 1983; Phillips 1970; Wein- stein 1986), with thick vessel walls, poorly wedged, contorted, and untem- pered paste, and at least in some cases, flat bases. In inland southeast Texas, pot- tery was introduced several centuries later, probably disseminating from the coastal zone where sandy-paste wares of the Goose Creek series (Aten 1983; D. Suhm and Jelks 1962) had come into prominence. While the earliest pottery serves as a time marker and indicates extraregional interaction and influence, and may also have increased efficiency in food process- ing (Aten 1983), there are currently no indications of major changes in lifeways Fig.6.6.

The small flaked lithic drill/perforator, suggested by Aten to be a marker of the Turtle Bay and later peri- ods, has recently been found in some abundance in Middle and Late Archaic zones at Eagle’s Ridge (Ensor and White 1998; see Fig.6.4 herein). Because in most cases the site-specific radiocarbon data do not fit well with the placement of sites within the sequence of named periods, and because time ranges for key nonceramic traits are far longer than the periods for which they were de- fined by Aten, there are clear problems in dividing the post-Archaic archeological sequence into discrete, relatively short pe- riods. For this reason, the Ceramic period is discussed here in terms of broad time intervals that have relevance to identifi- able patterns of change on the upper Texas coast and beyond (Fig.6.11). At the same time, it is apparent that Aten’s temporal placement of sites according to seriated ceramics approximately parallels the relevant series of radiocarbon-dated site components (see Fig.6.9), suggesting that his ceramic seriation remains a useful relative chronological tool. Diachronic Trends during the Ceramic Period on the Coast The Early Ceramic Period As mentioned above, there is consider- able evidence for continuity in site loca- tions and basic settlement/subsistence patterns between the end of the Archaic and the Early Ceramic periods; sites con- tinue to consist mostly of rangia middens along secondary bay margins or riverine estuaries. The beginning of the period is thus currently recognizable only on the basis of changes in certain artifact classes. Limited data on lithics suggest that the Fig.6.9.

By this time, the pottery in the Gal- veston Bay area exhibits little similarity tocontemporaneous(Marksville)material in Louisiana.

The burial was that of an The Late Prehistoric Period By around a.d.700, the introduction of the bow and arrow on the upper Texas coast is evidenced by the appearance of small, light straight- and expanded-stem stone arrow point types (Alba, Catahoula, and Scallorn types; see E. Turner and Hester 1993). Following the generally es- tablished framework for Texas archeology, the appearance of arrow points can be taken to mark the beginning of the Late Prehistoric period (see, e.g., Hester 1980b; Prewitt 1981, 1985). Patterson’s (1991a, 1995) suggestion that unifacial arrowpointswerepresentbyca.4000b.p. has not received general acceptance. Simi- larly, his argument (Patterson 1991a) that the generally late Perdiz type was present by ca. a.d.600 in southeast Texas is ques- tionable, given the widespread appear- ance of the type across Texas only after ca. a.d.1250 (e.g., L. Johnson 1994; Mallouf 1987; Prewitt 1985; E. Turner and Hester 1993). Patterson’s (1991a) early placement of this type appears to be based on its co-occurrence with earlier projectile point types in vertically mixed site deposits (see discussion in Ricklis 1993b). Recent findings at the Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) on Galveston Island sug- gest that the Late Prehistoric can be di- vided, as elsewhere in Texas, into two subperiods. At Mitchell Ridge, an Initial LatePrehistoricsubperiod(Ricklis1994a) is associated with the introduction of the bow and arrow, as represented by Scallorn arrow points.

The Final Late Prehistoric subperiod at Mitchell Ridge is abundantly repre- sented by a lithic assemblage of Perdiz arrow points, prismatic blades, thin bi- facial knives, and expanded-base drills made on blades and blade-like flakes (see Fig.6.12). This assemblage is well dated at the site to between a.d.1280 and 1450, in accord with the time range of ca. a.d.1250/1300–1700 for similar Fig.6.13. Late Prehistoric vessel forms, based on examination of vessel sections and large pot- lithic assemblages in inland Texas (see, sherds from the Mitchell Ridge site, 41GV66, Galveston Island (after Ricklis 1994a). e.g., Black 1989b; L. Johnson 1994; Pre- witt 1985; Ricklis 1994b). End scrapers and knives were scarce at Mitchell Ridge, but that situation is not surprising con- sidering that, although bison bone frag- ments were present, most of the meat weight represented in faunal samples came from fish and deer. Presumably, bison were hunted on the mainland, so that only selected meaty elements were brought to Mitchell Ridge. Beveled knives and end scrapers are in fact found at mainland sites (see, e.g., Wheat 1953), wherebisonkillsites(e.g.,theWhiteOak BayousiteinHarrisCounty[McReynolds etal. 1988]) have been found. The Late Prehistoric influx of bison onto the Texas coastal prairies by ca. a.d.1300 (Huebner 1991; Ricklis 1992a) must have found a response among coastal populations who, as did inland groups, adopted a function- ally associated lithic tool kit. During the Late Prehistoric, ceramics underwent some discernible technological and stylistic modifications. Grog temper- ing was introduced, presumably from the east, a change which Aten (1983) places at ca. a.d.1000. (Given the actual ten- dency for radiocarbon dates in his se- quence to be older than site age estimates based on ceramic seriation, this introduc- tion may have occurred somewhat ear- Fig.6.14.

If Aten’s seasonality results on rangia prove to be reliable, the spring-summer occupation of the “coast” may actually refer to the more inland areas around secondary bays and river deltas; at least during the Late Pre- historic, significant fall-winter occupation may have been focused on the landward side of the barrier islands. Certainly, the problem of seasonal locations of subsis- tence activities and seasonal aggregation and dispersal of populations merits fur- ther investigation. Population Growth and the Emergence of Incipient Sociocultural Complexity Aten (1983) has suggested that grow- ing populations along the coast by Early Ceramic times were a systemic catalyst for successive fissioning of social groups; as a group’s numbers approached four hun- dred or so, it split, thus conserving exist- ing social mechanisms with an essentially egalitarian social order.

In the cemetery desig- nated as Area 4, 91 percent of the grave pits contained burial goods, as compared with 20 to 25 percent in the other three cemeteries (Fig.6.18). Moreover, the combinedgravesinArea4yieldedtwenty- fourdistinctclassesofgravegoodswhereas the other three cemeteries produced only between one and three classes of goods. These findings strongly suggest a spatial segregation of relatively high-status buri- als, as would be expected in a social sys- tem involving some degree of internal ranking (see, e.g., J. Brown 1981; Fried 1967; Mainfort 1985; O’Shea 1984). That a single cultural pattern is repre- sented by all four cemeteries (as opposed to different cultural groups with differing mortuary behavior) is indicated by funda- mental similarities among all four ceme- teries in other aspects of mortuary behav- ior, especially the virtually consistent orientation of heads to the southeast (Ricklis 1994a, 467–68). Also, the dif- ferential amounts of grave goods cannot be ascribed to diachronic change in mor- tuary behavior since (a) all four cemeter- ies contained Late Prehistoric burials, (b) two cemeteries (Areas 1 and 4) con- tainedburialsthatwereradiocarbondated to the Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Early Historic periods, and (c) burials in Area 4 contained abundant and varied goods regardless of the time period.

There is no evidence for signifi- cant change in mortuary patterns during the Protohistoric, since single primary in- terments and some secondary burials are stilltherule,andthedeceasedwereburied in the same discrete cemeteries used dur- ing Late Prehistoric times. There is some suggestion of an in- creased variety of arrow point types being used in Protohistoric times. The over- whelmingly predominant arrow point in the Final Late Prehistoric was the Perdiz type, whereas the excavations in Protohis- toric Feature 9 yielded a mix of Perdiz, Bulbar Stemmed, and unstemmed round- based and lozenge-shaped arrow points (Fig.6.19). Significantly, a Protohistoric burial of a child (Feature 82), with a 1-sigma range of a.d.1480–1650, contained a complete necklace of native-made tubular conch shell beads and large blue-green glass beads of the Itchuknee Plain type.

We opted for a compromise approach. Ac- cordingly, while the overview is largely structured within a conventional culture- historical framework involving sequential periods and phases, we emphasize specific trends within these periods. Trends exam- ined within each time interval include settlement mobility and landscape use, changes in subsistence economies as re- flected in dependence upon domesticated versus nondomesticated plants and ani- mals, and how changes in technology, settlement structure, and social organiza- tion reflect the evolution of these settle- ment and subsistence systems.

Survey level data are often problem- atic, and thus an even greater issue is the paucity of excavation data from the east- ern Trans-Pecos. The few excavations that have been conducted in the Guadalupe Mountains have largely focused on caves androckshelters(Ayers1936;Mera1938; Roney 1985, 1995; Schroeder 1983) that represent only a handful of the total sites in the range. Only Susan M. Applegarth (1976) and Susana R. Katz (1978) have investigated open sites. A small number of sites have been investigated in the La Junta region (Cloud etal. 1994a; J. C. Kelley 1949; Mallouf 1990, 1995a; Shackelford 1951, 1955), but few other excavations have taken place. Fortunately, this situation is being altered with a re- newed emphasis on archeological investi- gations at the Center for Big Bend Stud- ies in Alpine.

O. Brown etal. 1994, 1995; D. Mar- tin 1999; M. Miller and O’Leary 1992a; Vierra etal. 1997, 1999). Culberson and Hudspeth Counties follow, with intensive dating studies con- ducted at Wind Mountain (Hines etal. 1994), Granado Cave (Hamilton 1998), and several sites investigated along the All American Pipeline (M. Miller 1994; New Mexico State University and Continuum Corp.1989) and Samalayuca Pipeline (Mauldin and Leach 1997; Staley and Turnbow 1995). Radiocarbon dates have recently been obtained from important settlements in the La Junta and Big Bend regions(Cloudetal.1994;Mallouf1990) and from Balmorhea State Park in Jeff Davis County (Charles 1994). Elsewhere throughout the Trans-Pecos, however, few or no radiocarbon dates are available, particularly in those counties centered on the Stockton and Delaware Basins, and therefore prehistoric patterns and devel- opments based on absolute dates in these areas are very poorly known. With these factors in mind, the out- line of the human occupation of this vast region that we offer is tentative, and, at times, we draw heavily on data from sur- Fig.7.4.

Zones C1 through O, with a seemingly well-stratified sequence of radiocarbon dates ranging between twelve thousand and more than fifty thousand years in age, contained large quantities of Pleisto- cene faunal material, well-preserved plant remains, and other ecofacts purportedly in association with hearths, stone arti- facts, modified animal bones, and human skin impressions and hair. Middle and Late Holocene occupa- tions of the shelter by human groups are not contested. Zones A through C con- tained preserved corncobs, cordage, and a sample of recognizable chipped stone and ceramic artifacts. The ages of these items, plus two radiocarbon age estimates ob- tained directly from sandal fragments re- covered from these strata, occupy a range within the Early and Late Archaic peri- ods. Arguments for a human presence in the cave during the Late Pleistocene, prior to 10,000 b.c.and up to thirty-five thousand years in age, are based on less conclusive findings. Claims of pre-Clovis occupations rest primarily on a small quantity of crudely manufactured stone artifacts, a very small number of bones with fractures or marks suggestive of hu- man modification, hearth features con- structed of stones differing petrologically and chemically from the limestone rock formations comprising the natural setting Fig.7.4.

These environmental changes were also marked by the extinction of the large game animals such as mammoth, mastodon, and bison thought to have been a primary food resource for Paleo- indian groups (Mallouf 1981). Early Paleoindian: Clovis Complex Knowledge of Clovis occupation of the Trans-Pecos and Jornada Mogollon re- gions has been obtained almost entirely through rare and isolated finds of the dis- tinctive, fluted lanceolate Clovis projectile points (Campbell 1970; Harkey 1981; Krone 1976; MacNeish 1993b; O’Laugh- lin etal. 1988). Similar artifacts have been observed in private collections, but overall, few Clovis points and even fewer Clovis sites have been documented (par- ticularly when comparing the Trans-Pecos and Jornada Mogollon regions to the Southern Plains and south Texas; see Meltzer and Bever 1995), despite several extensive and intensive archeological sur- veys in southern New Mexico (Beckes etal. 1977; Carmichael 1983, 1986; Camilli etal. 1988; Doleman etal. 1991; Duran 1982; Lukowski and Stuart 1996; Mauldin etal. 1997; Oakes 1981; Raves- Fig.7.5.

Early Paleoindian: Folsom Complex Folsom manifestations in the Trans- Pecos are much better known than are their Clovis predecessors. Several excava- tions at Folsom components have been undertaken from the late 1980s to 1990s (Ackerly etal. 1987; Carmichael and Meyer n.d.; Mauldin and Leach 1997; Mauldin and O’Leary 1994). In addition, the nature of Folsom tool forms, subsis- tence adaptations, and mobility patterns has recently been the subject of inquiry (Amick 1994a, 1995, 1996). In contrast to the preceding Clovis pe- riod, numerous Folsom period points and occupation sites have been recorded dur- ing archeological surveys (e.g., Beckes 1977; Beckett 1983; Carmichael 1986; Hester 1977c; O’Hara 1988; M. Miller etal. 1988; Whalen 1978). Stuart (1997) has reported a cluster of Folsom compo- nents distributed around the margins of a drainage channel leading from a fault line escarpment north of El Paso. Surface col- lection activities recovered more than a dozen fragmentary and whole Folsom points, in addition to a substantial num- ber of steep edge angle tools (Fig.7.6). Isolated Folsom and Midland points have been described by Brook (1968a) and Quimby and Brook (1967), while Ander- son and Carter (1985; see also Kauffman 1984) report on a fragmentary Folsom point at the Vista Hills site in east El Paso. Several of the larger sites in the re- gion have been reported by avocational archeologists (e.g., J. Davis 1975), includ- ing the Cruz Tarin site (Everitt and Davis 1974), Moody Tank (Russell 1968), and Three Buttes (Krone 1975).

Folsom occupation in the eastern Trans-Pecos is known primarily through the excavation of an extensive occupation site on Chispa Creek south of Van Horn in Culberson County. Chispa Creek is a tributary to Wild Horse Draw, which, in turn, is part of the southern watershed of Salt Flat Basin and therefore is strategi- cally situated along a major north-south transit corridor. The excavations were conducted by the University of Colorado in 1967 under the direction of Joe Ben Wheat. Although the results of the exca- vations have not been formally reported, Lindsay (1969) summarized the findings. Three areas having high numbers of Fol- som points were chosen for excavation. The artifact assemblage includes more than one hundred Folsom points and many channel flakes, five hundred scrap- ers, numerous other tools such as gravers Fig.7.7.

Plant remains were abundant throughout the deposits, and several hundred corn- cobs, kernels, beans, and cucurbit samples were recovered. Excavations at open-air sites in the central basins, alluvial fans, and river margin terraces of the Hueco, Tularosa, Mesilla, and Salt Flat Basins have also contributed important information on Archaic period archeology in the Trans- Pecos. While the rich material culture preserved in rockshelters is typically ab- sent at open-air sites, these studies have provided much of the information for in- terpreting settlement patterns and land use. Investigations at Keystone Dam led to the identification of Archaic house structures, several among the earliest in the southern Southwest. Extensive studies of small sites throughout the Hueco and Tularosa Bolsons at Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range (Burgett n.d.; Dole- man etal. 1991; Mauldin etal. 1998; Fig.7.8. Location of major Archaic period components of the western Trans-Pecos mentioned O’Laughlin and Martin 1989; Seaman in text. etal. 1988; Whalen 1980a), in addition to several projects in the Mesilla Bolson west of El Paso (Camilli etal. 1988; O’Leary 1987; Ravesloot 1988), have identified an extensive Late Archaic use of the central basins, marked by small, shal- low pithouses or “huts” and thermal fea- tures. Excavations at several sites with large burned rock features situated on alluvial fans and terraces (Carmichael 1985; Fields and Girard 1983; Hard 1983a; O’Laughlin 1979) have also pro- vided important information and insights into Archaic adaptations. For the eastern Trans-Pecos, Mallouf’s (1985) summary offers a much more de- tailed overview than can be provided here, and several observations in Sebas- tian and Larralde’s (1989) overview of southeastern New Mexico are also rele- vant for our understanding of Native American life in the Archaic. A small number of studies have been completed since the publication of Mallouf’s exten- sive overview, including investigations at Phantom Lake Spring in Jeff Davis County (Charles 1994), Ward’s (1992) study of materials from sinkholes and rockshelters in the Delaware Basin, a de- Fig.7.9.

07-A2946 4/13/04 12:05 PM Page 223 JORNADA MOGOLLON AND EASTERN TRANS-PECOS REGIONS / 223 A total of fifty-one dates with cali- brated age ranges falling securely within this interval is known from the western Trans-Pecos, along with a dozen or so that partially overlap this temporal inter- val. The distribution of the dates differs from the Early Archaic, with buried burned rock features and rockshelter de- posits providing a smaller proportion of the available dates. A surprisingly small number (n"5) of dates overlapping the Middle Archaic time interval have been obtained from rockshelter deposits, al- though whether this is due to sampling bias or a reduced focus on occupation of rockshelters is unknown. A small number of deeply buried burned rock features of Middle Archaic age have been docu- mented, including examples buried at depths of 2 m in the Delaware Moun- tains south of Guadalupe Peak (M. Mil- ler 1994) and in the vicinity of Gardner Springs Arroyo (Almarez 1990; Gile and Hawley1968;M.MillerandStuart Fig.7.12.

In ad- dition, artifact assemblages tend to be slightly more substantial in number than Early Archaic components. Preservation factors may account for this variance. However, because the resolution of avail- able chronometric methods is not suffi- cient to confidently determine whether features are contemporaneous, the com- mon finding of clusters of thermal fea- tures may indicate greater levels of settle- ment intensity and perhaps the presence of larger social groups.

It is evident from published projectile point collections from the region that two hafting configurations represent the most common Middle Archaic forms: contract- ing stems with flat, rounded, or pointed bases and expanding stems with concave bases. Again, there appear to be regional differences in the distribution of these forms, with expanding stem/concave base forms having general affinities with the Oshara Tradition and Cochise sequences more prevalent in the western Trans- Pecos, while contracting stem forms are more prevalent among the central Texas and Coahuila traditions present in the eastern Trans-Pecos. Another trait of Middle Archaic projectile points in the western Trans-Pecos is the variety in blade modifications, including beveling, serration, and extensive retouching. While simple retouching and reworking is common among Early and Late Ar- chaic points from the western Trans- Pecos, beveled and serrated blades occur predominantly among Middle Archaic forms. Such patterns may indicate an in- creased emphasis on the conservation of raw materials, blade modification related to multiple uses of the tools, or an aspect of increased efficiency in felling prey. These possibilities suggest that the design anduseofprojectilepointsamongMiddle Archaic groups reflects different patterns of technological and settlement organiza- tion than was the case among earlier and later intervals of the Archaic period.

While not exceedingly greater in size or in artifact density than those of preceding periods, the Late Archaic sites’ sheer numbers indicate a much more in- tensive land use pattern. General Trends of the Archaic Period In this section we examine three broad trends of the Archaic period archeological record. First, the radiocarbon record can be employed as a proxy indicator of land use intensity, population growth, and the introduction of various technologies. Sec- ond, quantitative and qualitative data have been collected on a large sample of projectile points from Fort Bliss, permit- ting us to draw tentative inferences re- garding trends in projectile technologies, hunting strategies, and settlement mo- bility. Finally, issues of regional hunter- gatherer mobility or territorial ranges can be considered through visual or geochem- ical sourcing studies of lithic raw materi- als and a consideration of projectile point distributions. Settlement and Demographic Trends as Revealed by the Radiocarbon Record and Projectile Point Frequencies As mentioned above, it has been noted that through time there are increasing numbers of occupations from the Early and Middle to Late Archaic periods. Site counts and densities have been presented in support of these observations (Car- michael 1986; Mallouf 1985; Whalen Fig.7.16. Trends in summed radiocarbon probability distributions for Archaic period feature 1980a), and while interpretations derived contexts and cultigens in the western Trans-Pecos/Jornada Mogollon region (data from from such data (e.g., S.

While simple stable throughout the Paleoindian- cestral and present course of the Rio retouching and reworking of projectiles is commonlyseenamongEarlyandLateAr- chaic points from the western part of the Trans-Pecos,moreextensivemodifications in the form of beveled and serrated blades occur predominantly among Middle Ar- chaic forms; this provides additional evi- dence for a distinctive Middle Archaic technological pattern (see Fig.7.18). Two major forms of blade modifications were investigated: beveling and serration. More than 35 percent of the Middle Archaic points have these blade modifications, compared to less than 5 percent of the Late Archaic or Late Archaic/EarlyFor- mativeprojectilepoints. While the pres- ence of edge serration and beveling on points is not uncommon in thesouthern Southwest(e.g.,Wills1988), it appears that the Jornada region has an unusually high incidence compared to several other regions. The specific tool performance charac- teristics of beveled and serrated blades are uncertain. Experimental work conducted by Stanley A. Ahler (1971) indicates that serrated edges are more suitable for hide cutting and skinning and may increase the piercing power of the projectile. An- drew L. Christenson (1987) and others view serration as reflecting raw material conservation. Resharpening a projectile blade by adding serrations increases the overall cutting edge surface or length while conserving the material of the edge. Blade beveling—the resharpening of al- ternate edges along the blade—is also seen as a means of conserving raw mate- rial (Sollberger 1971). There is also some question as to whether blade beveling in- dicates the use of the projectiles as multi- functional bifacial tools (Ahler 1971). In either case, these patterns indicate that Middle Archaic projectile points are part of a distinctive technology in the Archaic Fig.7.18. Attributes of projectile point assemblages by major temporal period in the western Trans-Pecos: a, distribution of mean size and blade/shoulder measurements; b, distribution of tradition, one that may have had a spe- mean stem/haft measurements; c, distribution of blade modification characteristics; d, distri- cific emphasis on raw material conser- bution of raw material categories.

Recent studies of hunter-gatherers emphasize the relationship between technology, subsis- tence resources, and settlement mobility. As suggested by Bleed (1986) and Kuhn (1994), mobile groups should employ maintainable, portable, and durable tools, while Schott (1986) proposed that mo- bile groups would also require a greater degree of versatility among their tools. In this sense, Early Archaic forms may be considered “overdesigned” (see Bleed 1986; Nelson 1991) in that they are among the largest and thickest projectile points in the Trans-Pecos, were com- monly manufactured of durable materials more resistant to breakage (although of- ten less amenable to resharpening), and had simple, reliable haft elements (or strong stems) that lacked notches, barbs, Early Archaic Late Archaic Late Formative basal protrusions, and other easily break- able items. Reliability and durability ap- pear to be the preferred design character- istics among Early Archaic projectile points. Subsistence and settlement changes during the Early Archaic may be reflected by a change in prey selection and hunting practices, as suggested by the adoption of stemmed projectile point forms, in addition to a reduced emphasis on tool maintenance and a greater em- phasis on reliability. The most distinctive trait of Middle Archaic projectile points lies in the fre- quency of blade modifications, including beveling, serration, and extensive re- touching. It has not been determined whether such patterns indicate an in- creased emphasis on the conservation of raw materials, multiple uses of the tools, and/or an increased efficiency in felling Fig.7.18.

In stark contrast to this broad Archaic tradition, textiles from Formative or Late Prehistoric period con- texts have predominantly Mogollon (western New Mexico) characteristics. Together, data from obsidian distribu- tions and textiles indicate that a pro- nounced shift in regional dynamics oc- curred at the close of the Archaic period. Summary of the Archaic Period Important changes in subsistence, settlement mobility and land use, territo- rial ranges, and technological organiza- tion apparently took place during the Ar- chaic period. However, several of the observed trends, and particularly infer- ences derived from these observations, are tentative. Clearly, additional information in the form of corroborative data sets is required, particularly through analyses of faunal, macrofloral, and other subsistence data, settlement patterns, chipped stone assemblages, and raw material distribu- tions. It is hoped that our discussion will provoke a broader consideration of settle- ment and adaptation over the long Ar- chaic sequence. The rarity of radiocarbon-dated fea- tures during the Middle Archaic period may be due to large-scale changes in sub- sistence practices and landscape use that are distinct from the Early and Late Ar- chaic.Suchaperspectiveoffersanalterna- tive means of investigating this temporal interval that reaches beyond explanations based solely on site preservation and archeological visibility. The Late Archaic period is also marked by several distinct Fig.7.19.

A similar pattern took place in the La Junta district of the eastern Trans-Pecos. While the agricultur- ally based Puebloan occupations of the Jornada and La Junta regions have re- ceived the most attention, the results of sporadic work conducted throughout other areas of the Trans-Pecos suggest that Native Americans in those locations were also affected to some degree by these significant cultural changes. Chronological sequences for the Late Prehistoric period are generally undefined throughout much of the eastern Trans- Pecos. Developments in these areas have often simply been assigned to a generic Late Prehistoric temporal interval, al- though cultural-historical sequences from adjoining regions have occasionally been adopted. Three generally contemporane- ous phases have been defined for the Jor- nada and La Junta regions. In the La Junta district (J. C. Kelley etal. 1940), these include the poorly defined Chisos phase (a.d.1–900/1000), the Livermore phase (a.d.900/1000–1200), and the La Junta phase (a.d.1200–1400). The Formative period in the western Trans-Pecos also has been traditionally di- vided into three phases (Lehmer 1948): Mesilla (a.d.900–1100), Doña Ana (a.d. 1100–1200), and El Paso (a.d.1200– 1400). Lehmer’s original beginning date of a.d.900 for the Mesilla phase has been extended to a.d.200/400, depending on the source and consideration of when El Paso brownware ceramics first appear (see Miller’s discussion in Perttula etal. 1995a). Whalen (1978, 1985b) subse- quently integrated these phases into larger taxonomic units, placing the Mesilla phase within the Early Formative, or Pit- house period, and the Doña Ana and El Paso phases within the Late Formative, or Pueblo period.

07-A2946 4/13/04 12:06 PM Page 239 JORNADA MOGOLLON AND EASTERN TRANS-PECOS REGIONS / 239 Pithouse structures include circular and subrectangular or square shapes. Later pithouses tend toward subrectangu- lar and square shapes, but there is consid- erable variation across the region, and two or more shapes may occur within in- dividual sites. Circular pithouses of the Late Formative period tend to be more substantial than their predecessors of the Mesilla phase, often having greater depths and floor space, although a clear lack of formality in construction continues. These differences may also reflect shifting settlement locations, as pithouses situated in riverine zones and alluvial fans tend to be more substantial than those docu- mented in the central basin landforms. Prepared or plastered floors and walls are rare in pithouses, but subfloor features in- clude small, unlined hearths, few and ir- regularly positioned postholes, and occa- sional storage pits. Many structures, however, lack subfloor features. More formally constructed structures, namely formal, noncontiguous rooms, or simply isolated rooms, appear during later time intervals; the term “pit room” has also been used, along with the somewhat inappropriate term “pithouse.” These structures have a substantially greater for- mality and uniformity in construction than pithouses. Typically, they are square in shape, shallow in depth, and have pre- pared caliche or adobe-plastered floors; Fig.7.21. Examples of Formative period house forms from the western Trans-Pecos.

Entry steps are often present in pueblo rooms, as are occasional small, raised platforms (sometimes re- ferred to as “altars”). Primary posthole patterns in pueblo rooms follow a three- or four-post pattern. Dating the Trans-Pecos Architectural Sequences Chronological placement of these ar- chitectural forms and accompanying settlements has long been a matter of uncertainty and debate. Until recently the chronological placement of pithouse and pueblo settlements was based on ce- ramic cross-dating and a small sample of chronometric dates (see Brook 1970; Whalen1983,1985a).Indeed,asof1992 only twenty-eight radiocarbon and four- teen archeomagnetic age estimates had been obtained for El Paso phase residen- tial sites, and the majority of radiocarbon dates were from isolated pit room sites (Batcho 1987; Browning 1991; Browning etal. 1992; Duran and Batcho 1983; O’Laughlin and Martin 1990). Radio- carbon dates were often from vague or ambiguous contexts and were seldom cor- rected for isotopic fractionation.

07-A2946 4/13/04 12:06 PM Page 241 JORNADA MOGOLLON AND EASTERN TRANS-PECOS REGIONS / 241 though at the regional scale the frequency of these structural forms covary through time until a.d.1000, when circular struc- tures were apparently no longer built. Both subrectangular pithouses and iso- lated rooms were inhabited between a.d. 1000 and 1250/1300. Again, the relative frequencies of these two forms covary until sometime between a.d.1250 and 1300, when, for the most part, pithouses were no longer constructed. Pueblos were occupied during the a.d.1250/1300– 1450 interval, but habitation of isolated rooms persists through this period (see Fig.7.23). The dated architectural sequence also provides important insights into changing patterns of mobility. Cross-cultural stud- ies of architectural form have noted a re- current pattern linking round, insubstan- tial structures with mobile settlement systems, while angular structures tend to be affiliated with more sedentary groups (Binford 1990; Hunter-Anderson 1977). Lewis R. Binford (1990) also noted that groups with variable or seasonal mobility Fig.7.23. Planview of the La Junta phase pueblo at the Millington site, Presidio County, Texas (after J. C.

The most com- mon type of activity area is one or more rock-lined pits adjacent to scatters or mounds of discarded, fractured rock. Dense trash middens are also present. Extramural hearths and pits are rare. Despite the apparently coherent settle- ment layout of these sites, unequivocal evidence for temporal differences among different site areas and feature types has now been recognized (M. Miller 1990, 1995b; Whalen 1994a), most notably with stratigraphic and horizontal differ- ences in midden formation and pithouses at North Hills. Fig.7.25 illustrates one of the more intriguing aspects of site use. While chronometric dates for pithouses and midden deposits range between a.d. 900 and 1150, the majority of age esti- mates from rock-lined pit features date between a.d.1150 and 1250/1300, co- eval with subsequent architectural and settlement changes involving isolated rooms. While not discounting the fact that these are terminal use dates for these features and that the features may have been used during earlier occupations, it is nevertheless clear that a specialized use of these sites involving rock-lined thermal features continued after the abandonment of residences. Occupations representing the later portion of the Transitional period, such as Meyer Range, present quite a different Fig.7.24.

Because several additional cases of El Paso phase isolated rooms have been encountered (Browning etal. 1992; O’Laughlin 1995, personal communication; O’Laughlin and Martin 1990; Sechrist etal. 1998), it can no longer can be confidently stated that contiguous pueblo room blocks were the primary focus of habitation during the Pueblo period. Of importance in considerations of re- gional demographic and adaptive patterns is that changes in the architectural se- quence and in site structure reflect shifts in settlement location and mirror tempo- ral patterns expressed in features and arti- facts across the region.

Early Formative (Mesilla phase) components are widely distributed throughout the basin, while Late Forma- tive (Transitional and El Paso) settle- ments tend to cluster along the alluvial fans of the Organ Mountains or the fan/basin interface in the vicinity of Coe Lake playa. In addition, Transitional components tend to be distributed on higher surfaces of alluvial fans while El Paso phase settlements are closer to playas (see Fig.7.27). Recent archeological surveys within alluvial fan piedmonts of the eastern Franklin Mountains near El Paso (Kauff- man and Stuart 1994; Sale and Gibbs 1995) and in the Sacramento Mountains (Sale and Ennes 1997), as well as excava- tions at several habitation sites on the me- dial Franklin Mountain fans (Aten 1972; M. Miller 1989, 1990; O’Laughlin 1979; Shafer etal. 1999), tend to support Car- michael’s interpretation. El Paso phase components, particularly ones with resi- dential structures, are exceptionally rare within the alluvial fan topographic zone. Accordingly, the concept of El Paso phase “core areas” is still valid, but with modifications. More detailed archeologi- cal information, coupled with a refined understanding of chronology and ceramic sequences, suggests that several of these areas may more appropriately be viewed as foci of settlement during much of the Late Formative period, especially between Fig.7.27.

07-A2946 4/13/04 12:06 PM Page 246 246 / DESERT ARCHEOLOGY OF WESTERN TEXAS Valley between El Paso and Las Cruces (Brook 1975; O’Laughlin 1980). Unfor- tunately, several decades of urban and agricultural development have destroyed the majority of these sites and obliterated most of the prehistoric landscape. An often overlooked aspect in the tra- ditional focus on Formative period archi- tectural sites concerns nonresidential sites or short-term sites with special processing facilities. Michael E. Whalen (1978) pro- posed the existence during the puebloan El Paso phase of special purpose sites with burned rock features along the alluvial fans of mountain chains. The majority of these features have been dated to before the pueblo interval of a.d.1250/1300, although radiocarbon ages from some burned rock features range from a.d. 1250 to 1450, indicating that these fea- tures were used for subsistence activities even during presumably agricultural peri- ods. Nevertheless, use of the features, and by extension the processing of cacti, suc- culents, or other items associated with their use, appears to have been substan- tially reduced during the El Paso phase in comparison to earlier periods (M. Miller 1997). Reviewing radiocarbon dates from the Hueco Bolson, Mauldin (1994, 1995; see also Mauldin etal. 1998) demonstrates that site formation and use of thermal features significantly declined in the cen- tral basins after a.d.1000. In order to amplify this study, we examine trends among major feature classes and topo- graphic landforms in the Hueco, Tu- larosa, and Mesilla Bolsons (Fig.7.28).

This pat- tern suggests that exploitation of these food resources may have intensified dur- ing the latter part of the Transitional pe- riod but decreased as agricultural depen- dence—or perhaps more appropriately, agricultural specialization—increased. Significantly, this plant use pattern is also reflected in the regional decline after a.d.1250/1300 of the use of rock-lined pits or other thermal facilities presumably used to process these plant foods (see below). Additional evidence for increased maize dependence among prehistoric populations is available from analyses of stable isotope ratios in human skeletal material.

The most compelling analysis of faunal material from a pueblo component is from La Cabrana, located on the first Rio Grande terrace immedi- ately northwest of El Paso (Bradley 1983; Foster etal. 1981). The recovery of more than five thousand fish bones and scales indicates a distinct riverine component to the subsistence base. Formative Period Technological Patterns Sequential changes in architectural form and site structure, settlement pat- tern, and subsistence economies are also reflected in the material culture of the western Trans-Pecos. Several recent stud- ies have used various classes of artifact data to successfully monitor or infer broad-scale changes in subsistence econo- mies during this period (Calamia 1991; Hard etal. 1994, 1996; Mauldin 1995; M. Miller 1997). Changes in ground- stone and ceramic technologies have re- ceived particular attention because they indicate coincident patterns of increasing agricultural dependence and changes in mobility patterns. Analyses of storage and thermal or burned rock facilities (Leach 1993; M. Miller 1997; Whalen 1994b) also provide important insights into changing aspects of technological organization. Thermal and Storage Features Several changes in the form, size, and frequency of burned rock and other ther- mal features occur throughout the For- mative period. Presumably these reflect Fig.7.30.

The current archeological data indicate that reliance on cacti intensified during the Transitional period, particularly between a.d.1150 and 1275, coeval with the ap- pearance of formally constructed house forms and an increasing emphasis on storage. Notably, the regional decline in nearly all types and size groups of thermal features occurred after a.d.1250/1300, and this is when the ubiquity measures of cacti in flotation samples also show a drastic reduction. Intensification of cacti processing and agriculture occurred roughly simultaneously. We suggest that these trends support the argument that subsistence practices between a.d.1275 and 1450 became not only more agricul- turally dependent but also more agricul- turally specialized. Moreover, the appar- ent intensification of both traditional plant processing and agricultural produc- tion occurred in tandem and across dif- ferent environmental zones and marks an important transition in subsistence and settlement.

Groundstone Trends in groundstone form and use in the western Trans-Pecos are known primarily through studies by Calamia (1991), Hard etal. (1996), and Mauldin (1995). Using multiple lines of evidence, including macrofloral analyses and trends in stable carbon isotopes measured in hu- man bone, Hard etal. (1996) demon- stratethatincreasingmanosizeandgrind- ing area correlate with an increase in corn processing. Although part of a larger syn- thesis of archeological data across the Southwest and the Southern Plains, their study demonstrates that a similar trend of increasing groundstone size, representing a pattern of increasing agricultural depen- dence, occurred in the Jornada Mogollon between a.d.200 and 1450. Based on an extensive analysis of manos from both ex- cavated and surface contexts, they further show that greater proportions of two- handed manos, as well as the significant increase in mano size and grinding area, occurred in assemblages dating after a.d.1000 (Fig.7.32). In addition to mano size, the increased prevalence of trough metates over slab and basin forms has been noted at Pueblo components (Lehmer 1948), a factor ob- served in other regions to be associated with increased agricultural dependence Fig.7.32.

This shift may relate to the greater containment secu- rity afforded by necked forms for pro- cessing corn (Hard etal. 1994; Seaman and Mills 1988a, 1988b; see also Braun 1983). Miller’s (1997) comparative analysis of vessel form utilizing a sample of more than five thousand El Paso brownware rim sherds from twenty assemblages dat- ing between a.d.200 and 1450 docu- mented that vessel form assemblages from components dating to the Mesilla phase and the earlier part of the Transitional pe- riod vary widely among the seven vessel classes used in the analysis, while assem- blages from Pueblo settlements are re- markably consistent in terms of the pro- a portional representation of vessel form classes. This situation at first appears counterintuitive, in that one would ex- pect residential occupations of longer du- ration at pueblos to have a greater variety of vessel forms. However, this finding does not necessarily reflect the variety of vessels (i.e., the number of specific vessel classes, or “richness”) observed in the as- semblages, but rather the variation, or “evenness,” among the proportional rep- resentation of vessel classes. That is, Mesilla and early Transitional sites have uneven representations of vessel forms; one may have a high proportion of neck- less jars, a moderate proportion of necked jars, and a small proportion of bowls, while another site has a moderate propor- tionofnecklessjars,moderateproportions of necked forms, and a high proportion of bowls.

Formative period lithic technolo- gies are poorly known, and there is little information on whether any substantial changes in reduction technology, tool form, or raw material procurement oc- curred during this period. Information on lithic assemblages of puebloan oc- cupations is especially limited. Aside from a small number of descriptive ac- counts listing general artifact classes and raw material types at Hot Well, La Cabrana, and Pickup Pueblos (Bentley n.d.; Bradley 1983; Garcia 1988), tech- nological and functional studies of lithic assemblages from pueblo occupations are virtually nonexistent, and the as- semblage from only one isolated room component of this period has been re- Fig.7.34.

Informal core technologies and the production of informal flake tools remained dominant, as did the exploitation of local valley ter- race and alluvial gravel sources for the majority of raw materials. Several studies have noted the com- mon trend of decreasing proportions of fine-grained materials over the pre- ceding Archaic period (Carmichael 1986; Whalen 1980a). Obsidian tends to be more common among Late For- mative assemblages.

The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 in New Mexico and the Manso Revolt of 1684 in the El Paso area provided the impetus for the next series of mission and presidio es- tablishments. After the Pueblo Revolt among puebloan groups in northern New Mexico, an estimated two thousand Spanish refugees and Native Americans loyal to the Spaniards were resettled around missions in the El Paso Lower Valley. Tiwa (Tigua), Piro, and Tompiro groups from the Rio Abajo pueblos of the central and northern Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico were resettled at the mis- sions of Ysleta and Socorro. The original Ysleta mission and at least two locations of the mission at Socorro were destroyed by floods. In the 1980s, Rex Gerald, working at site 41EP1532, identified the location of what is suspected to be the So- corro mission occupied until 1760 (Ger- ald 1990b; D. Martin 1999). Missions were also first established in the La Junta district in 1683. J. C. Kelley (1953) and Madrid (1993) have tentatively identified the Polvo site (412PS21) as the location of the San Antonio de los Puliques mis- sion and pueblo known as Tapacolmes. Unfortunately, Spanish Colonial period sites in the La Junta district have received little archeological attention aside from limited work completed at the Polvo site (Cloud etal. 1994). Archeological aspects of the Pueblo Revolt period in the western Trans-Pecos have recently come to light in excavation and survey projects in the El Paso Lower Valley in the vicinity of the present-day towns of Ysleta, Socorro, and San Elizario (D. O. Brown etal. 1994, 1995; M. Mil- ler and O’Leary 1992a; Peterson 1993; Peterson and Brown 1992a, 1992b; Sale etal. 1987; Vierra etal. 1997, 1999). Fig.7.39.

07-A2946 4/13/04 12:07 PM Page 264 264 / DESERT ARCHEOLOGY OF WESTERN TEXAS northern Mexico during Spanish Colo- nial times. The earlier expression of the tradition is represented at the Ysleta WIC Clinic site (Miller and O’Leary 1992b) and has a distinctive continuity with northern New Mexican Native American ceramic traditions because of the presence of carinated bowl forms. Carinated bowls (vessels with polished red slips or washes) and an absence of red-on-brown designs mark production and stylistic attributes distinguishing the early period from post–a.d.1700/1750 assemblages from sites in Socorro and San Elizario (Brown and Driver 1994; Marshall 1997). The Valle Bajo tradition shares several generic similarities with Spanish Colonial brown- ware collections of the Conchos phase in the La Junta district. While certain differ- ences in temper and paste can be ex- pected given the distance between El Paso and La Junta de los Ríos, sufficient simi- larities exist in design and form to indi- cate that the historic brownware of the Conchos phase represents another local expression of thecorrienteware tradition of the greater Southwest.

Other geologic factors that influenced prehistoric occupation include the nu- merous rock shelters hollowed from the sheer limestone cliffs (Fig.8.2), the copi- ous quantities of lithic raw material avail- able as gravels or eroding chert beds, and the strictures imposed on accessibility be- tween upland and riverine resources. The prehistoric settlement patterns reflect the high incidence of rockshelters on the Pecos River and the Rio Grande and their lesser presence on the Devils River, where instead huge open camps are found at the mouths of every tributary. By far the ma- jority of the sites recorded south of the Rio Grande are also rockshelters, but the emphasis on rock art recording has un- doubtedly introduced this bias. Early settlers describe an environment quite different from that of today, before erosion, exacerbated by overgrazing and modern droughts, reduced the soil cover in historic times. The disastrous result is evident in the siltation of Amistad Reser- voir, the deflation of stone features once perched on deeper soils but now sitting on exposed bedrock (Turpin 1982; Tur- pin and Bement 1989), the burial of the Lewis Canyon petroglyphs under rede- posited sediments (Turpin and Bass 1997), and the higher incidence of flood damage to rockshelters and rock art (Pat- ton and Dibble 1982).

The culture history of the Lower Pecos is a microcosm of hunting and gathering societies throughout the world, alternat- ing between an emphasis on a hunting economy to one dominated by gathering. The stamp of arid lands adaptation is seen in the aspects of prehistoric lifeways that are most influenced by environment and economics, such as material culture, technology, and settlement patterns. The excellent preservation of normally perish- able items, and the diverse and elaborate body of art, both mural and mobiliary, transcends the mundane, opening vistas into the political, social, and religious spheres of hunter and gatherer lifeways.

The many rockshelter excavations north of the Rio Grande have failed to fix the Shumla’s style in time, but radiocarbon dates recently obtained from an open site on the eastern periphery of the Lower Pecos also are consistent with the postu- lated age of ca. 2300 b.p.(Mehalchick etal. 1999, 158). Bryant (1966) recog- nized a return to aridity that he called the Juno Interval, so presumably the Flanders subperiod peoples were practitioners of the ancient exploitation strategies that characterized the Early and Middle Ar- chaic periods. There can be little doubt that people using Shumla dart points left a substantial material record in many sites stratigraphically above the Cibola de- posits. North of the Rio Grande, how- ever, the most prolific sites have been the most poorly excavated. There has been a tendency to attribute the earliest glyphs at the large open bedrock petroglyph site, Lewis Canyon, to the makers of Shumla points because one of the designs resembles this dart point style.

Based on the several preserved fiber fea- tures at the Wroe Ranch site, small shelter occupancy appears to have intensified and emphasized the procurement and process- ing of vegetal material. A higher recovery of fish bones and scales in some shelter deposits also suggests the exploitation of previously less important food sources, but at other sites, such as Skyline Shelter, riverineresourceswerealwaysasignificant component of the diet. The composite picture mirrors that suggested by Ken- neth Brown (1991) for the Middle Ar- chaic period: a broad resource procure- ment strategy characterized by increased mobility, diversified diet, and the ex- ploitation of a wide range of environmen- tal niches, probably on a seasonal basis.

Most of the Red Monochrome sites are near the mouth of the Pecos River, but some examples are found on the Dev- ils River, as far north as the mouth of the Dry Devils. The only example yet re- corded in Mexico was in Parida Canyon, across from the mouth of the Pecos, and itisnowinundatedbyAmistadReservoir. Several Red Monochrome sites, in- cluding at least one painted in black pig- ment, have been reported in the Big Bend area. Miriam Lowrance (1982) attributed them to Jumano artists, citing ethnohis- toric descriptions of clothing and hair- styles that could be artistically rendered as “buns.” The Jumanos, and their allies, the Cibolos, were placed along the Rio Grande, from La Junta to south of mod- ern-day Del Rio, by seventeenth-century a Spanish chroniclers, so Lowrance’s (1982) hypothesis is not without merit. Another intrusive art style, Bold Line Geometrics, is less securely dated to the Late Prehistoric period because its ab- stract iconography provides few temporal clues (Turpin 1986b). Design motifs are variations on straight lines and blank spaces that are combined into nested zig- zags, herringbones, cross-hatches, and blanket patterns (Fig.8.9a, b). In the last, diamond-shaped cells are linked, forming a spider web design that uses blank space as a design element. Many of the geomet- ric pictographs are associated in some way with water, painted surrounding seeps in the shelter walls or, in the case of Parida Cave, above interior springs. Again, most of the sites are found near the mouth of b the Pecos River, with a few aberrant ex- amples recorded on the Devils River and Red Bluff Creek.

The historic vegetation of the South- ern High Plains is a mixed-prairie grass- land, and the dominant native plant community is shortgrass (Blair 1950; Lotspeich and Everhart 1962). Trees are absent except along the escarpments and reentrant canyons. Native plant com- munities of the region occur in very few areas today, however, because most of the Southern High Plains is under cultivation. The Southern High Plains has low, even environmental gradients, flat topog- raphy, and uniform regional geology. These topographic and geologic condi- tions prevailed throughout the Late Qua- ternary, suggesting that past environ- ments were relatively uniform throughout the region and that geomorphic responses to climate were similar and synchronous. This situation, in turn, suggests that long- distance geological and paleoenvironmen- tal correlations can be made with some degree of confidence. Cultural and Environmental Chronology Five general cultural periods are rec- ognized for the Southern High Plains: Paleoindian (11,500 to 8500 b.p.); Ar- chaic (8500 to 2000 b.p.); Ceramic (2000 b.p.to ca. a.d.1450); Protohistoric (ca. a.d.1450 to 1650); and Historic (ca. a.d.1650 to 1950s).

Lipscomb now repre- sents the largest single-event Folsom kill known for the Southern Plains. At Lubbock Lake, Folsom occupations are represented by a series of bison kills around the marshy edges of ponds. Each kill was of a small cow-calf herd, and the animals were butchered on the spot using both expedient lithic and bone butcher- ing tools (E. Johnson 1987a; E. Johnson and Holliday 1987). Bones were stacked in small piles representing butchering units. Lithic tools were either retouched or utilized amorphous flakes. Production of the bone butchering tools took place in the kill area, and the debris and tools were discarded there (E. Johnson 1985). Folsom points were refashioned and also resharpened for use as butchering tools Fig.9.3. Lubbock type collection of points, from a bison kill/butchering locale in Area 5 (FA5- (E.

Late Paleoindian environments are characterized by an intensification of the warming and drying trend that began during Folsom times (Holliday 1997a, 1997b). Effective precipitation decreased and maximum summer temperatures rose. Periodic droughts and disappearing surface water resources denoted the be- ginning of the trend toward modern cli- matic conditions. Seasonality was more strongly expressed with greater seasonal temperature fluctuations, decreased effec- tive rainfall, and lowered humidity. Verte- brate faunas at Lubbock Lake indicated that valley-axis wet meadows/freshwater marshlands with emergent vegetation and sedge beds were available, grading into better-drained valley floors and margins with mixed-grass prairie (E.

Johnson etal. 1982), while assays on bone yielded ages of 9360 b.p.and 8010 b.p.(Harrison and Killen 1978). At Ryan’s site (Hartwell 1991, 1995; Hartwell etal. 1989; E. Johnson etal. 1987), Plainview points (Fig.9.6), large bifaces, and large flakes were found within lacustrine deposits of a very small, extinct playa that overlooked Yellowhouse Draw. The morphology of the points ranged from pristine to reworked. The site was a plow-disturbed cache (Fig.9.7). The Plainview occupation at Lubbock Lake is characterized by the continuation of kills of small herds of bison around the marshy edges of ponds, the clustering or grouping of bones in distinct concentra- tions, and a change in weaponry design Fig.9.5.

Although this material was of Plainview age, whether or not it represents a cul- tural activity has yet to be determined. Three Firstview sites have been exca- vated in the region (see Fig.9.1). At Blackwater Draw Locality #1 (J. Hester 1972), Firstview occupations are present in the carbonaceous silts (Unit E [Haynes 1975, 1995]), but the stratigraphic, geo- chronological, and archeological situation of the material is not clear. Only a few radiocarbon ages are available from this unit, but at most it spans the period from ca. 10,500 to 8500 b.p.(Haynes 1995). At least three bison kill/butchering lo- cales were excavated, two in the lower part of the silts and one in the upper part (Agogino etal. 1976; J.

Hester 1972; E. Johnson and Holliday 1997; Sellards 1952). Sellards (1952) based his Portales Complex on this suite of projec- tile points. Wheat (1972) reexamined the projectile points and concluded that most were resharpened variants of the Firstview design. Bones were jumbled and the de- posit may have been trampled. At least three episodes of surface weathering are evident on the elements, indicating more than one kill event (E. Johnson 1986b; E. Johnson and Holliday 1997). Radio- carbon assays yielded ages of ca. 8970 b.p. and ca. 8690 b.p.that did not overlap at 2-sigma (E. Johnson and Holliday 1997). These dates fall within the age range for a. Firstview on the Southern High Plains (E. Johnson 1987c; E. Johnson and Hol- liday 1981) and indicate that at least two Firstview occupational events are repre- sented at the Clovis site. San Jon (Roberts 1942), on the north- western edge of the Southern High Plains (see Fig.9.1), was a stratified, multicom- ponentsite(Fig.9.8)whereculturalactiv- ities took place along the edge of a playa basin (Fig.9.9). The “San Jon” bone bed in Area II yielded a minimum of five bi- son, and articulated limb elements, par- ticularly lower limbs, were common. Pre- sumably, this bone bed represented a small-scale bison kill at the edge of the playa. The one projectile point recovered from the bone bed was the type specimen for the San Jon point (Roberts 1942), b. anditstipwasreworked(Hilletal.1995). Wheat (1972) subsumed the San Jon type into his Firstview type. Organic sedi- ments from within the bone bed yielded an age of ca. 8360 b.p.(Hill etal. 1995). At Lubbock Lake, Firstview peoples continued to hunt and butcher small herds of bison at the edge of the marsh- lands (E. Johnson and Holliday 1981). Bone concentrations and the stacking of elements continued. Bone fracturing was minimal, and therefore, bone tool manu- facture and use were reduced and marrow processing was rare. The amorphous lithic flake tools were common, and Firstview points were resharpened and reused as butchering tools. The Firstview c. occupation at Lubbock Lake was radio- carbon dated to ca. 8600 b.p.(Holliday Fig.9.7.

A bone concentration represent- ing several individual bison consisted of articulated to semi-articulated segments indicating butchering units. None of the elements had been broken for marrow. Neither lithic nor bone butchering tools were recovered, although numerous re- sharpening flakes indicated the use of sev- eral lithic tools. Radiocarbon ages on soil humates date the Early Archaic activity to ca. 8000 b.p.(E. Johnson and Holliday 1989). The camp at San Jon was dated to 8000 b.p.on charcoal. By about 6000 b.p., the lakes and marshes in the draws had left significant accumulations of marl, but the dominant sediment across the region, in and out Fig.9.8. Deep erosional canyon and complex stratigraphy at San Jon, a playa site on the High Plains surface. of the draws, was wind-blown material (Holliday 1989b, 1995c, 1995d). Eolian sedimentation was episodic but wide- spread from 9000 b.p.until 5500 b.p., with most areas affected by 6500 b.p.Be- tween 5500 b.p.and 4500 b.p., eolian sedimentation occurred throughout the Southern High Plains. This eolian sedi- mentationculminatedinsignificantfilling of draws, construction of sand dunes, lo- cal sedimentation in playa basins, and ad- ditions to lunettes throughout the region. This eolian activity marked peak aridity intheLateQuaternary,andtheperiodbe- tween 6500 b.p.and 4500 b.p.is known as the Altithermal (Holliday 1989b). The Altithermal coincides with the Middle Archaic period. Conditions were hot, dry, and dusty (Holliday 1989a; E.JohnsonandHolliday1986).Themas- sive eolian sedimentation that occurred indicates further reduction in vegetation cover, probably due to increased tempera- Fig.9.9.

Three sites yielded evidence for the excavation of wells by prehistoric occupants in the Middle Holocene. At Blackwater Draw Locality #1 (Evans 1951; F. Green 1962) at least nineteen wells are known. At Mustang Springs (Meltzer 1991; Meltzer and Collins 1987) dozens of wells were discovered. Excavations at Marks Beach (Honea 1980) exposed a purported well. A hearth and associated Clear Fork gouge were recovered in Middle Archaic context from substratum 4A at 41LU26 (Bandy etal. 1981; E. Johnson and Holliday 1986). Despite the harsh conditions, relatively intensive occupation continued through- out this period at Lubbock Lake. At least twenty-eight activity areas are known to include camping events, bison kill/ butchering locales, and a large oven prob- ably used for vegetal processing (E. John- son and Holliday 1986). The oven is a largeovalbasinfilledwithashandcapped by a layer of burned caliche cobbles (Fig.9.11). A broken, worn sandstone metate was found in the rock covering. This feature was radiocarbon dated to ca. 4800 b.p.(E. Johnson and Holliday 1986). By 4500 b.p., the climate began to ameliorate and return to relatively cooler and more moist conditions that brought Fig.9.10. Map of the Southern High Plains with locations of selected post-Paleoindian sites. about landscape stability and environ- mental changes that generally have per- sisted into modern times. Sedimentation ceased, little wind erosion occurred, and a stable vegetation cover returned. Forma- tion of the Lubbock Lake Soil at Lubbock Lake and similar soils at other localities occurred (Holliday 1985c, 1990b, 1995b, 1995c). This landscape stability heralded the establishment of essentially modern conditions and a continental climate. Range conditions improved, and a mixed-grass prairie replaced the probable desert-plains grasslands of the Middle Holocene, both in the draws and on the uplands. Localized marshlands returned to the valley axes with a resurgence of springs; occasional hardwood trees were found in the draws. On the uplands, playas and salinas held seasonal to year- round water (Holliday 1995c, 1995d; Holliday etal. 1996). More extensive sur- face water was available, indicating more Fig.9.11.

For vari- ous political reasons, the National Park Service never followed up on any of its proposals (Flores 1990, 160–65), but the State of Texas has created two small parks along the Caprock Escarpment: the 16,400-acre Palo Duro Canyon State Park, and the 13,906-acre Caprock Can- yons State Park. Just as modern humans find the Caprock Canyonlands to be unique and inviting, so too did the pre- historic Native Americans living in the Southern Plains, and it is not surprising to find that the archeology of this subre- gion also is unique. This revelation is not entirely new, but the culture history syn- thesis by Boyd etal. (1997) is the first attempt to formalize the concept of the Caprock Canyonlands as a unique arche- ological subregion. The environmental characteristics of the Caprock Canyonlands, and the many subtleties that distinguish it from the High Plains and Rolling Plains, are not described in detail here. What is impor- tant is recognition of the fact that, be- cause of its geologic and geomorphic his- tory, the Caprock Canyonlands was an oasis in an otherwise arid landscape. For prehistoric peoples, the canyonlands pro- vided more abundant (in terms of quality and quantity) and predictable resources thananywhereelseintheSouthernPlains: natural shelter, firewood, raw lithic mate- rials, plant and animal foods, and, most importantly, water. Freshwater springs emerging primarily from the Ogallala aquifer, and to a lesser extent from Trias- sic and Quaternary aquifers, are common Fig.10.1. Ecological/archeological regions within the Texas Panhandle Plains. The Caprock all along the Caprock Escarpment, and Canyonlands subregion is defined based on a combination of topography (Raisz 1957), surface geology (Curtis and Ham 1972; Renfro 1973; Williams and McAllister 1979), vegetation areas major riverine systems were generally (Arbingast etal. 1973), and geographic regions (E.

The Late Prehistoric I pe- riod in the Caprock Canyonlands spans the entire Plains Woodland stage of cul- tural development in the Texas Panhandle (i.e., the Lake Creek Complex), and the latter part of the period is contemporane- ous with late Plains Woodland/formative Plains Village occupations in western Oklahoma (i.e., the Custer phase) and with unknown cultural groups in west- central Texas (i.e., the Blow Out Moun- tain phase). This period also coincides with the Southwestern pithouse periods in southeastern New Mexico and far western Texas (i.e., the El Paso and Doña Ana phases of the Jornada branch of the Mogollon, the Querecho and Maljamar phases of the eastern extension of the Jornada Mogollon, and the 18 Mile and Mesita Negra phases of the Middle Pecos) and ends at the time of the pithouse to Fig.10.2.

10-A2946 4/13/04 12:20 PM Page 304 304 / HIGH PLAINS AND CANYONLANDS The floor of this structure was virtually devoid of artifacts. Because of their differences, Structure 1 is interpreted as a habitation while Structure 2 is thought to represent a stor- age facility, but they both exhibit some similar characteristics. Both structures have clay-plastered entryways, approxi- mately 1 m wide and more than 2 m long, in the form of ramps that gradually slope upward from the floor level. The pithouses are shallow, with floor levels at approximately 35 cm below the ground surface. Some erosional beveling of the landform probably has occurred, but it is unlikely that the houses were dug down much more than 50 cm, and some form of superstructure must have extended above ground. Pieces of daub recovered from the fill of Structure 1 suggested that it may have had a wattle-and-daub super- structure. Patches of clay/gravel and large rocks with plaster remnants found in the fill may indicate that Structure 1 had a partial masonry superstructure.

The faunal assemblage indicates that the inhabitants killed and ate more deer and/or antelope than they did any other animals, and only one bi- son element was recovered. Other ani- mals that may have been utilized for food include skunks, rabbits, and turtles, while snake, prairie dog, and other rodent re- mainsareprobablyintrusive.Pollenanaly- ses provided somewhat equivocal results (and a preservation bias is likely), but slightly higher concentrations of cheno- ams were observed in some features. Charred plant remains recovered from extramural features indicate that goose- foot and purslane may have been food resources, and juniper and cottonwood/ willow were used as firewood. In addi- tion, charred oak acorns were recovered from the fill of the burial, from a trough depression inside Structure 2, and from the possible structure. Although the spe- cies was not identified, it is likely that these acorns represent the use of shin oak (Quercus havardii) as a food resource. The number of analyzed pollen and flota- tion samples was minimal, and Cruse notes that “the possibility that horticul- ture was practiced cannot be ruled out” (Cruse 1992, 141). The Kent Creek site is interpreted as a multifunctional residential village, but its size (i.e., the number of pithouses pres- ent) is unknown because the excavated area represents only a small portion of a much larger site. The primary activities that are evident at the site are hunting and processing of small to medium-sized animals; procurement, processing, and Fig.10.6.

The pithouse (Feature 37) is an oval, basin-shaped depression that is 3 by 3.5 m and was dug down ap- proximately 40 cm below the former ground surface into the bedrock substrate (Fig.10.8). Two large oval-basin metates were found cached (i.e., stored upside down) inside the pithouse, and a third slab-type metate in the structure (found in the backhoe trench) also may have been cached. Subtle burned areas in the central floor of the pithouse may repre- sent an interior hearth(s); no definite en- tryway was identified, but it may have been to the southwest. Charred mesquite beans were recovered from the floor of the pithouse. The ten storage pits (Features 17–20, 24–25, 30–32, and 39) are all quite sim- ilar in morphology, being round in plan- view and ranging from 85 to 110 cm in diameter and 50 to 80 cm deep with rounded to flat bottoms and sides that ta- per slightly inward (Fig.10.9). All of the pits are intrusive about 40 to 60 cm into bedrock, and two had large oval-basin metates cached (again upside down) at the top of the pit. The fill of these fea- tures is generally fairly clean sandy sedi- ment (except for one that may have been backfilled with trash), and there is little doubt that they represent storage pits. They are all clustered into a relatively small 8 by 8 m area (see Fig.10.6), and it is hypothesized that they were located in this particular spot and dug into the bed- Fig.10.7.

Charred remains of some other plants, such asChenopodiumand cucurbit seeds, may represent food resources, but their archeological contexts do not confirm this interpretation. The charred cucurbit seeds cannot be identified as to species and probably represent a wild species (such as buffalo gourd) rather than a cul- tivated variety, but the absence of domes- ticated plants in the macrobotanical samples from 41GR291 cannot be in- terpreted as an absence of agriculture al- together. Since the absence of cultigen remains could be due to differential pres- ervation or plant-processing techniques that did not result in charred remains, the question of whether the early occu- Fig.10.8.

The archeological evidence (primarily the features and artifacts) suggests that there were dramatic changes in site func- tion and subsistence activities around a.d.1100. In general, the early occupa- tion period is characterized by a greater dependence upon plant processing (i.e., more and larger groundstone tools), and the late occupation period is characterized by a greater reliance upon hunting (i.e., more arrow points) and an increase in the manufacture of chipped stone tools (i.e., a b more unmodified debitage).

10-A2946 4/13/04 12:20 PM Page 310 310 / HIGH PLAINS AND CANYONLANDS precise location is not stated, the Double Burial site is situated between 50 and 100 km north of the Kent Creek site. The Double Burial is undated, but the associated points indicate that it is proba- bly contemporaneous with, and perhaps related to, the Palo Duro Complex. This was suggested by Willey and Hughes (1978b, 190) based primarily on the sim- ilarities of the burial points to the Dead- man’s arrow point style. This interpreta- tion is plausible, but the fact that these two individuals probably were killed by arrows tipped with Deadman’s-like points is equally important. An alternative inter- pretation is that these individuals may have been killed by people of the Palo Duro culture rather than having been Palo Duro peoples themselves, and this possibility also has been noted by Chris- topher Lintz (1986, 225). The only other burial that might pos- sibly be associated with the Palo Duro Complex is one found at the Sam Wahl site. It is a single, cairn-covered human interment (Feature 23 in Fig.10.6) that is radiocarbon dated to a.d.256–415. The human skeletal materials were found in an oval pit and are interpreted as a sec- ondary (i.e., bundle) burial of a middle- aged male. The bones were extremely fragmented and jumbled, and their con- text (in a tight cluster in one portion of the pit) suggested that they might have been confined inside an organic container such as a basket or a hide bag. The only grave inclusions were a ground and fac- eted piece of hematite (i.e., paint stone) and a Scallorn arrow point 6 cm long. The latter was found in a context suggest- Fig.10.10.

Deadman’s Shelter also has a high activity diversity, with fifteen categories represented, while all of the camp sites exhibit moderate artifact diversities with between ten and thirteen categories repre- sented. Boren Shelter No. 2 has the low- est artifact diversity with only nine of the seventeen categories represented. Two other calculations presented in Table 10.6 are useful for further compar- ing and contrasting these components. One is the total artifact density, calcu- lated as the number of artifacts per square meter of excavation, and the other is the adjusted artifact density, calculated as the number of artifacts (excluding unmodi- fied debitage) per square meter of excava- tion. These artifact densities are consid- ered to be crude measures of the relative intensity and/or duration of occupation. The Kent Creek site and Deadman’s Shelter have much higher total artifact densities than do any of the other sites. As discussed below, this situation may be due to differences in site function or in Fig.10.11.

All of the Palo Duro camp sites exhibit similar artifact densities but vary consid- erably in terms of site function. While hunting activities are fairly well repre- sented at the County Line, Fatheree, and South Ridge sites, plant processing was very much the dominant activity at the Blue Clay, South Sage Creek, Gobbler Creek Bridge, and Cat Hollow sites. In this regard, the latter sites are more like the Sam Wahl site than they are the other camp sites. The chipped stone tool assemblages from Palo Duro sites (see Table 10.5) may be characterized as being rather ho- mogeneous, but the relative frequencies of artifacts vary considerably from site to site. When only the chipped stone tools (i.e., projectile points, drills, gouges, bi- faces, cobble tools, unifaces, and edge- modified flakes) are considered and sites with stone tool samples of fewer than fifty specimens are excluded, some inter- esting patterns emerge.

Projectile points, bifaces, and cobble tools are less common in general but are quite variable from site to site, respectively constituting between 2 to 43 percent, 3 to 24 percent, and 2 to 26 percent of the chipped stones at any one type of site. There is a ten- dency for cobble tools to be much better represented at plant-processing sites, and it has been suggested that these tools may have been used to refurbish (i.e., peck the surfaces of) grinding stones (Boyd etal. 1994, 78–79, 145). Two classes, drills and gouges, are generally rare and respec- tively make up between 0 to 5 percent Fig.10.13. Early arrow points from the Sam Wahl site: a, Bonham; b–e, Scallorn.

Most of the gouges found at Palo Duro sites are Clear Fork–type unifaces (E. Turner and Hester 1993, 246–49), and they usually have some evidence of haft wear. There is a tendency, albeit weak, for these tools to be better repre- sented at sites where intensive plant pro- cessing occurred. If gouges were used for wood working, as has been suggested for south Texas (Hester etal. 1973), then it is possible that they were used as adzes for making and maintaining digging sticks or other wooden tools. Alternatively, gouges could have been used to tip the ends of some type of multipurpose scraping/plan- ing tool or digging stick (Ray 1941, 161– 62). Of particular interest, Clear Fork gouges have been found in sufficient fre- Fig.10.14.

Caching (or storing) of com- plete large oval-basin metates may indi- cate that this grinding tool kit was the most important in terms of the amount of material being processed at Sam Wahl. Although less abundant, the grinding tools from the Kent Creek site do exhibit roughly the same morphological variabil- ity as do those from Sam Wahl. At Kent Creek, no complete metates were found, but the fragments represent both slab and basin types (one fragment was of a thick slab with a deeply worn concavity), and the manos are either oval in shape with flat or convex faces or they are rectangular with flat faces. Two of the rectangular manos have beveled faces. When the groundstone assemblages from the residential bases are compared by material type and completeness, an in- teresting pattern emerges (Table 10.7). Metate fragments heavily dominate the assemblageatSamWahl,buttheyareonly moderately abundant at the Kent Creek site. In addition, most of the metate frag- ments at Sam Wahl were recycled (i.e., reused as hearthstones), while none of those at Kent Creek were found in re- cycled contexts. Since Triassic sandstones and Quaternary gravel outcrops are im- mediately available at both sites, the dis- tance to material sources is not a factor affecting the frequency of grinding tools. Thus, some other factor must account for these differences. While it is possible that grinding activities were simply more im- portant at Sam Wahl than at Kent Creek, this explanation is not totally satisfactory. S. H. Schlanger (1990, 1991) has ob- served that complete and fragmentary ground stones are considerably more abundant in village sites that were occu- Fig.10.15.

Settlement and Architecture Antelope Creek phase sites in the re- gion are thought to number in the hun- dreds. These settlements consist of tem- porary camps; a hierarchy of habitation sites including isolated farmsteads/home- steads, hamlets, and larger villages (Lintz 1986); possibly some small bison-kill pro- cessing stations (Brooks and Flynn 1988); and quarry sites. The more permanently inhabited sites are typically situated on steepterraces,elevatedknollsintheflood- plain, or occasionally, in more westerly sites, on remote mesas. Surveys in the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles (Bro- sowske and Bement 1998; Etchieson 1980; Guidry etal. 1979) have demon- stratedthattheprincipaltributarystreams have a higher site density than do the North Canadian and Canadian Rivers. I suspect water quality issues may have brought about this location choice. Cli- matic change would have led to drier conditions, the water table would have dropped, and that change would perhaps have led to higher mineral content in the major river valleys. An alternate explana- tion is that good land was often in de- mand for both residences and agriculture, prompting Antelope Creek groups to place settlements near rivers on land that was not ideal for farming. The most distinctive element of Ante- lope Creek phase settlement is the use of large stone slabs in wall construction. These slabs were used in single or double rows, placed vertically to form the wall Fig.11.2.

11-A2946 4/13/04 12:22 PM Page 337 FROM STONE SLAB ARCHITECTURE TO ABANDONMENT / 337 it appears that residential construction began to emphasize single room struc- tures, although they were of greater size than those present during the earlier por- tion of the phase (Lintz 1986). Lintz (1986, 133–41) established six different types of residential aggregation. Typical Antelope Creek phase dwelling features included a passageway entrance, a depressed central floor channel, and occa- sionallyaraisedplatform(altar?)foundon the west wall (Fig.11.4). Roof supports consisted of four interior posts usually tethered around a well-prepared central hearth. Storage pits that were subse- quently filled with refuse are often pres- ent within houses or in the village area. There exists considerable information on the nature of stone slab architecture as well as its integration into the community patterning of the Antelope Creek phase. Whatislesswellexploredaretheexplana- tory mechanisms regarding the function- ality of such dwellings and the social im- plications of the sometimes multiroom residential units. Why construct houses of stone slab architecture and what are the behavioral implications of such con- struction? It has been argued that stone slabs were used as the preferred building material because of the absence of a reli- able source of wood timbers. However, this argument lacks documentation of a shortage of wooded zones where timbers would be accessible. Similarly, if the shortage of wood for timbers was the crit- ical issue, should we not also expect other groups on the western edge of the High Fig.11.3. Multiroom residential patterns of Antelope Creek Ruin 22 (Lintz 1986, 317). Plains to resort to stone for residential construction? While Late Prehistoric Plains Villagers in western Kansas and western Nebraska constructed slightly subterranean earth lodges (Wedel 1967), there are no indications that stone was used anywhere else in the region except for the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles. Patricia A. Gilman (1987) has suggested that for southwestern pithouses (as well as above-ground pueblos), climatic factors may have influenced architectural choices. This explanation may also apply to the stone slab houses of the Antelope Creek phase. The floors of the houses can be considered as shallow subterranean (usu- ally less than 30 cm) in character. This below-ground situation, combined with the stone slab and plastered walls, would function to ameliorate extreme heat and Fig.11.4. Model Antelope Creek phase residential unit (Lintz 1986, 90).

Freshwater mollusks were used for spoons and scrap- ers and were also shaped into pendants. The bone tool assemblage is obviously diverse. What is even more impressive is theextensivelaborinvestmentintheman- ufacture of agricultural tools. It is not uncommon for broken scapula hoes to display evidence of mends. This energy investment is also interesting in that the agricultural system is a marginal one that came under increasing stress around a a.d.1350. If agricultural productivity is becoming less efficient, why not revert to a system that uses simple digging sticks rather than hoes that require considerable time and effort to manufacture? There also appears to be a potential conflict be- tween the use of bison bone for tool man- b ufacture and the use of bison bones in the production of bone grease. Studies of ele- ments being shattered for marrow extrac- tion and grease production may provide some clues as to whether there is compe- tition among these two activities for bi- son elements. Trade and Warfare Trade and warfare can be viewed as c alternative responses to the same issue within prehistoric cultures, that of negoti- ating social conflict (R.

The study area for this summary, then, encompasses parts of fourteen counties, extending some 300 km from Delta County on the north to Grimes County on the south. The northern edge is de- fined to include Cooper Lake because, while it is actually in the eastern Black- land Prairie, this part of the Sulphur River valley has recently yielded impor- tant information about the prehistory of this edge of the Caddoan area, and Post Oak Savanna habitat is present in part of the Cooper Lake basin. The study area is not extended any farther north, however, to avoid the distinctly different (at least during the Late Prehistoric period) Red River valley (Bruseth 1998; see also Pert- tula, chapter 13, this volume). The second anchor for this discussion is the Jewett Mine and adjacent Lake Limestone. These project areas are about 200 km south of Cooper Lake in the up- per Navasota River valley, with some of theJewettMinesitesstraddlingthedivide between the Navasota and Trinity Rivers. Important projects between Cooper Lake and the Jewett Mine include Lake Fork Reservoir, which is in the Sabine River drainage, and Richland/Chambers Reser- voir, which is situated near where the TrinityRiverentersthePostOakSavanna. One of the notable gaps in archeological coverage for the region occurs down- stream from this latter project area—the stretch of the Trinity River Valley that separates Freestone and Leon Counties on the west from Anderson and Houston Counties on the east. The southern limit of the study area is marked by the Gibbons Creek Mine on the lower Navasota River. While the Post Oak Savanna runs southwestward from Fig.12.1.

Most of the archeological materials are Late Ar- chaic in age, but a Middle Archaic com- ponent (Analysis Unit 3/4) dating to 4500–3000 b.c.was found in the lower part of the excavations.

Jewett Mine and Lake Limestone Components predating the Late Ar- chaic period also are scarce in the upper Navasota River basin, with only two exca- vated sites apparently containing substan- tial materials dating to this temporal in- terval (Fields 1990). Both sites are in the uplands along a tributary to the Navasota River, and the archeological remains are contained in sandy colluvium. The earlier of these is Analysis Unit 4/5 at the Lambs Creek Knoll site (41LN106), where a single radiocarbon assay of ca. 8000 b.c. and the small collection of classifiable dart points (one Golondrina, one Hoxie, one Woden, one untyped specimen with Fig.12.4.

These deposits contained a single burned rock hearth and yielded a modest collection of 997 lithic artifacts. The formal tool as- semblage contains an unusually high per- centage of unifaces, with most of the other tools being dart points and other bifaces. Because of poor preservation, al- most no faunal or macrobotanical re- mains were recovered. A somewhat later component was identified as Analysis Unit 4/5 at the Charles Cox site (41LN29A). While no radiocarbon dates were obtained from these deposits, a pre–Late Archaic age is suggested for some of the remains by the dated Late Archaic deposits above and by the relatively high proportion of untyped expanding-stem and parallel-stem dart points (n!9; Fig.12.5), although four later points (Axtell, Gary, and Neches River types) and a single earlier point (San Patrice) are included as well. No cul- tural features were found in this unit, but scattered burned rocks suggest the former presence of burned rock hearths. The lithic artifact collection consists of 2,359 specimens, with the formal tools being dominated by dart points and other bi- faces. This component yielded no faunal remains at all and very few macrobotani- cal remains. Fig.12.5.

While somewhat higher use intensity is indicated for the Charles Cox than the Lambs Creek Knoll site, it is difficult to relate this higher use intensity to differ- ences in occupation length and/or fre- quency of use, and there is insufficient evidence to suggest that this reflects an increase in population densities through time. The evidence from these two sites is consistent with the ideas that the upper Navasota River basin was used by foragers during this time and that population den- sities were low. Late Archaic and Woodland Periods Cooper Lake In the upper Sulphur River basin, components dating to the Late Archaic and Woodland periods are moderately common, with the best excavated ex- amples occurring at six sites: Finley Fan (41HP159), Tick (41DT6), Spike (41DT16), Johns Creek (41DT62), Hur- ricane Hill (41HP106), and 41HP137 (Fields etal. 1993, 1997; Gadus etal. 1992; McGregor 1996; Perttula 1990a). Analysis Unit 1/2 at the Finley Fan site is the sole isolated and excavated Late Ar- chaic component. Although datable ma- terials were scarce, the evidence suggests that this component dates to ca. 1650– 150 b.c.The work in this part of the site identified two burned rock hearths and yielded 2,937 lithic artifacts. The formal tools are dominated by bifaces and a vari- ety of dart points, including two Dawson, two Gary, two Kent, two Morrill, two Trinity, one Wesley, one Yantis, four Yar- brough, four untyped specimens, and 12 fragments (Fig.12.6), but gouges, Fig.12.6.

The 19 arrow points recovered represent later materials trans- located down from the overlying later de- posits, and this situation is probably true for the ceramics as well, since they are so few in number and no different from the pottery in the overlying Late Prehistoric contexts. The formal lithic tools are dom- inated by bifaces and dart points; per- forators, gouges, unifaces, cobble tools, ground stones, hammerstones, and pitted stones are present in much smaller num- bers. These deposits contained 172 dart points, with 76 percent of the classifiable specimens being Gary points; most of the remainder are typed as Dawson and Kent (Fig.12.7). Both components yielded large faunal collections containing a di- verse array of taxa, with turtles, deer, rab- bits, other small mammals, and mussels being most common; the Spike site also yielded a few elements identified as bison. The modest collections of macrobotanical remains consist mostly of hickory nut- shells,withPediomelum(formerlyreferred to asPsoralea) rhizome fragments, acorns, and vetch/peavine seeds occurring in small numbers.

Based on these limited data, it appears that subsistence pursuits focused on woodland resources, and there is no evidenceforhorticultureduringthistime. Of these twenty Late Archaic and Wood- land components, fifteen (at eleven sites) are interpreted as residential bases and five (at three sites) as procurement/pro- cessing locations. Five of the residential base components (at three sites) are lo- cated along the Navasota River, while the others are in the uplands to the east. All five of those in riverine settings are inter- pretedasgeneral-purposeresidentialbases (i.e., lacking a special focus on particular activities). In contrast, the upland com- ponents consist of two general-purpose residential bases (at two sites) and eight residential bases at which activities fo- cused heavily on plant processing and sec- ondarily on hunting (at seven sites). This distinction suggests that Late Archaic– Woodland settlement systems were sched- uled based on the occurrence of plant foods. Eleven of the residential sites ap- pear to have been occupied with low or moderately low frequency, suggesting low population densities overall. A greater in- tensity of use is indicated for the other four residential bases, and this situation probably reflects more frequent reoccupa- tion, the relatively long-term nature of the occupations, or both. The five analysis units interpreted as procurement/processing locations appear to have had a primary focus on plant pro- cessing and a secondary focus on hunt- ing-related activities.

Based on the absence of constructed mounds or elaborate buri- als (all of the burials at Cooper Lake lack grave goods), it is clear that the area was occupied by groups with less complex so- cial systems than those of early Late Pre- historic Caddoan groups to the north, east, and south. Evidence for Native American use of the Cooper Lake area during the second half of the Late Prehistoric period is much sparser, and it appears that the area was essentially abandoned by about a.d. 1500. Only two excavated sites, Hurri- cane Hill (41HP106) and Peerless Bot- toms (41HP175), have isolable compo- nents that date to this interval (Fields etal. 1993; Perttula 1999), although some of the early Late Prehistoric sites discussed above, particularly Spider Knoll, probably continued to be used into the 1200s (Fields etal. 1993, 1997; Perttula 1999). The part of the Hurricane Hill site that was occupied during this time is known as the South rise.

The majority of the typable arrow points are classed as Turney (37 percent) or Perdiz (34 per- cent), with most of the remainder being Cliffton, Fresno, and Talco (Fig.12.11). Both of the classifiable dart points are typed as Gary. The ceramic collection is unusual not onlybecauseofthelargenumberofsherds but also because many of the sherds are relatively large, allowing reconstruction of vessel sections. The sherds are distinctive in that 41 percent contain shell temper (the remainder have grog and/or bone) and 5 percent are red slipped. A number of vessel forms are represented, including several kinds of carinated bowls, simple bowls, deep bowls, globular jars, large and small cylindrical jars, and bottles and a couple of the forms that are more typi- cal of Plains vessels than Caddoan ones (Fields etal. 1993). Nonetheless, most of the ceramics can be related comfortably to such Caddoan types as Ripley En- graved,AveryEngraved,SimmsEngraved, McKinneyPlain,NashNeck-Banded,and Emory Punctated-Incised (Fig.12.12). Only two of the pipe fragments are dis- tinctive; one appears to be part of an elbow-shaped pipe, while the other has a short stem that is not typical of either elbow-shaped or Red River pipes. The bone tool collection, although small, is interesting because it contains a grooved bison (?) rib possibly representing a rasp.

In sum, the middle and late parts of the Late Prehistoric period at Cooper Lake are somewhat difficult to interpret because of the limited number of exca- vated components, but it is clear that there were changes in settlement strate- gies from the early part of this period. The two analyzed components appear to have seen long-lived occupations involv- ing broad ranges of activities, and at least one, and probably both, were used by sedentary groups. Limited residential mo- bility is indicated, and these sites proba- bly were similar functionally (i.e., they Fig.12.11. Arrow points from the late Late Prehistoric component at the Peerless Bottoms site were small farmsteads occupied by groups (41HP175), Cooper Lake: a, Cliffton; b, Fresno; c, d, Perdiz; e, Talco; f–h, Turney. with mixed hunter-gatherer and horticul- turaleconomies).Thereisnoevidencefor substantially greater reliance on cultigens than during the early part of the period, and there is no indication of a shift to a bison-oriented hunting strategy, although bison are present at Peerless Bottoms and not at the earlier sites (except the Wood- land component at the Spike site). The small number of isolable compo- nents dating to this late interval makes it clear that this stretch of the Sulphur River valley was occupied less densely during this time than before. In fact, small num- bers of late artifacts occur at many sites that predominantly predate ca. a.d.1200, and because of their small numbers these artifactssuggestthatmostofthelatecom- ponents in the project area represent non- intensive, presumably limited-purpose use. Thus, there is reason to question whether the two excavated components discussed above are typical for the area. From this perspective, it appears that settlement systems during the second half of the Late Prehistoric period may have included limited numbers of residential sites but relatively large numbers of lim- ited-function procurement/processing sites. This situation implies an increase in logistical mobility over the early Late Pre- historic period. Jewett Mine and Lake Limestone Eleven components dating predomi- Fig.12.12.

The Old Union Bridge and Carl Sadler sites are in alluvial settings, while the deposits at the others are mostly colluvial. Middens were presentattheBottoms,MoccasinSprings, and perhaps Old Union Bridge sites. Eight components lack cultural features entirely, and only four concentrations of burned rocks interpreted as hearths or discarded hearth debris, two postholes, one pit of unknown function, one burial, and one cache of cores were found in the remaining three components. Sixteen ad- ditional burned rock concentrations and three pits were recorded at the Bottoms site, but it is hard to be certain that these are associated with the Late Prehistoric component. This uncertainty is especially the case for the rock concentrations, since rock hearths and scattered nonfeature burned rocks are much more common in earlier (i.e., Late Archaic–Woodland) contexts in the region. One additional human burial dating to the Late Prehis- toric period was found at the Cotton- wood Springs site (Fields and Klement 1995), but the associated occupational debris was so sparse at this predominantly Fig.12.13.

The collection of bone tools, all of which are from Moc- casin Springs, contains 2 antler pressure flakers, 3 pointed tools fashioned from long bone splinters (2 have parallel grooves along their margins suggesting use as rasps), and 1 deer metatarsal with parallel grooves across one face, which also may be a rasp. The ceramics are overwhelmingly (96 percent) grog or bone tempered. Most of the remainder are classified as the sandy- paste ware that occurs in small numbers in Woodland contexts at the mine and elsewhere across southeastern Texas, and a few sherds belong to the kaolin-paste ware also used earlier in the region. It is unclear if these minor groups represent ceramics actually used during the Late Prehistoric period or if they are intrusive from the earlier deposits. While most of the tempered ceramics are plain, some exhibit decorations (e.g., random body punctations, brushing, diagonal incising, pinching, engraving, neck-banding, and appliquéd strips or nodes) that are charac- teristic of pottery in Caddoan sites to the east (Fig.12.14). The motifs on a few sherds are strongly reminiscent of those on defined Caddoan types (e.g., Holly Fine Engraved, Killough Pinched, May- delle Incised, Patton Engraved, Poyner Engraved, and Weches Fingernail Im- pressed), although design execution tends to be sloppier on the sherds from the Jew- ett Mine sites. Hence, it appears that some, and probably all, can be related to the Caddoan ceramic tradition in one way or another, be they pots made by Caddo peoples or copies made by local groups.

The second technological change dis- cussed here is the use of ceramic contain- ers. While Woodland contexts at both CooperLakeandtheJewettMinedocon- tain small numbers of sherds (the ratios of sherds to shaped chipped stone tools are only 0.1:1 and 0.2:1, respectively), there is reason to suspect that some or maybe even all of the ceramics are intrusive from later occupations. Thus, it appears that ceramics were at best a minor part of the material culture during the Woodland pe- riod. Pottery is only marginally better represented in early Late Prehistoric con- texts at the Jewett Mine (the ratio of sherds to shaped chipped stone tools is 0.5:1), and it is clear that activities re- lated to the use of ceramics were not im- portant at the sites used during this tem- poral interval.

The fact that the ratios for the two late compo- nents at Jewett are higher than those for the single late component at Cooper Lake is intriguing given that the latter appears to represent a single-component occupation by largely sedentary hunter- gatherer horticulturists, while the former are more likely to represent repeated, shorter-term residential occupations by hunter-gatherers. Assuming it is not a function of the small number of sites in- volved, this difference may reflect the more logistical nature of the late Late Pre- historic settlement strategies at Cooper Lake (i.e., more frequent performance of procurement/processing tasks away from residential sites, resulting in decreased tool densities).

The climate of the region is humid, with a mean annual precipitation of at least 120 cm; periods of maximum rain- fall occur in the spring and fall seasons. Droughts are not uncommon, and den- drochronological analyses of tree rings for the last 1,000 years suggest that there were numerous wet and dry spells during that era (Stahle and Cleaveland 1994, 1995). Dry conditions and the worst droughts occurred in the late a.d.1200s, in the mid-1400s and 1600s, and then again in the mid-1700s (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995, fig. 4). The period between a.d.1549 and 1577 has been suggested to have been the worst June drought in the past 450 years (Stahle etal. 1985). More favorable crop growing conditions probably occurred during the intervening years, especially between ca. a.d.1390 and 1440, then in the late part of the sixteenth century and early seven- teenth century, and finally, at the begin- ning of the eighteenth century, when Spanish and French colonists settled among the Caddo peoples in earnest. These climatic perturbations presumably affected the predictability and success of themaizeharvestsduringtheCaddoanoc- cupationofthePineywoodsandPostOak Savanna. Certainly similar perturbations in the Holocene also affected the range, distribution, and abundance of naturally occurring plants and animals during the long prehistoric Native American settle- ment of northeastern Texas (see M.

Of particular import were Johnson’s (1962, 208) temporal divisions of the Archaic based on projectile point sequences and on the introduction of plain ceramics at the end of the Archaic. Dee Ann Story (1990, fig. 32) and J. Pe- ter Thurmond (1990a, table 8) provide the most current chronological classifica- tions of Archaic age dart points, with straight and expanding-stem forms char- acteristic of the Early and Middle Archaic periods and the contracting stem darts particularly diagnostic of the Late Archaic (and much of the Woodland period as well [Schambach 1982, 1998]). What have we learned about the Ar- chaic populations who lived in northeast- ern Texas? Recent paleoenvironmental re- search summarized by C. Reid Ferring (1995c) suggests that much of the Ar- chaic period, particularly the period be- tween about four thousand and eight thousand years ago, was drier than today, with apparent reductions in biomass as well as the local expansion of prairie habi- tats along the western margins of the re- gion. Nevertheless, drier conditions and changing vegetation conditions “clearly did not preclude occupations” (Ferring 1995c, 33) during these periods.

Burned rock features (possible hearths, ovens, and cooking pits) and burned rock concentrations are present in dated Middle Archaic contexts at a few sites in theSulphurRiverdrainage(seeCliffetal. 1996a; Gadus etal. 1992), suggesting that an important activity was the cook- ing and processing of plant foods, but mainly by small groups for short-term use (Fields etal. 1997, 90). A single burned rock feature at the Unionville site (41CS151; see Fig.13.3) has a calibrated date of 4161–4040 b.c.(Cliff etal. 1996a). Lithic raw material data from a possible Middle Archaic assemblage at Lake Fork Reservoir in the upper Sabine River basin indicate that the exchange of nonlocal materials (particularly finished tools) was commonplace (Perttula 1984), although “patterns in raw material use were not uniform across Northeast Texas” (Fields and Tomka 1993, 92), and in general, the use of nonlocal raw materials was not common. At Cooper Lake in Ar- chaic contexts, the nonlocal lithics that are present primarily originated to the north in the Red River basin (Fields 1995; Fields etal. 1997; see also Fields, chapter 12, this volume). Mound com- plexes of Middle Archaic age in northern Louisiana at this time also suggest the development of more complex hunter- gatherer societies in the Trans-Mississippi South (see J. W. Saunders etal. 1997; J. W. Saunders and Allen 1997). Late Archaic sites are widely distrib- uted in the Pineywoods and Post Oak Sa- vanna, occurring along the major streams, near springs, on spring-fed branches, on upland ridges, and on tributary drainages Fig.13.4.

Two calibrated dates from one of the eight mounds at Hudnall- Pirtle are in a range between a.d.1152 and 1250. The McKenzie (41WD55) site in the middle Sabine River drainage has a single substructural mound that dates be- tweena.d.1298and1470(seeGranberry 1995), and there are contemporaneous mounds covering structures with ex- tended entranceways at the Redwine (41SM193) and Bryan Hardy (41SM55) sites(seeWaltersetal.1998).TheMiddle Caddoan occupation at Redwine also included an extensive midden deposit, hearth and pit features, and a small ceme- tery with extended supine burials; the cemeterycontained7.0ceramicvesselsper burial, 0.75 ceramic pipes per burial, and 6.0 arrow points (primarily the Perdiz type) per burial (Walters etal. 1998, 26). The Hale (41TT12) and Keith (41TT11) multiple mound sites (see Fig.13.18) may also have had a civic- ceremonial function in the Big Cypress Creek basin, and the same may be said for the Roitsch (41RR16), Wright Plan- tation (41RR7), Fasken (41RR14), and Sanders (41LR2) sites in the Red River basin (Bruseth 1998; Hamilton 1997). At Roitsch–Sam Kaufman, four calibrated dates from a rectangular structure near the East Mound (Skinner etal. 1969) range between a.d.982 and 1250 (Pert- tula 1998a, table 1). Only a few possible Caddoan mounds are known in the lower Sulphur River ba- sin of northeastern Texas (see Fig.13.18) and southwestern Arkansas (Cliff 1997; J. Miller 1986), and they appear to con- sist of single mounds rather than large mound centers with both earthen plat- forms and burial mounds.

Extensive excava- tions documented a circular structure un- der Mound 1/2, an assortment of pits and postholes in nonmound contexts, and several large burial pits in a mortuary mound (the Reavely-House Mound). No clear evidence for on-site permanent Cad- doan habitation was identified at Wash- ington Square, although an interesting assortment of large sherd-filled pits (rep- resenting many vessels) was encountered in one area between Mound 1/2 and the mortuary mound (see Corbin and Hart 1998, fig. 14). These pits may represent deposits from public feasting activities led by Caddo elite (see, e.g., S. Scott and Fig.13.17. Schematic layout of funerary objects, Feature 14, at the Tyson site. Photograph cour- tesy of Dr. Tom Middlebrook. Jackson 1998) who used the Washington Square mound site as a ceremonial center from a.d.1200–1400. The radiocarbon dating of the Wash- ington Square and George C. Davis sites hints at the possibility that the Washing- ton Square Mound center began to flour- ish about the time (after ca. a.d.1250) that the George C. Davis site was losing power and social authority. This change suggests that the Caddoan community that built and used the Washington Square Mound site—more advanta- geously located eastward at the nexus of north-south (later known as the Caddo trace) and east-west (later known as the Camino Real) aboriginal trails—achieved preeminence at the expense of the long- lasting (four hundred years) polity on the Neches River. The George C. Davis site was abandoned by the early fourteenth century. The Formative, Early, and Middle Caddoan Pineywoods groups possessed a rich material culture. Well-made, corner- notched, and rectangular-stemmed arrow points were common, along with silt- stone and greenstone celts, perforators and borers (Fig.13.20), large Gahagan bifaces, and a variety of more expedient stone tools (unifacial flake scraping and Fig.13.18. Multiple mound sites in northeastern Texas and adjacent areas of southwestern Arkansas and northwestern Louisiana (adapted from Perttula 1993c). cutting implements). Long-stemmed Red River (Hoffman 1967) and cigar-shaped ceramic pipes were made by the Caddos at this time, as were ceramic earspools and figurines (see Newell and Krieger 1949).

Davis [Newell and Krieger 1949; Stokes and Woodring 1981], Deshazo [Fields 1981, 1995], Benson’s Crossing [Driggers 1985], and 41MX5 [Brewington etal. 1995]). Much attention has been paid by archeologists over the years to the well-made ceramics manufactured by the Caddo peoples, and the analysis of Caddo ceramics is integral to the study of any Caddo site in the four-state Caddoan archeological area. The Caddos made ceramics in a wide variety of vessel shapes (see Reynolds 1992) and with an abundance of well- crafted and executed (L. Johnson 1992) body and rim designs and surface treat- ments (Table 13.1). From the archeologi- cal contexts in which Caddo ceramics have been found, as well as inferences about their manufacture and use, it is evi- dent that ceramics were important to the prehistoric Caddos in the cooking and serving of foods and beverages, in the storage of foodstuffs, as personal posses- sions, as beautiful works of art and crafts- manship (i.e., some vessels were clearly made to never be used in domestic con- texts), and as social identifiers (certain shared and distinctive stylistic motifs and decorative patterns marked closely related Fig.13.21.

This diver- sity can be reasonably interpreted to be representative of specific Caddoan social groups. In historic Caddoan times, ce- ramic vessel forms and decorations are considerably more homogeneous across much of the Caddoan area, suggesting ex- tensive intraregional contact between contemporaneous Caddoan groups (Pert- tula 1992a, 154 and Table 14). There is an interesting temporal trend intheCaddoanceramicsfrompartsofthe Red River valley (in northwestern Louisi- ana) below the Great Bend, the middle Sabine River basin, and the Neches- Angelina River basins for larger portions of vessel surfaces to be decorated, particu- larlywiththeintroductionofbrushingon the bodies of utility jars.

13-A2946 4/13/04 12:32 PM Page 392 392 / EASTERN AND NORTHERN TEXAS Caddoan ceramics were apparently widely traded in Texas, as they have been found in significant quantities at north- central, east-central, central, and inland southeastern Texas archeological sites (Story 1990, 247). The earlier Caddoan ceramics (dating before ca. a.d.1300) were most widely distributed in the upper Trinity and Brazos River basins of north- central Texas (see Perttula etal. 1995b, 190), and in inland southeastern Texas, while the Late Caddoan ceramic wares appear to have been most commonly ex- changed with east-central and central Texas groups after a.d.1300, as well as with prehistoric peoples living along the Trinity River in inland southeastern Texas (McClurkan 1968). Caddoan ceramic finewares were also traded extensively in a b parts of the Midwest and southeastern United States, most notably after ca. a.d.1300–1400 with Native American groups living in the Lower Mississippi Valley of Arkansas and Louisiana (Early 1993, 232–33), as well as far afield (such as central Kansas [Wedel 1959]). Other types of ceramic artifacts manu- factured by prehistoric Caddoan groups include ceramic earspools and disks, figu- rines,andavarietyofpipeforms(A.Jack- son 1933, 71). The earliest types of Cad- doan clay pipes were plain, tubular, and cigar-shaped forms, followed by the long- stem “Red River” pipes (Hoffman 1967) with burnished and polished stems and bowls; rectangular platform pipes and someelbowpipeforms(BrusethandPert- tula 1981, figs. 5–11a, b) have also been recovered in Caddoan sites dating before c d a.d.1200.

Kelley 1997; Schambach 1983; C. Webb 1959). Upstream from the Texarkana phase, the McCurtain phase represents another Late Caddoan archeological complex (Bruseth 1998) (Fig.13.26). In the Texarkana and Belcher phase ar- eas, sites include large, permanent settle- ments with mounds and cemeteries, hamlets, and farmsteads. The mound centers were marked by the construction of earthen mounds that were used as temples, burial mounds, or ceremonial firemounds(seeD.Kelley1998;C.Webb 1959). These settlements were inhabited by sedentary Caddo agricultural commu- nities with complex societies led by indi- viduals with high status who lived at the mound centers (e.g., Story 1990).

(1995) suggest that the Moore/Higginbotham mound center and community a few miles downstream from the Cabe site represents the upper Kadohadacho village that was eventually abandoned in 1788 (see F. Smith 1995, 77). The Belcher phase is thought to date from ca. a.d.1500 to the late seventeenth century (D. Kelley 1998; Perttula 1992a). Bruseth (1998) provides the most cur- rent discussion of the archeological char- acter of the Late Caddoan McCurtain phase. As stable isotope and bioarcheo- logical evidence has shown, the McCur- tain phase Caddos were agricultural peoples, depending heavily on the culti- vation of maize as the main staple of the diet (Colby 1997; Rose etal. 1998). Like other Late Caddoan groups on the Red River (see Fig.13.26), the McCurtain phase settlement pattern includes numer- ous habitation sites (with household cemeteries and substantial midden depos- its) and mound centers, though the mounds appear to have mainly been con- structed between ca. a.d.1300 and 1500. In some instances, mound centers were not directly associated with permanent settlements or middens (see Wyckoff 1967). The McCurtain phase mounds were generally constructed in one or two stages over important public structures, with the structure abandoned, dismantled and/or burned, then capped with a fill zone of soil scraped from nearby deposits. Simple and elaborate single and multiple burials were also placed in the mounds, as with the East Mound at the Roitsch– Sam Kaufman site on the Red River Fig.13.26.

(Recent excavations at the Rookery Ridge [41UR133] and Earspool [41TT653] sites have uncovered houses of this period that will provide much use- ful information when the results of the excavations are published; see Galan 1998 and Parsons 1998.) Based on a few exca- vated Late Caddoan structures in the Pineywoods (some of which were in mounds and may thus not be at all characteristic of domestic structures [Fig.13.29]), the single pole structures were probably circular in shape, were thatched and wattled, measured between 5 and 8 m in diameter, and may have had, on occasion, extended entranceways (Clark and Ivey 1974; Galan 1998; Par- sons 1998; Perttula n.d.; Thurmond 1990a, 144, 146, 148, 168, 210–11). Structures had central hearths and center posts, possible interior benches and racks for sleeping and above-ground storage purposes, as well as storage and trash pits. Residential structures had some midden accumulation on their floors (i.e., house middens), which were not prepared or lined with clay, but the vast majority of the daily trash and refuse was deposited on the nearby trash midden mound. When Pedro Vial visited the Nadaco Caddo “village” near the Sabine River in 1788 (probably in the vicinity of Longview and Marshall, Texas), he de- scribed it as having thirteen to fifteen houses scattered over a distance of three leagues (about eight miles) (Nasatir and Loomis 1967, 344–45).

Only a small number of Late Caddoan period mounds are known in the region (Fig.13.30), ranging from one to four small mounds per site, and they are unlike the types of mound complexes typically constructed in the major river valleys at this time (Story 1990). Pineywoods mounds were substructural mounds; no pyramidal plat- form or burial mounds are known for this time period. Substructural mounds are generally restricted to mounds that cap a burned circular structure that was con- structed on the ground surface or in a small, shallow pit. In at least two in- stances, the mounds contained sequent structures, but the “structures originated at higher levels in the mound[s] due to occupational accumulations of soil and ash, and not the result of any deliberate capping” (Thurmond 1990a, 168). Thurmond suggests that the locations of Late Caddoan period mounds in the Cypress Creek basin appear to be associ- ated with clusters of contemporaneous settlements, cemeteries, and limited use areas, “and it is therefore possible that these concentrations of components rep- resent the archeological manifestation of... Cypress cluster constituent groups during the [preceding] Whelan phase” (Thurmond 1990a, 234–35). A similar Fig.13.29.

Burials within the family cemeteries include single extended inhumations within a patterned arrangement of burials in rows; burials are oriented roughly east- west (see M. Bell 1981; Hunt etal. 1996; R. Turner 1978). Children were typically buried in subfloor pits within the house- hold structures themselves. According to Thurmond, artifact associations in family cemeteries differ only by age and sex: “Adolescents were buried with more of- ferings than children or infants, and with fewer offerings than adults. The graves of males often contain clusters of arrow- points in patterns suggesting quivers of arrows, and those of females contain pol- Fig.13.30. Distribution of Late Caddoan mound centers: (1) P.

Burials from prior to a.d.1550 demonstrate consider- able intraregional variability in the man- ner of treatment, as well as in the types of artifactual remains placed in the burials as offerings. For example, in addition to the multiple interments at Tuck Carpenter, shaft tombs are represented in a pre– a.d.1550 cemetery at the Lower Peach Orchard site. At the J. E. Galt site, the high-status burial included such offerings as a large number of celt fragments and other native stone implements, rather than caches of arrow points (Thurmond 1990a, table 29). Galt bifaces were also recovered from the cemetery.

No post–a.d.1550–1600 community ceme- teries are known in the Three Basins and Tankersley Creek subclusters, with the ex- ception of Tuck Carpenter, which sug- gests that many of these areas were aban- doned by resident Caddoan groups about this time. In general, these community cemeter- ies are relatively short-term mortuary phenomena that were used intensively in portions of the Pineywoods after about a.d.1550 to the early 1600s.

Other finewares include zoomorphic effigies and rattle bowls. The utility vessels were tempered with grog and grit and had a coarser paste alongwith a thicker body. Small to large jars (more than 30 cm in height with orifice diameters greater than 25 to 30 cm) and plain conical bowls were typical utility vessel shapes. The presence of car- bon encrustations, food residues, and soot on many of the utility vessels indi- cates that these pots were used for cook- ing (e.g., Skibo 1992); the large orifice diameters and vessel volumes also sug- gest that some utility vessels were used primarily for storage of foodstuffs and liquids. The types of decorations and/or surface treatment on the utility vessels (Fig.13.35) included neck banding or corrugation, brushing, appliqué, incision, punctation, or various combinations thereof (Perttula etal. 1995a; R. Turner 1995, table 1). Small handles or lugs were present on some of the utility vessels. Based on sherd samples from domestic contexts, utility vessels probably com- prised between 50 and 70 percent of the ceramic assemblages in Titus phase sites, with proportionally fewer utility vessels in Fig.13.34.

13-A2946 4/13/04 12:33 PM Page 405 PREHISTORIC AND CADDOAN ARCHEOLOGY OF THE PINEYWOODS / 405 have been of lesser importance in the Titus phase than they were between ca. a.d.900 and 1400 (Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Perttula etal. 1982). In fact, the subsistence evidence from the Titus phase in the Pineywoods, as well as elsewhere in the Caddoan area, suggests the successful development of a Caddoan maize-based economy at this time (G. J. Fritz 1990, 421, 425). Vertebrate species identified in Titus phase trash middens include deer, turkey, cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, squirrel, and beaver. Turtle and fish were also present but were relatively uncommon compared to mammals and birds. Deer and turkey appear to have been the dominant ex- ploitable species (Perttula etal. 1982, 1993a). The examination of bioarcheological remains sheds some additional light on the subsistence character of the Titus phase populations, but to date the results have not been substantial because of the relativelysmallsamplesofhumanremains that have been analyzed from Pineywoods Late Caddo sites (Burnett 1990, 402– 408). Based on admittedly limited bio- archeological evidence, principally the low frequency of dental caries and porotic hyperostosis in the few studied human re- mains from Titus phase sites, Barbara Burnett suggests that the Late Caddoan inhabitants of the Cypress/upper Sabine and the middle Sabine consumed little to no maize and “were not dependent upon a maize-rich diet” (Burnett 1990, 405, 408).
