LITHIC ARTIFACT TYPE DEFINITIONS AND RECORDED ATTRIBUTES TYPE DEFINITIONS Cores and Hammerstones Cores are nodules that have faceted platforms from which specific kinds of flakes are removed (Figure 1). They are subdivided into unidirectional, bi-directional, multi- directional, bipolar, flake core, and undetermined fragment types (Figure 2). Tested materials are nodules with a single flake removed from an unprepared cortical platform at one or more isolated locations. They probably represent nodules that have been tested for material quality and were then rejected. Cobble unifaces have two or more flakes unifacially removed along a single edge margin, usually at one end of the pebble or cobble (Figure 2). Cobble unifaces probably represent unprepared cobble cores. Cobble bifaces have two or more flakes bifacially removed from a single edge at the end of a pebble or cobble. They presumably represent formal heavy-duty chopping tools (i.e., choppers), but might have also been used as a source for flakes. Cobble bifaces differ from bifacial cores in that bifacial cores are generally made of siliceous materials and have more than one continuous bifacially retouched edge perimeter. A hammerstone is a nodule that exhibits battering on an otherwise unmodified cortical portion of its surface. This battering usually occurs on the end or along the perimeter of the pebble or cobble. In contrast, anvils are artifacts that exhibit repeated battering in a specific isolated location, so that a small circular depression is created on a planar surface.

Figure 2. Cobble uniface and unidirectional (single face) core (upper). Unidirectional (multi face) core, bi-directional (bifacial) core, and hammerstone (bottom). Debitage Debitage consists of the by-products of core reduction and tool production. Flakes are pieces of material that have been detached from a core or tool by percussion or pressure, as opposed to angular debris, which are pieces that are incidentally broken off during core reduction. These pieces of shatter lack definable flake characteristics, such as a platform, bulb of percussion, eraillure, ventral/dorsal surface, and proximal/distal ends. Microdebitage are pieces of debitage with a maximum length equal to or less than 10 mm. Core flakes are flakes that have been detached from a core (Figure 3). A polythetic set (Clark 1968:36—37) of attributes for core flakes consists of a single or dihedral platform, a platform that is approximately as wide as the flake, a platform angle of greater than 75°, cortex present on the dorsal surface, dorsal scars that may be absent, parallel, or perpendicular to the platform, a thickness of greater than about 5 mm, a pronounced bulb of percussion, and an eraillure scar. To be classified as a core flake, the flake must exhibit at least six of the eight defining attributes. Bipolar flakes are flakes that have been detached from a core through the use of a bipolar reduction technique. That is, the core is set on an anvil and struck with the percussor (Crabtree 1972:42). The resultant flake differs from a core flake in that it may have two bulbs of percussion (positive or negative), eraillures, and/or scaling/crushing at one or both ends.

Core flake (Slaughter et al. 1992:67) Core trimming flakes are pieces that are have been struck at a 90 degrees angle to the major flaking axis of the core along the edge of the core platform and dorsal flaking surface. They are sometimes referred to as platform renewal or rejuvenation flakes, since they often remove the step fractures than can occur adjacent to the edge of the platform. They may also represent an attempt to change the orientation of the core, by preparing and reorienting a new flaking surface that is perpendicular to the previous major flaking axis. Core trimming flakes are similar to uniface rejuvenation flakes (Highley 1995:482). Core tablets are also flakes that have been struck perpendicular to the major flaking axis of a core; however, they have been struck just below the platform to remove the whole striking platform from the core (Collins 1999:24). Opposing core flakes have been detached from the bottom of the core by striking at a 90° angle to the major flaking axis. This then acts to create a platform from which flakes are removed in the opposite direction from the previous removals. They may also reflect a type of overshot flake which as removed the bottom of the core (Montgomery 1978:67). These flakes exhibit marked ventral curvature, and multiple dorsal flake scars which radiate towards a single termination at its distal end. Change-of-orientation flakes are core flakes where the dorsal surface scars are opposed to the direction that the flake was removed. For example, these would be the initial flakes detached from a core that has been reoriented by removing an opposing core flake. Potato or orange rind flakes are flakes removed from cobble unifaces where the platform and lateral edge of the flake are covered with cortex.

Biface flakes are flakes that have been detached from a bifacially retouched artifact (Figure 4). A polythetic set of attributes for biface flakes consists of a multi-faceted platform, an isolated platform, a lipped platform, a platform angle less than 75°, a weak bulb of percussion, cortex absent on the dorsal surface, dorsal scars that are roughly parallel to each other and perpendicular to the platform, a thickness of less than 5 mm that is relatively even from proximal to distal ends, and a pronounced ventral curvature. A flake must exhibit at least six of the nine attributes to be classified as a biface flake. Biface flakes removed from retouched tools tend to exhibit a platform angle less than 50°, whereas, flakes removed from bifacial cores generally have platform angles from about 50 to 75°. Biface Thinning Flakes Figure 4. Biface flake (Jackson et al. 1988) Overstruck flakes are flakes removed from the edge of a biface, but go over and beyond the face of the artifact detaching a portion of the opposite edge. These items are also referred to as outrepassé flakes (Tixier 1963:43-44). Notching flakes are flakes which exhibit a negative dorsal scar originating from the platform, a small indentation at the platform, a convex ventral profile and a salient bulb of percussion (Titmus 1985:251- 252). Uniface flakes are flakes that have been detached from a unifacially retouched artifact (Jelinek 1966; Shafer 1970). A polythetic set of attributes for uniface flakes consists of a single-faceted platform, a platform angle of greater than 60°, dorsal scars that are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the platform, a single distal scar on the dorsal surface of the flake (sometimes separated by an arris), and marked ventral curvature. Pieces esquillées are rectangular pieces that have bifacial scaling on one or more edges (Tixier 1963:146). Although traditionally viewed as tools, they may also be the by-

product of a bipolar reduction technique (Flenniken 1981:56). Burin spalls are pieces that have been struck from the edge of a flake, so that the resulting scar (or facet) approaches 90° to the plane of the blank from which it was removed. Pot lids are Hertzian cones produced when siliceous rocks are subjected to heat. Hammerstone flakes are flakes with cortex on the platform and dorsal surface, with the platform being heavily battered. Ground stone flakes are flakes that have a ground facet(s) situated on their dorsal surface. Undetermined flake fragments are fragments for which flake type could not be determined. Manuports are unmodified pieces of lithic raw material that have been transported from their source area to another location as a result of human behavior. This may include materials to be used in lithic reduction, ceramic production, or other miscellaneous functions. Retouched Tools Retouched tools are the result of the secondary percussion or pressure flaking of a piece in order to produce a specific tool shape (Figures 5 and 6). Marginally retouched flakes are pieces of debitage with retouch that extends over less than one-third of the surface of the artifact (Chapman and Schutt 1977:86). This is non-invasive retouch limited to the edge margin, but may be unidirectional or bidirectional. Notches are flakes with one or two contiguous notches along the edge of the piece, while denticulates are flakes with three or more contiguous notches along the edge of the piece (GEEM 1975). Perforators and gravers are flakes with retouched projections. Gravers exhibit a blunt end and perforators a pointed end. Burins are flakes that have had a portion of their edge removed (Crabtree 1972:48). Figure 5. Informal tools; retouched flake, notch, denticulate, and perforator.

Figure 6. Formal tools; Uniface, scraper, and biface (upper). Biface, drill, and projectile point (lower). Unifaces are artifacts that exhibit retouch scars over one-third or more of only one of their surfaces. This type of retouch can be defined as invasive. Unifaces exhibit initial edge retouch that lack a formal overall shape. In contrast, scrapers are specialized forms of unifaces that exhibit secondary edge retouch producing a formal shaped tool with an edge angle between 60 to 80°. Bifaces are artifacts that exhibit retouch scars extending over one-third or more of both of their surfaces (Chapman and Schutt 1977:93). Generalized bifaces tend to be ovate or lanceolate in shape, with edge angles between about 30 to 50°. Drills and projectile points are specialized forms of bifaces. Drills are bifacially retouched flakes that are twice as long as they are wide, about as thick as they are wide and often exhibit a diamond-shaped cross-section. Projectile points are bifaces that exhibit hafting modifications that distinguish a stem from the blade. Tabular knives are thin, tabular pieces of stone of varying sizes, with one or more edges that exhibit marginal retouch and/or use-wear. In some instances, the tabular material fractures to a naturally sharp edge, while others are flaked to the desired sharpness

(Adams 2002:189) (Figure 7). These tools are commonly referred to as “agave knives.” They differ from marginally retouched flakes which are manufactured on flake blanks. 7. 9 1'o 44 6 aD ee PR APPD ITC e AV® STB 4 . : 11 7. 15 16 «47 18 «19 : 41.22 23 24 25 .26 27 28 Figure 7. Tabular Knife Ground Stone Tools Ground stone tools are artifacts that exhibit ground and/or abraded surfaces. Manos are cobbles or slabs with at least one surface characterized by one or more smooth facets produced through grinding (Figure 8). They were handheld artifacts that were primarily used to crush and grind vegetal foodstuffs against a metate (Chapman and Schutt 1977:95; Christenson 1987:44). Polished surfaces on manos may indicate a function other than vegetal processing (e.g., hide processing [Adams 1988]). One-hand manos are less than 170 mm in width and two-hand manos _ have a width equal to or greater than 170 mm. Undetermined manos are fragments where the projected length of the artifact could not be determined.

Figure 8. One- and two-hand manos. Metates are characterized by at least one large grinding surface upon which vegetal foodstuffs may have been crushed and ground with a mano (Figures 9 and 10). They generally have a grinding surface greater than 450 cm? in size (Christenson 1987:47). Milling stones are informal unmodified slabs with flat grinding surfaces. Although the grinding surface may exhibit some pecking, the slab itself exhibits little in the way of formal shaping (NOTE: California analysts use slab metate and not millingstone). Basin metates are slabs with concave basin-shaped grinding surfaces. These two metate types are usually associated with generalized seed processing and the use of a one-hand mano in a rotary motion, although millingstones can also be used with two-hand manos in a longitudinal grinding fashion. Slab (or flat) metates are formal rectangular-shaped metates with large, flat prepared grinding surfaces (see previous comment for millingstone). Trough metates have a deep prepared trough as a grinding surface. The trough may be open at one or both ends and may exhibit a surrounding shelf. These two metate types are usually associated with more specialized corn milling and the use of two-hand manos in a longitudinal back and forth motion. If the type of metate could not be determined, it was classified as an undetermined metate fragment. Grinding slabs (or lapstones) were, however,

distinguished from millingstones by having a length less than 250 mm. These artifacts may have been used for a variety of purposes. Grinding slab fragments were separated from undermined ground stone fragments by having a length greater than 100 mm. Undetermined metates are fragments sufficiently large to determine that they represent portions of metates, but specific metate type could be determined. =. Figure 9. Milling stone, basin metate, and trough metate. Polishing stones are pebbles with finely ground and polished surfaces (Figure 11). These generally consist of small quartzite pebbles that could have been used to polish ceramic vessels. Palettes are tabular-shaped artifacts with finely ground and polished flat surfaces (Figure 8). Mortars are artifacts with large, deep, pecked, and ground concavities. Pestles are oblong artifacts with one or more ground ends. They presumably were used with the mortars to pulverize and grind various substances. Abrading stones are artifacts with localized but irregularly ground surfaces, with a distinction made between generalized abrading stones and grooved abraders (Figure 11). Axes exhibit a prepared bit (flaked or ground), whereas, mau/s exhibit battering on one or both butts (Figure 12). Either can be grooved for hafting (full or partial). In contrast, hoes exhibit an unprepared bit that often exhibits rounding and striations and hafting notches.

Figure 10. Slab metate (right) with two-hand mano (left) Ornaments are beads, pendants, and other forms of jewelry. Effigies are anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figurines. Stone ceramic lids are thin circular-shaped artifacts whose perimeters have been bidirectionally retouched. These lids may have been used to cover storage or cooking vessels. Shaped slabs are large rectangular-shaped slabs (or fragments) that have been bidirectionally flaked along their perimeters. These artifacts were often used to cover ventilator shafts or door openings. The miscellaneous ground stone category was used when the artifact could not be placed within any of the defined types, but was a recognizable artifact. In contrast, undetermined ground stone are unclassifiable ground stone fragments. These fragments often exhibit a single flat grinding surface.

RECORDED ATTRIBUTES Cores and Core Tools Material type and material grain were recorded for all of the artifacts. Fine-grained (glassy) materials were glossy and translucent. Medium-grained (glossy) materials exhibited a smooth surface, had a dull to glossy luster, and were aphanitic. Coarse- grained (coarse) materials were grainy to the touch, dull in luster, and porphyritic. Artifact condition was recorded as whole or fragmentary. Length for cores and cobble unifaces was measured in millimeters along the axis, through the major flaking surface. Width was measured perpendicular to the length, and the remaining dimension was measured as thickness. By contrast, the length of hammerstones was measured in millimeters along the longest axis, the width was measured perpendicular to the length, and thickness was the smallest dimension of the artifact. Each artifact was weighed to the nearest tenth of a gram with an Ohaus digital scale. Weight was the only measurement recorded for core fragments. Several core types, based on platform orientation and core shape, were recorded. Tthe core types included unidirectional, bidirectional, multidirectional, bipolar, flake cores, and core fragments. In addition, these core types were subdivided into specific subtypes. The unidirectional-core subtypes included single-face, multiface, prismatic, and pyramidal cores with flakes removed from a single striking platform. Bidirectional-core subtypes included change-of-orientation, discoidal, bifacial, opposed-same-face, opposed-different-face, and 90° cores with flakes removed from two separate striking platforms. In the case of the change-of-orientation cores, flakes were removed from separate platforms at oblique angles to each other. Multidirectional-core subtypes included globular, opposed/90°, and opposed-same-/different-face cores with flakes removed from three or more platforms. Bipolar cores exhibited battering, crushing, and/or negative or positive bulbs of percussion at one or both opposing ends. Flake cores included same-face and multiface cores. Core fragments were broken cores. Platform type and the number of platforms were recorded for cores. The number of platforms was coded as zero for noncores and core fragments. Bipolar cores were arbitrarily assigned a single platform each. Platform types were cortical, single faceted, multifaceted, cortical/single faceted, and undetermined/not applicable (i.e., core fragments and noncores). Cortex type was recorded as nodular, tabular, waterworn, or undetermined. Nodular or tabular cortex is the natural, weathered surface of a nodule or tabular-shaped rock. Waterworn cortex is the rolled surface created through water transport of a rock. The percentage of the cortical or unflaked surface was measured for whole artifacts as 0 percent, 1-49 percent, 50-99 percent, 100 percent, and undetermined fragments. The reason for discard was recorded for cores and cobble unifaces, including broken (material flaw), broken (culturally induced fracture), extensive hinging/stepping, exhausted, still usable, extensive battering, burned, undetermined, and not applicable (e.g., hammerstones). The presence or absence of burning also was recorded. Burning was represented by the presence of discoloration, pot lids, and/or crackling.

The number of damaged loci also was recorded. This damage refers to possible use wear and not to platform preparation. Each damaged locus was given a sequential number for each artifact. The type of damage was recorded as battering, rounding, scarring, or abrasion/ground. Battering is the pounding application of force to a specific locus when one object is struck against another. This action can produce conical impact rings (Hertzian cones) on a natural surface or bidirectional step fracturing and the deterioration of an edge margin. Rounding is the damage that results in the rounding of an edge margin and scarring from the removal of microflakes along an edge margin. Abrasion/ground is the presence of any abraded or ground surface on an artifact. Only damage that was obviously visible or could be identified with a 10x hand lens was recorded. The location of the damage was recorded as being on an edge, convex surface, ridge, flat surface, flake-scar ridge, or all over the artifact. An edge is the intersection of one or more negative flake-scar facets; edge damage is associated with an artifact having been used as a chopper or pecking stone. A convex surface is a nonacute, natural, convex surface of an object; damage in this location reflects use as a hammerstone. A ridge is an acute, naturally sharp surface; the damage on a ridge reflects use as an angular hammerstone. Flat is a naturally flat surface; damage on this surface reflects use as a hammerstone or anvil. Flake-scar ridges (arrises) are the high points along the edges of a negative flake scar; sometimes these areas are ground (e.g., on cobble unifaces), indicating that the tool may have been used as a plane or adze. Damage over the entire surface of an artifact presumably reflects multifunctional uses (e.g., a heavily battered hammerstone or pecking stone). Debitage Material type and material grain were recorded for each piece. The condition of each artifact was recorded as whole, proximal (broken), midsection (broken), distal (broken), lateral (broken), or undetermined (i.e., flakes smaller than 10 mm). All pieces of angular debris were considered whole. Measurements were taken on all whole flakes. Length was defined as the distance along the proximal-distal axis of a flake (i.e., perpendicular to the platform) and was measured in millimeters using a sliding digital caliper. Weight was recorded to the nearest tenth of a gram for all debitage items. The type of platform was recorded for all flakes as absent, cortical, single-faceted, dihedral, multifaceted, crushed/collapsed, and not applicable (for angular debris and microdebitage). A cortical platform is unprepared and situated on cortex. A single- faceted platform consists of a single flake scar. A dihedral platform consists of two flake scars, and a multifaceted platform consists of three or more flake scars. A crushed platform is one in which the proximal end of the flake is covered with step fractures, indicative of crushing along the edge of the core platform. A collapsed platform is identified on whole flakes that lack a clear platform and any traces of crushing. A battered platform is a cortical platform that is covered with battering and impact marks, which may be indicative of a hammerstone spall. Platform preparation was documented for all flakes as abraded or retouched.

Cortex type was recorded using the same attributes as for the cores. It was recorded as absent, on the platform only, on the dorsal surface only, on the platform and partially on the dorsal surface, or on the platform and/or totally covering the dorsal surface. The presence or absence of burning also was recorded. The presence or absence of edge damage was recorded, as a possible indication of artifact use. A hand lens was used to determine the presence of flake utilization, with possible damage being recorded if it was consistent along the edge margin (e.g., scarring, rounding, or polishing). If present, the total number of modified edges was noted. The location with edge damage was recorded as end, lateral, projection, and dorsal (e.g., a ground stone flake), and edge outline was recorded as straight, concave, convex, straight/concave, straight/convex, concave/convex, projection (e.g., a graver or perforator), or flat (e.g., an abraded/ground surface). Lastly, the edge angle of all damaged edges was recorded to the nearest 5°. This measurement is equivalent to the “spine plane angle” (Tringham et al. 1974:178), which measures the intersection of the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the edge. If the angle varied along the edge, a mean edge angle or the angle that characterized most of the edge was recorded. A “shuriken” edge- angle template was used for this analysis. It consists of a circular disk template with angles cut into its side at 5° increments, from 20° to 90°. The edge to be measured is placed within the notches until the angle that fits most accurately is determined. Retouched Tools Material type, material grain, condition, cortex type, and burning were recorded for retouched tools, using the same attributes as those recorded for the debitage. Measurements were taken in millimeters for whole tools. Length was measured along the proximal-distal axis. Width was measured at a 90° angle to the proximal-distal axis. Thickness was the greatest measurement once the proximal-distal axis was rotated 90°. The proximal end is the same as that defined for flakes on informal retouched tools and the possible hafted end on formal tools (e.g., bifaces, projectile points, and scrapers). Weight was measured to the nearest tenth of a gram. Tool fragments were only weighed. Artifact type including biface stage, informal flake tools, scrapers and projectile points are recorded. Biface stage is subdivided into early stage (2a) with edge angles between 55-75° and width/thickness ratios of 2.00 or more, middle stage (3a) with edge angles between 40-60° and width/thickness ratios of 3.00-4.00 and late stage (4a) with edge angles between 25-45° and width/thickness ratios in excess of 4.00 (Callahan 1979). Biface shape (plan view) and projectile (haft) type were recorded as lanceolate, foliate circular, ovate, triangular, irregular, stemmed, contracting stemmed, corner-notched, side-notched, side-notched with basal notch, indeterminate and not applicable (i.e., not a biface or projectile point). Edge morphology was recorded for bifaces and projectile points as continuous or serrate, and reworking of the blade and/or base were monitored for bifaces and projectile points.

The number of separate retouched edges was recorded for each tool. Each edge was given a sequential number. Only one edge was recorded for any tool exhibiting a continuously retouched edge (e.g., bifaces, projectile points, drills, and scrapers). It is the marginally retouched pieces that most often exhibit separate retouched edges. Edge outline was recorded as straight, concave, convex, straight/concave, straight/convex, concave/convex (e.g., a denticulate or double-notch), projection (e.g., a graver or perforator), flat (e.g., an abraded or ground surface), or undetermined (e.g., a fragment). Edge outline and edge angles were measured, as was each edge of a retouched piece, along the blade of a biface or projectile point and along retouched edges of scrapers. Edge angles were measured the same as for utilized debitage. Information specific to projectile points was recorded for functional type (dart or arrow), blade shape, stem shape, base edge shape, basal thinning, basal grinding, the presence/absence of beveling and the presence/absence of a ventral flake scar (see Appendix A). Additional metrics were recorded in mm for blade length, stem length, neck width, basal width and basal indentation depth. Overall length and blade (max) width were previously recorded. All measurements are to 0.00 mm for projectile points. Ground Stone Tools Material type and condition were recorded using the same methods as for cores. Measurements were recorded in millimeters for all whole artifacts. Length was the greatest measurement parallel to the direction of use-surface axis of the artifact. Width was the greatest measurement perpendicular to the use-surface axis. Thickness was the greatest measurement on a 90° plane to the length and width. Weight was recorded in grams. Ground stone fragments were only weighed. In addition to these measurements, the maximum length and width of the primary grinding surface were also recorded for manos and metates. Surface modification was recorded as flaking, grinding only, pecking only (blank), pecking and grinding, indeterminate and none. Ground stone manufacturing investment was recorded as minimally altered if the item had been pecked only on the grinding surface, shaped if the item had been flaked and/or pecked on less than half of its entire form, well-shaped if the item was flaked and/or pecked on half or more its form, and completing shaped if the item exhibits evidence of production over all or nearly all of its form. The number of use faces was recorded for the ground stone artifacts. A tool cross section was recorded for manos with single or double grinding surfaces as plano (flat), concave, convex, biplano, plano-convex, biconvex, wedge-shaped (beveled), other (i.e., tools without grinding surfaces), or undetermined. The surface latitudinal cross section was recorded for metates as concave, convex, flat, U groove, V groove, or undetermined. Surface shape provides a general description of the primary grinding-surface shape and was recorded as roughly ovoid, rectangular, irregular, or other.

Mano blank type was recorded as cobble, tabular, shaped and indeterminate. The presence of mano finger holds and trough metate wear was recorded as present or absent. Multiple use for recycled items was recorded as none or multiple use. Stroke direction was recorded as reciprocal-flat, reciprocal-rocking, circular (indeterminate) and indeterminate. Use wear on ground stone that was not associated with grinding was recorded as absent, battering (e.g., mauls or manos used as hammerstones), or flaked/rounded (e.g., axes). Evidence for the presence or absence of burning (heating) also was recorded (e.g., blackened or fire-cracked).
