ABSTRACT This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES), for the proposed Tenmile Creek 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project located in Dallas County, Texas. Approximately 4.2 miles (mi; 35 acres ([ac]) of corridor alignments for the installation of a sanitary sewer relief interceptor pipeline were surveyed for the proposed project. Impacts to waters of the United States, associated with the installation of the pipeline, will require compliance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Subsequently, impacts to cultural resources must be considered as part of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106 process. Furthermore, as the Trinity River Authority is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The goal of this survey was to locate cultural resources that could be adversely affected by the proposed project, and to provide an evaluation of the eligibility potential of each identified resource for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). All work conformed to 13 Texas Administrative Code 26 (13 TAC 26), which outlines the regulations for implementing the ACT, and was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 9374. During the survey, three newly recorded prehistoric archeological sites (41DL563, 41DL564, and 41DL565), one newly recorded historic-age archeological site (41DL566), and two previously recorded archeological sites (41DL229 and 41DL360) were documented within the survey area. There is the potential for significant, deeply-buried prehistoric archeological deposits to be present at 41DL563, 41DL564, and 41DL565 along the Option 1 and Option 3 alignments. Option 2 is recommended as the preferred alignment, and therefore the Area of Potential Effects (APE), for the Tenmile Creek 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline. The portions of sites 41DL229, 41DL360, and 41DL566 within the APE are recommended to be not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as SALs. Provided the TRA selects the Option 2 reroute alignment, no further cultural resources investigations are recommended. If Option 2 reroute alignment is not selected, additional coordination with the THC will be required prior to project construction. If any cultural resources are encountered during construction, the operators should stop construction activities in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and immediately contact the project cultural resources consultant to initiate coordination with the Texas Historical Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to resuming construction activities. All project-related records and field data will be temporarily stored at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the Center for Archeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY This cultural resources survey was conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES), under contract to Teague, Nall, and Perkins, Inc., on behalf of the Trinity River Authority (TRA) for the proposed Tenmile Creek 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project. The project area is located south of Wilmer in southern Dallas County, Texas. Approximately 4.2 miles (mi; 35 acres ([ac]) of corridor alignments for the installation of a sanitary sewer relief interceptor pipeline were surveyed for the proposed project. The original proposed pipeline alignment (Option 1; 2.11 mi; 14.42 ac) extended approximately 0.9 mi from the terminus of Watermill Road to generally parallel Tenmile Creek and terminated at an existing utility access point approximately 0.38 mi west of Interstate Highway (IH) 45. Two alternative alignments (Options 2 and 3) were surveyed to identify a viable alignment due to the documentation of two potentially significant prehistoric archeological sites (41DL563 and 41DL564) along the original Option 1 proposed alignment. The proposed Option 2 reroute (0.75 mi; 6.43 ac) extended east from the original Option 1 alignment south of Lavender Road to avoid site 41DL563 and continued east along Lavender Road where it extended south to parallel Tenmile Creek and avoid 41DL564. The Option 3 reroute (0.45 mi; 8.92 ac) continued along Lavender Road from Option 2 and then extended south to connect to the remaining portion of the Option 1 route that paralleled Tenmile Creek. Impacts to waters of the United States, tied to the installation of the pipeline will require compliance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Subsequently, this requires that impacts to cultural resources be considered as part of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106 process. Additionally, as the TRA is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The goal of this survey was to locate cultural resources that could be adversely affected by the proposed project, and to provide an evaluation of the eligibility potential of each identified resource for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). This cultural resources survey was conducted by Principal Investigator Jamie Vandagriff, Senior Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster, Project Archeologist Anne Gibson, Archeological Field Technicians Trey Lyon and Will Clow, and Equipment Operator Cody Wiggins on 10 April, 15 through 17 April, and 17 through 19 June 2020. All work conformed to 13 Texas Administrative Code 26 (13 TAC 26), which outlines the regulations for implementing the ACT, and was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 9374. During the survey, three newly recorded prehistoric archeological sites (41DL563, 41DL564, and 41DL565), one newly recorded historic-age archeological site (41DL566), and two previously recorded archeological sites (41DL229 and 41DL360) were documented. Sites 41DL360, 41DL563, and 41DL564 were identified within the original Option 1 alignment. Due to the potential for significant prehistoric archeological deposits to be present at sites 41DL563 and 41DL564, the NRHP eligibility for these sites remains undetermined. Subsequently, Option 2 and Option 3 reroute alignments were surveyed. Within the Option 2 reroute alignment, previously recorded prehistoric site 41DL229 was revisited and delineated. Within the Option 3 reroute alignment, in addition to site 41DL229, sites 41DL565 and 41DL566 were documented. Due to the potential for significant deeply-buried prehistoric archeological deposits to be present at 41DL565, the NRHP eligibility for this site remains undetermined. Subsequently, Option 2 is recommended as the preferred alignment, and therefore the Area of Potential Effects (APE), for the Tenmile Creek 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline. The portions of sites 41DL229, 41DL360, and 41DL566 within the APE are recommended to be not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as SALs.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES), under contract to Teague Nall and Perkins, Inc. (TNP), on behalf of the Trinity River Authority (TRA) for the proposed Tenmile Creek 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements project. The purpose of these investigations was to conduct an inventory of cultural resources (as defined by Code of Federal Regulations, Title 36, Section 800.4 [36 CFR 800.4]) present within the proposed project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE). Additionally, the project aimed to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended, or for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT; Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191 [9 TNRC 191]) and associated state regulations (Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26 [13 TAC 26]). The goal of this survey was to locate, identify, and assess archeological sites, buildings, structures, or other cultural resources within the proposed survey area that may be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as SALs. This investigation was conducted in accordance with 36 CFR 60.4 and 13 TAC 26, which outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively. Prepared in accordance with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA 1992) guidelines, this report satisfies the NHPA Section 106 and the ACT requirements of the proposed project. A description of the proposed project area, pertinent regulations, environmental and historical contexts, field and analytical methods, results of the investigations, and recommendations regarding the identified cultural resources are provided in this document. 1.1 Reporting Conventions Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in imperial units (e.g., inch [in], foot [ft], mi, acre [ac]) within this report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in metric units (e.g., centimeter [cm], meter [m], kilometer [km], hectare [ha]), unless historic-period artifact or architectural elements are more appropriately recorded in imperial units. 1.2 Regulatory Framework 1.2.1 Antiquities Code of Texas As the TRA is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, it is required to comply with the ACT. The ACT was passed in 1969 and requires that Texas Historical Commission (THC) staff review actions that have the potential to disturb historic and archeological sites on public land. While advance project review and coordination with the THC is required for undertakings with more than 5 ac or 5,000 cubic yards of ground disturbance, the THC can still request project information and/or an archeological survey in advance of ground disturbances since all publicly sponsored projects must comply with the ACT. However, if the activity occurs inside a designated historic district, affects a recorded archeological site, or requires on-site investigations the project will need to be reviewed by the THC, regardless of project size. 1.2.1 National Historic Preservation Act The NHPA, specifically Section 106 of the NHPA (54 U.S. Code [USC] 306108), requires the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), an official appointed in each state or territory, to administer and coordinate historic preservation activities, and to review and comment on all actions licensed by the federal government that will have an effect on properties listed in the NRHP, or eligible for such listing. Federal actions include, but are not limited to, construction, rehabilitation, repair projects, demolition, licenses, permits, loans, loan guarantees, grants, and federal property transfers. As the project will require compliance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act under a Nationwide Permit administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), it is subject to the provisions of the NHPA, as amended. 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 1

1.3 Area of Potential Effects 1.3.1 Direct APE Approximately 4.2 miles (mi; 35 acres ([ac]) of corridor alignments for the installation of a sanitary sewer relief interceptor pipeline were surveyed for the proposed project (Figure 1.1). The original proposed pipeline alignment (Option 1; 2.11 mi; 14.42 ac) extended approximately 0.9 mi from the terminus of Watermill Road to generally parallel Tenmile Creek and terminated at an existing utility access point approximately 0.38 mi west of Interstate Highway (IH) 45. Two alternative alignments (Options 2 and 3) were surveyed to identify a viable alignment due to the documentation of two potentially significant prehistoric archeological sites (41DL563 and 41DL564) along the original Option 1 alignment proposed for the project. The proposed Option 2 reroute (0.75 mi; 6.43 ac) extended east from the original Option 1 alignment south of Lavender Road to avoid 41DL563 and continued east along Lavender Road where it extended south to parallel Tenmile Creek and avoid 41DL564. The Option 3 reroute (0.45 mi; 8.92 ac) continued along Lavender Road from Option 2 and then extended south to connect to the remaining portion of the Option 1 route that paralleled Tenmile Creek. Option 2 is recommended as the preferred alignment, and therefore the Area of Potential Effects (APE) for this project. In general, a 100-ft-wide corridor was surveyed for the proposed project to accommodate the new permanent utility easement and temporary construction workspace. The proposed Tenmile Creek 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor will be installed at a depth of approximately 15 ft. 1.3.2 Indirect APE If the proposed project requires federal permitting from the USACE, an assessment of indirect effects will be required within USACE jurisdiction to satisfy Section 106 of the NHPA requirements. Indirect impacts were not be formally evaluated for this project due to the negligible potential for adverse indirect effects to above ground historic-age cultural resources for this type of construction, as most elements will be at or below grade. 1.4 Administrative Information Sponsor: TRA Review Agency: THC; USACE Principal Investigator: Jamie Vandagriff, MA, RPA Survey Crew Members: Jamie Vandagriff, Christopher Goodmaster (Senior Archeologist), Anne Gibson (Project Archeologist), Trey Lyon (Archeological Field Technician), and Will Clow (Archeological Field Technician) IES Project Number: 04.080.064 Days of Field Work: 10 April 2020, 15 through 17 April 2020, 17 through 19 June 2020 Area Surveyed: 35 ac Resources Recommended Eligible for NRHP Under 36 CFR 60.4: None Resources Recommended Not Eligible for NRHP Under 36 CFR 60.4: 41DL229, 41DL360, and 41DL566 Resources Undetermined for NRHP Eligibility: 41DL563, 41DL564, and 41DL565 Resources Recommended Eligible for SAL Under 13 TAC 26: None Resources Recommended Not Eligible for SAL Under 13 TAC 26: 41DL229, 41DL360, and 41DL566 Resources Undetermined for SAL Designation: 41DL563, 41DL564, and 41DL565 Curation Facility: No artifacts were collected.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND 2.1 Environmental Setting 2.1.1 Climate Dallas County lies in the north-central part of the State of Texas. Annual precipitation averages between approximately 35 to 42 in. About half of the precipitation usually falls as rain between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of the year. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year-round temperature with the occasional exceedingly hot and cold periods (Estaville and Earl 2008). 2.1.2 Topography, Geology, and Soils The Ferris 7.5-minute USGS topographic quadrangle map illustrates that the project area is primarily located within the Tenmile Creek floodplain (Figure 2.1). The westernmost portion of the area occupies a relatively narrow section of the valley. As the project area extends to the east, the valley gradually widens and the floodplain becomes broader, particularly north of the Tenmile Creek channel. In the central portion of the project area, the pipeline alignment crosses an unnamed tributary of Tenmile Creek. Tenmile Creek joins with the Trinity River approximately 5.73 mi to the east. The survey area lies within the Northern Blackland Prairie in the Texas Blackland Prairies ecoregion. This area is distinguished from surrounding regions by the gently rolling hills and fine-textured, black clay soils and prairie vegetation (Griffith et al. 2004). Most of the native prairie has been converted to cropland, non-native pasture, and expanding urban uses. Historical vegetation included little bluestem, big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, and tall dropseed. Vertisols dominate the Blackland Prairie ecoregion and consist of high clay content soils that have significant shrink and swell potential. The survey area is underlain by the Cretaceous-age Austin Chalk (Kau) and Ozan (Ko) formations and is mantled by Quaternary-age alluvium deposits (Qal) along the floodplain of Tenmile Creek (Figure 2.2). The Austin Chalk Formation is characterized by massive chalky limestone deposits with thin marl interbeds that has weathered upwards forming the deep vertisols that mantle the Blackland Prairie region. The Ozan Formation is comprised of sandy, chalky, or glauconitic marl. Alluvium deposits are primarily comprised of sand, silt, clay, and gravel (McGowen et al. 1991; USGS 2020). As shown by the Soil Survey of Dallas County, Texas, there are eight soil map units within the survey area (Coffee et al. 1980; Figure 2.3; Table 2.1). Approximately 96.3 percent of the soils within the project area pertain to the occasionally and frequently flooded alluvial soils of the Tenmile Creek floodplain. The remaining 3.7 percent of the survey area contains soils typical of upland settings within the Northern Blackland Prairies region. Soil data was viewed from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Web Soil Survey 2020). 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 5

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND 3.1 Previous Investigations A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and the Texas Historic Sites Atlas (THSA), maintained by the THC, indicated there are no previously recorded historical markers or cemeteries within the survey area (TASA 2020; THSA 2020). The TASA database identified one previously conducted archeological survey for the existing paralleling pipeline, which overlaps a portion of the survey area (TASA 2020; Table 3.1; Figure 3.1). That survey, conducted in 1982 by the Texas Department of Water Resources (TDWR; now the Texas Water Development Board [TWDB]), consisted of a reconnaissance survey performed by TDWR personnel (Fox 1982). Prehistoric archeological site 41DL229 was recorded based on information provided by a local landowner during that survey. In addition, the TASA indicated four previously conducted archeological surveys and four previously recorded archeological sites located within 1 mi of the survey area (TASA 2020; Tables 3.1 and 3.2). TASA records depict that site 41DL229 is located within the Option 2 reroute alignment. The site was recorded as a prehistoric site located on a terrace of the Tenmile Creek floodplain. The site was reported to TWDB cultural resources survey staff as a popular “arrowhead collecting” location at the time of the initial recording of the site. Since 1981, a portion of the area was developed to include a residential dwelling and several associated outbuildings.

These resources included soil survey data (Coffee et al. 1980; NRCS 2020), geologic data (McGowen et al. 1987), the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM), the 1936 State Highway Map for Dallas County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, and historic and modern aerial photography and satellite imagery. 3.2.1 Disturbance Analysis During the background review, it was determined that the survey area was primarily used for agricultural or ranching purposes as early as the 1920s, and presumably since the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to historical maps, Ferris Road, Watermill Road, and several unnamed rural roads were present by 1920. Additionally, the Texas Electric Railway crossed the eastern terminus of the project area at that time. Based on historical aerial photographs, by the 1950s, the majority of the survey area had been cleared of woody vegetation, which has been covered by secondary growth near major creeks and streams. The most significant ground disturbances within the project area occurred when the existing utilities were constructed, which included transmission lines and pipelines. 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 11

3.2.2 Prehistoric Archeological Resources Potential The TxDOT PALM for Dallas County indicates that nearly the entire survey area features a high potential for containing shallow and deeply-buried cultural resources within areas that have retained a reasonable context. The TxDOT PALM examines “the character and classification of the soils and assesses the shallow and deep geoarcheological potential or the likelihood that soils could contain buried cultural materials in reasonable context (i.e., historic/recent disturbances, landscape setting, and soils data) for each soil series” (Abbott 2011:161). The TxDOT PALM model identifies where sites are likely to be preserved in a reasonable context versus indicating where sites are likely to exist (Abbott 2001:154, 2011:179). “The resolution of the PALM is appropriate to the scale of landform mapping (1:24,000)” (Abbott 2011:175). Any analysis of the data beyond the scale of mapping can result in a misunderstanding of the detail of mapping (Abbott 2011). Due to the more detailed evaluation required to accurately evaluate cultural resources potential for field methodology development (typically 1:7,000 or less), the cultural resources potential evaluation, presented in this scope, includes an assessment of the PALM results at a more detailed level to determine if the APE has retained a reasonable degree of contextual integrity, as assumed by the PALM model. A reasonable context is evaluated through a review of historical and modern aerial photographs to evaluate the level of previous ground disturbance that has transpired within a given area. The field methods for assessing the presence of archeological sites is presented in this scope of work. A small portion of the survey area features a moderate potential. As previously discussed, significant ground- disturbing activities have transpired within localized portions of the survey due to construction of the existing sewer pipeline, an overhead electric transmission line corridor, and previous land use. However, areas outside of these locations were determined to have retained a high to moderate potential for encountering prehistoric cultural materials in both shallow subsurface and deeply-buried contexts. 3.2.3 Historic Period Resources Potential Historic-period resources within North-Central Texas are primarily related to farmsteads, houses, and associated outbuildings and structures that date from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. Typically, these types of resources are located along old roadways, but can be located along railroads, streams, and open pastures. Although, determining the presence of the earliest of these buildings and structures is problematic, maps depicting the locations of these features are available post-1900. A review of historical maps and aerial photographs indicate that a small farmstead was located near the Option 2 and Option 3 reroute alignment during the early 20th century. In addition, the Texas Electric Railway, also known and the Interurban Railway, extended across the easternmost portion of the APE. 3.3 Prehistoric Cultural Context Given the size of the region and the depth and breadth of cultural complexity that has developed in the area, this section must necessarily be limited in scope. Although the chronological framework for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed, the available data allow a generalized prehistoric cultural chronology. Current conceptions of the prehistoric cultural chronology of North-Central Texas, particularly within the upper Trinity River basin (Table 1), are largely based on four major reports by Peter and McGregor (1988), Prikryl (1987, 1990), and Yates and Ferring (1986) (Table 3.3). References are provided to supplement the information summarized here. Table 3.3: Generalized Native American Cultural Chronology for North-Central Texas* Period Date Ranges (B.C. /A.D.)

3.3.1 Paleoindian Period The Paleoindian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or stratigraphically mixed contexts (Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995). The Field Ranch site (41CO10), along the upper Elm Fork Trinity River, is a prime example of a typical Paleoindian site context (Jensen 1968). Projectile point types found in North-Central Texas that can be associated with the early through late parts of the Paleoindian period include Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Plainview, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff. Clovis and Plainview style projectile points, temporally and culturally diagnostic artifacts of the Paleoindian period, have been recovered along both Denton Creek and Clear Creek in the Cross Timbers. Based on a sample of projectile points from surface sites, Prikryl (1990) has concluded that among the most common Paleoindian point types in North-Central Texas are Plainview and Dalton. Interestingly, the only two investigated sites in North-Central Texas with apparently discrete Paleoindian components, the Lewisville Lake (41DN72) and Aubrey (41DN479) sites, indicate occupation early in the Paleoindian period, both producing Clovis projectile points. Ferring and Yates (1997) suggest that these types date to approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years before present (B.P.), based on cross dating with sites in other regions. The suggested age for these projectile point types may correspond with the onset of early Holocene alluviation in the local river valleys, including the Trinity and Sabine River basins. The majority of the recorded Paleoindian sites cluster in the upper Trinity River drainage, where the most intensive archeological investigations have taken place, although these sites often consist of no more than one or two projectile points. The generally low frequency of Paleoindian sites and artifacts, coupled with the tendency for projectile points to be made from nonlocal lithic raw materials, have led investigators to characterize these populations as highly mobile, with low regional population densities (Lynott 1981:100–101). Knowledge about the settlement-subsistence strategies used by these earliest occupants of the North-Central Texas region is extremely limited. Early research indicated that the Paleoindian lifestyle was dependent on the hunting of Late Pleistocene megafauna species, including mammoth, mastodon, bison, camel, and horse. However, more recent investigations at the Aubrey site in Denton County has indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on big game animals alone; rather, the entire range of prairie and forest species was used (Ferring 2001). The preponderance of small game at the Aubrey site could be interpreted as representing a more generalized pattern of foraging than the reliance on mammoth and bison apparently demonstrated at other Paleoindian sites on the Southern Plains (Hofman 1989a:31–32). Such a divergence in subsistence patterns may reflect an inherent adaptability of Paleoindian technology to changing environmental conditions encountered as early populations spread southeastward into Texas (Ferring and Yates 1997). Whether this pattern of a more generalized foraging subsistence system is characteristic of Paleoindian adaptations in the Eastern Woodlands and the focus on now extinct, big game species is more characteristic of a Plains adaptation remains to be documented. There are no reported excavations of stratified Paleoindian components on the central Blackland Prairie itself. Nonetheless, a variety of early projectile point styles have been found, largely in surface contexts, and it is clear that this part of Texas was used throughout the period from ca. 9,500 to 7,000 B.C. Presumably, this use was by hunter-gatherer groups with low population densities and high residential mobility. The Lewisville Lake site contained 27 hearth features with an associated Clovis point but few other lithic artifacts (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958; Story 1990:182–184). Although the original radiocarbon dates of the hearths suggested an anomalously early age for Paleoindian occupation (ca. 37,000 years B.P.; Crook and Harris 1956), later work by the Smithsonian Institution (Shiley et al. 1985; Stanford 1981) appears to have resolved the controversy concerning the date of the occupation there. Apparently, the presence of naturally occurring lignite in these hearths, either as a fuel or as an inadvertent inclusion, contaminated the radiocarbon samples (Shiley et al. 1985). Consequently, the generally-accepted age of 10,000 to 12,000 years B.P. (ca. 8,000 B.C. to 10,000 B.C.) for early Paleoindian period occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human inhabitants of North-Central Texas. The deeply- buried Aubrey site, located on the Elm Fork Trinity River in Denton County, yielded lithic debitage and Clovis points buried beneath 8 m (26 ft) of Holocene alluvium on the Elm Fork Trinity River floodplain (Ferring 2001). The discovery of this site suggests that well-preserved Paleoindian sites in North-Central Texas will only be found by examining deeply-stratified Holocene alluvium in floodplain contexts. 3.3.2 Archaic Period In North-Central Texas, the Archaic period is generally dated to extend between ca. 7,000 B.C. and A.D. 700, with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions of the period tentatively identified (Prikryl 1993:199). Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from 7,000 to 4,000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4,000 to 2,000 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 2,000 B.C. to A.D. 700. Relatively recent overviews of the Archaic period in this portion of Texas include Hofman (1989a), Prikryl (1990), and Story (1985, 1990). Knowledge concerning the Archaic period in the upper Trinity River 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 14

drainage is limited by the lack of data from major excavations. This is particularly true for the Early and Middle Archaic periods. Mixing of archeological site components also has hampered interpretations regarding downstream Trinity River use by prehistoric peoples during the lengthy Archaic period. Because few isolable Archaic components have been excavated, a comprehensive understanding of artifact chronologies, subsistence practices, and settlement strategies is lacking. Previous investigations along the West Fork Trinity River (Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986) indicate that primary contexts for Early and Middle Archaic sites will be found deeply buried within floodplain alluvium. Diagnostic artifacts for the period are similar to those of adjacent regions, although developing a sound chronological sequence of diagnostic tool types has proven difficult because many of the investigations have focused on terrace surface manifestations where early artifacts are frequently mixed with later materials. Prikryl (1990) suggests that Early Archaic projectile points include early split-stemmed varieties and possibly Angostura, and Middle Archaic points include basal-notched forms such as Andice, Bell, and Calf Creek along with Bulverde, Carrollton, Dawson, and Wells. Some of this mixing and the generally low numbers of Early and Middle Archaic sites may be due to extensive erosion of mid-Holocene deposits, as has been documented for the Brazos River drainage west of the Dallas area in Young, Stephens, and Throckmorton counties (Ensor et al. 1992). The relatively intensive work at Richland-Chambers Reservoir suggests a similar conclusion for the western edge of the Post Oak Savanna at the eastern margin of the Blackland Prairie, although it has been noted that data pertaining to the Early to Middle Archaic subperiods may be scarce in part because sites dating to this interval lie deeply buried or were removed by extensive erosion during the mid-Holocene (Fields 1995; McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Late Archaic point types reportedly include Castroville, Dallas, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, Gary, Godley, Marshall, Palmillas, Trinity, and Yarbrough (Prikryl 1990). At one time, the Carrollton and Elam foci were used to define the Middle and Late Archaic, respectively (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954). The initial treatment of the Archaic period (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the Carrollton and Elam foci, was based upon materials from such terrace contexts. Reevaluation of the type-site artifacts; however, showed that the materials were so mixed that perpetuation of these foci provides little interpretive value (Hofman 1989a; Prikryl 1990). Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer recognized acceptable to describe North-Central Texas prehistoric chronology (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987; Yates and Ferring 1986). Though few isolable components have been analyzed for the various divisions of the Archaic period in North-Central Texas, slowly increasing populations responding to warmer and drier environmental conditions have been postulated to explain the overall archeological record of the period (Lynott 1981; Story 1990). It is thought that these factors may have led Archaic populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of North-Central Texas to develop a diversified hunting and gathering pattern based on bottomland resources of the rivers and major creeks; whereas, populations on the Southern Plains maintained a focus on bison hunting (Hofman 1989a). Projectile points of the period were fashioned from local lithic materials (typically quartzite), suggesting that populations were less mobile than were their Paleoindian predecessors. Less mobility also may suggest refinement of the diversified subsistence pattern to include scheduling of resource use within more restricted areas and repeated seasonal site occupation. Conversely, archeological sites dating to the Late Archaic period are relatively common across the Blackland Prairie. The Late Archaic represents the earliest time for which much is known about indigenous prehistoric lifeways. Both the Pecan Springs site (41EL11) at Bardwell Reservoir and the Strawn Creek site (41NV6) at Navarro Mills Reservoir yielded Late Archaic point types such as Gary, Dawson, and Yarbrough, although they tended to be mixed with materials from later occupations (Duffield 1963; Sorrow et al. 1966). The surface collections analyzed during the Superconducting Super Collider project also contained these types, as well as a number of Late Archaic types common in Central Texas—such as Bulverde, Darl, Ensor, Marcos, Marshall, Montell, and Pedernales—and a variety of probable Late Archaic forms more characteristic of the northern and eastern parts of the state such as Carrollton, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, and Kent (Yedlowski et al. 1998). Noting the relatively high frequency of Late Archaic projectile points, Yedlowski et al. (1998) suggest an increased regional use by hunter-gatherers as a result of increasingly moist climatic conditions, presumably associated with greater productivity in subsistence resources. They also note that, although the projectile point evidence indicates interaction with groups living in Central Texas proper, larger proportions of projectile points indicate affinities with East Texas than during the Early and Middle Archaic periods. Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997) indicate that the Late Archaic period is characterized by site assemblages left by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a locality for a limited time and then moved to another locality, supporting a resource-scheduling hypothesis. Deer and numerous small mammals were the primary food resources. Despite refinement of resource 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 15

utilization, evidence of dietary stress has been found on Late Archaic human skeletal materials (Ferring and Yates 1997; Gill-King 1987). Brown and his colleagues (1987:44-22–44-26) presents similar conclusions concerning an increase in occupational intensity and increased interaction for those project areas at the eastern edge of the region (i.e., Cedar Creek Reservoir in southeastern Kaufman County and Richland-Chambers Reservoir in southeastern Navarro County). Two of the three excavated sites at Cedar Creek Reservoir have strong Late Archaic components represented by numerous Gary points and a variety of other lithic tools (Story 1965), and at least 15 sites at Richland- Chambers Reservoir have identifiable components of this age. In addition to assemblages of projectile point styles (e.g., Dawson, Gary, Godley, Kent, and Yarbrough) that indicate ties to the regions to the north and east of the Blackland Prairie, rather than to the south and west, each of these areas has yielded information suggesting that ceramics may have been introduced into the material culture of local groups during the latest part of the Late Archaic, much as they were across most of East Texas (where this interval usually is termed the Early Ceramic or Woodland period). At Cedar Creek Reservoir, distributional data from the Lacy (41HE70) and Gossett Bottom (41KF7) sites suggest that the initial use of ceramic containers preceded introduction of the bow and arrow, although it is difficult to be certain because the sites were not well stratified and the ceramics could not be related to known early types such as Williams Plain (Story 1965). The most complete picture of the archeology of the Late Archaic for this region comes from the Post Oak Savanna at the eastern margin of the Blackland Prairie. Along Richland and Chambers creeks, Late Archaic groups appear to have been hunter-gatherers whose subsistence pursuits focused on wild plant foods such as hickory nuts and prairie turnips, and fauna such as deer, turtles, small mammals, birds, and fish (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Although presumably not sedentary, these groups clearly used the area in an intensive fashion for residential purposes, and it appears that populations increased while territory sizes decreased. At Richland- Chambers Reservoir, distinctive shell-tempered sherds were recovered from contexts dated between A.D. 200 and 700 at the Adams Ranch site (41NV177; Bruseth and Martin 1987), apparently representing the earliest ceramic industry in the upper Trinity River basin. The presence of large anthropogenic basins or depressions, often measuring approximately 16 m (52.5 ft) in diameter and 0.6 m (0.2 ft) in depth, associated with Late Archaic period sites suggests that important sociopolitical changes may have been occurring during this time period. These features were first identified at a series of sites along the East Fork Trinity River and were considered an important trait of the Wylie focus (Harris and Suhm 1963; Stephenson 1952; Wilson 1946). These were large, circular features that appear to have been used for communal processing of vegetal resources (and later as cemeteries), perhaps in the context of band aggregation in “tension zones” as territories decreased in size (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Radiocarbon assays from these features at the Upper Rockwall (41RW2) and Sister Grove Creek (41COL36) sites in the Lavon Lake area suggest that the pits and the Wylie focus were associated with the Late Prehistoric period (Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Lynott (1977) widened the temporal span by incorporating a Late Archaic phase into the focus definition. Subsequent work on “Wylie pit” features at Richland-Chambers Reservoir to the south confirmed their Late Archaic age (Bruseth and Martin 1987). Nonetheless, the wide range of associated artifact types and the long temporal span represented by the pits made it clear that the Wylie focus was not a useful construct. Bruseth and Martin (1987), while discarding the focus as unusable, further supported Lynott’s (1975) original interpretation of the pits as being associated with large-scale food processing. Their interpretation equates the pits to the burned rock middens of Central Texas, with both representing group aggregations. 3.3.3 Late Prehistoric Period The Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 700 to 1600) is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points in the archeological record of North-Central Texas. The A.D. 700 date for the beginning of this period is based upon dated contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage to the west. Group aggregation and large-scale manipulation of subsistence resources, as represented by the Late Archaic Wylie pit features and the human burials they contain, may be indicative of societal changes that continued through the Late Prehistoric period. Habitation structures indicating increased sedentism, at least in certain places and at certain times, have been found in some Late Prehistoric sites, along with cultigens such as corn, and arrow points and ceramics indicating important technological changes. There may also be evidence of differential mortuary practices (e.g., the distinction between burials placed inside and outside of Wylie pits) that could reflect a shift toward a hierarchical social structure, although this evidence is not nearly as strong as that for the Caddo area of East Texas. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period be divided into an early and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of the foraging subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting increasing influences from extra-local groups on the Southern Plains farther to the north. Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). Prikryl’s (1990, 1993) Late Prehistoric I period (A.D. 700 to 1200) is marked by the Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Scallorn, and Steiner arrow point types. Ceramic vessels are primarily grog-tempered and undecorated, but some 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 16

evidence indicates influences from other regions in some locally manufactured ceramic wares displaying designs similar to those associated with East Texas Caddo ceramic types. Evidence for corn agriculture and domestic structures has been found at sites at Joe Pool Lake in western Dallas County as well as to the north at Hubert Moss Lake near the Red River (Lorrain 1969; Martin 1994; Peter and McGregor 1988). Cultural changes were also taking place on the Southern Plains farther to the west, though that area adhered to the Archaic lifestyle even after technological innovations such as the bow and arrow were accepted (Lynott 1981). As a result of intensive excavations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake, Peter and McGregor (1988) proposed a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba arrow points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late 12th or early 13th century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive Caddo occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred, in at least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time. Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive change separate from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; however, analysis of a Native American burial salvaged along Spring Creek (site 41DL373) in northeastern Dallas County also suggests maize consumption. Radiocarbon dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155 and 1275, while a carbon isotope ratio of -17.7 ‰ suggests that, although maize was consumed, it did not form a major part of the diet (Peter and Clow 2000). These indications of maize consumption contrast with a small grouping of disturbed human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369), also in Dallas County. Located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork Trinity River), that site yielded remains of at least four individuals dated to approximately A.D. 1035. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although shell beads and a shell gorget were present, and a carbon isotope ratio of -21.6 ‰ suggests that the group’s diet was not high in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Given the slightly earlier date of the Harbor Pointe burials compared to the Cobb-Pool and 41DL373 sites, it is possible that maize agriculture was introduced to the region ca. A.D. 1200; conversely, this same evidence may indicate that Late Prehistoric groups in North-Central Texas practiced divergent subsistence patterns. Sites dating to the broadly-defined Late Prehistoric period (e.g., post A.D. 700), are also common downstream within the Trinity River Basin of the Blackland Prairie. The collections studied during the Superconducting Super Collider project contain substantial numbers of both early (e.g., Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Colbert, Scallorn, and Steiner) and late (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz) arrow points, but Yedlowski et al. (1998) note that early arrow point varieties are more frequent, perhaps reflecting high population densities continuing from the Late Archaic period. Other than the Perdiz and Scallorn types, which have such widespread distributions, the arrow styles indicate cultural influences from east and north of the Blackland Prairie region. The limited ceramic samples, containing sherds reminiscent of types such as Weches Fingernail Impressed, Killough Pinched, Maydelle Incised, and Poynor Engraved, also support interaction with Caddo groups to the east (Yedlowski et al. 1998). The Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills Reservoir presents a similar scenario, with most of the typed arrow points dating to the first half of the Late Prehistoric period and the more distinctive ceramics relating to the early Caddo types, such as Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Weches Fingernail Impressed (Duffield 1963). The Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir also yielded numerous early style arrow points, as well as a respectable number of Perdiz points, along with a small collection of highly fragmented ceramics (Sorrow et al. 1966). Three sites excavated at Cedar Creek Reservoir contained Late Prehistoric components, although materials of this age were common only at the Gossett Bottom and Lacy sites (Story 1965). Early arrow point styles (e.g., Alba, Catahoula, Friley, Granbury, Scallorn, and Steiner) are better represented than late ones (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz), but not in significant amounts. Not surprisingly, ceramics are more frequent in this area than to the west and clearly are related to the Caddo tradition to the east and northeast; some of the more distinctive decorated sherds were considered reminiscent of types such as Canton Incised, Killough Pinched, and Ripley or Wilder Engraved (Story 1965). The faunal remains from the Gossett Bottom and Lacy sites, many of which probably relate to Late Prehistoric occupations, consist predominantly of deer, turtle, and small mammals, with bison occurring only in small numbers. Based on the feature evidence (or lack thereof), it appears that the Cedar Creek Reservoir portion of the Trinity River basin was occupied by mobile hunter-gatherers rather than sedentary groups during the Late Prehistoric period. Some of the best data concerning Native American use of the region during the Late Prehistoric period is from Richland-Chambers Reservoir. Sites dating to this interval are common at the reservoir, especially for the early half of the Late Prehistoric period, and it appears that there was a significant decline in population densities after about A.D. 1300 (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). The data suggest that most of the excavated sites with Late Prehistoric components were used for residential purposes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987), although there are some sites that more 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 17

likely represent resource extraction camps (e.g., 41FT193 and 41NV139). The structural patterns at the Bird Point Island site (41FT201) indicate intensive use by sedentary hunter-gatherers during the early Late Prehistoric period. Conversely, investigations of other generally contemporaneous components at nearby sites (e.g., Adams Ranch, Irvine [41NV182], and Little Cedar Creek [41NV173]) have yielded middens and numerous features suggesting intensive use but which lack house structures, possibly indicating seasonal occupation of those sites. Macrobotanical remains primarily indicate the use of wild plant foods such as hardwood nuts, a variety of seeds, and tubers/rhizomes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). The only tropical cultigen is maize, and it occurs in very small quantities and only in contexts dating to the last half of the Late Prehistoric period. Hence, groups who lived in this area were predominantly hunters and gatherers. The arrow points that characterize the early (Alba, Scallorn, and Steiner) and late (Perdiz and Cliffton) parts of the period are the same styles found elsewhere across the area, and it appears that Gary dart points may have continued to be used through the early Late Prehistoric period (McGregor and Bruseth 1987:183). Ceramics are moderately common and clearly relate to Caddo wares, with most of the identified types (e.g., Maydelle Incised, Poynor Engraved, and Weches Fingernail Impressed) indicating contact with groups in the Neches River drainage, east of the Trinity River. During the Late Prehistoric II period (A.D. 1200 to 1600), influences from the Southern Plains became pronounced in the Cross Timbers and the adjacent prairie areas. These influences coincided with an increase in bison herd size in North-Central Texas (Lynott 1981; Prikryl 1990). Bison were important to subsistence but shrinking procurement territory sizes due to population increases continued the trend toward horticulture and settled village life (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). In terms of technology, a Plains Indian tool assemblage became increasing common in the region (Prikryl 1990). Items associated with that assemblage include calcareous-tempered ceramic vessels, some of which fit the description for the Nocona Plain type (shell-tempered), and triangular arrow points such as the Fresno, Harrell, Maud, Perdiz, and Washita styles. Tools specific to bison hide processing include snub-nosed or thumbnail scrapers and edge-beveled Harahey knives. Bison scapula hoes, which also are common in Plains Indian sites, have been recovered from sites in the Lewisville Lake and Lavon Lake areas of Denton and Collin counties (Barber 1969; Harris 1945). Concerning the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates (1997:305) summarize Late Prehistoric II period occupations as characterized by multiple, short-term, logistic sites that lack ceramic artifacts and architectural features, with the exception of site 41DN102, which contained the only architectural remains identified within the project area and might represent a small hamlet occupied between approximately A.D. 1300 and 1450. No evidence of horticulture was recovered, and faunal remains indicate a foraging strategy that emphasized a reliance on deer procurement and occasionally bison. Little evidence of the transport and curation of chert raw materials was encountered and there was no evidence of long-distance raw material acquisition. Late Prehistoric II ceramic traditions in the Lake Ray Roberts area were dominated by locally produced, shell-tempered wares, which were being produced across the general Southern Plains region by that time. Furthermore, little, if any, evidence of interaction with the Caddo was encountered within the area, which supports Story’s previous synthesis of that period (Story 1990). Thus, the Lake Ray Roberts data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of the Late Prehistoric period largely independent of the Southern Plains or East Texas woodlands. The Plains Indian influences associated with settled village life were used to define the now outmoded Henrietta complex of North-Central Texas. The Henrietta complex, based on Krieger’s (1946) more expansive Henrietta focus, extends from the Red River south along the headwaters of the Trinity and Brazos rivers. The type site, M. D. Harrell (41YN1), is located along the Brazos River in Young County just northwest of Palo Pinto County in the drainage basin now inundated by Possum Kingdom Reservoir (Krieger 1946). The Harrell site and other associated sites contain middens, house structures, rock hearths, storage pits, and burials, and they most often are located on sandy knolls or terraces overlooking river valleys (Brooks 1989; Forrester 1994). Excavated sites attributed to the Henrietta complex include the Glass (41MU24) and Coyote (41MU28) sites located on the Red River in Montague County (Lorrain 1967; Woodall 1967), and it is clear that sites such as Dillard (41CO174) in Cooke County are related as well (Martin 1994). The Henrietta complex as an investigative tool is limiting to archeological analysis since its loose definition tends to obscure local differences, while more recent investigations in the upper Trinity River drainage have tended to highlight local variations. At Ray Roberts Lake, for instance, Ferring and Yates (1997) see local trends emerging independent of extra-regional influences. They cite the lack of evidence for extensive maize horticulture and the preponderance of short-term logistical camps as the basis of their hypothesis. Similarly, Peter and McGregor (1988) demonstrated that occupation of the Mountain Creek drainage was less intensive in the Late Prehistoric II period than during prior periods and evidence of the practice of maize horticulture is limited. Available evidence suggests that the regional 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 18

adaptation developing in North-Central Texas after A.D. 1200 was truly distinctive from the Southern Plains adaptations revealed in areas to the northwest (Peter et al. 1997). 3.3.4 Protohistoric & Historic Native American Periods The cultural divergences between North-Central and Northeast/East Texas that began in the Archaic period continued into the Protohistoric and Historic periods. The sporadic nature and uncertain extent of early European contact with indigenous groups in North-Central Texas, coupled with disparities in knowledge about these groups themselves late in prehistory, make it difficult to precisely determine the temporal boundary between the Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic periods. Various sociological factors, primarily the colonization of New Mexico by the Spanish, caused drastic changes in the cultural composition of North-Central Texas, as groups from elsewhere migrated into the area and existing groups were forced to adapt to their presence. Meanwhile, Caddo groups continued to dominate the northeastern portion of the region, although significant changes were also occurring there. For purposes of this synopsis, the Protohistoric period begins in 1542 with the first sustained contact between Native Americans and the Spanish in the region. Although contact between Spanish and Native American groups during at least the early portion of the Protohistoric period was indirect and intermittent, European exploration, trading, and settlement affected various indigenous groups in a variety of ways. Unfortunately, historical documentation and archeological evidence are very sparse for the Protohistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin. After 1598; however, Spanish influence was never absent from the Southern Plains. However, direct Native American contact with Europeans continued to be limited and only brief records of Spanish journeys into or through the North-Central Texas area exist (Hofman 1989b; John 1975). Although European trade items appear on a limited number of archeological sites in North-Central Texas (Sollberger 1953), no Protohistoric site in the region has been thoroughly investigated and characterizations of the Native American adaptations during that period are conjectural at best. Tonkawa, Wichita, Caddo, and Comanche all are likely to have traversed the area. The manner in which many Native American populations responded to contact with the Spanish and their cultural trajectory following this contact is not precisely known, and the exact locations of their sites and detailed ethnohistoric data are almost nonexistent. By the 18th century, migrant Plains Indian groups had moved into and beyond North Texas, and their documentation by traders and explorers marks the beginning of the Historic Period (Prikryl 1993). Unfortunately, because reliable historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River basin during the early historic period, it is not clear which specific aboriginal groups were residing in the present-day region at the beginning of this period. Clearly, the early historic era in North Texas was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and amalgamation (see Newcomb 1961). Documentary sources suggest that the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai, Yojaune, Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo traversed the region at various times during the period (Campbell 1983; Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell 1982). At the beginning of the 19th century, the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern Plains became commonplace. This was the result of increasingly peaceful relations between the Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the north, and the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory by the United States in 1803. 3.4 Historic Cultural Context American explorers began to settle the North-Central Texas region around 1840. Settlers found rich soil, ample water, useful trees, and an abundance of wild game (Maxwell 2019). Reoccurring conflicts with Native American tribes caused many of these settlers to seek protection at Bird’s Fort, located near present-day Arlington (Maxwell 2019). To recruit settlers to the area, the Republic of Texas granted land to the Texas Emigration and Land Company, known as the Peters Colony in 1841. After continuing attacks on outlying settlements by Native Americans, Sam Houston signed a treaty with tribal chiefs at Bird’s Fort in 1843 (Maxwell 2019). Over time, the Texas Emigration and Land Company acquired three additional land contracts, encompassing most of North-Central Texas. By the mid-1840s, several new communities were formed in the region, including the areas of Lancaster and Wilmer in 1844 to 1850 (Nall 2020). Texas was annexed by the United States in 1846, and the First Legislature of Texas established Dallas County that year. The county was probably named for George Mifflin Dallas, Vice President of the United States under James K. Polk. In the 1850s and 1860s, the county’s economy was dominated by crops of corn, cotton, and wheat and livestock of hogs, cattle, and sheep (Maxwell 2019). Though the fertile Blackland Prairie soils attracted settlers, prior to the 1870s, poor transportation, limited markets, and lack of mechanized farm equipment prevented the large-scale plantation agriculture characteristic of many parts of the South, and most settlers at this time were subsistence farmers living near reliable water and timber supplies along major streams. Despite the exodus of soldiers during the American Civil War, the population of Dallas County increased as it attracted refugees and slave owners from other southern 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 19

states (Maxwell 2019). In the 1870s and 1880s, construction of railroad lines connected Dallas and many of the towns within Dallas County to the rest of the state and nation (Maxwell 2019). Lancaster was settled in 1844 by a family from Illinois along Tenmile Creek as part of the Peters Colony (Nall 2010). By 1850, the town was laid out and a post office was established in 1860. Lancaster was incorporated in May 1887. At that time, the Lancaster population was around 550, and it doubled by 1900. The Lancaster Tap Railroad was completed in 1890, which connected Lancaster with the Houston and Texas Central at Hutchins located south of Dallas, but it was abandoned by 1934 (Nall 2010). The Dallas and Waco Railroad was built through Lancaster in 1888, and by 1891 it became part of the Missouri, Kansas and Texas, running from Dallas to the Gulf Coast of Texas (Nall 2010). By the early 20th century, an electric commuter rail, the Interurban Railway, extended from Dallas to several of the outlying communities. The line was part of a 56-mi-long track owned by the Southern Traction Company that extended from Dallas to Corsicana including a stop in Wilmer. In 1912, the line was purchased by the Texas Traction Company, which merged with Southern Traction Company to become the Texas Electric Railway. After the merger in 1917, the Texas Electric Railway spanned from Denison to Waco. The Corsicana line was discontinued in 1941 when the popularity of the automobile caused the Texas Electric Railway to lose revenue (Werner 2010). Wilmer saw settlers arrived in the area before 1850 and was called Prairie Valley at the time when the Houston and Texas Central Railroad established a stop in 1872 (Maxwell 2010). The first postmaster, J. W. Johnson first arrived in 1883, but by 1884 the post office was renamed Wilmer after A. J. Wilmer who was a conductor on the Houston and Texas Central. In 1890, Wilmer had a population of 100 and was a farming community with the principal crop being cotton. At the time of World War I, Wilmer had a population of over 200, three churches, White Banking Company, the Citizen's Cotton Oil Company, a blacksmith shop, a restaurant, a livery stable, two drug stores, and two groceries as well as telephone connections (Maxwell 2010). Wilmer was incorporated in 1945 and had a population of 450 at the time with the majority commuting to Dallas to work. The population grew rapidly over the next several decades and had 2,479 people by 1990 and over 3,000 in 2000 (Maxwell 2010). During the 20th century, Dallas County gradually became less rural and agricultural as manufacturing became more prevalent. Manufacturing became increasingly significant during and immediately after World War II, providing employment for young people coming from rural areas and creating economic growth (Maxwell 2019). By 1950, approximately 90 percent of Dallas County was classified as being urban. During the following four decades, the population of the county tripled from 600,000 to 1,800,000. Major industries included manufacturing, retail trade, wholesale trade, and the service industry. Lancaster and Wilmer experienced similar growth rates. From 1930 to 1960 the principal industries in the area were cotton oil and printing companies, and by 1970 Lancaster had a population of 12,500 with 135 businesses. As a result of the spread of urbanization from the City of Dallas, the city’s population increased from 300 residents in 1950 to nearly 53,000 citizens in 2010 (Nall 2010; U.S. Census Bureau 2010). The number of businesses also increased from less than a dozen in the late 1940s and early 1950s to over 1,200 businesses in 2000 (Nall 2010). 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 20

CHAPTER 4: METHODS Prior to fieldwork, the IES staff conducted historical and archeological records reviews to determine the locations of previously recorded resources within the survey area and within a 1-mi radius of the direct survey area (see Section 3.1). IES staff also reviewed ecological, geologic, and soils data, as well as historical and modern topographic maps and aerial photography of the survey area. The methods utilized during this survey meet the minimum archeological survey standards for field investigations recommended by the CTA (CTA 2020), as approved by the THC. 4.1 Survey Methods 4.1.1 Pedestrian Survey The pedestrian reconnaissance survey consisted of visual examination of the ground surface and existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites and historic-age architectural resources within the survey area. The pedestrian survey also confirmed the locations of previous disturbances initially identified during the background review. Areas displaying high levels of disturbance were photographed to document the lack of potential for intact archeological deposits. Other documentation methods include narrative notes and annotated maps. 4.1.2 Intensive Survey In areas with potential for containing archeological materials in shallow contexts, shovel tests were excavated to the top of culturally sterile deposits, typically the calcic (Bk) subsoil horizon in this area. Each shovel test was at least 30 cm in diameter and was hand excavated in levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using 0.25-in (0.64-cm) hardware mesh to facilitate the recovery of buried cultural materials. If clay content was high and could not be efficiently screened, the excavated soil was manually troweled and visually inspected for artifacts. Additionally, the physical properties of each natural stratigraphic level were recorded. Investigators documented the results of each shovel test on standardized forms. The location of each shovel test was recorded using a differentially- corrected handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) unit. For linear projects, the THC Archeological Survey Standards for Texas require that 16 shovel tests be conducted per mi for each survey transect. However, the number of shovel tests varied based on the amount of disturbance, exposed bedrock or culturally sterile soil, ground visibility, and steep slope present within the survey area, or if archeological site(s) are encountered. This intensive survey was supplemented by systematic auger testing and backhoe trenching throughout the survey area. 4.1.2.1 Auger Testing As most of the survey area is located within frequently or occasionally flooded soils, a significant effort was undertaken to evaluate the potential impacts of the project to deeply-buried archeological resources. To adequately sample for deeply-buried cultural deposits throughout the survey area, a powered auger with a 12-in-diameter bit was used. Auger tests were excavated in 100-m intervals within sections of the survey area that were located within frequently flooded soils. Auger tests were excavated to depths of at least 1.5 m (5 ft). All excavated auger fill was screened using 0.25-in (0.64-cm) hardware mesh. Additionally, the physical properties of each natural stratigraphic level were recorded. Investigators documented the results of each auger test on standardized forms. The location of each auger test was recorded using a differentially-corrected handheld GPS unit. 4.1.2.2 Backhoe Trenching Due to the depth of the proposed impacts and the high potential for deeply-buried archeological sites within the Tenmile Creek floodplain, backhoe trenching was conducted across the eastern half survey area. Backhoe trenches were systematically excavated at 200-m intervals within portions of the survey area that are identified to contain the highest potential for deeply-buried archeological sites. In addition, backhoe trenches were placed in proximity to any artifact encountered greater than 100 cmbs during auger testing. Backhoe trenches averaged 6 m (19.6 ft) in length and were excavated to a maximum depth of 4.5 m (15 ft). When a trench was to a depth of approximately 1.5 m (5 ft), an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) competent field supervisor assessed the stability of the trench prior to recording soil data. If soil stability was low, the trench was widened through benching and/or limited to a safe depth for detailed recording of the soil profile. After the trench was recorded, the backhoe continued excavation. Backhoe trench profiles were monitored for the presence of archeological materials. At least 5 gallons of soil was screened through 0.25-in hardware mesh from every third excavator bucket load during excavation; however, representative soil sampling strategies varied per trench and increased or decreased based on in-field observations. The remaining excavated soil was visually inspected as it was placed on the spoil pile. Investigators documented the results of each backhoe trench on standardized forms.

materials, if observed, were recorded and an approximate depth was documented. If cultural materials were identified within a backhoe trench, a 30-cm-by-30-cm column sample or 50-cm-by-50-cm test unit was excavated within the trench. Controlled excavation units were manually excavated in 10-cm (3.9-in) levels to the base of the trench or to sterile soil. Trench excavation ceased once the trench reached the vertical extent of Holocene soils, water table, or the maximum depth the backhoe could safely excavate. Each excavated trench was photographed, backfilled, and geospatially recorded using a differentially-corrected handheld GPS unit. 4.1.3 In-field Artifact Documentation This survey employed a non-collection, in-field artifact analysis strategy. Artifacts encountered during fieldwork were identified to the most specific type and/or functional class possible, tabulated, and recorded by provenience, then returned to the context from which they were recovered. All artifacts recovered from subsurface contexts and all temporally-diagnostic artifacts were photographed. In addition, representative non-diagnostic artifact samples were photographed. Surface artifact s and artifact concentrations were characterized by content and relative frequency during field survey. The locations and extents of all artifact concentrations were mapped and plotted on site maps. Artifact inventory information is presented in tabular format within the report and artifact photographs are presented in the appendices. 4.1.4 Site Recording An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural resources. The recognition of a “site” is therefore contingent on content and extent. Content may refer to artifacts or cultural features encountered in surface or subsurface contexts, architectural elements, or other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the vertical and horizontal spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. For surficial materials, a site is defined as five or more artifacts of at least two different materials or functional classes located within the same vicinity (typically a 400 square m [m2; 0.1-ac] area) or at least one cultural feature. The extent of the surface artifacts and cultural features are then defined as the site boundary. When artifacts or features are encountered in buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally positive excavations. In cases where an excavated survey sampling location (i.e., shovel test) yields cultural materials, additional delineation excavations are conducted to define the boundary of the site. The spatial extent of the site is defined within the extent of positive excavations and surface artifacts or features when both are present. In addition, archival research can also be used to define the limits of some historic-period archeological sites. Cultural remains, meeting these criteria, are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) to be included in the TASA database. Conversely, discovery of cultural materials that do not meet these criteria are considered isolated occurrences of past human activity and are simply documented by location and content. Modern materials and features (i.e., less than 50 years old) are not considered sites, with only location and content noted during the survey. Depending on depositional integrity and cultural content, archeological sites can be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as SALs. Cultural isolates and modern features are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as SALs because of their failure to meet the site definition and their inability to contribute important information to the understanding of history or prehistory. 4.1.5 Background Research Prior to field investigations, a suite of archival sources including historic maps and aerial photographs were reviewed to determine former land use patterns and the locations of historic-age (e.g., greater than 45 years old) structures within and surrounding the survey area. 4.2 National Register Evaluation Criteria The assessment of significance of a cultural resource is based on federal regulations and guidelines. The regulatory criteria for evaluating resources for inclusion in the National Register are codified under the authority of the NHPA as amended (36 CFR 60.4 [a–d]), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Advisory Council) has also set forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Federal regulations indicate that “[t]he term ‘eligible for inclusion in the National Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR 800.2[e]). Based on Advisory Council guidelines, any cultural resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is a historic property. 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 22

Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, four criteria for eligibility are applied. The regulations provide that the quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and: Criterion A: that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or Criterion B: that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or Criterion C: that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or Criterion D: that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR 60.4(a–d)]. The principal objective is to determine whether a cultural resource possesses the potential to contribute to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Adequate information regarding site function, context, and chronological placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design, determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural resources is a particularly important objective during the inventory and evaluation processes. Criterion D is generally associated with prehistoric, but also historic-era, archeological sites. Criteria A, B, and C typically reflect association with historic-era resources, rarely with prehistoric sites. The objective of the current project was to locate and define both the horizontal and vertical extents of any cultural resources, document and describe those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility. 4.3 Curation This survey employed a non-collection strategy. Artifacts observed on the ground surface and recovered within excavations were identified, quantified, photographed, and inventoried in the field and were returned to the provenience from which they were recovered. Project-related records, field notes, photographs, forms, and other documentation will be organized to curation facility standards. All project records will be temporarily stored at the IES office and will be permanently curated at the CAR at UTSA. 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 23

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS The archeological inventory for the proposed Tenmile Creek 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project was conducted on 10 April, 15 through 17 April, and 17 through 19 June 2020. During this survey, three alternative alignments, totaling 4.2 mi (35 ac), were subjected to pedestrian reconnaissance survey and systematic intensive survey. Pedestrian reconnaissance was conducted across the entire APE to confirm the extent of prior ground disturbances and assess the likelihood of encountering cultural resources. Ground surface visibility was highly variable and irregular across the APE, ranging from 0 to 100 percent. Intensive survey with systematic shovel test sampling in staggered intervals was conducted across portions of the APE with the potential to contain archeological resources within shallow subsurface contexts. Auger testing and backhoe trenching was conducted within the Tenmile Creek floodplain due to the potential for deeply-buried archeological deposits in the alluvial setting. 5.1 Archeological Survey Results 5.1.1 Pedestrian Reconnaissance Survey Pedestrian reconnaissance survey verified previous ground disturbances outlined in Chapter 3. The following description covers the original Option 1 alignment (see Figure 1.1 and Figures 5.1 through 5.4). The western terminus of the survey area consisted of an existing pump station, gravel pad, two-track road, existing fence line, and existing buried utilities (Appendix A, Photographs 1 and 2). Immediately east of the pump station, the survey area consisted of an open field on the floodplain of Tenmile Creek to the west of Ferris Road (Appendix A, Photographs 3 through 5). The ground surface visibility in this area was zero percent. Directly to the south of the survey area, an existing sewer line paralleled the Option 1 alignment and Tenmile Creek (Appendix A, Photograph 6). Farther east, the survey area crossed a low-lying area that is frequently flooded and has been repeatedly modified with fill to allow crossing of an unnamed drainage channel that extends north from Tenmile Creek (Appendix A, Photographs 7 and 8). At the time of this survey, the area contained standing water and was inaccessible to pedestrian survey or mechanical excavation (Appendix A, Photographs 9 and 10). The section of the APE, east of the inundated area, also exhibited modified features by the addition of fill. Continuing east, the survey area crossed a densely-wooded area and through a section that had been cleared of vegetation, with the topsoil being significantly disturbed by grubbing activities (Appendix A, Photographs 11 through 15). The survey area directly to the east of Ferris Road and south of Lavender Road, consisted of a nearly level open field with grasses (Appendix A, Photographs 16 and 17). The survey area extended south then turned east to continue to parallel Tenmile Creek. That part of the open field lead to an unnamed tributary of Tenmile Creek that extended north-to-south and had been channelized with concrete bank stabilization (Appendix A, Photographs 18 and 19). The section of the survey area to the east of the channelized stream occupied an open agricultural field that had been recently mowed and raked for baling hay (Appendix A, Photographs 20 through 22). An existing sewer line extended along the southern border of the survey area and paralleled Tenmile Creek (Appendix A, Photograph 23). Within that section of the survey area, a proposed access road will extend along an existing two-track access road that connected Lavender Road to existing Oncor overhead electric utility line easement (Appendix A, Photographs 24 and 25). The survey area continued east, paralleling a wooded riparian corridor along Tenmile Creek and the existing Oncor right-of-way (ROW; Appendix A, Photograph 26). The survey area then extended southeast toward Tenmile Creek along an area that has been cleared of woody vegetation and was occupied by a two-track road (Appendix A, Photographs 27 and 30). The two- track road extended through to the eastern terminus of the survey area. An artificial earthen berm, part of the early 20th century electric interurban railway line that has been previously recorded nearby as archeological site 41DL360, extended in a northwest-to-southeast orientation across the survey area (Appendix A, Photographs 31 through 36). The Option 2 reroute alignment extended from the Option 1 route just east of the intersection of Ferris Road and Lavender Road (see Figures 5.2 and 5.3). The westernmost portion of the Option 2 alignment extended east across a nearly level field and continued through a densely-wooded riparian forest along an unnamed tributary of Tenmile Creek. The Option 2 reroute alignment continued to extend across a gently-sloping terrace landform along a portion of Lavender Road before realigning to the south to reconnect with the Option 1 alignment within the Tenmile Creek floodplain (Appendix A, Photographs 37 through 39). The Option 3 reroute alignment extended east along Lavender Road from Option 2, and continued southeast along the eastern margin of an open agricultural field that had been recently mowed and raked for baling hay where it connected with Option 1 alignment immediately north of the Oncor overhead electric utility line right-of-way (ROW; see Figure 5.3; Appendix A, Photographs 40 and 41). 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 25

5.1.1 Intensive Survey 5.1.1.1 Shovel Tests Shovel tests were systematically excavated within portions of the survey area with the potential to contain shallow archeological deposits within approximately 80 cm of the ground surface and within the location of previously recorded site 41DL229. Disturbed areas were field verified through shovel testing and visual observations. Significantly disturbed areas were photographed during the survey. Shovel tests were excavated within the portions of the Option 2 and 3 reroute alignments that extended across the terrace landform in the central portion of the survey area. During the intensive survey, 12 shovel tests and 12 site delineation shovel tests were excavated within the survey area (see Figures 5.2 and 5.3; Appendix B). Within the survey area, the terrace gradually sloped to an unnamed tributary of Tenmile Creek to the west and a drainage swale, partially occupied by a wetland, to the east. Both the Option 2 and 3 reroute alignments then extended south across the terrace to the floodplain of Tenmile Creek. Due to the location of previously recorded prehistoric archeological site 41DL229 across the summit of the terrace, shovel test intervals were reduced to 30 m in an attempt to relocate the site during the current survey (Shovel Tests [STs] 3 through 10; see Figure 5.3). In general, shovel tests excavated across the terrace landform exhibited a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly clay loam to a depth ranging between approximately 24 to 52 cm below surface (cmbs) overlying light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly silty clay loam subsoil horizon with common calcium carbonate concretions (Appendix A, Photographs 42 and 43). Shovel tests were generally terminated once excavation depth penetrated 10 to 20 cm into the calcic subsoil horizon. 5.1.1.2 Auger Tests Auger tests were systematically excavated along the Option 1 alignment to identify areas that had the potential for containing deeply-buried archeological deposits and potential paleosols. Twenty-four auger tests were excavated during this survey (see Figures 5.1 through 5.3; Appendix C). The Option 1 survey area primarily extended along the Tenmile Creek floodplain. In general, auger tests exhibited a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay to depths ranging from 40 to 200 cmbs overlying a grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay subsoil horizon (Appendix A, Photographs 44 and 45). Auger Test (AT) 8 was extensively disturbed due to fill at a high water crossing west of Ferris Road (Appendix A, Photographs 46 and 47). Auger tests were generally terminated once excavation depths penetrated 10 to 20 cm into the subsoil horizon or where soils became too compact to excavate (ATs 23 and 24). The entire Option 1 route was not completely surveyed via auger testing due to the lack of access to the easternmost portion of the survey area at the time of the initial survey. The portion of the survey area inaccessible to auger testing was systematically surveyed via backhoe trenching during a later survey mobilization. During the auger test survey, large mammal bone fragments were recovered within two of the auger tests (ATs 16 and 20; see Figures 5.2 and 5.3). Large mammal bone fragments were encountered at a depth of approximately 110 to 150 cmbs in AT 16 (Appendix G, Photographs 3 and 4) and approximately 150 to 160 cmbs in AT 20 (Appendix H, Photographs 4 and 5). 5.1.1.3 Backhoe Trenching Twenty-five backhoe trenches were excavated within floodplain portions of the survey area (see Figures 5.2 through 5.4; Appendix D). Initially, six backhoe trenches were planned for the survey; however, due to the inaccessibility of a portion of the Option 1 alignment at the time of the auger test survey, the addition of the Option 2 and 3 reroute alignments, and the identification of several deeply-buried archeological sites within portions of the survey area, 17 survey trenches and eight delineation trenches were excavated. Backhoe trenches were excavated at the locations of ATs 16 and 20, where large mammal bone fragments were recovered in auger tests, to investigate those locations more adequately. Additional survey backhoe trenches were excavated in the eastern portion of the survey area (see Figure 5.4). Four of the trenches were positive for prehistoric cultural materials and features. Trenches 1 through 4 were excavated off positive AT 16 (Site 42DL563), which contained mammal bone fragments, along the Option 1 alignment in an open field in the central part of the survey area (see Figure 5.2; Appendix A, Photographs 48 and 51). In general, Trenches 1 through 4 exhibited a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay to depths ranging from 60 to 80 cmbs overlying dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam to depths ranging from 150 to 165 cmbs (Appendix D). This was underlain by either a brown (10YR 5/3) or a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay subsoil horizon to depths of 200 to 360 cmbs. Trench 2 was positive for cultural materials (i.e., charcoal, large mammal bone fragments, and mussel shell). Site 41DL563 Features 1 and 2 were encountered in Trench 2 at depths of 228 and 245 cmbs, respectively. These features are discussed in detail in Section 5.2. 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 30

Trenches 5 through 8 were excavated as delineations off positive AT 20 (Site 41DL564), which contained mammal bone fragments, along the Option 1 alignment in an agricultural field that had been previously mowed for baling hay in the central part of the survey area (see Figure 5.3; Appendix A, Photographs 20 and 21 and 52 through 56.). In general, Trenches 5 through 8 exhibited a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay loam to depths ranging from 36 to 190 cmbs overlying either a brown (10YR 5/2) or a yellowish brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay to depths of 104 to 220 cmbs (Appendix D). This was underlain by either a dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay, or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay horizon to depths of 160 to 380 cmbs. Trench 5 was positive for cultural materials as very large mammal bones were recovered from 160 to 220 cmbs. Trench 8 contained large mammal bones and charcoal at 245 to 270 cmbs as well as a feature that contained burned clay, charcoal, and mussel shell at 285 to 310 cmbs. Site 41DL564 is discussed in detail in Section 5.2. Trenches 9 through 13 were excavated along the Option 1 alignment in a wooded area directly south of an existing Oncor ROW (see Figures 5.3 and 5.4; Appendix A, Photographs 57 through 61). In general, Trenches 9 through 13 exhibited a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) or dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay to depths ranging from 40 to 220 cmbs overlying either yellowish brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay to depths of 146 to 330 cmbs (Appendix D). This was underlain by either very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay or dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay horizon to depths of 160 to 380 cmbs. Trenches 9 through 13 were negative for cultural resources. Trenches 14 and 15 were excavated along the Option 1 alignment to the east and west sides of Site 41DL360 in an area that had been cleared of vegetation in the easternmost section of the survey area (see Figure 5.4; Appendix A, Photographs 62 through 63). In general, Trenches 14 and 15 exhibited a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) to depths ranging from 36 to 70 cmbs overlying dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) with light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt laminations to depths of 140 to 174 cmbs (Appendix D). This was underlain by brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay with yellowish red (5YR 4/6) mottles to depths of 270 to 280 cmbs. The last layer consisted of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay with yellowish red (5YR 4/6) mottles to depths of 300 to 320 cmbs. Trenches 14 and 15 were negative for cultural resources. Trenches 16 through 18 were excavated along the Option 2 alignment to the east of Trenches 1 through 4 (see Figure 5.2; Appendix A, Photographs 64 through 66). Trenches 16 and 17 were excavated within an open field and Trench 18 was excavated within a wooded area. In general, Trenches 16 and 17 exhibited a surface layer of brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam and clay loam to depths ranging from 54 to 60 cmbs overlying dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam with very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt mottles to depths of 86 to 120 cmbs (Appendix D). This layer is followed by very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay to 270 cmbs and is underlain by pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam to a depth of 270 cmbs. This is underlain by very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam to 350 cmbs. The soil profile exposed within Trench 18 consisted of a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam to a depth of 72 cmbs. This overlaid a stratum of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam to a depth of 128 cmbs. Between 128 cmbs and 190 cmbs, a layer of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay was encountered. Soils transitioned to a dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam to a depth of 260 cmbs. Trenches 16 through 18 were negative for cultural resources. Trenches 19 and 20 were excavated along the Option 2 alignment to the east of Trenches 5 through 8 in an agricultural field that had been previously mowed for baling hay in the central part of the survey area (see Figure 5.3; Appendix A, Photographs 67 through 68). The soil profile exposed within Trench 19 consisted of a surface layer of dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam to a depth of 24 cmbs (Appendix D). This overlaid a stratum of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay to a depth of 120 cmbs. Between 120 cmbs and 320 cmbs, a layer of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam was encountered. Soils transitioned to a light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay to a depth of 400 cmbs. The soil profile exposed within Trench 20 consisted of a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam to a depth of 190 cmbs. This overlaid a stratum of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam to a depth of 282 cmbs. Between 282 cmbs and 330 cmbs, a layer of light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy clay was encountered. Neither Trench 19 nor 20 were positive for any cultural resources. Trenches 21 and 22 were excavated along the Option 3 alignment to the east of Trenches 19 and 20 in an agricultural field that had been previously mowed for baling hay in the central part of the survey area (see Figure 5.3; Appendix A, Photographs 69 through 70). The soil profile exposed within Trench 21 consisted of a surface layer of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam to a depth of 180 cmbs (Appendix D). This overlaid a stratum of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam to a depth of 280 cmbs. Between 280 cmbs and 330 cmbs, a layer of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam was encountered. The soil profile exposed within Trench 22 consisted of a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam to a depth of 60 cmbs. This overlaid a stratum of brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam to a 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 31

depth of 100 cmbs. Between 100 cmbs and 140 cmbs, a layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam was encountered. Soils transitioned to a light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay to a depth of 220 cmbs. At depths exceeding 300 cmbs, a layer of dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam was encountered. Trenches 21 and 22 were negative for cultural resources. Trench 23 was excavated along the Option 3 alignment to the southeast of Trenches 21 and 22 in an agricultural field that had been previously mowed for baling hay in the central part of the survey area (see Figure 5.3; Appendix A, Photographs 71 through 73). The soil profile exposed within Trench 23 consisted of a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam to a depth of 50 cmbs (Appendix D). This overlaid a stratum of dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam to a depth of 180 cmbs. Between 180 cmbs and 300 cmbs, a layer of pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam was encountered. Soils transitioned to a dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam to a depth of 326 cmbs. Trenches 24 and 25 were excavated as delineations off positive Trench 23 (Site 41DL565) that contained a feature consisting of charcoal and burned clay. Site 41DL565 is discussed in detail in Section 5.2. The soil profile exposed within Trenches 24 and 25 consisted of a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam to depths of 170 to 175 cmbs. This overlaid a stratum of brown (10YR 5/3) loam to depths of 250 cmbs to 290 cmbs. Between 250 cmbs and 390 cmbs, a layer of dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam was encountered. Neither Trench 24 nor 25 were positive for containing cultural resources. 5.2 Encountered Cultural Resources 5.2.1 Site 41DL229 5.2.1.1 Previous Investigations Site 41DL229 was initially recorded in 1982 during a reconnaissance survey by Texas Department of Water Resources (TDRW) cultural resources personnel for the existing sewer pipeline (Fox 1982). The site was recorded based on information provided to TDRW cultural resources staff by a local landowner, who characterized the site as a popular artifact collecting location frequented by local collectors. As the site was outside of the alignment proposed for the existing sewer pipeline corridor, no systematic surface inspection or subsurface sampling to determine the site boundary was conducted at that time. Based on the informant information, site 41DL229 was assumed to encompass the entire surface of the terrace landform during the 1982 TDWR survey. 5.2.1.2 Survey Observations During the IES survey, a previously recorded prehistoric site (41DL229) was encountered within a portion of the survey area along the proposed Option 2 alignment (Figure 5.5). Due to the plotted site location across the summit of the terrace landform, survey shovel test intervals were reduced to 30 m within the previously identified site area to locate and delineate the site more accurately. Site 41DL229 was initially identified during the intensive survey when prehistoric artifacts were recovered within ST 10, excavated near the western margin of the landform. The site was delineated through a series of shovel tests excavated in 15-m intervals from ST 10. The site extended along the westernmost portion of the terrace landform, above the channel of an unnamed tributary of Tenmile Creek (Appendix E, Photographs 1 through 3). A large borrow pit was observed to extend from the northern margin of the survey area north along the terrace landform escarpment adjacent to the unnamed tributary. Site 41DL229 was documented within an area extending approximately 35 m north-to-south by 57 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.1 ha (0.24 ac) within the survey area. The site was delineated based on extent of positive shovel tests, observed disturbances, and the extent of the survey area (see Figure 5.5). The site extends outside of the survey area to the north and south. Ground visibility during the survey was limited due to the presence of pasture grasses across the landform. Despite vegetation cover, approximately 20 to 30 percent surface visibility was observed across much of the site. Shovel tests excavated within the site revealed a soil profile consisting of an upper stratum of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly clay loam to depths ranging from approximately 30 to 45 cmbs. Below the surface stratum, a yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam was encountered. A single artifact was observed on the ground surface and artifacts were encountered within four shovel tests excavated across the portion of the site within the survey area. 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 32

5.2.1.3 Artifacts During the delineation of 41DL229 within the survey area, prehistoric lithic artifacts (n=12) were encountered in four shovel tests (STs 10, 11, 12, and 15; Table 5.1). Lithic artifacts consisted of four pieces of chipped lithic debitage, six fragments of fire-cracked rock (FCR), and an expended amorphous core (Appendix E, Photographs 4 through 14). The expended core, which measured approximately 4 cm by 5 cm, was manufactured from metaquartzite. Chipped lithic debitage raw materials included gray chert (n=1) and Ogallala quartzite (n=3). FCR (n=6) equally comprised both quartzite (n=3; 50 percent) and limestone (n= 3; 50 percent) raw material types. Most prehistoric lithic artifacts encountered at 41DL229 (n=9; 75 percent) were recovered between a depth of 20 to 40 cmbs.

However, during the original recording of 41DL229, Fox suggested that the site dates to the Late Prehistoric (1982). The general paucity of artifacts recovered at the site may indicate that the location was used for a short duration or for limited activities. The site suggests a general trend of chipped stone tool maintenance and short- term inhabitation. The location of the site near the summit of the terrace landform has restricted the archeological deposits to the shallow subsurface, as little sedimentation is likely to have occurred at that elevation during the Holocene. In addition, the landform has been subject to agriculture since at least the early 20th century, and possibly since the mid-to-late 19th century. Since the site is restricted to the shallow subsurface, the vertical extent of the site has almost certainly been completely disturbed. 5.2.2 Site 41DL360 5.2.2.1 Previous Investigations Site 41DL360 was initially recorded in 1994 during a cultural resources survey for the expansion of a landfill south of Tenmile Creek (Davis et al. 1994). The site was documented as a bridge abutment and a portion of the earthen embankment pertaining to the Texas Electric Railway. 5.2.2.2 Survey Observations During the IES survey, a previously recorded historic-period site (41DL360) was encountered at the eastern terminus of the survey area along the proposed Option 1 alignment (Figure 5.6, Appendix A, Photographs 1 through 12). The earthen berm extends northwest-to-southeast across the survey area approximately 58 m northwest of Tenmile Creek (see Appendix A, Photograph 9). The site continues to the north of the survey area; however, that area was not surveyed as it is outside of the current survey limits. The portion of the site encountered during the survey is approximately 44 m north-to-south by 17 m east-to-west totaling 1,264 m² in size. The earthen berm occupies approximately 0.8 ha (0.19 ac) within the survey area and is approximately 2 m above the ground surface. The vegetation surrounding the berm was sparse due to previous land clearing for construction of the existing sewer line located to the south, and the berm featured overgrown vegetation. An existing utility line is located on top of the berm and extends its length in the same northwest-to-southeast trend (see Appendix A, Photographs 1, 4 through 6, and 9). A second larger utility line parallels the berm directly to the west. A northwest-to-southeast extending two-track road is located to the south of the site. Trenches 14 and 15, to the northwest and southeast of the site, had no artifacts associated with this site (see Appendix A, Photographs 2, 5, 8, and 10). 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 34

5.2.2.3 Archival Research The portion of 41DL360 within the APE was part of a 56-mi-long railway track owned by the Southern Traction Company that extended from Dallas to Corsicana, which included a stop in Wilmer. In 1912, the rail line was purchased by the Texas Traction Company, which merged with Southern Traction Company to become the Texas Electric Railway, also locally known and the Interurban Railway. After the merger in 1917, the Texas Electric Railway spanned from Denison to Waco. The Corsicana line was discontinued in 1941, when the popularity of the automobile caused the Texas Electric Railway to lose revenue (Werner 2010). By 1956, it appears most of the tracks had been removed. USGS topographic maps dating to the 1950s and 1960s depict the former railroad with a dashed line, indicating features remained but were not functional. 5.2.2.4 Site Summary Site 41DL360 represents a small segment of abandoned railroad berm associated with the early 20th century Texas Electric Railway. There are no other remaining structural parts or artifacts associated with this site within the survey area as they were presumably removed after the abandonment of the railway. 5.2.3 Site 41DL563 5.2.3.1 Survey Observations During this survey, 41DL563 was documented within the proposed Option 1 alignment (Figure 5.7; Appendix G, Photographs 1 and 2). The site was initially encountered within AT 16, which yielded mammal bone fragments at a depth of approximately 110 to 150 cmbs (Appendix G, Photographs 3 and 4). The site was delineated through the excavation of two additional auger tests (ATs 15 and 17) and four backhoe trenches (Trenches 1 through 4). The site extended along a generally level portion of the Tenmile Creek floodplain at an elevation of approximately 420 ft amsl. Site 41DL563 was documented within an area extending approximately 67 m north-to-south by 30 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.16 ha (0.4 ac) within the survey area. The site was delineated based on extent of positive excavations and the extent of the survey area. The site likely extends outside of the survey area to the east and west. Trenches excavated within 41DL563 exhibited a soil profile that consisted of a disturbed layer of construction fill and debris within the shallow subsurface that mantled undisturbed alluvial sediments characterized by laminated silt and clays that transitioned to more developed soil zones with depth (Figure 5.8). Strata comprised of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay were typically observed to underly the surface layer, before transitioning to brown (10YR 5/3) or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay with depth. The soil profile exposed within Trench 2 consisted of a surface layer of disturbed very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay to a depth of 44 cmbs. This overlaid a stratum of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay to a depth of 60 cmbs. Between 60 cmbs and 210 cmbs, a layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam was encountered. Soils transitioned to a brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, which extended to a depth of 280 cmbs. Two possible prehistoric features were encountered at a depth of 230 to 268 cmbs. The soil profile exposed within Trench 3 consisted of a surface layer of disturbed dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay to a depth of 50 cmbs. This overlaid a stratum of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay to a depth of 80 cmbs. Between 80 cmbs and 200 cmbs, a layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam was encountered. Soils transitioned to a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay to a depth of 320 cmbs. The soil profile exposed within Trench 4 consisted of a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay to a depth of 46 cmbs. This overlaid a stratum of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay to a depth of 165 cmbs. Between 165 cmbs and 280 cmbs, a layer of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay was encountered. Soils then transitioned to a dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay to a depth of 300 cmbs, then to brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay to a depth of 360 cmbs. 5.2.3.2 Features 5.2.3.2.1 Feature 1 Feature 1 initially presented at approximately 228 cmbs during the excavation of Trench 2 within the trench floor. The area, which exhibited a faint light red (2.5YR 6/8) staining within the yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay matrix, was manually skimmed to expose a generally rectangular area, measuring approximately 12 cm by 14 cm, of yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fill with abundant ash and charcoal surrounded by a 5-to-7-cm-wide band of red (2.5YR 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 36

5/6) and light red (2.5YR 6/8) clay that extended into the trench profile (Appendix G, Photograph 5). Feature 1 was clearly exposed by a depth of 235 cmbs (Appendix G, Photograph 6). Due to the presence of a potential intact prehistoric feature, Test Unit 1 (50-cm-by-50-cm) was centered on the feature and manually excavated to adequately document and determine the artifact contents of the feature (Figure 5.9; Appendix G, Photograph 7). Feature 1 extended to a depth of approximately 245 cmbs, where the feature diminished to a generally circular stain of faint light red (2.5YR 6/8) clay. Other than charcoal, ash, and reddened (non-vitrified) clay observed within the fill and margins of the feature, no artifacts were encountered during the excavation of Feature 1. 5.2.3.2.2 Feature 2 Feature 2 was encountered at a depth of approximately 248 cmbs within Test Unit 1 in Trench 2, originally excavated to investigate Feature 1. Due to the presence of the additional feature, excavation of Test Unit 1 continued to expose and document Feature 2. By a depth of 255 cmbs, Feature 2 presented as a generally circular pit, approximately 8 cm in diameter, surrounded by a margin of red (2.5YR 5/6) and light red (2.5YR 6/8) clay with a plume or fan of organic- rich fill containing burned clay, ash, charcoal, and very small fragments of calcined bone that extended approximately 10 to 12 cm outside of the feature to the south (Figure 5.10; Appendix G, Photograph 8). Other than charcoal, ash, calcined bone fragments, and reddened (non-vitrified) clay observed within the fill and margins of the feature, no artifacts were encountered during the excavation of Feature 2. Due to the very moist (nearly saturated) soil conditions, the calcined bone fragments were the consistency of bone meal or putty and could not be recovered for potential faunal identification. Excavation of Feature 2 continued to a depth of approximately 268 cmbs, where the bottom of the feature terminated into the surrounding yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay matrix. As both features extended outside of Trench 2, the extent and positions of Features 1 and 2 were evident in the Test Unit 1 profile along the margin of Trench 2. In profile, Feature 1 clearly extended into and truncated the top of Feature 2 (Figure 5.11; Appendix G, Photograph 9). 5.2.3.3 Site Summary Site 41DL563 is a deeply-buried prehistoric site within the Tenmile Creek floodplain. The chronological age and function of the site are not known, but it likely is of Late Prehistoric age and pertains to use of the landform for a variety of habitation or resource extraction functions. The presence of deep, alluvial soil deposition across the landform has likely served to cap and preserve the archeological deposits at the site, a characteristic that is supported by the presence of multiple potential prehistoric cultural features. Although the landform that contains 41DL563 has been subject to agriculture since the mid-to-late 19th century and modern utility infrastructure, the deeply-buried nature of the site is likely to have protected it from those impacts. Therefore, the site is likely to preserve significant archeological data. 5.2.4 Site 41DL564 5.2.4.1 Survey Observations During this survey, 41DL564 was documented within the proposed Option 1 alignment (Figure 5.12; Appendix H, Photographs 1 through 3). The site was initially encountered within AT 20, which yielded mammal bone fragments at a depth of approximately 120 cmbs (Appendix H, Photographs 4 and 5). The site was partially delineated through the excavation of four backhoe trenches (Trenches 5 through 8). The site extended along a generally level portion of the Tenmile Creek floodplain, likely a natural levee, at an elevation of approximately 415 ft amsl. Site 41DL564 was documented within an area that extended approximately 89 m north-to-south by 30 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.24 ha (0.6 ac) within the survey area. The site was delineated based on extent of positive excavations and the survey area boundary. The site was not completely delineated within the survey area to the north due to lacking rights-of-entry. The site is likely to extend outside of the survey area to the north, east, and west. Trenches excavated within 41DL564 exhibited a soil profile that consisted of varying degrees of near-surface disturbances overlying alluvial sediments characterized by laminated silt and clays that transitioned to more developed soil zones with depth (Figure 5.13). Strata comprised of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay were typically observed to underly the surface layer, before transitioning to brown (10YR 5/3) or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay with depth. Trench 5 was excavated adjacent to the location of AT 20 to further investigate the recovery of mammal bone fragments at that location. The soil profile exposed within Trench 5 consisted of a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay to a depth of 64 cmbs. This overlaid a stratum of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay to a depth of 104 cmbs. Between 104 cmbs and 160 cmbs, a layer of brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay was encountered. Soils then transitioned to a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 39

silty clay that extended to a depth of 370 cmbs. Within the upper portion of the dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay zone, charcoal flecks were common in the soil matrix and very large mammal bones (cf. Bos or Bison) were observed in moderate frequency (approximately 30 fragments) within the trench and excavated fill at a depth range of approximately 180 to 220 cmbs (Appendix H, Photograph 6). Due to the presence of charcoal and very large mammal bones within Trench 5 and the adjacent AT 20, a control column was excavated within the Trench 5 profile. Within the control column, one additional very large mammal bone was recovered from a depth of 170 to 180 cmbs. The soil profile exposed within Trench 6 consisted of a surface layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay to a depth of 146 cmbs. This overlaid a stratum of pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay to a depth of 300 cmbs. Between 300 cmbs and 380 cmbs, a layer of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt was encountered. The soil profile exposed within Trench 7 consisted of a surface layer of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy clay loam to a depth of 36 cmbs. This overlaid a stratum of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay to a depth of 190 cmbs. Between 190 cmbs and 220 cmbs, a layer of brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay was encountered. Soils transitioned to a gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay to a depth of 360 cmbs. The soil profile exposed within Trench 8 consisted of a surface layer of brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay loam to a depth of 36 cmbs. This overlaid a stratum of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay to a depth of 114 cmbs. Between 114 cmbs and 173 cmbs, a layer of brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay was encountered. Soils transitioned to a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay that extended to a depth of 275 cmbs, then to dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay at a depth of 300 to 345 cmbs. Within Trench 8, additional very large mammal bone fragments were encountered at a depth range of approximately 200 to 240 cmbs within the trench fill. Feature 1 was observed within Trench 8 at a depth of 245 cmbs. 5.2.4.2 Feature Feature 1 was observed at a depth of approximately 245 cmbs during the excavation of Trench 8. The presence of the feature was initially indicated by the observation of organic-rich fill containing charcoal, burned bone fragments, and mussel shell observed within the excavated trench fill (Appendix H, Photograph 10). Based on the observation of the organic-rich fill, mechanical excavation of the trench ceased, and the trench profiles and floor were visually examined. Feature 1 was located in the profile of the trench headwall as a small, shallow pit approximately 20 cm wide and 10 cm deep. All excavated feature fill was screened. Other than charcoal, ash, very small (approximately 2 to 5 millimeter [mm]) burned bone fragments, and two mussel shells, no additional artifacts were encountered within the fill of Feature 1. A fragment of charcoal was recovered from Feature 1 and submitted for radiocarbon analysis (see Section 5.2.4.3). 5.2.4.3 Radiocarbon Analysis Results Of particular importance in the evaluation of a prehistoric archeological site for inclusion in the NRHP is the potential for the site to contribute information important to understanding prehistory. This information potential is contingent upon the degree of preservation and the applicability of the associated data to local and regional research questions. The availability and adequacy of information regarding site function, context, and chronological placement is essential to a comprehensive evaluation. Because research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and previous research, the determination of site context and chronology of sites and site components is a particularly important objective during the evaluation process. During the survey investigations at 41DL564, charred botanical material samples were observed in several subsurface contexts. A fragment of wood charcoal recovered from a depth of 245 cmbs within Feature 1 was submitted for radiocarbon dating. The results of radiocarbon dating indicate that Feature 1 was used between AD 1295 and 1404, placing it firmly within the early portion of the Late Prehistoric II period (Table 5.2; see Table 3.3).

The site was occupied during the early stage of the Late Prehistoric II period between approximately AD 1300 and 1400. The function of the site is largely unknown, but certainly site activities included the butchering of large game animals. Whether the portion of the site within the survey area is part of a larger habitation site or base camp is presently unknown.

of deep, alluvial soil deposition across the landform has served to cap and preserve the archeological deposits at the site, a characteristic that is supported by the presence of a prehistoric cultural feature. Although the landform that contains 41DL564 has been subject to agriculture since the mid-to-late 19th century and modern utility infrastructure, the deeply-buried nature of the site is likely to have protected it from those impacts. Therefore, the site is likely to preserve significant archeological data. 5.2.5 Site 41DL565 5.2.5.1 Survey Observations During this survey, 41DL565 was documented within the proposed Option 3 alignment (Figure 5.14; Appendix G, Photographs 1 through 6). The site was initially encountered within Trench 23, which yielded a buried feature at a depth spanning 252 to 265 cmbs (Appendix G, Photographs 7 through 9). The site was delineated through the excavation of two additional trenches (Trenches 24 and 25) and an auger test (AT24). The site extended along a generally level portion of the Tenmile Creek floodplain at an elevation of approximately 412 ft amsl. Site 41DL545 was documented within an area extending approximately 50 m north-to-south by 30 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.12 ha (0.3 ac) within the survey area. The site was delineated based on the extent of positive excavations and the extent of the survey area. The site likely extends outside of the survey area to the east. Trenches excavated within 41DL565 exhibited a soil profile that consisted of undisturbed alluvial sediments characterized by laminated silt and clays that transitioned to more developed soil zones with depth (Figure 5.15). The construction fill was minimal within Trenches 24 and 25. Strata comprised of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam were observed from the surface to depths not exceeding 50 cmbs in Trench 23. Soils transitioned to a 130-cm- thick stratum consisting of dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam with very pale brown (10YR 7/3). At a depth ranging from 180 cmbs to 300 cmbs, soils consisted of a pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam. Feature 1 was encountered between 255 cmbs to 265 cmbs. Soils slowly transitioned to a dark gray (10YR4/1) clay loam. Trench 23 was terminated at 326 cmbs. Trenches 24 and 25 featured a slightly different soil profile. The upper-most soil consisted of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam. Very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt laminations increased with depth. At a depth of 170 cmbs to 175 cmbs, soils transitioned to a brown (10YR 5/3) loam. Beneath this, a stratum of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam was encountered to depths ranging from 250 cmbs to 290 cmbs. Trenches 24 and 25 were terminated at depths of 390 cmbs and 385 cmbs, respectively. No cultural materials were observed within these trenches. 5.2.5.2 Feature Feature 1 initially presented at a depth of approximately 252 cmbs during the excavation of Trench 23 within the trench floor (Appendix I, Photograph 7). The area was manually skimmed to expose a generally circular area which exhibited a faint light red (2.5YR 6/8) staining, charcoal, and ash within the pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam matrix within the trench floor. Feature 1 was clearly exposed by a depth of 255 cmbs and measured approximately 25 cm in diameter (Appendix I, Photograph 8). Due to the presence of the potential intact prehistoric feature, Test Unit 1 measured 50-cm-by-50-cm and was placed within the trench floor. Test Unit 1 was oriented to bisect Feature 1 for manual excavation and to adequately document and determine the artifact contents of the feature. The feature appeared to be the base of a small, conical pit with very diffuse margins. Feature 1 extended to a depth of approximately 265 cmbs, where the feature diminished to a generally circular stain of faint light red (2.5YR 6/8) clay (Appendix I, Photograph 9). Other than charcoal, ash, and reddened (non-vitrified) clay observed within the feature fill, no artifacts were encountered during the excavation of Feature 1. 5.2.5.3 Site Summary Site 41DL565 is a deeply-buried prehistoric site within the Tenmile Creek floodplain. The chronological age and function of the site are not known, but it likely is of Late Prehistoric age and pertains to use of the landform for a variety of habitation or resource extraction functions. The presence of deep, alluvial soil deposition across the landform has likely served to cap and preserve the archeological deposits at the site. Although the landform that contains 41DL565 has been subject to agriculture since the mid-to-late 19th century and modern utility infrastructure, the deeply-buried nature of the site is likely to have protected it from those impacts. Therefore, the site is likely to preserve significant archeological data. 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 46

5.2.6 Site 41DL566 5.2.6.1 Survey Observations During this survey, 41DL566 was documented within the proposed construction access road extending south from Lavender Road and the Option 3 reroute alignment (Figure 5.16; Appendix J, Photographs 1 through 7). The site was initially encountered within ST 21, excavated near a metal water supply or drainpipe observed immediately outside of the survey area to the west (see Appendix J, Photographs 4 and 5). Excavation of ST 21 yielded a wire nail at a depth of approximately 0 to 20 cmbs (Appendix J, Photograph 8). The site was delineated through the excavation of six shovel tests (STs 19 through 24). The site extended along a generally level terrace landform above the Tenmile Creek floodplain at an elevation of approximately 416 ft amsl. Site 41DL566 was documented within an area extending approximately 38 m north-to-south by 30 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.12 (0.3 ac) within the survey area. The site was delineated based on extent of positive excavations and the extent of the survey area. The site likely extends outside of the survey area to the west. Shovel tests excavated within 41DL566 exhibited a soil profile that consisted of a disturbed layer of construction fill and debris within the shallow subsurface. Artifacts were recovered within STs 21 and 22. The site has been disturbed by the demolition of the farmstead, excavation of a livestock pond immediately east of the site, and construction of an existing access road associated with the Oncor overhead electric utility lines ROW to the south 5.2.6.2 Artifacts Historic-age artifacts were recovered within two shovel tests (STs 21 and 22) excavated at 41DL566 (Table 5.3). Within ST 21, a single 4d wire nail (post-1908; Adams 2002; Wells 1998) was recovered (see Appendix J, Photograph 8). A variety of nails, domestic container glass, window glass, sheet metal fragments, and a brick were recovered within ST 22 (Appendix J, Photographs 9 and 10). The brick recovered within ST 22 was a machine- made, red-paste brick that lacked any manufacturing stamp. Nails from ST 22 included 2d (n=1), 4d (n=1), and 10d (n=1) wire nail examples (post-1908), in addition to an indeterminate wire nail fragment and a possible cut nail fragment. Window glass recovered in ST 22 comprised a single fragment of light green window glass and one fragment of light aqua window glass. Domestic container glass from ST 22 (n=12) included examples of manganese solarized (n=1; 1870s to 1920; Lockhart 2006), selenium-arsenic decolorized (“straw-tint;” n=3; post-1912 to 1960s; Scholes 1952), aqua (n=1), amber (n=4), and colorless (n=3) glass. All artifacts documented at site 41DLx-04 were observed within the uppermost 20 cmbs.

5.2.6.3 Archival Research Site 41DL566 is within the 320-ac Franklin Brigance Survey, Abstract 103, patented on 11 February 1846. The property was briefly owned by W. T. Lavender in the late 19th century (Table 5.4). William Tolbert Lavender was a Confederate soldier and served as a sergeant in Company I, 18th Texas Cavalry, Darnell’s Regiment. His mother, Margaret Hall Little Lavender, emigrated to the region during the second wave of migration to settle the Peters Colony, and became an important member of the local community. Following the Civil War, W. T. Lavender also rose to a level of local prominence. However, the original Lavender homestead was located farther west near the intersection of Belt Line Road and Nokomis Road. It is likely that 41DL566 was occupied by tenants or employees of the family. Table 5.4: Chain of Title for 41DL566 Grantor Grantee Date Volume Page Heirs of Thomas J. Kelley: Charles A.

Although Margaret Hall Little Lavender and W. T. Lavender were important individuals in the local community, the Lavender homestead was located elsewhere and 41DL566 is likely to have been occupied by tenants or employees of the family. Demolition of the farmstead and continued modern development near the site location has extensively disturbed and severely compromised the contextual integrity of the site. Therefore, the site is unlikely to preserve significant archeological data. 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 51

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS During this cultural resources survey for the Tenmile Creek 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project, approximately 4.2 mi (35 ac) of corridor alignments for the construction of the sanitary sewer relief interceptor pipeline were surveyed through pedestrian reconnaissance and intensive survey. Twenty-four shovel tests, 24 auger tests, and 25 backhoe trenches were excavated through the course of survey. As a result of this survey, one previously recorded prehistoric archeological site (41DL229) and one historic-age archeological site were revisited (Appendix K). Three new prehistoric archeological sites (41DL563, 41DL564, and 41DL565) and one new historic-age archeological site (41DL566) were encountered (Appendix K). The eligibility recommendations of these cultural resources are briefly summarized within Table 6.1 and are detailed below. Table 6.1: Summary of NRHP/SAL Eligibility Recommendations Resource ID NRHP/SAL Eligibility Recommendations 41DL229 Not Eligible within APE 41DL360 Not Eligible within APE 41DL563 Undetermined 41DL564 Undetermined 41DL565 Undetermined 41DL566 Not eligible within the APE 41DL229 pertains to a previously recorded prehistoric site of unknown age or function, located partially within the Option 2 and 3 alignments. Based on the survey data, 41DL229 consists of a sparse assemblage of lithic artifacts in a shallow subsurface context. Cultural materials encountered at the site consist of chipped lithic debitage, a core, and burned rock. Due to the paucity of artifacts and lack of cultural features, faunal remains, or other dateable organic materials observed at the site, 41DL229 is unlikely to preserve archeological data important to understanding prehistory within the North-Central Texas region. Furthermore, the contextual integrity of the site has likely been compromised by agricultural activities. Based on the lack of association with a significant historical event(s) or person(s), the absence of innovative or artistic design elements or architectural features, and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the portion of 41DL229 within the APE is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, C, or D or for SAL designation. No further evaluation or mitigation efforts are recommended for the portion of this site within the APE. 41DL360 pertains to a segment of earthen embankment associated with the early 20th century Texas Electric Railway within the Options 1, 2, and 3 alignments. The portion of 41DL360 within the APE is a small segment of a singular linear feature devoid of railroad-related hardware or additional features. Based on the lack of association with a significant historical event(s) or person(s), the absence of innovative or artistic design elements or architectural features, and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the portion of 41DL360 within the APE is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, C, or D or for SAL designation. No further evaluation or mitigation efforts are recommended for the portion of this site within the APE. 41DL563 pertains to a prehistoric site of unknown age or function, located within the Option 1 alignment. Based on the survey data, 41DL563 consists of a habitation site with two cultural features encountered at a depth range of 230 to 268 cmbs. Cultural materials encountered at the site consist of the two features and a minor amount of faunal bone. Based on this survey effort, the NRHP-eligibility of 41DL563 is undetermined. Due to the deeply- buried nature of the site and the presence of multiple prehistoric cultural features, additional investigation of 41DL563 would be necessary to adequately assess the NRHP-eligibility of the site under Criterion D or designation as a SAL. Therefore, avoidance of the site by the selection of the Option 2 reroute alignment is recommended. 41DL564 pertains to a prehistoric site, dating to the early portion of the Late Prehistoric II period, located within the Option 1 alignment. Based on the survey data, 41DL564 consists of a habitation site with well-preserved faunal remains (including bison) and a cultural feature encountered at a depth range of 180 to 255 cmbs. Cultural materials encountered at the site consist of a small pit feature, charcoal, faunal bone, and mussel shell. Based on this survey effort, the NRHP-eligibility of 41DL564 is undetermined. Due to the deeply-buried nature of the site and the presence of a prehistoric cultural feature and well preserved faunal and botanical remains, additional 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 53

investigation of 41DL564 would be necessary to adequately assess the NRHP-eligibility of the site under Criterion D or designation as a SAL. Therefore, avoidance of the site by the selection of the Option 2 reroute alignment is recommended. 41DL565 pertains to a prehistoric site of unknown age or function, located within the Option 3 reroute alignment. Based on the survey data, 41DL565 consists of a habitation site with a cultural feature encountered at a depth range of 252 to 265 cmbs. Cultural materials encountered at the site consist entirely of the feature. Based on this survey effort, the NRHP-eligibility of 41DL565 is undetermined. Due to the deeply-buried nature of the site and the presence of a prehistoric cultural feature, additional investigation of 41DL565 would be necessary to adequately assess the NRHP-eligibility of the site under Criterion D or designation as a SAL. Therefore, avoidance of the site by the selection of the Option 2 reroute alignment is recommended. 41DL566 pertains to an early 20th century farmstead located partially within the Options 1 and 3 alignments and a proposed construction access road. Based on the survey data, 41DL566 consists of the remnants of domestic and architectural debris within a disturbed shallow subsurface context associated with the demolished farmstead. Based on the lack of association with a significant historical event(s) or person(s), the absence of innovative or artistic design elements or architectural features, and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the portion of 41DL566 within the APE is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, C, or D or for SAL designation. No further evaluation or mitigation efforts are recommended for the portion of this site within the APE. Provided the TRA selects the Option 2 reroute alignment to avoid impacts to sites 41DL563, 41DL564, and 41DL565, it is the recommendation of IES that the Tenmile Creek 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project be permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resources investigations.. If Option 2 reroute alignment is not selected additional coordination with the THC will be required prior to project construction. If any cultural resources, other than those detailed within this report, are encountered within the APE during construction, the operators should immediately stop construction activities in the area of the inadvertent discovery. The project cultural resources consultant should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with the THC and USACE prior to resuming construction activities. In addition, if project designs change, and areas outside the APE detailed within this report are to be impacted, additional field investigations may be required. 40TM-2 Relief Interceptor Pipeline Improvements Project IES Project No. 04.080.064 Cultural Resources Survey Report Page 54
