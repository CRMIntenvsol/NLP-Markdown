ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE ARMADILLO SITE i ABSTRACT Chesapeake Energy Corporation has recently entered into a lease agreement with Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport for natural gas exploration on airport property. During archaeological survey of a pipeline study corridor in October of 2007, a prehistoric site with buried cultural material was identified. Further testing was recommended for the Armadillo site (41TR219) to determine its eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. Testing revealed that the site deposit was contained in a natural swale. Based on the projectiles recovered occupation was during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. Due to the lack of geological stratigraphy, the low density and mixing of the few datable artifacts, and the absence of datable organic materials that might have provided data for environmental reconstruction, the site is not recommended for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that construction proceed within the pipeline study corridor. eee AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 1 INTRODUCTION Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) recently entered into a lease agreement with Chesapeake Energy Corporation authorizing Chesapeake to explore for and produce natural gas on DFW property. The airport property is roughly defined by State Highway 121 and Interstate Highway 635 on the northeast and north, by SH360 and the channel of Big Bear Creek to the west, by SH183 on the south and President George Bush Turnpike to the east and southeast. During October 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a pedestrian survey of a section of the pipeline study corridor north of Glade Road and west of West Airfield Drive in Tarrant County, Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4491 (Figure 1). A prehistoric site, 41TR219, was recorded in the pipeline study corridor south of padsite BN and north of Glade Road. Chesapeake Energy proposed to bore under the prehistoric site, yet due to the potential for hydraulic fracturing to occur within the site boundaries during the bore process which could impact the site, further testing was recommended in order to determine if the site is eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Properties and as a State Archeological Landmark (Shelton and Todd 2007). All testing of the site was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4773. Padsites/lateral — Construction Area Pipeline Study Corridor ~ Figure 1.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 2 Site 41TR219 is located on the northwest bank of an intermittent tributary that drains west into Big Bear Creek. Shovel tests during the survey were used to define the horizontal limits of the sediments containing cultural materials at the site (Appendix 1). Sediments containing artifacts appeared to be confined to a depth of less than a meter, and 75 lithic artifacts were found in the upper 80 cm of these sediments. These sediments ranged in color from very dark brown (10YR3/1) to dark yellow brown (10YR4/6) sandy loam with no pronounced stratification. One shovel test ST60 was placed in the center of the area having the highest artifact concentration, and thirty artifacts consisting of flakes, chips, and fire-cracked rock were encountered between 20 and 80 cm. Augering within the site area revealed that the top of a reddish sandy clay existed just below the maximum depth of shovel testing at an average depth from 75 to 97 cm below the surface. In five of the shovel test locations augering was extended below the A horizon into the sandy clay to depths of up to 138 cm. Outside the site area yellowish red (SYR5/8) sandy clay was encountered at a depth of 19 cm. The purpose of the investigation was to determine the significance the Armadillo site. This report has been prepared for review by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission as part of their Section 106 review process. This report was written in accordance with report guidelines adopted by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report presents a brief description of the natural and cultural environmental resources of the area. The research design, methodology, and the results of the testing follow. Recommendations and references cited conclude the report.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 3 NATURAL ENVIRONMENT The DFW property straddles the Blackland Prairie/Eastern Cross Timbers biotic zones and falis in an ecotone environment. These two distinct biotic zones are affected by the underlying geological strata and the overlying soils and sediments (Diggs, Lipscomb, and O’Kennon 1999). The natural divide between these two geological formations is east of Big Bear Creek which runs from the northwest to the southeast through airport property and joins with Little Bear Creek to form Bear Creek to the south. To the east, the Late Cretaceous Eagle Ford limestone underlies Heiden or Houston Black series clayey soils in the Blackland Prairie that are mostly level over thin bedrock (Coffee, Hill, and Ressel 1980:2). Both clays are upland soils and are moderately to well drained on gentle slopes (Coffee et al. 1980:61). The western side of the airport property is underlain by the Woodbine sandstone formation (Fisher 1972). The soils along Big Bear and Bear Creek and their tributaries range from loamy soils of shallow to moderate depth along narrow ridges to sandy to fine sandy loams on the slopes of drainages. The Armadillo site location is in deep Silawa fine sandy loam and Whitesboro loam is in the floodplain of the unnamed perennial creek tributary adjacent to the site (Ressel 1981: Sheet 20). The B horizon for the Silawa fine sandy loam is described as first occurring at 6 inches and extending to 46 inches below ground surface. The B horizon is red to yellowish red sandy clay (Ressel 1981:50). The topography from the site rises to the east then drops off to relatively level pastureland. To the west, the terrain is a gradual slope downward to Big Bear Creek, and then rises up on the west side of the creek. Fields of Uvalde Gravel (Byrd 1971) are known to occur in upland settings between the airport and the valleys of the Elm Fork and the West Fork to the east and south (Menzer and Slaughter 1971:217). In addition, these gravel fields occur northeast of the East Fork of the Trinity River (Trask 2005). These gravels are likely to be an eastward extension of Ogallala gravels (Banks 1990:56) and similar gravel fields could be present in the study area. The Eastern Cross Timbers biotic zone contains dense oak woodlands in the bottomlands and covering the uplands (Prikryl 1990:12-13). The western edge of the airport and along Bear Creek has diverse vegetation with open savannahs, dense brush, and various woody species (Diggs et al. 1999:46). This diverse biotic zone is attractive to a variety of mammals such as deer, coyote and badgers as well as quail, dove and songbirds (Ressel 1981). AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 4 CULTURAL HISTORY Prehistoric occupation dates before 8500 BP, and is identified by distinctive spear points such Clovis, Dalton and Plainview. These types of artifacts have been recovered from deeply buried floodplain deposits along the various forks of the Trinity River in North Central Texas (Crook and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001). Daniel Prikryl reported that in the Lower Elm Fork area most of the Paleoindian sites are located on the terraces above the floodplain (1990:19). The Early Archaic period 8500-6000 BP coincides with the onset of a drying period in North Central Texas that marks the termination of the Pleistocene period, and isolated Early Archaic components have been reported in the area. The Middle Archaic period 6000 — 3500 BP saw stabilization in the environment that is reflected in current climate conditions and vegetation which consists of oak-savannah and grasslands that are present as the Eastern Cross Timbers. Middle Archaic sites are typically located on terraces adjacent to the Elm Fork of the Trinity River rather than on tributary terraces (Prikryl 1990:73). The population in North Central Texas as shown by number of sites saw a significant increase during the Late Archaic 3500-1250 BP. A wetter environment contributed to increase of mast crops attractive to humans as well as game animals within the Eastern Cross Timbers woodlands (Prikryl 1990:74). Sites from this time period are typically found on perennial tributaries and not along the Elm Fork channel. During the Late Archaic, there was a significant increase in the use of quartzite for the manufacture of Gary, Ellis, Elam and Dallas projectile points (Prikryl 1990:76). Skinner (1981) suggests that a settling in occurs along the major and minor tributary environments during this period. Sedentary life ways increased during the Late Prehistoric I period from 1250-750 BP. The appearance of ceramics, the bow and arrow and houses in the archaeological record coincided with a drier climate shift. Site density decreased along tributaries during this period. The percentage of quartzite tools decreases from the Late Archaic and diagnostics from this period include expanded stem arrow points such as Scallorn and Alba (Prikryl 1990:79-83). By the Late Prehistoric II 750-250 BP, there is an increase in buffalo bones in site deposits and a shift in the tool kit with the appearance of Harrell, Fresno and Washita arrow points, along with scrapers and flake drills. Sites from this time period are typically located on sandy terraces above the floodplains of major tributaries (Prikry] 1990:80). Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been found in North-Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas and is possibly due to the Native Americans migrating out of the area because they were unable to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988:103). Within Dallas County, members of the Caddoan and Cherokee groups occupied the areas surrounding the Trinity River until the mid 1840’s (Handbook of Texas Online 2006). AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 5 The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around 1840, and Lonesome Dove, settled in 1845. Lonesome Dove, located near present-day Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant County (Garrett 1972:55). Many settlers came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although only 160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57). The Civil War took its toll on the North Central Texas population, as most of the able-bodied men left to fight for the Confederacy. Fort Worth was later spurred by growth of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000 head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. From the 1940s and 1950s, Tarrant County’s many factories began to turn out a wide variety of products, including airplanes, helicopters, mobile homes, electronics, and plastics. The development of the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport also generated considerable revenue and contributed to the increase of population of Grapevine. Hay, beef, cattle, wheat, and horticulture are the chief agricultural products today. The population has grown steadily over the last hundred years (Hightower 2006). Before the development of the DFW property began in 1969, the land between present day Highway 114 and SH 183 was primarily agricultural land, and has been in continuous use since the 1880’s. Sam Street’s Map of Tarrant County (1893) indicates the parcel of land where the Armadillo site is located was utilized grazing or cultivation at the turn of the century. Previous Investigations Multiple investigations have been performed along the drainages of Big Bear Creek on the airport property as well as along Bear Creek, Grapevine Creek, and Cottonwood Creek near the study area; these have been discussed by Chapman and Skinner in The Archaeological Potential of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas (2006). Specifically, prehistoric sites, which are primarily lithic scatters, have been recorded during surveys along the terraces and slopes of the drainages to Big Bear Creek (Prikryl 1990; Texas Archeological Site Atlas 2007). Several prehistoric sites in similar settings to the Armadillo site have been recorded in the Bear Creek corridor. Few terrace sites have been excavated within or adjacent to the airport property. Between 1972 and 1973, the proposed route for the extension of SH 360 was surveyed for archaeological sites. Three prehistoric sites (labeled A, B, and C) were recorded during the survey; site B (41TR63) was located northwest of confluence of Little Bear and Big Bear Creek on the western edge of airport property. A total of 1,487 artifacts were collected from the surface; these artifacts included twenty-seven stemmed and unstemmed Archaic bifaces. In the 23 test units, 414 artifacts were recorded; cores, flakes, chips and charcoal were recovered in the top six inches of soil (Lorrain 1973a:3). Northwest of the Armadillo site on DFW property, a Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric buried site deposit (41TR21) contained chert and quartzite lithics was tested (Ferring 1992:9). The areas of the site are located in two geological contexts: shallow deposits in AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 6 area A on a sandy terrace 1.5 — 2 m above the Big Bear Creek floodplain and stratified deposits in area B in the colluvium/alluvium at the terrace-floodplain margin (Ferring 1992:13). Fifteen test units were excavated with lithics being the primary artifacts class present; additional artifacts included a ceramic pipe fragment and isolated burned bone fragments which were recorded in area B. Over 1,400 artifacts were recovered during testing. Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric diagnostic projectile points were recorded on the surface, and one Late Prehistoric Washita point was recovered in area B at 30 cm below surface. The Big Bear Creek surveys were performed by Hayden Whitsett and Dan Fox in 1979 and 1980 for the Texas Department of Water Resources. Several of the prehistoric sites recorded had been originally located by Larry Banks before the airport was built. These surface scatters of lithics and burned rock were located along Big Bear Creek (TASA 2007; Prikryl 1990). Many of these sites were located in sandy terrace and ridge soils overlooking the creek or its tributaries. No subsurface testing was conducted during these surveys. In the West Fork drainage, Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites have been recorded in several settings such as in floodplains, on Pleistocene terraces and or in valleys adjacent to intermittent drainages (Skinner, Caren, and Trask 1999:72). A Late Archaic deposit was recorded in the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity River in 1996 (Ferring and Byers 1996). Preservation of mussel and animal bone was good, and lithic artifacts and fire-cracked rock were present. An additional site recorded floodplain adjacent to the West Fork of the Trinity River was site 41TR162 which was a buried deposit located along an abandoned meander of Walker Branch in River Legacy Park (Skinner et al. 1999). Site 41TR162 was between 30 and 40 cm below the surface and contained Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric points, pottery, and mussel shell (Skinner et al. 1999:45). Terrace sites within the West Fork drainage with buried deposits include the Fountain site (41TR136) and the Chambers site (41TR114). Excavations of the Fountain site uncovered hearths, postholes, and a cache pit dating from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric (Hanson and Kvernes 1997). Chert was the primary lithic material recovered; the lithic assemblage consisted mainly of tertiary flakes, with low densities of primary (3%) and secondary (14%) flakes in the 13,000+ flakes recovered. Arrow points were common at the site, and other artifacts included a small sample of pottery and bones of deer and bison. The Chambers (41TR114) site was located on a benched area above an ephemeral stream channel in northwest Tarrant County. A total of 136 dart points were recovered and were primarily from the Late Prehistoric period with few types (6) from the Late Archaic. Pottery and faunal remains were present as well (Glasgow 1990).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 7 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY Site 41TR219 appears to be a low density site deposit that covers more than 3,000 sq. meters. The results from the shovel tests indicated that artifacts were present from ground level to 80 cm below the surface. Lithic debris is the only artifact class recorded during shovel testing, with less than 75 artifacts in the 25 shovel tests used to define the site limits. Shovel tests failed to reveal any distinct cultural or soil horizons and no evidence of organic preservation was found. One Late Prehistoric arrow point was found in the backdirt of an armadillo hole within the site; therefore, we inferred that lithics had been worked here in the past. Within the thin scatter of artifacts recorded, there appears to be a 15 x 20 m “artifact concentration” located roughly in the center of the site. Upon survey, the function or age of the site was not understood, nor was sufficient information available as to what the environment was like. The site is located in alluvial/colluvial soils adjacent to an intermittent tributary of Big Bear Creek. Bank profiles and shovel tests placed outside the site boundaries indicated that the immediate area has been flooded regularly, and it appeared that the site has been disturbed by bioturbation based on the rodent and armadillo burrows noted throughout the site. Based on the limited information on the artifact distribution and the environmental setting, two hypotheses about prehistoric occupation at site 41TR219 were proposed. Site 41TR219 may be the location of a hunting camp that was temporarily occupied during the Late Prehistoric period on the edge of an intermittent tributary of Big Bear Creek. Deer and small mammal hunting may have been the prime purpose of this site, but at the time of occupation tools were repaired and nearby Ogallala gravels were collected and worked into chipped stone tools. It is expected that fire-cracked rock and hearths may be present and that animal bones should be present if the soil acidity is not too high. It is also our expectation that the artifact spread may be due to bioturbation and that a relatively thin occupation surface was once present. If this is true, it will be important to recognize the occupation surface and any features that may be preserved in place. The alternative to the above is that the site was occupied for a longer period of time by very small groups or an individual and that the artifact spread represents the length of occupation. This scenario would be supported by the presence of datable artifacts within the thin deposit, specifically from the top to the bottom of the deposit. Methodology The site boundaries fall within the pipeline study corridor; specifically the eastern boundary of the site begins at the pipeline centerline and continues to the west southwest approximately 45 m. The pipeline study corridor is 300 foot wide, and the three pipelines to be installed are between 16 and 24 inches in diameter and will be buried up to 15 feet below ground surface during the bore process. Testing was recommended due to the AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 8 potential for hydraulic fracturing which can occur during the boring process. Hydraulic fracturing could impact the site. In order to test for buried deposits in the pipeline study corridor APE, AR Consultants, Inc. excavated backhoe trenches throughout the site. The profiles of the backhoe trenches were examined for features or distinct cultural levels in the soil and were excavated until the C horizon was encountered or up to 3 m deep. Nine 1 x 1 m test units were placed at any features uncovered in the trenching. In addition, four units were placed at the site center where the highest artifact density was located during shovel testing, and two test units were placed within the boundaries of the site outside of the artifact concentration as control units. The northwest corner was used as the point of reference, as the site is on a gradual northeast to southwest slope. The test units were dug in arbitrary 10 cm levels and all soils was screened through 4" screens. Soil samples were collected to test the acidity of the soil as well as to measure sand grain size. Also, carbon was to be collected from the features for dating and environmental reconstruction. Excavations were done by a five person crew shovel skimming dirt into screens. Test units were excavated to levels below the presence of any artifacts or until the B horizon was encountered. Excavations of test units that contained two sterile levels within the A horizon were augered to the B horizon. A base map of the site and the immediate study area was created. The map showed the locations of shovel tests, test units, backhoe trenches, bank profile, and the location of the arrowpoint recovered from the armadillo burrow back dirt. Level forms and field notes were kept for each unit, while photographs and profiles were made of unique features or distinctive stratigraphy recorded within the test units. Artifacts from the site were washed, identified, cataloged, and labeled according to the curation standards of the TARL. During the analysis, stone tools were separated from lithic debris and categorized using formal tool types. The analysis of the lithic debris included the identification of cores, flakes, and shatter. The terms primary, secondary, and interior are used to evaluate the reduction process and the lithic assemblage was evaluated using the same basic model in the De Cordova Bend excavations (Skinner 1971). Fire-cracked rock was separated from the lithic debris and weighed by level in each test unit. Soil samples from several test units were tested for Ph level, sand grain size measured, and the soils were washed through 1/16” inch screen to determine if microlithics are present. Artifacts and records will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 9 RESULTS The results section begins with an introduction of the study area, followed by descriptions of the eight backhoe trenches. The descriptions of nine test units follow. Artifacts are briefly mentioned in the test unit section, and are described in detail in the analysis, which is the third section. In addition the result of the soil analysis is included in this section. The final section includes the conclusions of the testing of the site. Study Area The prehistoric site was recorded during the survey of the pipeline study corridor between padsite BN and Glade Road. Thirty shovel tests were placed along parallel transects within the eastern half of the pipeline study corridor to define the boundaries of the site, which covered approximately 3,253 square meters. The fourteen positive shovel tests were approximately 15-20 m apart. Cultural artifacts recorded in the shovel tests was sparse, with 1-4 artifacts per shovel tests except for three shovel tests which had 8-30 artifacts per shovel tests. Based on the results of the shovel tests, a 15 x 20 m area of “artifact concentration” appeared to be near the center of the site (Figure 2). Trenches Eight backhoe trenches were placed within or adjacent to the site boundaries to gain a better understanding of the underlying geology and to determine if there were any features present within the site boundaries. A composite profile using information from backhoe trenches 1, 5, 8, and 3 illustrates the location of the trenches (Figure 3) and is discussed following the detailed trench descriptions. Backhoe Trench 1 (BHT1) exposed a thin layer (15 cm) of brown (7.5YR4/3) sandy loam that was upslope and outside the site limits. The sandy loam rested on a thick (91 cm) layer of compact yellowish red (SYR4/6) sandy clay that was devoid of cultural materials. The sandy clay is the B horizon of the Silawa fine sandy loam that is the upper A horizon exposed in the trench and in the shovel tests within the site deposit. The profile in BHTS was similar to that in BHT1 and it too was located outside the site boundary. BHT3 revealed an A horizon of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) sandy loam situated adjacent to the creek bank. The southeast end of the trench exposed the contact between the colluvial/alluvial terrace soils and the floodplain deposits of frequently flooded Whitesboro sandy loam described as a narrow band of regularly flooded soil along the southerly flowing intermittent tributary. A fire-cracked rock feature was found in the southeast end of BHT3 at 40 cm below the surface, and was subsequently uncovered. The center of the trench was profiled, and the A horizon is underlain by a meter thick layer of culturally sterile brownish yellow (10YR6/6) sandy clay which rests on a clay which is part of the Woodbine Formation. The clay is also present at the bottom of BHT1 and BHT5 and is the “bedrock” that underlies the site. BHT8 was placed at the northeastern boundary of the artifact concentration and was excavated to 1.51 m below the ground surface (Figure 4). Four soil zones were recorded, AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 13 brown [60%] (10YR5/8) very fine sandy clay with 20% pinkish gray (7.5YR6/2) very fine sandy clay and red [20%] (2.5YR4/6) very fine sandy clay. During the trench excavation and during the recording of the trench descriptions, no distinct surfaces, features, or artifact concentrations were noted. Three unmodified quartzite cobbles were noted in the profile. BHT2 was placed at the outer boundary of the artifact scatter approximately 15 m west of the pipeline centerline. The trench was excavated to a depth of 3.15 m below the present ground surface and revealed that the underlying clay bedrock consists of at least three layers situated under the B horizon. The A horizon is 46 cm thick and was dark brown (7.5YR3/2) very fine clayey loam. The lower boundary is abrupt and rests on yellowish red (5YR5/8) sandy clay that is 81 cm thick and is the B horizon. The first zone of the B horizon was yellowish red (SYR5/8) sandy clay with brownish yellow 10(YR6/6) mottles and was 33 cm thick. Below the B horizon a massive layer of brown (7.5YR4/4) clay with pale yellow (2.5YR7/3) mottles that is 135 cm thick and rests on a layer of mottled brownish yellow (1OYR6/6) sandy clay that is at least 20 cm thick. No cultural material or features were seen during trenching or profiling. The profile BHT4 was similar to that in BHT2; it was at the same elevation within the site boundary, but was south of the artifact concentration. The A horizon in BHT4 was thin to non-existent, and the B horizon was a yellowish red fine sandy clayey loam which was 127 cm thick, followed by brown clay mottled with pale yellow and red sandy clay. Below 170 cm red clay mottled with ironstone and decayed sandstone was encountered. BHT6 was placed at a proposed bore point location within the construction area northeast of the pipeline study corridor and 66 m north of the 41TR219 site boundary. The trench was 14.7 meters long and on an east facing slope. The trench was on a 15 degree angle below level and started on the hill shoulder and continued eastward into the backslope. The stratigraphy for BHT6 is similar to BHT1 and BHTS with a thin A horizon. The Al horizon was from 0-30 cm and was brown (7.5YR4/4) very fine sandy loam with inclusions of Uvalde quartzite that ranged from marble to fist size. The gravel was natural and incorporated into this soil zone. The AB horizon extended from 30-58 cm and was yellowish red (SYR4/6) very slightly sandy clay with fragments of hematite and friable sandstone. The Bt/C horizon, and was from 58-74 cm and was mottled with three distinct soils; each soil was approximately 33% of the matrix. The first soil was strong brown (7.5YR5/8) very fine sandy clay. The second color was red (2.5YR5/8) very fine sandy clay. The third was yellowish brown (10YR5/6) very fine sandy clay with pockets of degrading hematite. Zone IV was from 74-110 cm and was pinkish gray (7.5YR6/2) clay with red (2.5YR4/6) horizontal mottling [40%]. Zone V was from 110+ and was dark reddish gray (2.5YR4/2) clay with mottles [20%] of black. It appears the mottles could be concentrations of iron that has percolated downward and are accumulating in this zone. At the southeastern boundary of the artifact concentration, BHT7 was excavated to a depth of 4.9 m. Zone I was from 0-4 cm and was brown (7.5YR4/3) very fine sandy loam. Zone II was from 4-82 cm and was brown (7.5YR4/4) very fine sandy loam and was very weak, soft, very fine granular. The A horizon ends approximately 1 m below the surface, and the B horizon was encountered in Zone III, which was from 82-121 cm and AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 14 was brown (7.5YR4/4) sandy mottled clay with degrading sandstone inclusions. Zone IV was from 121-137 and was brown (7.5YR4/4) very fine sandy clay with mottles [25%] of yellowish red (SYRS5/6) clay and dark gray [10%] (SYR4/1) clay with inclusions of hematite. Zone V was from 137-245 and was brown (7.5YR4/4) very fine sandy clay mottled with yellowish red [35%] (SYR5/6) clay and dark gray [15%] clay. The last zone from 245 to 490+ is gray shale bedrock. No cultural material or features were observed during trenching or soil recording. Shovel testing, augering, test units, and trenching revealed that the A horizon extended to a depth of no more than 130 cm within the artifact concentration. The A horizon outside the artifact concentration is significantly thinner. This thin A horizon was also exposed outside the site boundaries and in ten shovel tests (ST 1, 2, 35-38, and 47-50) placed in the pipeline study corridor north of the site; strong brown (7.5YR4/6) clay was encountered between 5 and 40 cm. The backhoe data confirm shovel tests results in that the A horizon is much shallower outside of the artifact concentration as illustrated in Figure 3. The profile BHT1, 5, 8, and 3, shows the A horizon continues to become shallower upslope from the site. To the west, Whitesboro floodplain soils are encountered at the end of BHT3. Test Units Nine test units were placed inside the site boundaries. Three units were placed near the burned rock concentration uncovered in BHT3, followed by four units which were placed inside the artifact concentration, and two test units were placed outside the concentration but inside the site boundary as control units. Test units 1, 7, and 8 were placed at the east end of BHT3 where a cluster of burned quartzite rocks was uncovered 40 cm below the surface. TU1 was placed east of the burned rock cluster to determine if cultural material was closer to the bank. Three levels were excavated to 30 cm below surface, and the western half of level four was excavated to 40 cm. This matrix consisted of sandy floodplain clay. No cultural material was recovered. Two additional test units, 7 and 8, were placed adjacent to TU1 to determine if the burned rock concentration extended to the east. Between levels 4 and 6 of TU7 and TU8, an 80 x 35 cm concentration of burned quartzite cobbles and sandstone rocks was uncovered. The burned rock concentration was labeled Feature 1 (Figure 5). Feature 1 was situated in a thin layer of sand below the Whitesboro clay approximately three m from the tributary bank. It consisted of a relatively level burned rock concentration that contained 20 fragments of fire-cracked quartzite cobbles and 79 pieces of burned sandstone (Figure 6). AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 16 A widely dispersed scatter (less than 10 percent density) of charcoal surrounded the burned rock concentration. Soil samples were collected from the charcoal scatter surrounding the burned rock concentration and from the center of Feature 1 for floation. TU7 was excavated to level six and then augered to 20 cm below the concentration, yet no additional cultural material was present within the test units. At the east end of the backhoe trench, there were sandstone and quartzite fire-cracked rocks approximately 40 cm below the surface. These fire-cracked rocks were immediately west of Feature 1 and most likely associated with the burned rock concentration identified as Feature 1 in TU7 and TU8. Since no other features were identified during trenching, four test units (TU2, 3, 4 and 9) were placed within the artifact concentration to determine if there was any vertical stratigraphy present. Artifacts were concentrated between 30 and 60 cm below the surface and fire-cracked rock was present in levels four through twelve of the test units. A soil profile of test units 2, 3, and 9 was constructed to identify the depth of the A horizon which contained the lithic scatter within the artifact concentration (Figure 7).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 17 Two Gary points were found within the artifact concentration; the first in TU4 between 10-20 cm and the second in TU9 between 20-30 cm. Both points are above the artifact concentration shown on the TU2, 3, and 9 profile. Test unit three contained the highest density of artifacts (195) and included fire-cracked rock, lithic debris, biface fragments and one biface. In TU9, two bifaces fragments were located in level seven. Test units TUS and TU6 were placed north and south of the artifact concentration as control units to compare artifact density within the site. The artifact density in TUS was very low, with a total of six lithic artifacts recovered between levels three and six. Sandy clay was encountered at 50 cm. The second control unit, TU6, had a total of 27 lithic artifacts between levels two and five, with sterile clay being encountered at 70 cm. No diagnostics were located in either test unit. The soil profiles within these two test units, along with the soil profile for TU4 located within the concentration, emphasizes how the A horizon is shallower outside the area of artifact concentration (Figure 8).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 18 Analysis Artifacts recovered from the test units and shovel tests were chipped stone tools, bifaces and fragments, lithic debris, and fire-cracked rock. A total of 593 artifacts (Figure 9) were recovered from the test units. The tools included two dart points, three dart point bases, three retouched flakes, two bifaces and six biface fragments. In addition, there were two cores, 384 pieces of unmodified lithic debris, and 192 pieces of fire-cracked rock (Appendix 1). A total of seventy-five artifacts were recovered from the initial shovel tests (Appendix 2). Soil samples were collected from the NW corner of the beginning of each level. Soil samples from TU3, TU6, and Feature 1 were analyzed for acidity levels, sand grain size, and then wet screened to determine if microlithics and organic materials were present.

N=593 Of the diagnostic lithics, two complete dart points and three dart point bases were recovered from the test units (Table 1). In addition, a broken arrowpoint was located in the armadillo burrow backdirt near ST24. The first complete point was a Gary dart point made of chert which was found in TU4 at 10-20 cm. The second complete point was a quartzite Gary point and was recovered from TU9 at 20-30 cm (Figure 10). Gary points are Middle to Transitional Archaic in age and date between ca. 2500 B.C. — A.D. 800 (Turner and Hester 1999:123) and may extend into the Late Prehistoric (Anthony and Brown 1994:12). The base to a chert Yarbrough point was recovered from TU3 at a depth of 100-110 cm. Yarbrough dart points are Late Archaic in age and date between ca. 1500 B.C. and A.D. 700 (Prikryl 1990:62). The broken arrow point is a quartzite Alba point, which is Late Prehistoric dates ca. A.D. 800 - 1200 (Turner and Hester 1999:200). A Late Prehistoric biface was located at level 8 in TU3. These artifacts appear to be mixed, with later artifacts below earlier ones such as the Late Prehistoric biface at 80 cm, which was AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 20 Two retouched chert flakes were recovered from TU2, each from level six and eleven. One chert Late Prehistoric biface was located in level eight. Test unit three also contained four biface fragments; one quartzite midsection in level four, and three chert fragments in levels two, eight, and ten. Test unit 3 also had two chert modified flakes; one each from level two and five. In TU4, a quartzite biface was recovered in level 10 and a quartzite biface fragment was recovered in level eight. A fragment of a quartzite biface was recovered from TU9 in level seven. In the armadillo backdirt near ST32, a quartzite biface fragment was also recovered. Of the 384 pieces of lithic debris recovered from the nine test units, 69.09% were quartzite, 30.40% were chert, and 0.5% was quartz. Within the unmodified lithic debris, 18.59% were secondary flakes, while 11.30% were interior flakes. Only 2.26% were primary flakes, while 63.06% was categorized as primary, secondary, interior chips or lithic shatter. Within the assemblage, there were two cores, which were recovered from TU2 level seven, and TU3 level five. Fire-cracked rock was recovered primarily from Feature 1 and TU3 (Table 2). There was also a thin scatter in TU2, TU4, and TU9. The 192 pieces of fire-cracked rock consisted primarily of sandstone (66.66%) with the remainder being quartzite cobbles (33.33%). In TU3, the fire-cracked rock was spread through levels four and twelve, and there was no clear surface or organic material associated with the fire-cracked rock. The highest concentration of fire-cracked rock of 1284.8 g for TU3 was in level 8. Lithic debris this level was low with only four secondary flakes and 2 pieces of shatter. Bioturbation is the most likely factor for this distribution of fire-cracked rock in TU3; several pieces of quartzite fire-cracked rock were located on the surface adjacent to TU3 and TU2 in the back dirt of armadillo burrows.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 21 of the fire cracked rock recorded in the test units was 5452.2 g; 2925.7 g were recovered from Feature 1, while 1965 g were distributed through TU3. Soil samples were collected at the beginning of each level from the NW corner. Soil from TU3, TU6, and Feature 1 was examined for the sand grain size, the type and size of pebbles, the soil Ph was determined for each level, and the samples were wet screened for artifacts (Appendix 3). In TU3 and 6, the soil was very fine sand, while the upper three levels in TU3 contained some silt mixed with pebbles. The pebbles were primarily sandstone and hematite, with quartzite and quartz pebbles in the lower levels of the test units. Pebble size ranged from 0.5 to 4.0 cm. The very fine sand and small pebble size recorded in the test units most likely contributed to the vertical movement of artifacts within the soil. When the Ph of the soil was measured in TU3, the soil was neutral in the upper two levels, then very slightly acidic between levels three and thirteen. In level fourteen, the soil became medium acidic. In TU6, the upper three levels were neutral, with levels four through six very slightly acidic, and level seven was very strongly acidic. The acidity to the soil is consistent with other terrace sites in sandy soils, and is not conducive to the preservation of organic material (Ferring 1992:14). During wet screening, two interior quartzite chips and one interior quartzite flake were located in levels four and eleven of TU3. These lithics were generally smaller than those recovered during dry screening in the field. Due to the similarity of soils between TU1-6 and 9, and the paucity of artifacts located within the soil samples, the soil collected from the other test units was not analyzed. Vertical movement of the artifacts is due to several factors. The fine sandy loam allowed for the heavier artifacts to “‘settle”, while smaller, lighter artifacts remained in the upper levels. Also, the sandy soil was ideal for animal burrows, many of which appeared to be armadillo burrows scattered throughout the site. The soil collected from Feature 1 was floated to determine if there macrobotanical remains were present. No seeds or other botanical remains floated, and 4 sand-grain size pieces of charcoal were located in the foam that floated. These pieces of charcoal were too small for radiocarbon testing or macrobotanical analysis. Faunal remains were located in the upper levels of TU2, 5, and 6; in TU2 level three there was a small mammal vertebrae, in level four there was half of a mandible to a Cotton Rat (Sigmodou hispidus); and in TU6 level one there was the maxilla of a Virginia Possum (Didelphis virginiana) (Davis and Schmidly 1994). In TUS there was a right metacarpal of a cow (Bos) (Tawater, personal correspondence 2008). The faunal remains were determined to be modern since they were in the upper levels of loamy sand which have a neutral Ph. Conclusions Two hypotheses were presented in the research design to in order to address the prehistoric occupation at 41TR219. Yet neither scenario presented in the hypotheses was confirmed; no occupation surface was identified to support the first scenario, and the paucity of artifacts and the absence of clear vertical stratification of the datable points did not demonstrate long-term occupation as suggested in the second scenario.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 22 Testing revealed a low density multi-component site which appeared to be sparsely occupied during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric. The lithic assemblage at 41TR219 is most likely associated with a sparsely occupied seasonal campsite located adjacent to the tributary stream; there were less than 700 artifacts in the shovel tests and test units and this is a low density per unit/level. No ground stone tools were in the assemblage, which indicates that plant processing was not occurring at the site. In addition, the majority of lithic debris consisted of secondary chips and flakes with only two cores and nine primary flakes, which suggests that unfinished tools were bought to the location but not manufactured from local sources (Skinner 1971:162). The tools recorded were a Late Prehistoric Alba point on the surface, a Gary point in level two of TU4, a Gary point in level three of TU9, and a Late Prehistoric biface in level eight of TU3 are evidence that the site was occupied during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric, yet the points were mixed stratigraphically. Quartzite Ogallala gravels were identified on the south slope of the intermittent tributary during the initial survey, but it is not certain that these gravels were being quarried locally. The site is located in alluvial/colluvial soils adjacent to an intermittent tributary of Big Bear Creek. Due to the vertical distribution of diagnostic lithics, and the lack of distinct features in the trenches and test units within the artifact concentration, it appears that the site center has been disturbed by bioturbation. This interpretation is further evidenced by the presence of rodent and armadillo burrows, and by the abundance of roots found. No occupation surfaces were identified nor were significant organic materials recovered during testing and there was no bone associated with the artifacts, suggesting either that no hunting or animal cooking activities were occurring or that the soil was too acidic for organic preservation. In TU2 and TU3, the fire-cracked rock was widely distributed within the test units, which is further evidence of bioturbation. The Late Archaic Gary point and a Late Archaic Yarbrough base were widely spread in TU3, between 10 and 110 cm, while a Late Prehistoric biface was at 80 cm in TU3.. The burned rock concentration (Feature 1) appears to have been an isolated event, and contained no cultural material within which to identify the function of the concentration. Burned rocks in small concentrations such as in Feature 1 and scattered throughout TU3 could be the remains of stone boiling (Lorrain 1973b:2) or evidence of small hearths. The soil collected from Feature 1 contained no datable organic material or charcoal. The Armadillo site is adjacent to a second-order tributary similar to Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric site distributions discussed by Prikryl (1990:74, 79) in the Lower Elm Fork drainage. Sixty-five percent of Late Archaic sites are situated on first-order tributaries, at their confluence with first- and second-order tributaries, or on second order tributaries (Prikryl 1990:74). Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric site types and artifact densities are highly varied, yet on DFW airport property two previously recorded sites have comparable lithic densities to that found at the Armadillo site. The first site is a multicomponent Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric site (41TR21) which is located on a terrace above Big Bear Creek (Ferring 1992). The second site is an Archaic site (41TR63) which was recorded at the confluence of Little Bear and Big Bear creek (Lorrain 1973a). AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 23 Site 41TR21 had over 1,400 lithic artifacts recorded from fifteen test units placed in two areas (Ferring 1992). The lithic assemblage recovered from the test units in area B (N=700) were similar to 41TR219, in that the majority of the artifacts were quartzite, there were few cores or bifaces, few diagnostic tools, and a high percentage of interior and secondary flakes. The majority of artifacts collected from area A were fire-cracked rock. Interestingly, the total weight of fire-cracked recorded at 41TR21 is less than the weight of fire-cracked rock recorded at 41TR219, which was 5452.2 g. The vertical stratigraphy appears to be better at 41TR21 and Ferring suggests that 41TR21 may have been intensively occupied or there were numerous occupation periods during the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric (1990:13). However the density is similar to that from 41TR219. Approximately 1,900 lithic artifacts were recorded at site 41TR63, which was located northwest of the confluence of Little Bear and Big Bear creeks. The majority of the artifacts were from the surface where a large number (27) of bifaces or biface fragments was collected. Several of the biface fragments appeared to be unfinished Late Archaic dart points. The number of bifaces is a much higher density than at 41TR219, yet a larger area was surveyed and tested at 41TR63. Quartzite was the predominant material, and the 414 artifacts recorded in the twenty-three 2 2’ x 1 2/3’ test units were interior flakes or secondary flakes. A thin lens of charcoal was present in the test units which were excavated to the red clay at less than a foot deep. This assemblage was similar to DFW as well, in that the majority of artifacts were quartzite and few cores were present. Fire- cracked rock was not weighed during these investigations. Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites recorded in the West Fork drainage are found in several settings such as floodplains, on Pleistocene terraces, and valleys adjacent to intermittent drainages (Skinner, Caren, and Task 1999:72). The artifact classes recorded at the sites in the floodplains are more varied and include pottery, shell and bone. Terrace sites along the West Fork such as the Fountain site and the Chambers site appear to represent longer periods of occupation that what we see at 41TR219. Both sites contained a higher density and diversity of artifacts than demonstrated at 41TR219. In addition, features such as hearths, postholes and a cache pit were recorded at the Fountain site (Hanson and Kvernes 1997) which is indicative of longer more sedentary occupation patterns. Overall, the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric sites recorded on DFW property appear to represent brief, small-group, reoccupations based on the low artifact densities recorded at sites 41TR21, 41TR63, and 41TR219 and on the retouched tool assemblages, the general absence of hearths or other features. These sites are similar to floodplain sites recorded the floodplain of the West Fork and Denton Creek but they appear to have functioned as temporary camps where tools were manufactured rather than where hunting and processing of aquatic animals occurred. Further research needs to focus on the locating and thorough testing of these site types, which are situated on terrace deposits along first and second-order drainages located in the Eastern Cross Timbers.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF ARMADILLO SITE 41TR219 24 RECOMMENDATIONS The identification and testing of site 41TR219 has added to our understanding of Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic campsites along tributaries of Big Bear Creek, yet the site lacks internal integrity and is not recommended to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological Landmark due to several factors. The site lacks vertical stratigraphy or significant organic materials for chronometric dating or environmental reconstruction. The Late Prehistoric biface located in level eight of TU3 was below the Gary points recorded in TU4 and TU9, which is a further indicator of site disturbance. Lithics are the only artifact class represented, and the site is a low density site compared to the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric Fountain site (41TR136) where over 13,000 flakes were recovered (Hanson and Kvernes 1997). Bioturbation was a significant factor in the disturbance of the Armadillo site, and there were no distinct soil or cultural levels identified in the A horizon during trenching in the testing as the soil analysis demonstrated. Due to these factors, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that the site is ineligible for the NRHP and that construction within the pipeline study corridor between padsite BN and Glade Road proceed as planned.
