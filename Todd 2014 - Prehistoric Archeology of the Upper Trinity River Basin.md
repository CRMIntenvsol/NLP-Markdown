Information such as the paleoenvironment, aboriginallife ways, artifacts, andsubsistencepatternsisdiscussedalongwithconclusionsconcerninglong-termtrends inprehistoricsettlementandsubsistence. INTRODUCTION The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the prehistoric archeology of the Upper Trinity River basin. Previous syntheses have been done by Smith (1969), Skinner(1972), Lynott(1977a),RichnerandBagot(1978),Yates and Ferring(1986), and McGregor (1988). This paper focuses on summarizing and presenting information, although not comprehensive in scope, from archeological investigations surveys done on themanylakesand alongsomeofthemajorrivers andcreeks intheregion. In this study, the Upper Trinity River basin contains portions of the counties Collin, Cooke, Dallas, Denton, Parker, Rockwall, Tarrant, and Wise in North Central Texas (Figure 1). The four major drainages that make-up the Upper Trinity River are the Clear Fork, the East Fork, the Elm Fork, and the West Fork. Numerous tributaries to the major drainages include Denton Creek, Rowlett Creek, Whiterock Creek, Big Bear Creek, Village Creek, Mountain Creek and Walnut Creek (Peter and McGregor 1988:Figure 2-1). A generalized depositional history is provided in Table 1. The study area lies within the northern portion of the Gulf Coastal Plain and the Texan biotic province. Sandy soils support oak-hickory forests while clay soils support a tall grass prairie. Forty-nine species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including deer, raccoon,rabbitsandopossum.Two speciesofterrapins(Terrapeneornata andTerrapene carolina) occur, as well as 9 species of lizards. In addition, 39 types of snakes occur, as wellas13speciesofanuranfauna(Blair1950:101-102). The Blackland Prairie, the Eastern Cross Timbers, the Grand Prairie (Fort Worth Prairie) and the Western Cross Timbers make up the vegetative zones of the Upper Trinity River basin (Figure 1). The Blackland Prairie is named after the black, clay soils derived from the Cretaceous limestone in the area. Annual precipitation is approximately 30 inches in the western portion ofthebasin and 40 inches in the eastern portion.Grasses dominate the area, with bluestems in the east and buffalo grass in the west. There are some small stands of timber (elm, oak, pecan, etc.) in the prairie also. The area drains quickly, due to the clay soils promoting runoff, which causes frequent flooding and deposition of sediment on the floodplain (Mahler 1972:68, 69). The Eastern Cross Timbers is a narrow band of oak forest underlain by the Woodbine Formation. The soil consistsofafinesandyloam. Low, rounded hillstypifytheEasternCross Timbers region and these hills are covered with thick oak forests. In some areas there is a savannah-like environment with broken, patchy woodlands. The area is well watered, and water penetrates into the ground rather than running off (Skinner 1972:164), except in areas withclayonthesurface.Thisrun-offcauseserosionintheareas withsurfaceclaysoils. 1

According to McCormick (1976:40), at least thirty-two species of fur- and meat- bearing animals are present in the Eastern Cross Timbers along with three hundred twenty species of birds of which forty-three are migratory. Forty-four species of fish and over 150 edible species of plants also are present. With at least 14 species of freshwater mussels,theplantsand animalsprovideanidealhuntingand gatheringenvironment. TheGrand Prairieextends fromnear Gainesvillesouthward to the Colorado River near Austin. The prairie consists of grassland and savannah and clay soils. Trees are found mainly along streams within the prairie. The terrain ranges from gently rolling to steep cliffs. Limestone and clay underlie the prairie. The Grand Prairie can be divided into a variety of econiches. European visitors to the Grand Prairie were amazed at the breadth and beauty of the park-like nature of the prairie (Hayward et al. 1992:7). The Western Cross Timbers, much like the Eastern Cross Timbers, consists of oak woodland savannahs (Diggs et al. 1999:46-47). Trees within the oak forest also include cedar elm, hackberry, pecan, juniper, and mesquite. Savannah grasses are mostly little and big bluestem and Indian grass, but various species of grama grasses and other perennials also are present. The main belt of the Western Cross Timbers lies on Cretaceous-aged rocks while the fringe (and rougher) area is underlain by Pennsylvanian-aged sediments.

The majorworkwas donebyReid Ferring(1994) who examined terraces of theUpperTrinity River. Ferring believes the Early Holocene (11,000 to 7,500 years ago) was moister than today. During the Middle Holocene (7,500 to 4,500 years ago), there was a period of decreased rain, but moist conditions returned to North Central Texas during the Late Holocene (4,500 years ago to the present). Brown (1998) studied the oxygen isotopes from mussel shells at 41DL270. His conclusions were that warmer, drier conditions existed between 2600 and 3200 years ago B.P. (650-1250 B.C.) and that it was wetter after 500 B.C. The conditions became dryer after 1500 years B.P. (A.D. 450) and are similartothoseoftoday. Prikryl (1993:192-193) suggests that prior to 12,000 BC, the climate of North Central Texas was cooler and moister than at present. Between 12,000 and 8,000 B.C., the climate became warmer and this continued to the present, but with brief mesic periods. The presence of high grass pollen and low arboreal pollen between 5550 and 1050 B.C. further suggested a drying period with a return of arboreal pollen after 1050 B.C. The later change is similar to the environment of today. High grass pollen also occurs at approximatelyA.D. 450 and from A.D. 1550 to 1650,thus also suggestingdrier periods.Thepresenceof paleosols betweenA.D. 1andA.D.1000 pointstoanincreasein moistureduringthisperiodwithareturntodrierconditionsafterA.D.1,000. Frederick (2011) argues that drier times occurred approximately a 1000 years ago based on the sediment deposition and a shift towards C4 plants. Todd (1999a) studied the succession of gastropod fauna from the Rough Green site (41TR163) located on a floodplain near Walker Branch and the Trinity River in the River Legacy Park in Arlington Texas. He concluded that an oak-savannah environment existed from 3

CHRONOLOGY Adefinitive chronologicalframeworkfortheUpperTrinityRiverbasinandNorth Central Texas has been difficult to establish for several reasons. Bioturbation, vertisols, pedoturbation and plowing has mixed up artifacts on sites. Lynott (1975:122) states that fine stratigraphic controls for the excavation of the Sister Grove Creek site (41COL36) were unwarranted because the site was situated in Trinity-Frio soils. These soils are vertisolic and are constantly being churned by expansion and contraction due to the fluctuations in the moisture content. The effect of earthworms on archaeological sites has beendiscussedindetailbyCanti(2003). Krieger (1946:137-141) attempted a chronological framework for North Central Texas when he defined the Henrietta Focus. The type site was the Harrell Site along the Brazos River in Young County, Texas. Among the traits for the Henrietta Focus, Krieger listed small, triangular points, Alba-barbed points, Harrell and Washita points, contracting Perdiz points, Nocona Plain pottery, antler tines with blunt tips, bone awls, and trade pottery from the Southwest and Southeast. Prikryl (1987:12) states that the artifacts and features from the Henrietta Focus bear strong similarities to those at Plains Village sites in the Southern Plains area. Peter and McGregor (1988:367) note the followingabouttheHenriettaFocus: Unfortunately, the concept of the "Henrietta Focus" is not very useful for regional comparison. Krieger's (1946:87-159) definition of the Henrietta focus includes artifacts from a series of occupations covering perhaps thousands of years from the Early Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period. The actual chronological framework for the Henrietta focus is consequently unknown even though it is assumed to be of the Late Prehistoric period. Further research is necessary before the "Plains-like" adaptationcanbedocumentedandunderstoodwithinNorthCentralTexas. Stephenson (1952:305-312) tried to create achronological sequence for the Upper Trinity River basin when he defined the Wylie Focus, which he though dated to between A.D.1300 to 1600, based on shell and clay-grit tempered potterywhich, he believed,was Caddo in origin. The Wylie Focus was characterized by Stephenson as having large circular pits, no indigenous pottery, flexed burials (both single and multiple and in poorly defined burial pits), maize agriculture and villages. Lynott (1977b) believes that the Wylie Focus sites were used by A.D. 1000. The Wylie Focus concept was discarded when Bruseth and Martin (1987:280) dated pits at the Bird Point Island and the Adams Ranch sites in the Richland Chamber Reservoir, which had been included in the focus, to the Late Archaic period. However, Crook and Hughston (2008) disagree and consider the Bird Point Island and Adam Ranch sites to be a separate phenomenon from the Wylie Focus. 4

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah Lynott (1977a:99-100) renamed the Late Prehistoric of North Central Texas the Neo-American Stage and divided it into two phases, the Early (A.D. 800 to 1200) and Late (A.D. 1200 to 1600). Lynott's (1977:99) Early Neo-American phase was considered equivalent to the Gibson Aspect of East Texas and the Austin Focus of Central Texas. Theinhabitants of theUpper TrinityRiver basin continued alifewaysimilar to thatofthe Late Archaic. There were numerous pits (presumably Wylie Focus pits) associated with this phase as well. Lynott (1981:105) later added that the presence of the domestic dog and the bow and arrow used in hunting were important characteristics of the Early Neo- American Stage, as well as the lack of horticulture. In addition, habitation sites tended to concentrate along major waterways (Lynott 1981:106). Pottery showed an affiliation to the Gibson Aspect pottery also. Skinner (1982:1-11) further added that the pottery could be grog-, grit-, or bone-tempered and that the dominant arrow point types were Alba, Scallorn, and Granbury. Lynott (1987:106) stated that the Neo-American Late Phase started around A.D. 1200 and lasted to the historic period. He saw a change in ceramics and projectile points, as well as the presence of limited horticulture, sedentary villages, storage pits and bison scapula hoes. According to Prikryl (1987:13), Lynott's Late Phase aligned with Krieger's Henrietta Focus. Prikryl added that diagnostic artifacts of the Late Neo-American were Fresno, Harrell, and Perdiz arrow points and Nocona and Late Caddo period pottery. Skinner (1982:1-11) thought that peoples of the Late Neo- American Phase were influenced by inhabitants of East Texas during the Fulton Aspect, the Toyah culture of Central Texas, the Plains Culture, and the Pueblo cultures to the west. Prikryl (1990) surveyed the Lower Elm Fork Branch of the Trinity River and created achronologybased on theprojectilepoints frommostlysurfacecollections which is shown on Table 2. Influenced by Lynott's earlier work, Prikryl (1990:62) divided the Late Prehistoric into two phases, the Late Prehistoric I, dating from 1250 to 750 B.P. and Late Prehistoric II, dating from 750 B.P to 250 B.P. Late Prehistoric I diagnostic traits consisted of maizehorticulture, houseremains, grog-tempered and sand-tempered pottery and Scallorn, Alba, Steiner, and Catahoula arrow points. Prikryl implied a subdivision of the Late Prehistoric I phase because the Steiner, Alba-Bonham, Scallorn and Catahoula arrow points are more common in the earlier portion of the Late Prehistoric I than the later. Late Prehistoric II seems to occur about the time that the climate of northern Texas became drier. Diagnostic traits include an emphasis on bison hunting, Washita, Fresno andHarrellarrow points,bison scapulahoes, "Plains-like" lithic artifacts, and settlements on sandy terraces above flood plains (Late Prehistoric I peoples lived on floodplains). It is important to note that Prikryl suggested that site placement in Late Prehistoric II times was suitable for agriculture, even though there appears to be no evidence of agriculture except for the bison scapula hoes, which will be discussed later. Ferring and Yates (1998:135), however, state that the separation of sites into these two phases was more difficult to determine during the archeological investigations at Lake Ray Roberts and LakeLewisville Based on their excavations in the Mountain Creek Drainage, Peter and McGregor (1988:364-367) created a threefold chronological framework of the Late Prehistoric. The first chronological period is the Early Phase, ranging from A.D. 700 to 1000. Diagnostic traits are Scallorn arrow points and grog-tempered wares. This chronological period may be similar to what Prikryl meant when he stated that Steiner, Scallorn, and Catahoula 5

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah points were more abundant in the earlier defined Late Prehistoric I phase. Subsistence and settlement patterns did not seem to change much during this time from those of the Late Archaic. During the Middle Phase, ranging from A.D. 1000 to 1300, maize horticultureand houses became dominant,implyingaformofsedentismin contrasttothe hunting-gathering lifestyle of the Early Late Prehistoric phase and Late Archaic times. Sedentism may be implied by the presence of vessels used for cooking or food storage or both, and house structures (Peter and McGregor 1988:149, 158). The Late Phase, ranging from A.D. 1300 to 1600, contained diagnostic artifacts such as Perdiz-like points and "Plains-like" scrapers. For the purpose of this paper, however, Prikryl’s classification (Table2)willbeusedsinceitisthemostaccepted intheregion. Table2.

CULTURALHISTORY Prehistoric Native American settlement in the Upper Trinity River basin and eastern North CentralTexas began at least 10,000 years ago as attested to bythepresence of distinctively shaped Clovis dart points at the Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957) and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001). Moreover, artifact collectors report the presenceofClovis, Folsom, Midland, Plainview, Scottsbluff and other Paleoindian points from the surface of sites in the region (Jensen 1968; Meltzer and Bever 1995; Young 2011). The presence of exotic artifacts made from non-local, lithic resources indicate that these early people traveled to territories where higher quality lithics were available or wereinvolved in a systemof raw materialtrading. Story(1990:182-184) states thatflakes made from Alibates, local quartzite and Central Texas chert were present at the Lewisville site. Ferring (2001:224) recovered lithics made of Alibates, Tecovas jasper, Edwards chert, and novaculite at the Aubrey Clovis site. The source area of the Alibates materialisapproximately490kmfromthesite. These early people hunted now-extinct large game, but certainly also foraged off the land. Interestingly, a potential well was found at the Aubrey site (Ferring 2001: 128- 129) that was dug by the Paleoindian inhabitants. The Dickie Carr site (41PR26) is located on the border of the Grand Prairie and the Western Cross Timber ecozones in the Mill Creek valley. The site is in an upland setting (Byers 2007). Two types of Paleoindian points were recovered from the site, Plainview and Dalton which indicates that peoples that made these points different point types used the site as a temporary hunting camp (Byers 2007:120). Bever and Meltzer (2007:76) believe that one reason 6

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah that the presence of Paleoindian sites is not abundant in North Central Texas is due to theirbeingdeeplyburied andonlysporadicallyexposedtoarcheologists. Thesubsequent period,the Archaic, lasted from as earlyas 7,000 or 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as A.D. 700 to 800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the Upper Trinity River basin but particularly along the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native foods. Dart points, grindingstones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are common artifacts found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making and using exotic cherts for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics for chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde Gravels (Menzer and Slaughter 1971). Large Archaic sites are generally located on terraces or ridges that overlook the Elm Fork of the Trinity. Smaller lithic scatters have been recorded in upland areas throughout the regiion. These sites appear to be Archaic in age, but none have been thoroughly studied (Prikryl 1990). Early Archaic points are split-stemmed varieties whereas Middle Archaic points include Carrollton, Morrill, Wells, Pedernales, and basal-notched types (Prikryl 1990:53). Dallas, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, Ensor, Gary, Godley, Marcos, Trinity, and Yarborough dominate the LateArchaic pointassemblage (Prikryl1990:54). A Motleypointwas recovered from Late Archaic-aged sediments at site 41DN270. According to Anthony (1994:184), the Motley point is more associated with aboriginal cultures in East Texas and Louisiana ratherthan NorthCentralTexas. Todd (1999b) suggests that some form of agriculture existed in the Upper Trinity River basin drainage during the Late Prehistoric period based upon the presence of shell hoes. Obsidian from New Mexico and ceramics from the Caddo area are evident during theLatePrehistoricatsomesites. Table 3 presents important/excavated sites in the Upper Trinity River basin. If possible, the radiocarbon date is presented. Radiocarbon dates are presented when available; if there are a series of radiocarbon dates, the youngest and oldest dates are provided. SITE LOCATIONS Prikryl (1990:80) states that Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric I occupations occur on clay floodplains and the sandy terraces above the floodplains. However, Late Prehistoric II people lived on sandyterraces above the floodplain. This occurrence may be due to the submergence of the floodplains due to increasing moisture or possibly the importance of horticulture to the economy after A. D. 950 and the presence of easily tillable soil along the terraces. Ferring and Yates (1998:146) note that sites within the Lewisville Lake study area are located along the eastern edge of the Eastern Cross Timbers either near or in contact with the Blackland Prairie grasslands. The site locations were probably chosen so that the aboriginal inhabitants could hunt white-tailed deer instead of harvesting the mast crops within the Eastern Cross Timbers. Also, based on the presence of bison bones on LatePrehistoric,bisonwerebeingprocured fromtheprairie,butat LakeRayRoberts, bison bones were scarce or non-existent on Late Prehistoric sites. Interestingly, at Lake Ray Roberts, the sites were located within the middle portion of the Eastern Cross Timbers. Skinner (Skinner and Baird 1985:5-12) hypothesized that occupations within the Lake Ray Roberts area took place only during specific seasons of the year, and the purposeofthesites wereforgatheringplantresources,especiallymast 7

WestForkPaleosol In the Upper TrinityRiver Basin, the “West Fork Paleosol” contains shell midden sites as well as other kinds of sites. According to Ferring (1994:59), the “West Fork Paleosol” formed in the upper part of the Pilot Point Alloformation between about 4,500 years ago and today. Sites found within the paleosol yield very little lithic material, burned rock, burned daub and mammal bone (Buysse 2000:172).

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah According to Ferring (2000:20), the West Fork Paleosol exhibits a wider variety of elements and facies because of its high stratigraphic position. Pedogenesis may not occur at various localities because not enough time has passed to destroy the primary structures or the hetereogeneity of its lithofacies. In their description of the West Fork Paleosol at 41TR170, Lintz et al. (2008:48) describes the paleosol as “largely devoid of pedogenic features such as clay skins or clay accumulations, blocky or ped structure or secondary carbonates.” (For a discussion of the presence of secondary carbonates see Abbott 2011.) The paleosol at 41TR170 consist of fine-grained sands, silts and clays derived from Lower Cretaceous-aged bedrock which are mainly limestone, shales and marls (Lintz et al. 2008:49). Yet Fredrick and others (2006:36), in their study of the Trinity Parkway in Dallas found the West Fork Paleosol consistent with Ferring’s observations that the soil is characterized by a large number of pedogenic features, including well developed structure, pressure faces, slickensides and secondary carbonate development. As Table 4 shows, various ages are recorded at various depths on various drainages for the West Fork Paleosol. The dates probably are related to the deposition or the “draping over” of the paleosol over the uneven underlying floodplain terrain as was thecaseat41TR170(Lintzetal.2008:48). Table4.

(2003:38) agree with Bruseth and Perttula’s (1996) concept that the West Fork Paleosol consists ofastrip alongdrainages. Skinner analyzed the findingfrom trenches excavated for 16 projects (163 trenches) along the Trinity River. Of the 16 projects, the West Fork Paleosol was encountered in only seven. The results mirror that of deep testing at the East First Street Bridge west of and adjacent to the West Fork (Todd et al. 2008b). The furthest trench, which was approximately 160 m from the river, did not contain any West Fork Paleosol which supports the concept that the West Fork Paleosol is a “strip sediment.” Cliff et al. (1999:78) consider that the strip, the archeologicallyhighpotentialarea,isabout1.0 kmwideatthecenteronthechannel. 10

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah AR Consultants, Inc. (Skinner et al. 2003) excavated 20 trenches extending to approximately5 m in the floodplain of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River in south Dallas. Despite the deep testing, no West Fork Paleosol was encountered. Skinner et al. (2005) dated charcoal from a hearth from the Dalbysite (41DL350) at a depth of 4.86 m at A.D. 540 to 680 (Late Archaic). Skinner interpreted this to mean that the West Fork Paleosol was actually deeper at the site and hidden by the overlying sediment. He also believes that is why the West Fork Paleosol was not encountered in the floodplain of the Elm Fork. If so, with the discovery of the Aubrey and Dalby sites and Bever and Meltzer’s (2007) conclusions about deeply buried Paleoindian sites in North Central Texas, there may be a great potential for discovering deeply buried sites in the Trinity River floodplain,someof whichcouldbeinthe West ForkPaleosol. Prikryl (1987:108) noted that if the formation of the West Fork Paleosol represents a moister climate, then floral and faunal regimes would have been different from those in the past and those in the future. Vegetation would have been lush and the Eastern Cross Timbers may have been a true oak woodlands. Greater mast would have been available; therefore, the fauna who eat mast would have been more abundant and more available to the aboriginal people who not only hunted the animals but also gathered andusedthemast. LITHICRESOURCES Menzer and Slaughter (1971) discuss the upland gravels found in North Central Texas which were recorded by Harris and Kirkland (1941) and Hatzenbuehler (1942a). Previously, the gravels were thought to have been laid down by the Trinity River or a proto-Trinity river. However, Menzer and Slaughter believed that the gravels were from the Rocky Mountains and the pre-Pliocene Ogallala Formation. In their opinion, the Ogallala Formation has retreated some 425 km west of the Dallas area. Byrd (1971:9) agreed with this interpretation and classified the upland gravels as Uvalde gravels which was first used by Plummer (1933). Byrd defined the Uvalde gravels as a disseminated deposit of cobbles ranging in size from 5-15 cm in diameter that consist mainly of limestone, quartzite, quartz, chert, jasper and igneous rock that occurs in isolated patches on stream divides and well-developed terraces. Banks (1990:56-57) further defined the Uvalde gravel as relict gravels on terraces of Late Tertiary and Pleistocene upland interfluves and erosional remnants of the retreating High Plains. According to Byrd (1971:17), Uvalde gravels range from Dallas and Tarrant counties, Texas to northern Mexico. Lithic quarry sites are found in the Uvalde deposits in the Upper Trinity River Basin. Trask (2005:5-7) recorded five lithic quarry sites (41DL407-412) overlooking the East Fork of the Trinity River in Mesquite, Texas. The single layer of gravel covers approximately860 acres but is probablymuch larger.Thewestern extensionof thegravel may have been recorded as 41DL112 byR. King Harris in 1941. About 80 percent of the testedmaterialwasquartziteandtheremainderwaschert. Prikryl (1990:83), in his study of projectile points from sites along Little and Big Bear creeks and the Elm Forkofthe TrinityRiver, determined that Paleoindian and Early and Middle Archaic points are made predominantly of chert, but quartzite was preferred for dart point manufacture by the Late Archaic peoples. Chert and quartzite were almost 11

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah used equally during Early Late Prehistoric I times and chert dominates the assemblage in Late Prehistoric II period. Prikryl thought that the use of chert had implications for trade, mobility and technology since Uvalde gravel studies indicate that quartzite makes up about 90 percent of the gravels and chert another 7 percent. Prikryl notes that the non- local chert was Edwards chert which can be found 150 km to the south and west of his study area. He further added that the dominance of chert, then quartzite and then chert again indicates possible restrictions in mobility that changed through time or that there were important trade connections for chert at different times. The high population mobility of the Paleoindian inhabitants of the Upper Trinity River basin gradually decreased through the Early and Middle Archaic. The marked population increase in the Late Archaic led to increased territoriality and less access to non-local chert; therefore, the local quartzite was heavily used. This trend continued through Late Prehistoric I times, but by the Late Prehistoric II period, chert again became more popular in assemblagesindicatinggreater group mobility,tradeorboth. Over 86 percent of the lithic debitage from the Branch site (41DL149), which is Late Prehistoric II in age, was chert. Quartzite dominated the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric I lithic debitage and tools in the remainder of the sites at Joe Pool Lake. McGregor (1995:197-200) states that the lithic resource availability was not constant throughout the Upper TrinityRiver basin. Sites where local lithic availability, such as the southern tributaries of the West Fork, was poor tended to have lower densities of lithic artifacts. Despite a substantial occupation at Joe Pool Lake, artifact densities are limited. McGregorbelieves thatthehigh use of chert at JoePool Lakewas from imported sources even though the local quartzite was used while populations across the rest of the Upper TrinityRiverbasinappeartohaveusedthelocalquartzite gravels. Chertmadeupfrom8to 32percentofthelithicassemblagefromthesites atLake Ray Roberts excavated by Ferring and Yates (1997:294-296, 299). Ferring and Yates state that the frequency of chert is due to the high small-large flake ratio from the tool maintenance actvities. It appears that Middle Archaic inhabitants imported and curated both cores and blank-preforms at sites but used local raw materials for about half of the unifacial and bifacial tools. Only a few chert cores and chert blank-preforms occur on Late Archaicsites.Chert appears to havebeen used infrequentlyfor unifacial and bifacial tools. The general absence of chert cores and blank-preforms strongly suggests that most Late Archaic people transported and curated chert tools as opposed to cores or blank- preforms. However, the presence of chert blank-preforms, the moderate to high use of chert for projectile points, and lower small-large chert debitage ratios suggest that Late Prehistoric peoples transported and curated flake blanks rather than finished tools. Overall, the data from Lake Ray Roberts tend to support Prikryl’s study of the Elm Fork except that the use of chert in in situ assemblages is quite high for all periods. The debitage data suggest that chert use is tied to projectile point manufacture-transport. Ferring and Yates explain that the higher use of chert for projectile points from the Lake Ray Roberts area may be due to the fact that Prikryl’s study area included samples from farthersouth andclosertothe WestForkoftheTrinityRiver. Lithic material used at the Lake Lewisville site excavations (Ferring and Yates 1998:148-149) appear to be similar to those from Lake Ray Roberts. A high non-local use of lithic was found in one Middle Archaic site. The non-local use of raw lithic materials may be a result of large group territories such that the inhabitants procured the 12

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah lithic materials themselves or else had extensive trade networks. Quartzite appears to be the dominant local material used in the Late Archaic and local materials were used in both Late Prehistoric I and II times. Chert debitage frequencies for the sites range from 12 to 31 percent and chert appears to be the most commonly used raw resource for tools. However, none of the blank-preforms from the Middle/Late Archaic component at 41DN20 are made from chert, suggesting the movement and curation of finished chert tools. Overall, the pattern at the sites is one where there was a use of local materials for on-site manufacture of all tools, a strong dominance of chert for retouched tools and a hightomoderateuseofchertforprojectilepoints. According to Ferring (2000:223-224), of the approximately 9,800 lithic artifacts recovered fromtheAubreysite,allofthelithicrawmaterialsarenon-local.TheTecovas- likequartzitewas from theescarpment ofthe Llano Estacado approximately380 kmwest of the site. Other lithic materials and the distances to their sources are Alibates chert (490 km), Edwards chert (250 and 475 km), quartzite and chalcedony from the Catahoula Formation (315 km) and possibly novaculites, cherts and quartzites from the Western Ouachitas (155 km) and Hot Springs, Arkansas (400 km). Prikryl (1990:64) suggested that the absence of local lithic resources was due to the mobility of the Paleoindian peopleswhowerefollowinggame. Chert appears to dominate the lithic assemblage during the early part of the Late Archaic occupation at 41DL203 (Tinsley 2011). However, during the latter phase of the Late Archaic, there is a marked dependence upon local materials for tool manufacture. The importance of Central Texas lithic materials returns during the Late Prehistoric periodofoccupationatthesite. Interestingly, two crystalline quartz flakes were recovered from 41TR174 on the West Fork (Lintz et al. 2004). According to Lintz and others (2004:126), the nearest source for the crystalline quartz is in Arkansas in the Ouachita Mountains in the vicinity ofHotSprings. Thequartzoutcrop is located approximately325 kmeast-northeast of site 41TR174. However, quartz may be found in the Red River gravels downstream from the Kiamichi confluence with the Red River (Pertulla, Personal Communication, 2013). The layer that the quartz crystals came from dates to caa A.D. 1015. Also, lithics made of Edwards Chert was recovered from a deposit dating to 2000 years B.P. and 1,000 years B.P. The nearest source of chert from the site is about 40 km to the south. Crook and Hughston (2011) discuss a cache of Edwards chert “quarry blanks” from Rock wall Countyas well.Thelithicsourceis unknown. Todd (2013) has hypothesized that Uvalde gravels, and, therefore, quarrysites are present along the West Fork of the Trinity River in southeastern Wise County. It appears that quarry sites are present along first and possibly second terraces along the river. In addition, buried deposits are present on second terraces along the drainage. The source of thelithicmaterialfound on archeologicalsites alongthe Clear Forkappears to bederived from gravels along the Brazos River some 35 to 40 km away (Lintz et al. 2004; Todd et al. 2009). Obsidian arrow points and at least one obsidiean scraper also have been discovered in this area. Based on X-Ray Fluorescence analysis, the source of some of the obsidian was the Taos-Santa Fe, New Mexico area (Crook 2013). Obsidian flakes from anunknownsourcealso werediscovered at41WS38(Moseley1996:41). 13

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah ARTIFACTS TheusualwidevarietyoftoolsarepresentonUpperTrinityRiverbasinsitessuch as arrow points and dart points, scrapers, bone flaking tools and awls, and bone hooks. However, the artifacts discussed below are either unique, different from those found in most tool assemblages in Texas or provide distinct chronological and/or trade information. Lithics Bi-notched cobbles (Figure 2) have been found on archeological sites in eastern North Central Texas. The bi-notched cobbles commonly are referred to “Waco Sinkers,” a term coined by Frank Watt (1983). Watt divided the bi-notched cobbles into 12 types andillustratedavarietyofnotched cobbles anddiscussedavarietyofuses forthecobbles and compared those from Texas to those from other parts of the United States. Watt (1932:59) concluded, “Until some proven data is discovered relating to their definite association with certain uses, any name or function applied to them is only through an apparentadaptabilityorresemblancebasedon modernconceptions.” Boyd and Shafer (1997:270) believe that the cobbles were not net weights but were used to procure some type of game in the early Holocene, but they were not in use by the Middle Archaic. In their argument, Boyd and Shafer (1997:267) mention that the notched cobbles are found in creek gravels, which is where one might expect the sinkers to be if they were used to weigh down nets. Based upon an examination of sites within eastern North Central Texas containing notched cobbles, the sites have substantial Early Archaic components and it is believed that the notched stones all date to this period (Todd2009). Although not numerous when one considers the number of sites that have been recorded in the eastern North Central Texas area and their true purpose being unknown, the presence of the bi-notched stones on archeological sites is interesting. Based upon analogy, archeological evidence, and ethnographic data (Speck 1915; Workman et al. 1980; Bryan 1984), the bi-notched cobbles possibly were used for net weights or hand- thrown seines used to retrieve fish as well as other fauna such as ducks and migratory fowl. Crook and Hughston (2007) defined what they believe is a new, distinctive lithic tool, the “East Fork Biface.” The tool (Figure 3) is roughly triangular in shape as well as wedge-shaped. Lengths vary from 30 to 64 mm and widths from 26 to 49 mm. The ratio of length to width is fairly standard, about 1.25:1. Thickness ranges from 8 to 23 mm. Due to repeated use and sharpening, the working edge is typically a straight edge but can be slightly convex to concave on rare occasions. The tool was probably hafted. Experimental tools were used in scraping bone and wood, especially “green” bois d’arc wood. The wood was thick enough to make a bow. Scraping wood provided the crushed edge that is typical of the tool. The tool may be specifically for wood working, but only future studies can substantiate that hypothesis. The tool is found on Late Prehistoric sites along the East Fork. One problem in defining the specific use of the tool is its lack of abundanceatEast Forksites. 14

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah In the western portion of the study area, tools made from hematite are found, especially celts (Mosley 1996). The shape of the celts range from the traditional rectangular to oval to triangular forms. The ends opposite the working edge are usually rough, probably to facilitate hafting. The celts may be Late Archaic in age. When compared to East Texas hematite celts and axes, those from the study area are generally smaller. The tools appear to be concentrated in the Western Cross Timbers portion of the studyarea. Figure 2. “Waco Sinkers” collected from Collin County, Texas. Photograph provided by Mr.John McCraw.

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah Ceramics Ceramics began to be made by the prehistoric inhabitants of the Upper Trinity River basin by at least A.D. 1000 although grog-, grit- and bone-tempered pottery may have been used at the Baggett Branch site as early as A.D. 750+100. Pottery is not abundant in North Central Texas as demonstrated by the fact that only 14 percent of the 238 sites investigated by Prikryl (1990) on the Elm Fork contained pottery. The pottery ranges from plain to decorated non-shell tempered wares similar to East Texas Caddo vesselsdatingaboutA.D.1000to1300andshelltemperedNocona Plainwares which are foundonPlains Villageagesites after aboutA.D.1250/1300.Caddotypewares represent (a) trade wares, (b) locally manufactured ceramics copies from Caddo pottery, (c) ceramics from Caddo settlements in the Upper Trinity River basin, or (d) a combination of the above. Caddo wares discovered during the archeological survey of Lake Lavon (Harris and Suhm 1963:Figures 5, 6) included Haley Complicated Incised, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Pennington Punctated-Incised, Canton Incised, Maydelle Incised, Killough Pinched and Monkstown Fingernail Incised. Also sherds of the Plains type Nocona Plain werefound.Prikryland Perttula(1995:190)suggest that one should lookto the Caddo groups of the upper Sabine River and middle Red River for vessel form and stylistic comparisons of ceramics recovered from the Upper TrinityRiver Basin. They go on to comment that a Sanders Engraved vessel, which was manufactured in the upper Sabine and middle Red River area, was recovered from a burial context at the Upper Rockwall site on the East Fork of the Trinity River (Ross 1966:Figure 10e). Perttula (1998) discussed Caddo pottery sherds from two sites in Dallas County along the Elm Fork. Based upon the ceramic types, the sites date to ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680, which is atypical since most Caddo ceramics in the Blackland Prairie as well as the East Fork usually predate A.D. 1300. However, Crook (2007b) recovered a similar aged Foster Trailed-Incised vessel (Figure 4) from the Sister Grove site (41COL36). Caddo wares have been found on prehistoric archeological sites along the Clear Fork of the Trinity RiverinParkerCounty(Toddetal.2009). Wares that appear stylistically Caddo may be found within the Mountain Creek drainage, but they may be a result of trade or the copying of the Caddo wares by inhabitants of North Central Texas. Peter and McGregor (1988) argue that the Cobb-Pool and Baggett Branch may represent sites occupied by Caddo peoples that moved into the Mountain Creek drainage area. If the pottery wares recovered from the sites were a result of trade or copying, then there was no intrusion of Caddo peoples into the Mountain Creek area; therefore, the inhabitants of the Mountain Creek drainage area were native to thatarea. TheNoconaPlain ceramics which arefound on sites datingfromca. A.D.1200 to 1600 have tempers have shell, fossil shell and calcareous material used as temper. These wares resemble Plains Village ceramics and take the form of globular and vase-like jars with outflaring rims and round or flat disk bases and barrel-shaped cups. Decorations on the jars are minimal and consist of rows of nodes, appliqué fillets, lip tabs and cord- marking.Thecupshavecorncob-roughenedexteriors(PrikrylandPerttula1995:192). 16

After about A.D. 1000, Southwestern ceramics occur on sites in North Central Texas. The best example is the ca. A.D. 950-1050 stirrup-spout Arboles Black-on-White vessel recovered from the Lower Rockwall site (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968) at Lake RayHubbard on theEast Forkof theTrinityRiver.Petrographic analysis showed thatthe basalt-tempered vessel was manufactured among Puebloan groups along the upper Rio Grande in New Mexico (Prikryl and Perttula 1995:192). Several Southwestern sherds from Santa Fe Black-on-White, Chupadero Black-on-White, Mimbres Black-on-White and Jemez Black-on-White vessels have been recovered from archeological sites along theEast ForkoftheTrinityRiver(Crook2013). At41DN372, FerringandYates (1998:114)discoveredsherdsunusualtothearea. Cord-marked sherds were found that resemble ceramics found in Plains Woodland cultures in south central Oklahoma as well as the Llano Estacado. Also found was an interior slipped bone-tempered sherd that resembles Cooper Boneware. This is a Woodland period Fourche Maline type made between ca. 2300 to 1800 B.P. It is the only oneofitstyperecovered fromtheUpperTrinityRiverbasin. BoneTools A bone-barbed “harpoon” was recovered from the Upper Farmersville site (41COL34). The barbed point is 13.7 cm long and made from deer bone. One end is pointed and the base has been deliberately shaped. Two 2 cm long barbs are on the point (Figure 5). Microscopic examination indicates that considerable wear is present on the shaped basal end as if some play occurred between the point and the shaft socket. Bone 17

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah points are usually associated with coastal-living people and are very rare in inland settings. Crook (1984:12-13) hypothesized that the point could have been used to procure rather large fish (for example, those that weigh about 110 lbs) in deep water for which smallbonefishhookswouldhavebeeninefficient. Figure5. Bone“harpoon”fromtheUpper Farmersvillesite(41COL34). Photograph providedbyMr. Wilson Crook, III. Bison scapula hoes (Figure 6) and other bone agricultural tools have been found in North Central Texas archeological sites. Barber (1969:19, 23) recovered two bison scapula hoes and a digging stick from the Hackberry site in Denton County. Lynott (1979:91-92) argued that the bison scapula hoes found in burials in North Central Texas may have been widely traded status items and were not used for agricultural purposes. The fact that the bison scapulae from the Upper Farmersville site (41COL34) appear to have been arranged on a bed of freshwater mussel shells and ash (Harris1945:37) supportsthatargument. Anunusualbonetool(Figure7)whosepurposeis unknownwas recovered from 41DL425 (Toddand Skinner2003)onBearCreek,atributarytothe WestFork.The bonetoolisapolishedantlerapproximately54 mmlongandwithan averagediameterof 16mm.Theknob’s diameterisabout27.15 mmandthecutandpolishedendhas a diameterofapproximately14.5 mm.Thecentralportionofthecutandpolishedendhas beendrilled.

Harrington (1924:Plate 3) illustrated what would be considered a hoe, based on modern day analogies, from an Arkansas Ozark Bluff shelter. The mussel shell was centrally perforated and hafted to the thick wooden portion of the hoe (Harrington 1924:6). Todd (1999b) conducted experiments with shells as hoes, and those withthebroaderposteriorshapeworkedquitewell. 18

Gradwohl (1982) provides evidence from historical and personal sources for the Illinois, Sauk, Fox, Winnebago,Hidatsaand Pawneeusingmusselshells toscrapecorn. FiredClayBalls/Objects Fired clay balls (Figure 8) in archeological sites in the Upper Trinity watershed occur as apparently purposefully made, spheroid to oval-shaped objects (Crook 2009). The fired clay balls may range in age from Early to Middle Archaic times (Crook 2009), although Lorrain (2011) and Frederick and others (2011) have recovered clay balls from LateArchaic contextsaswell. Figure8. Fired clayball/objects fromNorthCentralTexas(Crook2009). Frederick and others (2011:105) refer to the fired clay balls as irregular-shaped broken fragments of burnt or baked clay although ball shapes are present. Sizes range from 15-20 mm to as much as 100 mm in diameter, with the overwhelming majority being in excess of 40 mm. No evidence has been found of wattle or finger impressions. The balls are universally composed of a reddish sandy clay which is compositionally indistinguishablefromthesandyclaysoftheAlbritton FormationoftheT-1terracealong the main branch and Elm and West Forks of the Upper Trinity River. The only discernable difference between the clay balls and the Albritton is that the clay balls typically have turned a slightly darker reddish-brown from apparent exposure to heat. Cross-sections of the clay balls from multiple sites show a similar pattern, with reddish- brown exterior surfaces and dark grayto black cores. In fact, manyof the centermostpart of the balls are such a vitreous black color that they have the visible characteristics of charcoal. The firing process appears to have acted as a consolidating and preserving agent. Frederick and others (2011), in their study of clay balls found at 41DL203, 20

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah mention that a sandy material was present in the clay and that the balls were purposely brought to the site. Those clay balls that were dried slowly appeared to be more durable. However, in their experiments, the prehistoric clay balls did not have the black cores the experimental ones did. The conclusion is that the prehistoric clay balls were exposed to a high temperature environment for longer or on more occasions than were the experimentally-produced clayballs. At 41DL238, there appears to be a filled-in, bowl-shaped pit with a layer of the fired clay objects at the bottom of the pit (Lorrain 2011). As the pit area was excavated, approximately 200 fired clay balls were uncovered in a roughly circular pit about 1.2 m in diameter. The burned clayobjects were in a single, flat layer in no apparent order. The exteriorcoloroftheclayobjects wasfairlyuniform,buttheircolor gradationinthecross- section indicated differential heating. The feature is presumed to be an earth oven. Earth ovens that used rocks as heating elements are more common, but, apparently, if rocks werenotavailable,fired clayobjectscouldbesubstituted. BURIALS A burial was discovered in the Upper Trinity River basin among Pleistocene fossils in a sand pit in Dallas, Texas (Shuler 1923). The large adult male skeleton was found about 1.5 m below the ground surface. The Pleistocene age was suggested because thesand anddirtlefton thebones matched thesandanddirtlevelfromwhichPleistocene fossils were found and the degree of fossilization of the skull was similar to that of a camel recovered from the same layer. However, no artifacts were found with the burial that would indicate a Pleistocene age. Another burial was found near Carrollton on a terrace overlooking the Elm Fork of the Trinity River (Albritton and Pattillo 1940). No burial goods were associated with the burial and the Albritton and Pattillo did not verify that the burial was Mid-Pleistocene in age, nor did they establish that it was in situ in the terrace deposits. They do mention that the cranial measurements fall within the lower limitsavailablefortheCaddoand Wichitagroups. Themajorknown burials from archaeologicalsites within theUpperTrinityRiver basin are presented in Table 5. For specific information on the burials, the reader should refertothecitedreferences. Most of the burials found in the Upper Trinity River basin are flexed and with no grave goods. Cremations and bundle burials comprise only a small percentage of the known burials. Almost all the burials are single interments although they may occur in cemeteries. The supposed mass burial at the Harbor Pointe site is suspect because the area was disturbed and the burials could easily represent four single burials. There are exceptions, however. Crook and Hughston (2009:30) state that two cemeteries were present at the Upper Farmersville site, one on a small rise with six burials and the other with three burials associated with a large pit structure. The burial at 41DL396 (Hibbs and Hibbs 2006)is unusual.Theburialwas foundabout 0.9 mbs and itcontained three males of varying ages ranging from late/mid-life to about 12 years old. The burials were found lying against each other and, from the drawing, it appears the oldest male had his arm across the other two. No burial goods were associated with the grave and no cause of deathwaspostulated. Another interesting multiple burial was discovered at 41DL8 on Lake Ray Hubbard. The burial consisted of the highly fragmented remains of four adult 21

In one of the skeletons the external auditory meatus and the tympanic bone failed to develop; this is referred to as complete eternal auditory atresia. Seven dart points were discovered in the burial. The one sigma calibrated radiocarbon dates from Femur 5 were 1260-310 B.C. and 1210-1240 B.C. A one sigma calibrated radiocarbon date from Femur 7was1000to1050B.C.TheburialsdatetotheLateArchaic. Huff and Briggs (1963) examined the skeletal material from Lake Lavon, and Navey (1975) examined skeletal material from the Upper Rockwall, Lower Rockwall, Glenn Hill, Upper Farmersville, White Rock Spillway, Lavon Reservoir, Sister Grove Creek, Hogge Bridge and the Branch sites. They discovered that about 20 percent of the skeletons showed evidence of hematological disorders and periostitis and osteititis were found in about 30 percent of the samples. Dental absecesses were present in all of the samples and heavy wear on the teeth was prevalent due possibly to their hunting and gathering diet and ground-up stone material in the food. Nutritional stress also was present throughout the sample. The skeletal material investigated by Cliff and others (1996:24) found dental absecesses and nutritional stress. At Lake RayRoberts, Gill-King (1997) interpreted the skeletal remains of one individual as having died from disease and another possibly starved to death. Evidence of nutritional stress also was present. An adult female from 41CO141 experienced a period of dietary or metabolic stress between the ages of 7 and 10 (Gill-King 1987). Her diet may have been oriented toward plant foodsduetothelowiron contentinherbones. At the Merrill site (41DN99) at Lake Ray Roberts, two skulls and a long bone, probably a femur, were uncovered in a poorly defined pit.

Anotherburialwas found in an oval, stone-lined pit with several slanting sandstone and hematitic sandstone slabs and several flat-lying slabs marked the grave floor (Ferring and Yates 1997:182). This burial is similar to others found in the Western Cross Timbers (see Forrester 1991) indicating possible shared cultural relationship. The burial of “Clear Fork Woman” (41PR12) reportedly was surrounded by a ring of Lower Cretaceous-aged oyster shells and at one time, a long curved animal tooth probably was embedded in her face behind her left zygoma (Todd et al. 2009:48). These characteristics suggest that this was a ritual burial. Blair (1960:5) indicates that a burial from the Lower Rockwall site (41RW1) had a bed of mussel shells placedinthepitbeforethebodywasplacedinthegrave. Crook and Hughston (2009:31) have argued that the generally accepted concept that Late Prehistoric graves along the East Fork have no burial furniture is misleading. They have compiled records of 87 buried individuals, and of those 87 individuals, approximately 40 percent (35 individuals) have associated grave goods. Whitley and Skinner (2012:36) examined multiple burials from the East Fork of the Trinity River and found that of the 69 burials (99 individuals), 28 (41 percent) contained artifacts. Children only make up about 10 percent of the burials. Bone beads appear to be the grave goods associatedwiththechildren(Kirkland andHarris 1941;Harris 1947). 22

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah Figure9.Dartpointsfrom41DL8.IllustratedbyLanceK.Trask. FigurecourtesyofAR Consultants,Inc. The taking of human mandibles as war trophies occurred during the Blow Out Mountain phase in West Central Texas (Boyd 1995:482, 504) which dates from ca. A.D. 500 to 1100. If the two mandibles at 41DN26 (Ferring and Yates 1998) were war trophies, it mayindicate that therewere cultural ties between theaboriginal inhabitants of the Lake Lewisville area and West Central Texas. Lynott (1975:33) discovered the burial of an adult male with three small projectile points located in the ribs at the Sister Grove site (41COL36) in Collin County. Also, a burial of a decapitated male with three embedded darts recovered from the Lower Rockwall site (Whitley and Skinner 2012:34). Harris (1942:50) noted the presence of a skull burial at the GilkeyHill site (41DL406). If the mandibles were war trophies, their presence would indicate warfare between groups, but the points in the bodies and decapitation may indicate inter-group violence as well as potential actsofwarfare between groups. Very few burials have been radiocarbon-dated. The burial at the Harbor Pointe site on Rowlett Creek (Cliff et al. 1996:28) yielded a radiocarbon date of 970+60 years B.P. (A.D. 1010-1265). The burial from 41DL373 on Spring Creek (Peter and Clow 2000:20) is dated to A.D. 1155-1275. Two radiocarbon dates were obtained from the skeleton from Feature 15 at the Sister Grove site (Lynott 1975:70). The dates average to about A.D. 1160. Two burials from site 41DL8 date to approximately 1130-1380 B.C. and 930-1120 B.C. (Whitley and Skinner 2012). The Sandy Camp site (41PR108) has a burialwithablue glass tradebeadindicatingthatitdates toEuropean contacttimes. 24

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah ARCHITECTURE A few house structures and what may be house structures have been found in eastern North Central Texas Late Prehistoric sites. These include Butler Hole (41COL8) and Cobb-Pool (41DL148). The Butler Hole site contained one house (Housewright et al. 1947:8-16; Stephenson 1952:310) and the Cobb-Pool site had three house structures and a few other post hole features that may be drying racks, storage platforms or animal or hide processing areas (Peter and McGregor 1988:182-184). The house structure at the Butler Hole site is 4.2 m east-west and 3.1 m north-south. A hearth was located near the center ofthehouse.Based upon thepresenceofburned shell-tempered claydaub material that contained impressions of grass and twigs, the researchers felt that the outside of the house had been plastered and then burned when it was abandoned. A house structure is inferred by the presence of three post holes at the Calvert site (41DN102) at Lake Ray Roberts,butitsarchitecturalformcouldnotbedetermined (FerringandYates1997:254). The three structures at the Cobb-Pool site are probably a winter house (Structure 1), a summer house (Structure 3) which may not have been enclosed and a main house (Structure 2). This structure had an arrangement of post-holes that suggest there was an interior bench-like feature that may have been for sitting/sleeping, storage or both. Structure 1 appeared to have been rebuilt or reinforced to withstand inclement weather. Structure 1 was about 5 m in diameter, Structure 2 was ca. 5.4 m in diameter while Structure 3 was ca. 5.1 m in diameter. Charcoal from post hole 7 from Structure 2 has a corrected date of A.D. 1274+88 (use calibrated date) while ceramic sherds recovered from post holes 1 and 33 from Structure 3 have thermoluminescence dates of A.D. 720+240 and A.D. 1380+90. If the thermoluminescence dates are accurate (which seems unlikely given their large standard deviation and wide differences in their ages, Structure 3 may have been abandoned later than Structure 2. Also Structure 2 may have been burnedonabandonment,similartothehouseattheButlerHolesite. SUBSISTENCE FloralRemains No definitive statement can be made about plant food used by the inhabitants of the Upper Trinity River basin because of the limited number of floral analyses that have been done. Plants recovered from the Sister Grove site (Lynott 1975:66) include hackberry, balloon-vine and white-dog’s-tooth-violet. At Lake Ray Hubbard, Chenopodium and Amaranth seeds were recovered from archeological sites (Winchell 1985:A.3-4). These seeds were exploited intensely by aboriginal populations located in woodland environments. Only hackberry seeds were recovered from the Lake Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957:27) and lamb’s quarter was recovered from 41DL270 (Derring 1994:240). Charred pecan shell was recovered from 41TR170 (Dering 2008:F- 4). Dering believes the shell was accidentally charred because the pecan nut does not require being boiled to extract the oil or the meat from the shell. In all probability, the pecan nuts were being harvested at 41TR170 by the site occupants during other subsistenceactivities. 25

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah The Cobb-Pool site (41DL148), discovered on Village Creek, provides a different perspective. The majority of the plant remains are maize, followed by nuts, cucurbits, maygrass, lamb's quarter and sumpweed. The presence of maize (Fritz 1993:241) indicates short-term sedentism, perhaps as part of a seasonal round of farming or gardening where an aboriginal group was already dependent on wild plant food such as nuts. Peter and McGregor (1988:194) state that the inhabitants may have used the Cobb- Pool site as a base camp, although a temporaryone, from which theyventured for special orseasonalactivities.Some form of agriculture mayhave been conducted based upon the presenceofapossibleshellhoefromtheCobb-Poolsite(Raab1982:266). Martin (1988:348) suggests that the Cobb-Pool site inhabitants selected the locationbecausetheland was suitablefor agriculture,and theyhad access, notonlytothe forest, but to the Trinity River as well. The forest and river habitats provided most of the wild food resources, but the sandy areas adjacent to the Trinity River were utilized for growing maize. According to Peter and McGregor (1988:167) and Fritz (1993:237), approximately 72 percent of the 43 flotation samples contained maize The cupules from the Cobb-Pool Site are smaller than normal for domesticated maize (Fritz 1993:238). Peter and McGregor (1988:167) believe, based on the amount of maize recovered, that the maize was domestic, not imported although the site inhabitants may have brought the maizewiththem. Maize was recovered from the Butler Hole, the Campbell Hole and the Hogge Bridge sies (Stephenson 1952:305). However, R. King Harris, who helped Stephenson gather information about the Wylie Focus, said that Stephenson recovered only a single kernel of maize from his excavations (Marmaduke 1975:155). Fritz (1993:240) mentions that maize's role in the subsistence of the Wylie Focus groups as defined by Stephenson was questioned by Lynott and Marmaduke after their excavations in the Lake Lavon area in Collin,Dallas and Rockwallcounties. Lynott(1975:69)did not find anymaizecupules or pollen in his analysis of the Sister Grove site and argued that the absence of maize at the site is an indication that maize agriculture was not practiced there. Ferring and Yates (1998:153), in their analysis of stable isotopes from four skeletons from Lake Ray Roberts and Lake Lewisville that ranged in time from the Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric, indicate that the diet was based on significant meat consumption and that the consumed plants were not maize. The prehistoric inhabitants were eating “cool season” plants and the animals that ate those plants. Marmaduke (1975) suggested that the presence of bison scapula hoes on Wylie Focus sites indicates that agriculture could have been practiced or at least known by the Wylie Focus peoples. Peter and Clow (2000:26) argue that maize was becoming a part of the diet in North Central Texas during the early thirteenth century based upon the presence of maize at the Cobb-Pool site and the fact fromisotopicanalysis thattheburialfrom41DL373 had consumed maizealthough itwas notaprimaryplantinherdiet. The Baggett Branch site (41DL149), on the other hand, was probably a seasonal hunting and gathering site. Although maize was present, the dominant plant food resources are wild, mainly walnuts and Pediomelum (Peter and McGregor 1988:230). Other sites along Village Creek include 41DL189 and 41DL199. Psoralea tuber was recovered from 41DL189, mainly occupied during the Late Archaic. A radiocarbon date for the site ranges from 450 to 570 B.C. (Peter and McGregor 1988:57). At 41DL199, a nutshell belonging to either walnut (Juglans nigra) or hickory (Carya sp.) was recovered 26

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah as well as Psoralea tuber and Vicia-type seeds (Peter and McGregor 1988:80). The site contains artifacts that range from the Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric (Peter and McGregor1988:59). Plant gathering activities can be inferred from the presence of groundstone tools. Lorrain and Lorrain (2001) discovered several manos on Middle and Late Archaic-aged sites along Denton Creek. The manos could be divided into two types: circular and oblong; metates were absent. The opposite situation was found at 41DN381 (Ferring and Yates 1998). Fourteen unprepared manos, four prepared manos and fourteen unprepared metates indicate the importance of plant processing at the site. The groundstone probably wascachedatthesiteforusewhenthesiteinhabitantsreturned. Site 41DN544 (Jennings and Todd 2006) is an unusual site which consists of a 5.78 m long rock-lined occupation surface buried beneath 2 m of sediments in a tributary to Walnut Creek. A layer of charcoal which dates from A.D. 1430 to 1670 (Beta- 219491), contains within it a limestone rock surface (Figure 10). The limestone rocks, which range in size from 3 to 15 cm, appear to be a single rock thick. After a rain, the site was revisited and a limestone metate was found at the top of the soil slump approximately 64 cm below the rock layer. Deep testing was conducted to recover diagnosticartifacts and determinewhetherthesite extended significantlyinto thebank. A backhoe trench was excavated approximatelya meter north of and parallel to the exposed site. Approximately 4.78 m of a 15 cm thick zone fire-cracked rock and charcoal. Occasionally a mussel shell and a deer bone also were uncovered. Bush (2006) analyzed a charcoal sample and identified plum/cherry, hackberry, and elm wood. The plum/cherry wooddominatedtheassemblage. Based on the floral material recovered from sites discussed here, the prehistoric inhabitants of the Upper Trinity River basin exploited the post oak forests, floodplains, and the prairie. Grapes, hackberry, nuts, balloon-vine and white-dog's tooth-violet can be found in a post-oak environment as well as nuts, and prairie turnip, maygrass, and cucurbits can be found in a prairie environment. Sumpweed can be found in a prairie environment, but it is usually associated with large river floodplains such as the Trinity River. Lamb's quarter can be found on floodplains as well, but may grow in disturbed areassuchasinoccupied sites.Maygrassmaybefoundindisturbedareas also. FaunalRemains Animals utilized by the prehistoric inhabitants of the Upper Trinity River basin were varied and apparently abundant. Todd (2000) lists at least twenty-nine species of mammals, five species of birds, five frog species, seven turtle species, two species of snakes and fourteen freshwater mussel species that were utilized by the Late Prehistoric inhabitants of the Upper Trinity River basin. These same species were exploited during the Archaic as well as during Paleoindian times. However, during Paleoindian times, extinct turtles as well as other extinct Pleistocene animals were utilized at the Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957) as well as the horse and Bison antiquus at the Aubrey site (Yatesand Lundelius 2001:106-107). 27

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah Figure10. Ashandfire-crackedrocklayerat41DN425.Viewistothenorth.Photograph courtesyofARConsultants,Inc. It appears that the prehistoric inhabitants exploited all six environmental zones mentioned by Bousman and Verrett (1973): drainages, floodplains, floodplain rises, fluviatile terraces, upland slopes, and uplands. The fauna taxa (Table 6) recovered from archeological sites at theJoe Pool Lake generallyrepresent the types of animals found on sites witin the Upper Trinity River basin. Deer was the dominant large mammal found at all of the sites. Raccoon and opossum are next in numerical prominence. These mammals are found along forest edges, drainages of both the forest and prairie, and on floodplains and floodplain rises. The presence of both bison and pronghorn suggests that the upland prairie was utilized as well by the Late Prehistoric inhabitants. The ornate turtle further suggests the use of the prairie as a potential subsistence resource. Numerous beavers, turtles, fish and mussels indicate the use of aquatic sources. The box turtle, found on almost every site, can be found in upland slopes, wooded hillsides or open woodlands. Interestingly, it appears that more species of rodents were utilized at the Aubreysite than in later times. Todd (2004) hypothesized that rodents on prehistoric sites with cultigens were utilized more as a subsistence resource than on hunter-gatherer sites. Rodent bones were about seven times more abundant at the Cobb-Pool site than in hunter-gatherer sites atLakeRayRoberts. Numerous sites in the Upper Trinity River basin have been recorded that contained either shell lens or large numbers of freshwater mussel shells. One of the most interesting is the Rough Green (41TR162) site on Walker Branch, a tributary to the West Fork (Skinner et al. 1999). The site ranges from Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric in age. The shell deposit is approximately 50 cm thick and covers an area of ca. 60x25 m and at least two separate occupations were defined by shell middens in a trench profile. 28

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah Approximately 3,870 freshwater mussel valves were identified in the middens consisting of at least twelve species. Based upon the amount of known site area, it is estimated that approximately63,000 individualmussels arepresentinthedeposits.Atthispointintime, this makes the Rough Green site unique, not only in the number of freshwater mussels present, but also in the variety of species. However, Alan Skinner and I may have discovered a similar site approximately 7 km west of the Rough Green site. The new site waserodingoutofthe eastbankofatributaryflowingintothe West Fork. Story (1990:361) has noted that the increased hunting of bison is one of the more distinctivecharacteristics ofthelatephase(ca. A.D. 1500) of the Late Prehiistoricperiod. Bison remains are most common in North Central Texas after A.D. 1200. Nonetheless, there is no archeological evidence for vast numbers of bison. Bison herds were probably small, sporadic bands (Lynott 1979:92, 98). There has not been enough bison bones recovered from archeological sites in the area to suggest a shift in the subsistence practices of the inhabitants of the Upper Trinity River basin. Lynott (1979:98) concluded that after A.D. 1200, remains of white-tailed deer and other woodland mammals far out- weighed the presence of bison on archeological sites. This may not be true for the archeological record at Lake Lewisville, where bison bones matched the number of deer bones on 41DN27 and 41DN381. Bison probably were taken in chance encounters and were not systematically hunted as a group. Although some bison skeletons/bones have been found (Prikryl 1987), there is not enough to establish that bison were selectively hunted over deer and other mammals. Anthony and Brown (1994:303) believed that the inclusion of bison in the diet is “almost certainly a factor of the presence or absence of thebisoninthearea.” Dickens and Weiderhold (2003) echo this conclusion, noting that bison bones would not be found on archeological sites because the meat was removed from the bones and taken back to camp and the skeleton left in place. The single kills that was butchered and left in place at two archeological sites in Dallas County (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970) support such a conclusion. However, at 41DN27, an unusual bison bonerefusepit was discovered (Ferringand Yates 1998:83-86). Thepitwas capped by two bison calf skulls and bison bones consisting of skulls, vertebrae, ribs and limbs throughout the pit. At the bottom of the pit nine scapula were laid out intentionally to cover the bottom of the pit (Figure 11). At least six individuals were represented by the bones. Several boulders/cobbles also were present. The pit was dug in a manner that indicates that it was planned and the onlything to indicate it was also used as a refuse pit wasthehaphazardplacementofthebisonbonesinit. Animal interments have been found in the Upper Trinity River basin (Todd 2012). A puppy interment was discovered at the Sister Grove Creek site (41COL36). The puppy was between 2.5 to 4 months old and found in a Wylie focus pit that dated to ca. A.D. 1160. Stephenson (1952:301, 303) reported that the burial of a wolf was uncovered at the Hogge Bridge site (41COL1), a “Wylie Focus pit” site on the East Fork of the Trinity River in Collin County. The wolf, possibly a red wolf, was uncovered on the south interior slope of a large circular depression or pit. The grave was oval, no burial furniture was present and the style of the burial pit was similar to those in which humans remains wereinterred. Although not in directassociationwith thewolf burial, human burials were recovered on the eastern rim of the pit. The burial may have been some form of animal worship (Stephenson 1952). Marmaduke (1975:151), however, referred to the burial as 29

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah that of a “young” bear based upon Stephenson’s notes, not a wolf. According to Stephenson’s notes, afullyarticulated bearskeleton was found on thesouth interior slope of the pit and prior to photographing and mapping, a violent rain storm prevented further work until the area was dry. It appears that before Stephenson could return, individuals had removed some of the important diagnostic skeletal elements and scattered the rest of thebones. Table6.

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah ART Cliff and others (1996) discovered a gorget made from a Busycon contrarium shell at the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369) at Lake Ray Hubbard in Dallas County dating to approximately to A.D. 1035. The gorget was made from the convex side of the shell and is 88 mm long and 70 mm wide. The shell is similar to Forms 6 and 8 in Hall’s (1981) discussion of conch shell gorgets from Allens Creek. Hall (1981:302) believes that trade interaction east of the Trinity River was mainly with Caddo peoples during the Late Prehistoric and may have been reduced or completely absent with peoples living in Central Texas. Drilled freshwater mussel shell pendants were discovered at 41DL270 (Anthony 1994:186). Both shells had a hole drilled beneath the umbo. The species are LampsilisteresandQuadrulamortoni.TheshellsareprobablyLateArchaicinage. Alongwith shell gorgets, stone gorgets also have been recovered from the area. A limestone gorget fragment was discovered at 41DL137 in Dallas County (Peter 1982). Stone gorgets have been recovered from the Butler Hole site in Collin County (Lorrain and Lorrain 1982), in Rockwall County(Lorrain and Lorrain 1982),at an unnamed site in Rockwall County (Housewright 1941) and the Gilkey Hill site (41KF42) in Kaufman County (Harris 1942). (After further investigations at the Gilkey site, its location was placedinDallasCountyand giventhetrinomial41DL406 [Skinner2001:23]). A possible brown sandstone bear effigy (Figure 13) was discovered approximately 85 cm bs at the Fire Wagon Factory Camp site (41PR109) on the South Fork of the Trinity River. A sandstone mano and a possible sandstone gorget were associated with the bear effigy. Dart points dating from the Middle to Late Archaic have beenfoundatthesite (Toddetal.2009:54). Figure 13.

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah CONCLUSIONS Two important conclusions can be derived from the archeological information discussed in this paper. First, no significant changes in hunting and gathering strategies occurred from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. An indigenous cultural development occurred in North Central Texas from the last part of the Lake Archaic to the first part of the Late Prehistoric (Prikryl 1990:83). Due perhaps to a climatic drying trend during Prehistoric II times, an artifact assemblage appeared that had strong similarities with those found on typical Southern Plains sites. Ferring and Yates (1997:305, 1998:153), based upon their research at Lake Ray Roberts and Lake Lewisville, indicate that except for the introduction of the bow, little changed between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric. There was no evidence of decreased mobility, an increase of patch exploitationoradecreaseddiversityoffloraland faunalresourceprocurementpractices. Although houses and some form of agriculture may have occurred as well as bison hunting in the Late Prehistoric at some times and places, it was on such a limited scale as to not reflect a basic change in the lifeway of the prehistoric inhabitants of the Upper Trinity River basin. The presence of storage pits at the Hackberry site, the houses at the Cobb-Pool and the Butler Hole sites indicate some form of sedentism (Ferring and Yates 1998:53). The question is, “How long was the sedentism?” and “Were the structuresconstructedso thattheinhabitantscouldrevisitthemonaseasonalbasis?” This leads to the possible second conclusion, that the Late Prehistoric inhabitants of the Upper Trinity River basin were nomadic since there appear to be very few sites that may have been occupied year round. Since no winter settlements have been found, winter camps were presumably located elsewhere in the local region. Peter and McGregor(1988:194) argued, based upon thelow densityof artifacts,that theoccupation oftheCobb-Poolsite (41DL148)neverextended beyonda few years andthattheprimary occupational period was from springuntil fall; possiblythesite occupants used theCobb- Pool site as a base camp from which theyhunted and performed other seasonal activities. The majority of the faunal and floral resources utilized in the Mountain Creek drainage was during the Late Archaic were those that would not have been available during the winter months (Peter and McGregor 1988:363). The location of sites in the Blackland Prairie suggests that the sites were temporary because the amount of food needed by a group of people would not have been supplied by living on the prairie alone. Even living on the floodplains would have restricted the hunting and gathering season because plants andanimals existingtheremayhavehad aseasonalrangeaswell. Skinner and Connors (1979:51-52) have suggested that Late Archaic sites in the Mountain Creek drainage were the product of groups who were based in the central Brazos River basin, possibly along the Nolan River drainage, and that the Mountain Creek area was peripheral enough that the Late Archaic people could visit the area without fear of reprisal from the peoples occupying the Trinity River area. They base their conclusions on the fact that lithic materials found on the sites resemble materials from the central Brazos River. They also state that evidence of the potential route of peoples moving from one basin to another can be found at Lake Alvarado and the Ham Creek site where the lithic material more closely resembles that of the central Brazos basin area and not lithic materials local the Upper Trinity River basin. Lintz and others (2004)suggestthatthesamepossibilityat41TR174onthe WestFork. 33

ArcheologicalJournaloftheTexasPrairie-Savannah Williams (2004:236) makes an interesting statement about the aboriginal peoples that inhabited sites along the East Fork. Williams hypothesized that the people who inhabited the East Fork belonged to a different culture than those of the Elm and West Forks. The basis for this statement is probably the fact that regularly spaced central base camps are present along the rivers that are not present along the other drainages. In addition, violence may have occurred among the East Fork peoples as they expanded westward (Williams 2004). This tends to be supported bythe findings at the Sister Grove Creek site (41COL36) and the Lower Rockwall site (41RW1). Interestingly enough, Shafer (2006:7) places the separation between the Northern and Southern Prairie Caddo east of Joe Pool Lake. Might not the territorial boundary be marked by the East Fork of theTrinityRiver? Finally, thearcheologyof theUpperTrinityRiver basin would beenhanced bythe study of ephemeral sites such as the Dalby site (41DL350) (Skinner et al. 2005) and at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988), and 41DL270 (Anthony and Brown 1994). The Dalby site ranges in age from ca. A.D. 450 to 1500, yet no intensive occupation was found there. Except for one hearth and one burial, the use of the site by the aboriginal population was recognized by burned clay, charcoal, utilized freshwater mussels, and a scatter of artifacts. In other words, the occupations were brief. Vertically stratified deposits offer us a chance to deal with a single occupation episode that can be dated and which offers the opportunity to look at a distinguishable living surface if enough area is excavated. Looking at the tool kits, residue from limited and specific tasks provide an ideal setting for describing work/living areas and their relationship to features, artifact scatters, etc (Skinner et al. 2005). These archeological data sets thus can contribute key insights into the lifeways of specific groups of people across the landscape such as a familyactivityor ahunting,and gatheringactivitybylargertaskgroups.
