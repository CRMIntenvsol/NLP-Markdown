ABSTRACT Archaeological investigations were conducted for approximately 90% of fee-simple purchase areas for the proposed Superconducting Super Collider between October 1989 and July 1990. These studies are ongoing. Eventually, the entire 54 mile ring will be surveyed since geotechnical activities and indirect impacts will be performed for the full circuit. In all, 7 archaeological sites have been recorded and have received preliminary evaluations of their potential eligibility for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Cultural resources which will be directly impacted by this project include prehistoric camps and tool manufacturing areas, historic farmsteads, schools and churches, cotton gins, a small rural comimunity (Boz), and the Ellis County Poor Farm. These resources will be irrevocably ultered by the project and this report presents the first phase of treatment for the loss of this cultural heritage. == Pot es J aS il _| C33

EE mH HH HH HE MANAGEMENT SUMMARY From October 1989 to July 1990, the Archaeology Research Program of Southern Methodist University conducted a background and archival search and pedestrian reconnaissances of proposed land acquisitions and impact areas for archaeological and cultural resources within the Superconducting Super Collider. This project is under construction by the Department of Energy; Universities Research Association, Inc.; Superconducting Super Collider Laboratory; and Texas Natural Resources Laboratory Commission. Construction of this machine will directly affect about 10,000 acres of Ellis County, Texas. An additional 10,000 acres over the ring may be indirectly impacted. Approximately 43 historic and prehistoric archaeological sites had been recorded in Ellis County prior to commehcement of this work. An additional 77 archaeological sites have now been recorded in approximately 90% of the fee-simple purchase areas. Thirteen sites are prehistoric, two are prehistoric/historic, and sixty-two are historic. The archaeological research conducted for the project follows the Secretary of Interior's Standards and Guidelines, the Texas Antiquities Code, and the Council of Texas Archaeologist's Guidelines. This includes the inventory and evaluation of a number of cultural resources, including oral history, vegetation ecology, architecture, primary and secondary archival sources, dendrochronology, and archaeology. The multidisciplinary focus of this research has involved the participation of nonarchaeological professionals, to develop a more complete and accurate cultural model for the SSC project area. These resources, taken together, offer a more detailed picture of the local population (and inferentially, the prehistoric populations) than would otherwise be possible. The primary objective of this project is the collection and synthesis of the greatest amount of data possible and to record and report this information in a manner that it can be compared with different projects from region to region. This report is an interim document which presents the results of the investigations conducted to date. Since land access and project scheduling are ongoing, additional surveys, informant interviews, and other research will be necessary to completely inventory and evaluate the cultural resources affected by the Superconducting Super Collider. These will be attached to this report, which is the first of several phases of compliance with Federal and State cultural resources laws and guidelines. ii

ay J is me ese a INTRODUCTION 1 The Archaeology Research Program of Southern Methodist University, under contract (ESC 90821) with Universities Research Association, Inc., has performed field surveys of proposed fee-simple purchase by David H. Jumey areas and impact areas associated with the Superconducting Super Collider in Ellis County, Texas. The lead Federal Agency responsible for this project is the Department of Energy. The responsibilities for compliance with federal and state cultural resources protection laws and guidelines are shared by the Idaho National_ Engineering Laboratory Commission, EG&G, Inc.; the Superconducting Super Collider Laboratory; and the Texas Natural Resources Laboratory Commission. The Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) is located entirely within Ellis County, Texas (Figure 1-1). This project is south of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and the present landscape consists primarily of rural farmlands. The SSC will be a 54 mile ring which completely encircles the town of Waxahachie (Figure 1-2). Other towns and communities adjacent to the SSC include (clockwise from the northwest) Midlothian, Red Oak, Palmer, Garrett, Ennis, Bardwell, Avalon, Forreston, Italy, and Maypearl. The entire community of Boz will be within the West Campus. The principal impacts to the Ellis County landscape will be confined to fee-simple purchase areas for the East and West Campuses, shaft penetrations, and cooling ponds (Figure 1-3). Most of the 54 mile ring will not produce any direct impacts to the land surface, since the SSC will be constructed by boring a tunnel over 100 feet below the ground, in bedrock. The most extensive impacts will be within the West Campus, where over 300 acres will be excavated, and an entire administrative and scientific complex will be constructed. The largest proposed project areas under consideration are the West Campus, with approximately 7500 acres; the East Campus, with approximately 1500 acres; and the Ellis County Farm, with approximately 450 acres, In addition, 25 shaft penetration areas are planned, totalling approximately 1256 acres. Some roads will be improved, and approximately 5 miles of new road construction is planned. Other roadways will be upgraded and improved and additional utilities will be needed. All of these areas will receive full pedestrian reconnaissance, identifying all cultural resources. Approximately 90% of fee-simple purchase areas has been completed as of this interim report. The archaeological survey for the SSC was conducted to identify any cultural resources within the project area which may be potentially eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Protection of these resources is required by a number of federal laws and regulations, including but not

All of these regulations direct federal land managers to implement cultural resources inventory and assessment programs with the consultation of the SHPO, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and interested parties. The present, first phase archaeological survey was designed to comply with standard archaeological survey methodology as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (National Park Service 1983), the Council of Texas Guidelines (CTA 1987), and the regulations implementing the Texas Antiquities Code (13TAC41). In all, approximately 90% of the fee-simple purchases has been surveyed to date (September 11, 1990). When the remainder of the ring is considered, approximately 70% of the entire project area has received intensive coverage. Sixty-two historic sites, thirteen prehistoric, and two multiple component prehistoric/historic sites have been identified, recorded, and have received preliminary evaluations. These sites have been categorized according to a three level priority for further work (high, medium, low). A high priority indicates that the property may be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP); and 16 archaeological sites have been classified as high priority. A medium priority indicates that the NRHP eligibility is not known at present and further work is recommended; twenty-eight archaeological sites have been classified as medium priority. A low priority indicates that the archaeological site is probably not eligible for the NRHP, and 33 properties have been classified as low priority. This report consists of eight chapters, accompanied by four appendices, which present interim information on recorded cultural properties and a summary of initial researches on the cultural background of the region. Chapter 2 of this report describes the environmental setting for Ellis County. The bedrock geology is briefly summarized and evaluated for the potential preservation of archaeological sites, The soils, climate, and vegetation are discussed in some detail, since these aspects of the environment are important to understanding the human use and occupation of the region. The climate has fluctuated in the past, which has caused shifts in the vegetation and has also affected human settlements and use of the project area. Chapter 3 presents the prehistoric archaeological background for the region. Due to the fact that few large archaeological studies have been performed in Ellis County, this chapter draws on previous research in Dallas, Tarrant, and Navarro Counties as well as other areas of northem, central, and eastern Texas and adjacent states of Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. Two important aspects of prehistoric settlement and use of Ellis County are naturally occurring springs to which people were attracted, and ancient upland gravels (Uvalde) which were exploited for the manufacture of stone tools. At present, these two prehistoric property types, (i.e., spring heads and upland gravel sources) have not been adequately investigated in this region. Future studies associated with the SSC should explore more fully these site types using the 1-2

properties identified within the project lands. Such investigations will help to expand the local settlement patterns which are heavily biased by large reservoir projects consisting mostly of fluvial bottomlands and valley flank studies. Archaeological studies of large sections of the Blackland prairie ecosystem have not been undertaken to date in Texas placing important emphasis on the SSC studies described here. Integrating known and newly found sites in the greater SSC project area will provide a strong data base to fill in the void between wooded environments to the east and grassland and savannah environments of the lower Great Plains to the west. Based on known prehistoric sites in Ellis County, chipping areas, camps, habitations, and burial grounds are known to be present. The SSC project, however, is primarily upland, which has fewer sites than lowlands. Chapter 4 presents the historic background for Ellis County. Specific events and persons that have influenced the settlement and development of the county are summarized. Farming, by both landowners and tenants has played the most significant role in Ellis County's history and the majority of recorded historic archaeological sites are farmsteads. Cotton gins, schools, churches, and the Ellis County Poor Farm are other historic property types which represent important aspects of the development of the county. Chapter 5, the Research Design, integrates the historical significance of archaeological properties within a series of questions about human behavior. This is a preliminary design, which involves the overriding theme of Human Ecology and requires the simultaneous reconstruction of past lifeways and past environments. The research questions provide an empirical means of evaluating the importance of specific archaeological properties in terms of the data contained in them and their historical context. Chapter 6 is a description of the 13 prehistoric sites and the prehistoric components at two prehistoric/historic sites. The value of each is discussed in relation to the present environment and the potential yield of information that may be used to address the research questions. Prehistoric properties are evaluated for their potential significance under Criteria A, B, C, when appropriate, in addition to Criterion D. Chapter 7 contains the descriptions of the 62 historic properties and the historic components of two prehistoric/historic sites. The nature of each site is discussed, previous occupants or owners are identified, the property's applicability to meet National Register Criteria A, B, C, and D is reviewed, and its potential to yield information useful to address research questions is summarized. Chapter 8 summarizes the prehistoric and historic site assessments and provides recommendations for further work. The management of cultural resources is an ongoing educational and scientific process, and a number of options should be considered in the treatment of properties impacted by the SSC. Appendix A is a descriptive summary of investigations that have been conducted for the geotechnical explorations necessary to plan construction. This study was conducted simultaneously with the survey of fee-simple purchase areas. However, any cultural resources that were identified were avoided by redesigning the access routes or moving the bore location. 1-3 Ee es

e . # SS " _ =< u aa maz: Appendix B contains brief summaries of the General Land Office surveys dating from 1834-1888 and the SSC and Works Progress Administration surveys of 1936-1937 farms within and adjacent to the project area. Also included are notes which were transcribed from the Ellis County Commissioners Court and death records relating to the County Farm. These data comprise working files that can be used to understand the history of land use in the project and to determine the effects on specific cultural resources. Appendix C presents a narrative summary of ethnohistorical interviews that were conducted in conjunction with the archaeological survey. In order to maintain confidentiality, specific names and initials have been deleted. Copies of this report will be delivered to the respondents, and if they approve, their names may be used in the final report. Additional informant interviews are planned to gain further details on specific cultural properties, as well as sampling other ethnic groups (¢.g., Hispanic Americans, Czechs, and Easter Europeans). Appendix D is incomplete at present (October 1990), since this is an ongoing project involving archaeological collections performed by non-professional archaeologists. This information is useful for understanding the range of archaeological resources that is present in Ellis County. For example, collections that have been made over several decades greatly augment data obtained by single visit archaeological reconnaissances. The research philosophy employed in the SSC archaelogical survey is that of focused multidisciplinary research, examining numerous facets of the cultural and environmental ecology (past and present) for the region. As noted by Martha Doty Freeman (Story et al. 1990:367-384) many Cultural Resource Management projects never pass beyond descriptions of the archaeological data as manifestations of historical events. ARP has achieved significant results in the elucidation of the late prehistoric settlement for the Richland Creek region, specifically the investigations of Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch sites (Bruseth and Martin 1987:159-167) and the Cobb-Pool site in Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988). Also, ARP has employed multidisciplinary approaches in the study of historical archaeological sites, employing non-archaeological professionals in history, architecture, and ethnology. Oral history, dendrochronology, architectural history, cemetery studies, and reconstruction of the cultural environmental landscape within and around project areas have been conducted for Richland Creek (Moir and Jurney 1987; Jumey and Moir 1987), Joe Pool Lake (Moir et al. 1988; Jurney et al. 1988), and North Central Texas (Jumey et al. 1989). As prehistoric and historic properties considered eligible are studied further, it will be necessary to involve some to explore more fully the range of important data present. Eventually, this database will allow the development of a Cultural Resources Managment Plan for the SSC which will not only detail local cultural patterns, but also relate them to regional ones. Finally, since detailed studies of historic and prehistoric properties in sizeable areas of the Blackland Prairie Belt in North Central Texas and away from major alluvial valleys have not been conducted to date, the investigations associated with the SSC will offer an opportunity to fill some important local and regional data gaps. 1-4

| =} Co = == L a 3 os f | ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING by David H. Jumey with contributions by Brenda C. Cole GEOLOGY The SSC project is located in the north-central portion of Texas, which is classified as the West Gulf Coastal Plain Section of the Coastal Plain Province (Fenneman 1938). This area is generally characterized by low gently rolling relief formed from the weathering of relatively soft sedimentary rocks. The surface geology (Figure 2-1) consists of a series of latest Cretaceous and Paleocene age (63 million years old) lithified sediments of various hardnesses and rates of erosion. The principal geologic strata (west to east) are the Eagle Ford Group, the Austin Chalk, and the lower Taylor Marl (Ozan Formation). The Eagle Ford Group and the Taylor Marl comprise all of the project area and are most susceptible to erosion. The landscape is characterized by broad rolling uplands dissected by low gradient streams. The Austin Chalk is a clayey limestone which is more resistant to weathering, but which is relatively unstable where exposed. This escarpment, or surface landform is exposed from northeast Texas, through Dallas and extends to near San Antonio, although various limestones are articulated in the southernmost area. In areas such as Cedar Hill, in southwestern Dallas County, the Austin Chalk forms distinct escarpments while in an area 3 miles west of the western project boundary, near Maypearl, this escarpment is less pronounced. Another minor stratum, consisting of unconsolidated Quaternary deposits, is the Wolf City Sand. This stratum is adjacent to the Trinity River Trench, and for the most part, is outside the Study area. The Eagle Ford Group consists of shale, sandstone and limestone, with calcareous concretions. Sandstone and sandy limestone are in the upper part, with bentonites in the lower part. A hard limestone bed marks the base in Ellis and Johnson Counties, and low cuestas 200-300 feet thick have formed in small localities. The Austin Chalk is divided into three parts, with chalk throughout the upper and lower parts. There are some interbeds of calcareous clay. The formation weathers white with scarce marine megafossils. It is from 300-500 feet thick and will be the most extensive formation within the SSC project area. The Ozan Formation, or Lower Taylor Marl consists of clay with calcareous silt and sand increasing toward the top of the formation. It grades upward to the Wolfe City Sand. There are common marine megafossils and the thickness is over 500 feet. The formation weathers bright brownish gray. oe ran 2-1

These appear to be water worn lag gravels from long abandoned stream channels, dating to the early stages of the Pleistocene or earlier (Byrd 1971; Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Banks 1990). These gravels provide the only locally available sources for the manufacture of stone tools. Banks (1990) indicates that the term "Uvalde" gravels can be used to describe this feature which is an ubiquitous term applied to almost all relict gravel deposits on late Tertiary and Pleistocene remnants of the High Plains that once extended as far to the east as Fort Worth, with redeposited gravels extending much further, possibly into Louisiana, where it is known as the Citronelle Gravel. In addition to drainage patterns that developed due to the differential erosion of geologic strata, certain groundwater or surface aquifers and stream drainages were also produced by ancient tectonic activity, as a result of the Pennsylvanian mountain building epoch (trends northeast-southwest) which produced crustal deformation (forming Grabens) due to sediment loading in the Gulf of Mexico (Dave Goss, SSCL consultant, personal communication 1990). Small fracture belts up to 200 ft wide have influenced surface and subsurface water flow in the western project area, particularly along tributary drainages to Greathouse Creek and Baker Branch. This tectonic phenomenon has made erosion a major factor in the preservation of prehistoric sites in the western project area. Indeed, calcite crystals which are visible at the surface within fracture lines in this area indicate high groundwater tables that are estimated to be 40,000+ years old (Dave Goss, personal communication 1990). These calcite crystals may be suitable for radiocarbon dating, thereby indicating the rate of peneplanation (landscape levelling) and groundwater lowering over the last several episodes of the Quaternary. The Austin Chalk provides a source of stone which was used by historic people for foundation and chimney material. However, it is highly susceptible to weathering, and heat rapidly breaks down its Structure. During the historic period, it was possible to excavate massive wells and/or cisterns in this geological formation throughout the western project area, However, dependable water in the chalk rock areas is located at 600-800 feet, below the Austin Chalk (Brooks et al. 1964:71). Today the chalk from the Austin formation and shale from the Eagle Ford provide materials for making concrete. The Taylor Marl, located within the eastern and southern portions of the project area, was relatively unconsolidated and wells dug during the historic period usually had to be lined with wood or brick to prevent collapse. Although stone was not available for building, the Taylor Marl was suitable for brick manufacturing, and plants were developed at Palmer and Ferris. The distribution of Quaternary Terraces (see Figure 2-1) is of great relevance to the location and potential preservation of archaeological sites dating to the Paleo-Indian period. The mapped Quaternary Terrace units are relatively few in the SSC project area, and are limited to small areas along Red Oak Creek and around Lake Bardwell. There are more extensive Quaternary Terraces along Chambers Creek, some of 2-2

which are present in the headwaters in Johnson County. These “stranded” terraces are thought to be relicts of a pre-Holocene drainage, possibly including the Trinity River that once occupied the Chambers Creek Valley (Billy Stringer, Soil Conservation Service, personal communication 1990). Figure 2-1 illustrates how the underfit Chambers Creek has extensively cut the Eagle Ford Formation and Austin Chalk. The location of this relict drainage pattern has great relevance to our understanding of landform development in the southern SSC project area. The Quaternary Terraces which have been mapped during the geotechnic explorations for the SSC are fairly limited in their distribution. Quaternary Terrace deposits are located between the shaft penetrations F6 and E7; F8 and E9; E9 and F9, where there are Uvalde gravels present; Fl and E2; and E4 and Red Oak Creek. These terrace deposits have the potential to contain Pleistocene megafauna, but may contain evidence of human occupation only on their surfaces, since they may date more than 20,000 years. Post Pleistocene (H>locene) alluvium is also relatively limited in the SSC project area (see Figure 2- 1). The only significant areas where Holocene alluvium has accumulated are Red Oak, Grove, Waxahachie, and Onion Creeks. The areas where alluvium is located include F6 and E7; F7 and E8, with Big Onion Creek, Waxahachie Creek between E2 and F2; and Red Oak Creek between F3 and E4 and F4 and ES. Also, there is a substantial acccumulation of alluvium within the East Campus along Grove and Cottonwood Creeks. This points to the fact that relatively few areas in the study area have the potential to contain buried deposits relating to the prehistoric cultures that settled within and used Ellis County following the end of the Pleistocene. In a way this is extremely beneficial to modelling site potential and presence, since deep excavations can be cost effectively concentrated in a few areas with direct construction impacts. CLIMATE The western portion of Ellis County is classified as falling within a transitional belt between the Subtropical Humid and Subtropical Subhumid climatic regions (Collins and Bousman 1990). Eastern Ellis County (breaking about Waxahachie) falls entirely within the Subtropical Humid region. This is about the same location where the 32 inch/rainfall/year isopleth occurs. This isopleth zone falls along an area passing through Rockwall, Ellis, Navarro, and Limestone Counties. The climate in Ellis County affects agriculture in several ways, but four circumstances stand out; (1) there is irregular seasonal distribution of effective rainfall, (2) there is a fairly high rate of evapotranspiration, (3) there are frequently periods of more than 100°F temperature for several days in summer (usually in August), and (4) there are moderate winters with cold spells rarely lasting more than several days (Brooks et al. 1964:72). About 60% of the annual precipitation falls in the spring and summer. Excessive amounts of rain in the spring often delays planting, keeps the soil cold, and causes.erosion.

ey en) \ } L ) (i : } t ) rr clean cultivation (total plowing under of harvested plant stubble and potential ground cover), a large percentage of this rainfall is often lost to runoff. The wind also affects water retention. In spring a strong westerly or southwesterly wind may blow in dust storms. Cold winter air masses called "northers" move into the area from the north and bring sudden drops in temperature. When this event follows a warm and moist winter, it may terminate what is known as "False Spring”, and produce severe freezing of early crops, fruit trees, and affect the growth of post oak and other species of trees (Stahle 1990). On the average, there are 275 days between the last recorded temperature of 28°F temperature in the spring and the first in the fall (Brooks et al. 1964:73), which can be called the frost-free period. This allows all general field crops to mature, and the winters are mild enough for cool-season crops (such as wheat) to grow. The winter wheat crop is often the most dependable, but if there is a dry fall, this particular crop may not make a stand sufficient enough to cover the cultivated land or provide grazing in this area. SOILS Only three major soil associations are present within the SSC project area; the Eddy-Stephen, Austin, and Houston Black-Houston Series (Figure 2-2). The Austin Chalk underlies the Eddy-Stephen and Austin Associations, composing the western project area. The Taylor Marl underlies the Houston Black-Houston association which underlies the eastern project area. As stated previously, the uplift of the Austin Chalk has produced minor surficial fracturing which has influenced groundwater movement as well as geomorphological conditions which in turn are generally unfavorable for the burial and/or preservation of archaeological sites in primary contexts. Other minor soil associations include the Burleson Clay and the Trinity-Frio. Figure 2-3 illustrates the stratigraphic positioning of the Austin and Eddy soils. This view is from the SW, typical of the area between Maypearl and Boz. The generally rolling upland soils formed on Austin Chalk are truncated by the west facing escarpment. The West Campus is located in this general environmental zone, from 640-720 ft ams, on the Eddy and Austin soils, from 1 to 8% slopes. The tunnel itself will be near the base of the Austin Chalk. Figure 2-4 illustrates the landscape from the West to the East Campus, and is fairly accurate in term of stream placement and drainage patterns. Greathouse Branch is west of the West Campus, Onion Creek is in the south-central portion of the ring, and Red Oak Creek forms the northeastern border of the ring. South Prong Creek is not shown in this generalized figure. The junction between soils formed on chalk and the Taylor Marl is approximately in the center of the ring. Overall the landscape of the ring is characterized as gently rolling uplands which were broad tallgrass prairies in their native state. The vegetation of the western portion of the project area, on chalk, graded into short to medium grasses (Billy Stringer, Soil Conservation Service, personal communication 1990). 2-4

Two radiocarbon dates, taken from 4 to 5 ft below surface within the drill core for the shaft penetration BE8, in the Onion Creek valley, were submitted for dating to see if a rate of valley alluviation could be calculated. A clear soil horizon was preserved in the core from 4.5 ft below surface, an abrupt boundary between light grey clay loam with many fragmented snail shells to a dark organic clay loam. This soil boundary is also present in the stream bank of Onion Creek, approximately 50 meters north of the core location. Initially it was hypothesized that this buried black soil may be the Navarro (Bruseth et al. 1987:229-247) or Copan Paleosol (Hall 1982; Collins and Bousman 1990). The lower date was recent with 107.43+0.76% organic carbon (SMU 2405), indicating the input of radioactive carbon from atomic bomb testing. The upper date was 3190480 BP (SMU 2416), indicating that older sediments have been eroded from adjacent upland soils, burying the historic landscape. This phenomenon of deeply buried recent soils, covered by older sediments has been observed elsewhere in central Texas (Britt Bousman, personal communication 1990; Mike Collins, personal communication 1990). Three soils comprise the major part of the landscape along the western project area: the Eddy, Stephens, and Austin soils. The Eddy Series soils consist of dark grayish-brown lithosols and thin gravelly clay loams on uplands, which are underlain (usually 10-20 cm) by chalk. Plant roots penetrate the upper portion of the chalk, primarily through cracks. Pastures on these soils are composed mostly of short grasses and mesquite (Brooks et al. 1964:13). Only the Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3 percent slopes is suitable for occasional cultivation due to its droughty nature. Small grains, sweet clover, and similar cool season crops grow best on this type of soil. The typical soil profile of an Eddy gravelly clay loam consists of an Ajp from 0-6 inches below surface, over R-Ac platy chalk from 6-30 inches, over R soft chalk from 30-70 inches (Brooks et al. 1964:69). The Stephens Series soils consist of well-drained, shallow silty clays containing chalky rock fragments which overlie bedrock, and is called the whiterock prairie. This soil is slightly thicker than the Eddy, and ranges up to 30 cm deep. These soils are shallowest when they are near Eddy soils, and deepest when they are near Austin soils (Brooks et al. 1964:23). The Stephen developed under prairie, with side-oats grama, big bluestem, little bluestem, Indian grass, and other middle to tall grasses. A typical Stephen silty clay soil profile consists of an Ay, with chalk fragments on the surface, from 0-4 inches thick; an A12 with many chalk fragments from 4-14 inches; and R-Ac from 14-24 inches, and R from 24-40 inches (Brooks et al. 1964:68). The Austin Series Soils are well drained, moderately deep, friable silty clays on the prairie, and are well dissected by small drainages. The surface soil ranges from 15-20 cm and contains weathered chalk fragments. This soil is deepest in small valleys and concave footslopes, reaching up to 1 meter in depth. These soils also have developed under middle to tall grasses. A typical Austin silty clay profile consists of an Ajp from 0-6 inches, an Ay2 from 6-16 inches, an Ay3 from 16-22 inches, AC from 22-34 inches, and C from 34-42 inches (Brooks et al. 1964:59). 2-5 4 ace Co C= | SS Ge C3 Vee et 5

——4 E = The Burleson Clay Terrace (Figure 2-1, Number 1) is a landform that was produced during the Quaternary by broad scale downcutting. It is located along the north side of Chambers Creek, north of Waxahachie Creek, and north of Red Oak Creek. On this landform the Houston-Black and Burleson clays are the dominant soil types. The Burleson Series are very dark gray, deep heavy clay soils with a dense subsoil that slowly takes water. The surface layer is 10-15 cm in depth and is susceptible to cracking. The parent material is weathered old alluvium, rich in lime. When these soils are located on stream terraces, the parent material consists of this lime-rich alluvium with seams of water-bearing stratified sands and gravels (Brooks et al. 1964:11). These particular soils are deepest when they cover large areas, where the sand and gravel deposits are buried up to 15 ft deep in the ancient alluvium. A typical Burleson clay profile consists of an Aip from 0-4 inches; an A42 from 4-12 inches, compacted by tillage; an A13 from 12-26 inches; and AC from 26-40 inches; and C from 40-60 inches (Brooks et al. 1964:40). Two soils, the Houston and Houston Black comprise the majority of the landscape for the SSC project area east of Waxahachie generally from 400-500 ft amsl. The Houston Series are dark olive-gray, deep heavy clay soils, and are generally eroded (Brooks et al. 1964:16). These soils are well drained, rich in lime, and are agriculturally productive. Prior to historic settlement the native vegetation on these soils consisted of middle to tall grasses. The parent material underlying the Houston Series is either an olive clay or clayey marl (Taylor), however in the transitional zone between the Austin Series to the west, the Houston soils may overlie Austin Chalk. A typical Houston clay profile consists of an Ayp from 0-3 inches, with 3-15 cm pebbles on the surface; an Ay2 with few small (20 mm) pebbles from 3-9 inches; an AC from 9-34 inches, with few small (3-4 mm) pebbles; and C from 34-46 inches (Brooks et al. 1964:63). An important point to note is that these rounded quartzite pebbles and cobbles (Uvalde Gravels) are within the plow zone, while only smaller pebbles (2-4 mm) are below the plow zone in undisturbed soil. It is for this reason that the Uvalde gravels are termed "veneer", due to the fact that they are surface features that resulted from ancient (Pleistocene, Tertiary, or older) geological processes. The Houston Black Series are nearly level, gently sloping deep clays on uplands and terraces. These particular soils are moderately well drained, rich in lime, and are the most agriculturally productive in the region. As with the Houston soils, the native vegetation of the Houston Black consisted middle to tall grasses prior to historic settlement. In places, pebbles and cobbles are sometimes present in these soils. The parent material is weathered chalk, calcareous clay, clayey shale, or old alluvium. The A horizon is 15-30 cm thick and is intensely succeptable to cracking. This soil is intensively cultivated, and is quite mobile, or self-mulching. A typical Houston Black Clay (on the Ellis County Farm, 41EL58) consists of an A1p from 0-6 inches, with few rounded pebbles (3-15 cm in diameter) on the surface; an Aq2 from 6-16 inches, an A13 from 16-40 inches; an AC from 40-70 inches; and C from 70-80 inches (Brooks et al. 1964:63- 64). 2-6

One last soil Series, the Trinity Clay is found in the floodplains of Big Onion, Waxahachie, Grove, and Red Oak Creeks. Although not extensive, this soil type is very important for archaeological investigations, since sites can be deeply buried in the floodplains which are associated with this soil. Although sites may be harder to find in these areas, the processes which formed the Trinity Clay soils could have preserved and separated various cultural occupations through time. As a result all stream cuts in this soil type were closely examined during field survey. The Trinity Series are deep heavy clays, rich in lime, on floodplains. The surface layer is over 50 cm deep, and has over a 1 m thick subsoil. The parent material is calcareous alluvium washed from the blackland prairie. Beds of stratified sand and gravel lie beneath the parent material in many places. The typical Trinity clay soil profile for Ellis County was described in the Trinity River floodplain, and may not be quite as representative of the few areas that it is located within the SSC project (i.e., Red Oak, Grove, Waxahachie, and Big Onion Creeks). PRESETTLEMENT VEGETATION The SSC project area is situated along the westem edge of the East Texas zone of primary productivity in terms of the biomass (plants and animals) production (Rosenzweeg 1968; Owen and Schmidly 1986; cf. Collins and Bousman 1990:25). This factor is extremely significant to the understanding of long term climatic change. This zone is felt to have shifted frequently in conditioned response to climatic shifts. Therefore, such “edge” areas have the potential to yield significant information for environmental reconstruction through proxy records such as pollen in alluvial and aquatic deposits, geomorphological and soils analysis, dendrochronology, and other paleoenvironmental techniques of climatic reconstruction (Figure 2-5). - Historic reconstruction of plant communities that were recorded through General Land Office Surveyors’ notes taken during the distribution of Public Domain in Texas, Oklahoma, and southern United States have provided data on limited samples of native vegetation communities (Jordan 1973; Delcourt and Delcourt 1974; 1977; Delcourt 1976; Schafale and Harcombe 1983; Jumey 1987, 1988a; Weniger 1984). These notes provided fairly consistent and dependable data on arboreal species, and in some cases prairie/forest boundaries (Bourdo 1956; Delcourt and Delcourt 1974, 1977; Delcourt 1976; Schafale and Harcombe 1983; Jurney 1987, 1988a; Weniger 1984). Historic reconstructions are most successful when compared to modern community studies based on appropriate sampling and mapping techniques, and when cross-checked in the field (Schafale and Harcombe 1983), if native arboreal ecosystems remain. In Ellis County, all native arboreal ecosystems as well as prairies have been totally altered or eradicated. These types of studies using archival information, although biased by the political economy of land entrepreneurship and the lag factor + from initial frontier mapping to subsequent infilling of the settled landscape, provide a firm baseline from 2-7 fos

which paleobotanical changes can be developed, and the amount of climatic versus man-induced alteration within the modern environment can be understood. Based on the General Land Office surveyor's notes of Ellis County, the SSC project area encompasses three major presettlement ecosystems: pure upland prairies, brushy prairies adjacent to stream valleys (uplands and slopes), and riparian forests (floodplains) along streams such as Red Oak, Grove, Chambers, and Waxahachie Creek. Since the beginning of the historic period, these original plant communities and physiographic settings have been altered by numerous human activities. For example, fire suppression allowed trees and shrubs to encroach upon the prairie, In the eastern project, gullying was noted along prairie/slope margins of Red Oak Creek during the initial GLO surveys. In heavily forested areas, native trees were cut for housing, fences and fuel. Settlers also planted seeds and saplings from "home" thereby altering the general landscape by introducing exotic species. Bois d'arc is one transplanted species which was Not present.in the native ecosystem west of the Trinity River (Jurney 1988a). Due to its importance in fence building, building foundation piers, wagon spokes, etc., settlers planted this tree as a first priority, and today is has a dominant status in some areas. The largest of the native plant communities was the upland prairie. While this area was dominated by grasses and forbs, a large variety of trees were also present along the fringes of stream valleys and lowlying upland areas. Elm and mesquite were the most common trees followed by hackberry and cottonwood. Minor tree species along the brushy fringes of the upland prairies included several types of oaks, red cedar, and fruit and nut bearing trees such as haw, gum bumelia, and persimmon. The large number of forage tree species present in this area would have been conducive to high faunal populations. The riparian forest ecosystem would have been found along the streams of Ellis County. These consisted of hardwood forests and occasional wetland prairies. Elm was the dominant tree followed by hackberry, Spanish oak, and pecan. Oak species, fruit and nut producers such as red haw, walnut, and mulberry were also present. Much of the understory would have been water-loving species such as cattails and bulrushes. Along Waxahachie Creek and the eastern SSC project area around Ennis a higher density of mesquite was recorded in the surveyor's notes. Other trees were elm, hackberry, pecan, and ash. Along the wetland prairie cottonwood was the dominant tree followed by elm, hackberry, and mesquite. Numerous fruit and nut producers such as red haw, mulberry, and walnut were also present. This understory would again have contained water-loving species. Overall the presettlement vegetation of the SSC project area was predominantly prairie along with several riparian forests and wetland prairie communities included. The area would have been very rich in forage species which would have been able to support a large number of faunal species. This in tum would have made excellent hunting for local human populations as well. Hardwood resources were extremely important for historic settlers. Although some oak species were present in riparian forests and along the slopes of major drainages, extensive oak forests not present within the SSC project area. Nevertheless a major oak forest was located around the Tellico area, east of Ennis. 2-8 = a= = ] fl : } =

J = Cc) This forest was lumbered prior to and after the Civil War. A mortise and tenon frame church in Tellico has been tree-ring dated to 1867. This church was built from locally sawn post oak lumber. A second expanse of post oak forest was present near Italy, but was not as extensive as the one at Tellico. Both of these areas, along with the Red Oak, Greathouse, and Chambers Creek valleys offered sufficient forest resources (primarily oak) to attract early settlers. It is also probable that the early settlers within the prairie areas of the SSC project imported some hardwood lumber as well as pine lumber from east Texas. Post oak lumber was essential for horizontal log houses. Small oaks could be hewn and used in timber framing, but siding was needed to complete the structure. Larger oaks could be sawn, but due to their hardness and tendency to warp this species was not suitable for siding in most cases. Baldcypress and pine siding and framing materials had to be imported overland from East Texas by wagon. After the introduction of the railroad, cost for imported lumber fell, and a wave of construction began. Elms, pecans, and hackberries were second choices for construction and were generally not used in houses. Firewood was a commodity that insured the disappearance of native forests, which were replaced by managed wood lots. PRESETTLEMENT FAUNA The SSC project area, as noted above is dominated by prairie ecosystems, and was probably similar in the associated environments throughout the Holocene. Presumably, the most important animals of the tallgrass prairies were bison, cottontail and jack rabbit, and antelope; with bear, raccoon, white-tailed deer, and wild turkey along the wooded fringes of streams and around springs. On the basis of faunal data from archaeological sites (Dillehay 1974 has suggested two periods when bison were essentially absent from the southern High Plains; 6000/5000 B.C. to 2500 B.C. and A.D. 500 to A.D. 1200/1300. Lynott (1979) reviewed the extant evidence (which is relatively poor for earlier periods) for North Central Texas and concluded that they were never very numerous in the tallgrass prairies, but that after ca. A.D. 1200 their numbers did increase. Apparently, white-tailed deer were always the most dependable game animal within the SSC project area. MODERN FLORA The SSC project area has been radically altered by the historic settlement of the region. There are no known areas of native prairie left in Ellis County. The Katchina Prairie near Ennis, and a small area within the West Campus have been re-established as prairies, but the original plant communities probably do not reflect the undisturbed ecosystem. Also, the supression of prairie fires and the placement of barbed wire fences across the prairies have fostered a grid of hackberry and elm trees along the fencelines. Today elms and hackberries comprise a significant portion of the arboreal vegetation in wooded areas that were once prairies.

Another tree species which has been introduced onto the prairies is bois d'arc. This tree was planted by settlers to serve as hedges and as sources of fence posts, wagon spokes and foundation material. Mesquite is also thought to be an introduced species, resulting from the early herding of cattle. However, the GLO records indicate that large mesquite were relatively numerous in the native prairies during the 1830s-1840s. MODERN FAUNA Today, the animals of Ellis County also reflect the extreme disturbances wrought on the native ecosystems. Bison and bear have been extirpated. White-tailed deer were also extirpated during the late nineteenth century, and have been reintroduced since World War II. Raccoon, oppossum, armadillo, and coyote have been the most successful species to adapt to the modern landscape. Wild turkey were observed during our surveys of the wooded thickets around upper South Prong Creek. In summary, the landscape of today is only slightly similar to that of the presettlement period. For instance, the most common game animal in the Chambers Creek forest is reported to be feral hog. The native plants and animals have been altered in terms of their lifeways and habitats. Therefore any archaeological sites which may contain fauna or floral remains from the early historic or prehistoric periods could potentially yield significant information on the native ecosystems. 2-10 r~ —s —- ( hen eS : = =< a : . } — =o : Ue :

| PREHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND 3 by Bill R. Chada and David H. Jumey In the State of Texas, the diversity of the archaeological record and the environment is so great that a narrower focus must be given to the location of the Superconducting Super Collider Project, which is located in Ellis County, Texas. Through time Ellis County has been located within different cultural areas which have been arbitrarily defined on the basis of archaeological remains and physiographic provinces. As Bruseth et al. (1987) note, these arbitrary divisions are not so clearly defined in the archaeological record. During the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, cultural affiliations were with the North Central Plains (Figure 3-1, from Brown et al. 1982). During the Early historic contact era, Ellis County was within the Northeast Culture area (Figure 3-2), but was adjacent to the Northeast culture area and the Prehorse Plains culture area. During the Late Contact era, when indigenous historic Indian groups are somewhat identifiable, Ellis County was well within the Caddoan Language area (Figure 3-3), but was adjacent to the Shosonean Language area. Ellis County is located on the southern border of what has been defined as North Central Texas, therefore adjacent cultural areas exerted considerable influence on the prehistory of the project area. The archaeological evidence in North Central Texas lacks major syntheses, but several recent publications have brought much of the archaeological data together. Lynott's Regional Model for Archaeological Research in Northcentral Texas (1977) and Prikryl's Synthesis of the Prehistory of the m Fork of the Trinity River (1987) are the best examples of this level of research. However, no interregional Interpretations of North Texas have been produced since Krieger's Culture Complexes and ef in Northern Texas (1946). Therefore the taxonomic nomenclature and cultural historical sequences which have been developed mix several types of theoretical constructs. For the purposes of this overview, the term focus is employed as an heuristic device for describing cultural afffiliation or technological levels of adaptation. The terms phase and aspect are used to describe technological or stylistic manifestations of artifact assemblages which have specific geographic limits or boundaries. The terms focus or focii refer to more spatially and temporally limited defined assemblages of artifacts, A horizon is a set of technological or stylistic attributes which has broad geographic distributions. Ellis County is located geographically on the marginal area of three broad archaeological areas; Edwards Plateau/Central Texas, Trinity, and LaHarpe/Gibson/Fulton (Sorrow 1966:1). Sorrow (1966:1) states that the Edwards Plateau Aspect and the Central Texas Aspect, which form a continuu m the Archaic Period to the Late Ceramic Period, were located to the west. The Trinity Aspect of thé Middle\Archaic Period and (\ uv 3-1

(\ 7 foci from the Late Ceramic Period were to the north. The LaHarpe Aspect of the h e} Archaic Period and the Gibson and Fulton Aspects of the Late Ceramic Period are to the east (Sorrow 1966:1). This broadly dispersed, poorly defined cultural zonation is in great need of reevaluation (Story 1990:217). In addition, cultures undoubtedly ignored the artificial boundaries which have been established to date. Much of the —" archaeological knowledge of this region comes from work done in association with the building of reservoirs along the Trinity River and its adjacent drainages (McGregor and Bruseth 1987:13; Peter and McGregor 1988), but isprimarit} limited to those periods following the Late Archaic. The most lengthy and up-to-date chronological scheme (Figure 3-4) used here is that proposed by Prikryl (1987:104-132) in his study of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River, approximately 50 miles north of the SSC project area. This scheme is as follows: Cy ~~ Pafeo-Indian Period 10,000 - 6,000 B.C. = Barly Archaic Period —«6,000 - 4,000 B.C. Middle Archaic Period 4,000 - 2,000 B.C. 4 2 Late Archaic Period 2,000 - 200 B.C.

Each time period is subsequently broken down further to identify specific aspects, technologies (Figure 3-4) or events which are relevant to the identification of each grouping. For example, the Paleo-Indian Period is broken down to identify the Clovis, Folsom, and Plano Horizons. PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (ca. ? - 6,000 B.C.) : After nearly two decades of often vitriolic debate, it is now a certainty that human populations first entered the New World well before the end of the Wisconsin glacial stage, ca. 16,000 years ago. Data from Meadowcroft Rockshelter (Adovasio various; Carlisle and Adovasio, editors 1982) clearly indicates that Paleo-Indians had entered the Upper Ohio Valley on the frontiers of the northeastern United States by ca. 14000 B.C. Additionally, a corpus of accumulating data from South America, notably the excavations at Monte Verde in Chile (Dillehay 1989) suggests a comparable antiquity for human occupation in that part of the western hemisphere. These data appear to indicate that widely differing lithic technologies and presumably concomitantly dissimilar perishable assemblages and perhaps basic subsistence strategies may have characterized the earliest Paleo-Indian populations of the New World. 3-2 eS & |

i a. a Whatever the case, these very first Americans are not presently recognizable in the SSC project area, specifically. nor for that matter in this portion of Texas, generally (cf. Story 1990:176). During the Late Pleistocene and with the onset of the Holocene Epoch, the first human inhabitants are believed to have entered this region. These first inhabitants were the Paleo-Indians. This stage of human development is "most often characterized in terms of its manifestations on the Great Plains..." (Brown et al. 1987:5-4). The majority of the Paleo-Indian sites are found as surface exposures in mixed association with later occupations (Lynott 1981b:100). The Paleo-Indian Period is initially identified with a low population density which slowly increased through time. "Unfortunately, one of the most striking characteristics of the Paleo-Indian Stage in tne SSC project area) s the extreme rarity of sites exhibiting Paleo-Indian cultural materials" (Richner and Bagot 1978:51). "The single most distinctive trait of the Paleo-Indian Cultures is the crafting of stone projectile points which weré often exceptionally well made. Many of these points share common attributes which show some temporal and spatial variability and can be typed accordingly (Story 1990:177). These stone tool types associated with the Paleo-Indian sites are basally ground lanceolate points and were used either as projectiles or as knives. The lithic raw material used in tool manufacturing was of high quality and often was exotic (non-local) to this region. The Paleo-Indian Period can be divided into three horizons based mainly on the tool types that were used. These three horizons are the Clovis, Folsom, and the Plano. The Clovis, Folsom, and Plano horizons are considered to be techno-cultural horizons due to their wide geographic distribution of affiliated point types which are assumed to have been used over a relatively short period of time (Stanford 1983; Adovasio et al. 1983; Owen 1984). The geographic distributions of many of the Paleo-Indian point types span the North American continent and can be extended by basic technomorphological comparisons into South America (Brown et al. 1987:5-4). Clovis Horizon The Clovis Horizon consists mainly of lanceolate points with short basal flutes and prismatic blades, laurel-leaf shaped bifaces, end scrapers, and smooth bone or ivory cylindrical shafts (Lynott 1981b:101). Exotic lithic materials were utilized for the construction of points and scrapers as opposed to locally available quartzites and cherts. Clovis points (Figure 3-5) are rare but they are widely distributed and are in all areas of the Gulf Coastal Plain except in east-central Texas, which could represent gaps in the data rather than any real pattern in the Clovis settlement or economic system (Story 1990:178). Most of the Clovis sites are identified with a single point find and are located on upland, non-aggrading landforms, erosional cuts, or gravel quarries. It has been stated that the Clovis Horizon people were highly mobile and traveled considerable distances in small bands (Lynott 1981b:101). This implies that there was an overall low population density. However, with the lack of many good archacological sites, a series of unanswered questions still arise concerning more detailed aspects of the Clovis lifeways. For example, “What kinds of adaptive strategies 3-3

ee fz mimBeeaeaHe He HE i produce an archaeological record that comprises primarily largely scattered isolated points?, why no other tools?, and what implications does this have for Clovis subsistence strategies?" (Meltzer 1987:27-28). Unfortunately, the answers to these questions are based more on speculation than on substantive information, and there is an important scientific need to fill this gap. The truth is that the archaeological record of the Clovis Horizon, as with the rest of the Paleo-Indian Period, consists of mostly isolated fluted points rather than stratified or buried site contexts. However there are a few archaeological sites where Clovis points are found in contexts with mammoth kill and/or scavenged sites. Information on other aspects of the Clovis Horizon lifeways is very sketchy, and we get information based on hypotheses of archaeologists who feel for example that since the Clovis economy was "oriented toward the exploitation of large grazing animals like the mammoth, the more forested conditions in the eastern parts of northern Texas probably served to mit mammoth grazing and consequently human activity during this time period" (Lynott 1981b:101). . One of the few exceptions to the general lack of good Paleo-Indian sites is the recent discovery and excavation of a Clovis camp, bison kill site, and associated spring and pond by Reid Ferring of the University of North Texas. A report on this excavation, performed for the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers is in preparation. Briefly, Ferring (personal communication 1989) interprets this site as two brief encampments following a kill, with tool kit refurbishing, tool use, and tool discard activities present at the site. A Clovis Point, endscrapers, and heavily used blades were recovered the majority of which were made of Alibates chert from the Amarillo area and red quartzite from New Mexico. Over 10,000 artifacts were recovered. Since the site was deeply and rapidly buried, there is excellent preservation of cultural and paleoenvironmental information. Another find pertinent to the SSC project area is the discovery of a cache of Clovis blades in the Richland Creek Reservoir (Number 12 in Figure 3-6) by two avocational archaeologists Keven Davis (Waxahachie) and William Young (Corsicana). These blades have been donated to the State of Texas and are currently being analyzed by Bob Mallouf (State Archaeologist) and Mike Collins (TARL). Briefly, most of these blades were made from Edwards Plateau chert, and all had been heavily used and worn. Also, three blades made from materials of non-local origin were present. All of the blades were apparently used and then left in a cut-off channel of Chambers Creek and were less than 50 cm below the present ground surface (Keven Davis and William Young, personal communications 1989). The vegetation during the Clovis Horizon in this region was becoming more open due to decreased rainfall and warmer temperatures following the Pleistocene. There were forested conditions which probably persisted longer in the eastern areas, especially in the Blackland Prairie (Lynott 1981b:101). The distribution of the Clovis points suggests that all major environmental zones were exploited at one time or another (Story 1990:178). The sites that one could expect to find associated with the Clovis Horizon would most likely consist of an isolated fluted point. Such a site on the rarest occasion, could be associated with a mammoth or bison 3-4

nH HH HH EE i kill (or scavenged) site. Almost all of the Clovis points have been found in upland settings or along small tributary streams, probably because these are the areas where the sites are most likely to be preserved or discovered (Story 1990:182). "Finds in the main river valleys are less frequent probably because either the sites are deeply buried or they have been removed by erosion" (Story 1990:182). In the case of the Clovis cache find along Chambers Creek, this was an isolated activity area located in what was a landform with a low density of prehistoric site occurrences. To find sites (87% chance) of this size (ca. five meters in diameter with 2 artifacts/m2) it would be necessary to excavate 1 x 1 m shovel tests at 4.3 m intervals on an hexagonal grid over the entire landscape to be surveyed (Kintigh 1988:706). Such an intensive investment of labor is not feasible at the reconnaissance level, since costs would be exorbitant. According to a 1987 article by David J. Meltzer, a literature and questionnaire survey of members of the Texas Archaeological Society and others was done on the Clovis fluted points found in Texas. This survey, among other things, shows that there have been two Clovis points found in Ellis County (41EL5) and 12 Clovis points found in the North Central region of Texas (Meltzer 1987:32 and 42). The Ellis County points were found by C.K. Chandler of San Antonio, who has agreed to allow reanalysis of his entire collection from sites along Mustang and Waxahachie Creek in the vicinity of the East Campus. The two Clovis Point finds are located adjacent to the upland Uvalde gravel deposits fringing Lake Bardwell (Number 6 in Figure 3-6). However, the Paleo-Indians were not apparently using the Ogallala quartzites, since so few culturally diagnostic artifacts of this period have been found (C. K. Chandler, personal communication 1990). Thus, a major research objective for the SSC is why did Paleo-Indians leave broken points on sites adjacent to these veneer gravels? Did they make other types of tools there? There is a demonstrated presence of Paleo-Indians in the Superconducting Super Collider project area, and site discovery is a distinct possibility. Folsom Horizon Following Clovis is the Folsom Horizon. Folsom may have developed out of Clovis with possibly a gap of several hundred years (or several generations) and an apparent absence of an intermediary point style (Story 1990:189). There is a complete shift from the hunting of mammoths as the people from the Clovis Horizon did, to the hunting of bison (Bison antiquis and Bison bison). This shift in hunting preference began around 9200 B.C., which corresponds to a drying climate resulting in more open grassland environments namely short grass prairies. Short grass prairie ecosystems are believed to be preferred by the bison (Lynott 1981b:101). Folsom sites tend to be more restricted in distribution than Clovis sites (Story 1990:189). Overall the Folsom Horizon is believed to have lasted until 8,500 B.C. Thus far, there has been no evidence found to indicate that the social organization had changed significantly from the Clovis to the Folsom horizon. "Small bands of aggregated families with high degrees of mobility continued to move over vast areas, and population density in the region was still quite low" (Lynott 1981b:101). The level of use of the SSC project area and the Trinity River Valley by Folsom peoples seems to be very low. This is based on the relatively few artifacts found in the area which in part 3-5

could be due to a selection for environments with higher densities of large grazing animals which at that time may have been farther west (Lynott 1981b:101). Tool assemblages found at Folsom sites include the channel-fluted projectile points and nonfluted projectile points. The fluted Folsom points are very thin and have long distinctive flutes on both sides which extend from. the base to almost the tip of the point. There is also a distinctive nipple, which is sometime found located in the middle of the base. This nipple represents the platform for flute removal (Turner and Hester 1985:99), The raw material utilized for Folsom projectile points is characteristically of high quality. Other artifacts recovered at major sites include bifaces in various stages of reduction, scrapers, choppers, perforators, hammerstones, abraders, bone needles and possibly bone gaming pieces (Story 1990:189). The major Folsom sites are located in the Rocky Mountains and the western part of the Great Plains. In Texas, the Lubbock Lake site has yielded substantial evidence of Folsom occupation. Evidence of Folsom sites consist of snly points and some bifaces in the North Central Texas region. At present there are ten sites known to have produced Folsom points in this region, and of those ten sites, all but one are from surface or culturally mixed deposits (Story 1990:189). Plano Horizon The Plano Horizon is next in the cultural continuum and represents the period of time when Paleo- Indians were beginning to adapt to post-Pleistocene environmental and climatic conditions. Long, parallel flaked, nonfluted and sometimes stemmed lanceolate points, such as the Plainview, Eden, Meserve, Angostura, Scottsbluff, Dalton, and San Patrice types are characteristic of this horizon. Unlike the Clovis and Folsom Horizons, the Plano Horizon encompasses a more diverse set of cultural components, which are characterized by a proliferation of projectile point types. Dalton and San Patrice are included with the Paleo-Indian cultural groups because Dalton, San Patrice, and Plainview represent three different geographic areas but overlap temporally (Prikryl 1987:150), and are similar to other cultural groups classified along with the Plano Horizon. The Plano Horizon is believed to be the "final big game hunting occupation of the southern plains" (Lynott 1981b:101). The Plano Horizon existed from about 8,500 to 6,000 B.C. There is some controversy over the inclusion of the Plano Horizon with the Paleo-Indian Period or if it should be associated more with the Early Archaic Period (Suhm and Jelks 1962:213-214; Coe 1964:64-68; Gardner 1974:18; Perttula 1987:3-11; Prikryl 1987:145). This epistemological controversy is due primarily to the marked increase in population which is based partly on the greater number of projectile points found in relation to the previous Clovis and Folsom Horizons and partly on the increased expansion of post- . glacial grasslands. Also, it is difficult to arbitrarily define changes in what may have been a gradual techno cultural transition. There is speculation that a slight reduction in group mobility occurred in North Central Texas which is possibly due to an increase in population density along with a concomittant increase in the tall-grass prairie 3-6 =

Cc 7 m3 (Lynott 1981b:101). Lynott (1981b:101-103) also speculates that the family was still the basic economic unit and the largest social unit formed, but in northern Texas, most of the Plano Horizon sites occur in mixed contexts (non-aggrading soils) with later Archaic sites so it is very difficult to establish any population or social structure parameters. Scottsbluff Scottsbluff points are distinguished by their small shoulders, well defined stem that is “paralleled - sided to slightly expanded with square comers, and a generally straight base with more or less parallel - sided pressure flake scars that terminate smoothly at or near the midline of the points that are the result of a carefully staged sequence of production" (Story 1990:205). There is a difference, however, between the Scottsbluff points fo’ ad in Texas and the points found on the Plains. The Plains are where the Scottsbluff point was originally identified and defined. In Texas the points tend to be “wider, both blade and stem breath, than those on the Plains", the stem bases sometimes have a shallow V-shaped notch while those on the Plains do not or just rarely do, the reduction sequence appears not to have as many stages as those of the Plains, and the "points found on eastern sites are resharpened more often than the western ones, sometimes down to a mere nubbin" (Story 1990:209). Scottsbluff points of the woodland region tend to be constructed of non-local lithic materials, particularly central Texas cherts. It is believed that the people associated with Scottsbluff points preferred oak savannahs and forests over prairie country (Story 1990:209). This could explain why there have been few Scottsbluff points found in the project area with good context. A single apparent (though huge) Scottsbluff was collected by Charles Barton (Maypearl), five miles from the project area in a gravel/sand quarry of a Quatemary terrace in the Chambers Creek Valley (see Figure 2-1). This is an anomalous find, since it is whole and has no use or resharpening evidence, in a region where, as stated above, Scottsbluff points are usually at the end of their lifecyle or use trajectory. Scottsbluff points have also been found in the Sulphur River Drainage of northeastern Texas and the upper and middle reaches of the Trinity River (Story 1990:209). The transitional period between the Paleo-Indian Period and the Early Archaic Period technologies is represented by the Dalton and San Patrice point types. The Dalton and San Patrice point types are distinctive basally-ground lanceolate points which are usually side notched and often have characteristic tangs (Lynott 1981b:104; Prikryl 1987:157). There is some disagreement as to the classification of the Dalton and San Patrice points with either the Early Archaic Period or the Paleo-Indian Period. Story et al. (1990) and most others include Dalton and San Patrice with the Paleo-Indian Period, but these point types and associated lifeways appear to be closely related to the Early Archaic Period as well. Dalton The Dalton point is a sometimes fluted lanceolate style projectile point/knife, which probably developed out of an eastern form of Clovis (Story 1990:190). A distinct Dalton feature is beveling to 3-7

resharpen the lateral cutting edges of the point/knife blade (Story 1990:190). For example "in the core area the bevel is often serrated at least until the near final stages of use as a knife. After they were no longer serviceable as a cutting tool, or when broken, Dalton points sometimes were recycled into perforators, scrapers and burins” (Story 1990:190). Dalton tool kits contained "end and side scrapers, gravers on flakes, gravers on end scrapers, true blades, unifacial modifications to blades and blade like flakes, bipolar cores and wedges" (Story 1990:190). In addition to the point type, the Dalton people invented a bifacially chipped stone adze, possibly used in woodworking. Dalton points are fairly numerous in the SSC project area and surrounding counties of North Central Texas and have been found in Ellis County. The sheer number of points suggests that there was a more intensive use of the area than either Clovis or Folsom. During this time period, we notice hints of higher population densities, a reduction of mobility, and an emergence of territories (Story 1990:196). The greatest concentration of Dalton materials is in Northeast Texas and adjacent parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas. Although present in Ellis County, the project area is still a marginal zone for Dalton occupation. San Patrice The San Patrice, like the Dalton point, may have developed out of the Clovis or some other fluted complex (Story 1990:197). There are definite similarities between the San Patrice and the Dalton styles, nevertheless, the San Patrice points differ from the Dalton in several ways. First, San Patrice points are more often basally fluted with single and multiple flakes. Sometimes they are obliquely side notched, and are usually made of local raw materials, including petrified wood and small chert pebbles, San Patrice points are infrequently recycled into other tools. And lastly, the blade portions of the points are wide relative to their length and the edges are rarely saw-toothed or steeply beveled (Story 1990:202). In addition to the San Patrice points, other distinctive tools include the Albany scraper (possibly a knife) and a number of nondiagnostic unifacial tools, including side and end scrapers, retouched blades, burins, and gravers (Story 1990:202). There have been San Patrice point types found within Ellis County, as has been shown by our current examination of the collections of avocational archaeologists. The temporal placement of San Patrice is problematical because no San Patrice points have been found in tight stratigraphic context, and only one has been radiocarbon dated in North Central Texas (Story 1990:202). At that site, points similar to the San Patrice were found in strata “above Folsom and below a late style Dalton point, a Dalton adze and Plainview points" (Story 1990:202). The classic San Patrice points are found to the south of the Dalton points and mainly in the heavily wooded areas (Story 1990:202). This differs from the Dalton in that Dalton appears to have exploited a wider range of environments including the woodland edge. There is also a difference in raw material utilized for the construction’of Dalton and San Pairice points. 3-8

cP i eH la a El SUMMARY In general, all of the Paleo-Indian people apparently led highly mobile hunting and gathering lifeways. These earliest people exploited broad regions to gather plants and to hunt both migratory and resident animal populations. There are sites with evidence displaying that the early Paleo-Indians were big game hunters. Clovis sites for example have been found in association with mammoth kills, Folsom and Plano are associated with the hunting of bison (Bison antiquis). Recently, Clovis sites have also been associated with bison kills (Reid Ferring, personal communication 1989). Early reports concerning the Paleo-Indians stated that the subsistence was based heavily on big game hunting. In most areas of North America and specifically North Central Texas, this evidence is lacking, instead a generalized hunting and gathering lifeway is more likely. As mehtioned above, most of the knowledge of the Paleo-Indian culture is from surface finds, although professional excavations have occurred at some sites. Paleo-Indian Period sites are noted on both the main stream valleys and minor tributaries. Generally, these sites are exposed in the "second terrace deposits of the Trinity River and its major tributaries" (Skinner and Connors 1979:9). This evidence indicates a highly mobile existence with scattered campsites. The geographic diversity of point types and stone raw materials suggest unbounded territories. For example, the closest source for the Clovis cache in the lower Chambers Creek Valley is the Edwards Plateau near Georgetown, some 90 miles distant (Mike Collins, personal communication 1989). Paleo-Indian points have been recovered from Chambers Creek, Lake Bardwell, and Navarro Mills Reservoir (see Figure 3-6), as well as other areas within Ellis County, again indicating a Paleo-Indian presence in the Superconducting Super Collider project area. Caches of tools and raw materials such as the blades found by Keven Davis and William Young in Chambers Creek Reservoir are also known, Two areas of high potential for finding Paleo-Indian sites are in the area of the Supercollider's E7 and E8 penetration shafts. No survey work for the project has been done at E7 due to access being denied to the survey crew by the present owner of the land. Radiocarbon (humate) samples from the drill core at BE8a (see Appendix A) indicate that modern soils are buried 5 feet below the present ground surface. Paleo-Indian deposits could be much deeper. But again, Paleo-Indian material has been recovered in this area and sites have previously been identified and recorded, so further research should include geomorphological modeling and deep excavation with augers and machines. EARLY ARCHAIC PERIOD (6,000 - 4,000 B.C.) The Early Archaic Period marks the end to the Paleo-Indian Period when people began to adapt to a fully modern environment. There do appear to have been major climatic fluctuations in this period and a variety of projectile point types and artifact assemblages appear. There appears to have been a variety of 3-9

cultural responses to these new ecological systems. The term :"Archaic” has been used to designate cultural developmental sequences; a segment of a culture-historical sequences in a specific geographic area; and simply as a designation of a time period (Story 1990:211). Following Story et al. 1990, the term is used in this study to designate peoples who were hunters and gatherers or foragers beginning ca. 7000/6000 B.C. and possibly lasting among some peoples in North Central Texas until the Late Prehistoric Period. In North Central Texas, the Early Archaic Period is a very problematic time period due to the lack of well documented in situ sites. The best data for the region comes from Central and Southwest Texas. During the Early Archaic Period, there appears to be a lack of regionialization but there is a broad cultural pattern. Thus far there have been few sites located or investigated in North Central Texas which have discrete Early Archaic components, although Prikryl (1987:160) identified 57 diagnostics of this period from 22 sites in the upper Trinity River basin. The aggregation of Zarly Archaic Period peoples was confined to small groups of nomadic seasonal hunters, using geographical rounds which exploited both migratory and resident animals. Their hunting camp sites were briefly occupied. There is, however, a debate which remains unanswered, over whether the population size was increasing or decreasing during this time period. The small number of possible Early Archaic sites identified indicates that the population density was still low. "Maximum social groups were probably loosely structured bands that often changed size and composition, mostly in response to fluctuations in food resources" (Story 1981:144). Again this interpretation points to the strong influence of environment on human behavior. At this juncture, a discussion of anthropologically and archaeologically derived models of territorial ranges is merited. This character of cultural geography prompted the development of catchment analysis (Vita-Finzi and Higgs 1970) and the pattern of land use based on residential locations (Lee 1969) and is beneficial to the understanding of Archaic lifeways. Economic zonation and logistical radius models have been employed to define mobility patterning among hunting and gathering societies (Binford 1982:5-31). These models have been refined, employing ethnological studies of Australian individual and group territorial organization (Peterson and Long 1986) which indicates a complex organization beginning with the territory of an individual, encompassed by a broader annual range, encompassed by lifetime range of an individual. A band encompassed an aggregation of several annual and lifetime ranges of individuals, and together there is a group territory separated by "dead ground", from other bands but several bands may be encompassed by the individual group range. Beyond this range of the individual group, there is the binding force of reciprocity and gifts are exchanged beyond the band's annual range. The binding force for this zone of reciprocity is ultimately language, and the distribution of stylistic variables in material culture may reflect the actual language area (Sampson 1988:13-28). ; Early Archaic Period chipped stone tools tend to be less carefully fashioned and less often made of ‘exotic raw materials than during the Paleo-Indian period (Story 1990:213). The tool assemblages tend to be "more functionally varied but more cheaply produced, in terms of manufacture time and raw material 3-10 Say

eH i P= | ia) exploitation" (Story 1990:213). In general, concerning the Early Archaic Period{ “the evolutionary trend of projectile point manufacturing is in the direction of shorter, corner-notched }fiangular points of the Early Bruseth and Martin 19877 Story et al. 1990:216-219). Archaic Tradition and the San Patrice point type” Thus the material culture of this period suggests the development of mutually exclusive behaviors and <7 shared stylistic motifs or mental templates. The Early Archaic Period for Central Texas has been divided into four phases, the Circleville, San Geronimo, Jarrell and Oakalla (Prewitt 1981:73). The early part of this period, the Circleville Phase is characterized by low population density with a subsistence based on hunting and gathering. Gathering was apparently stressed over hunting and was preformed over large geographic areas in the range of the group. This trend continues through the San Geronimo and Jarrell Phases but during the Oakalla Phase this changes and we fin” the appearance of rock middens, less diversity in projectile point forms (Prewitt 198 1:73), and an apparent reduction in group range. Overall, there appears to be a cultural continuation from the Paleo-Indian Period to the Early Archaic Period which can be shown by the finely flaked lanceolate form and basal grinding present on many Early Archaic point types. Basal and lower edge grinding of Early Archaic points seem to have been a common trait in North America and North Central Texas (Suhm and Jelks 1962:213-214; Coe 1964:64-68; Gardner 1974:18; Adovasio et al. 1983; Lynott 1981b:104; Prikryl 1987:157). The Early Archaic Period has a "more diverse array of tools and are more varied from one locale to another" (Story 1981:143) as opposed to the Paleo-Indian Period. The projectile points are more often produced from local cherts and quartzites than in previous times. Ground stone items also appear at this time which suggests changes in processing of food resources or may suggest intensification of plant food collection (Brooks and Drass 1984). Additional evidence for the exploitation of a wide range of plant species and the increased utility of these plants can be associated with some of the new technologies developed by the Archaic people. These include the use of stone-lined hearths and baking pits and the use of milling implements. The subsistence of the Early Archaic Period is believed to be very similar to that of the Paleo-Indian Period with a few exceptions. As mentioned above, the Early Archaic Period people were nomadic seasonal hunters similar to the people of the Paleo-Indian Period except the geographic area covered in the annual range of a group or band was probably reduced. Emphasis was also placed on gathering rather than hunting (Brown et al. 1987:5-6), which may have further reduced the annual range of a group or band, and most likely there was a wide range of plant species which were probably exploited within this annual range (Story 1981:144). The environmental conditions of the previous Paleo-Indian Period consisted of a slow warming trend, but during the Early Archaic Period, there was a marked change. This climatic change was in the direction of a marked warmer and dryer period. This created new open prairie uplands and hardwood forests retreated to ‘floodplains, resulting in new adaptive requirements for the Early Archaic occupants (Lynott 1981b:103). It is not certain if "the occupants of northern Texas during the Plano Horizon adjusted their adaptive pattern or 3-11 ¢

left the region all together. At any rate, during the Early Archaic there is evidence of a less mobile hunting and gathering population in northern Texas" (Lynott 1981b:103). MIDDLE ARCHAIC PERIOD (4,000 - 2,000 B.C.) The Middle Archaic Period can be seen basically as a continuation of the Early Archaic Period, with a few exceptions listed below. The Middle Archaic Period is divided into several aspects. The LaHarpe Aspect extended in a wide band in the woodland/prairie interface region of northern Texas and portions of Oklahoma. The Trinity Aspect which contains the early Carrollton Focus (as)pne of the best (and earliest) defined Middle Archaic Period cultural assemblages (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954a, b; Crook 1952), and was centered along the Trinity River in North Central Texas. These apparent cultural traditions, along with the late Elam Focus (Crook and Harris 1952) are also centered in North Central Texas. These " :spects" and "foci" need reevaluation (Story 1990), but the original information still provides the best overall cultural- historical model for the Archaic in this region. The LaHarpe Aspect (Johnson 1962:268) particularly, spans both Middle and Late Archaic Periods, and needs completed reorganization through controlled archaeological investigations. The Carrollton Focus consist of only artifacts (Crook and Harris 1952:14) and the majority of the artifacts are projectile points. A few of these projectile points are composed of Plainview-like, nonfluted Folsom or early wel But the vast majority of the points are medium (35-50 mm) to small (under 35 mm) in size, some of which are stemmed with parallel sides and square bases, while others are shouldered and somewhat resemble the Gary contracting stem types of the Late Archaic\Period (Crook and Harris 1952:17). There were also 6thep points associated with this "focus" which include the Carrollton and Trinity dart points (McGregor 1988:31). In addition there are also spokeshaves, the Waco sinker, the chipped stone Carrollton axe, scrapers (specifically gouges), a few grinding stones, some ground stone items, drilling and boring tools made from broken projectile points, and two forms of knives (Crook and Harris 1952:14-18). Hammerstones and choppers are also fairly common at Carrollton Focus sites. The Elam Focus is a direct outgrowth of the Carrollton Focus (Crook and Harris 1952:23). The most common artifacts recovered from this focus are projectile points. These points are medium (35-50 mm) to small (under 35 mm) in size and relatively thick. Possibly the most common projectile point of this period is the Ellis dart point, followed by the Yarbrough and Elam (McGregor 1988:31). The technique used for the construction of these points are stemming and/or shouldering and barbing (Crook and Harris 1952:27). Drills were specifically made on a thick rough leaf-shaped knife, and scraping and cutting flakes were also present. Side scrapers, as in the Carrollton Focus, continue to be used; as do the quartzite hammerstones and choppers. We also find in comparison with the Carrollton Focus, the Elam Focus was characterized by a higher percentage of local quartzite in the lithic tools (McGregor 1988:31). use Creok ¢ Carns [452 cetation | | ae = & SS Ga) aes

L = Ge On the other hand, Prewitt (1981:73) divides the Middle Archaic Period for Central Texas into four phases. These are the Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, Round Rock, and the San Marcos. The Clear Fork Phase, as Prewitt (1981:73) describes it, is marked by an intensification of specialized food gathering. The population density continues to rise, based on the increase in site frequency. Population density continues to rise through the Marshall Ford Phase and peaks during the Round Rock Phase (Prewitt 1981:73). The San Marcos Phase is marked by a dependency toward a more generalized gathering subsistence and less dependency on hunting. Burned rock middens are common occurrences in Central Texas associated with the Clear Fork Phase, but there have been none found in North Central Texas. So common are these burned rock middens in Central Texas, that they have become essentially synonymous with the Central Texas Middle Archaic Period (Brown et al. 1987:5-7). From the Early Archaic to the Middle Archaic Period, the projectile point size also increased. Also during this time period, point types changed from comer-notched to side-notched forms. Point bases changed from expanding stem types to parallel stem types and finally to contracting stem forms of the Late Archaic Period. The raw materials commonly used for tools were the locally available lithic resources such as Additional point types dated securely to the Middle Archaic Period are the parallel and slightly contracting based points. Examples of these include: Pedernales, Bulverde, Travis, Nolan, Carrollton and Morrill points of Central and North Texas (Sorrow et al. 1967:142; Prewitt 1981:76; Prikryl 1987:162). Other characteristics of Middle Archaic Period lithic points include the basal notched group (e.g. Andice or Calf Creek Points). Several Andice Points have been identified in avocational collections from Ellis County, and a fragment of a possible Andice along with two Gary Points, was recovered from site 41EL119 within the East Campus by the present landowners. The period beginning at ca. 3,000 B.C. was marked by an increase in the effective moisture (i.e., that r et ere AGES which can be taken up by plants after evapotranspiration) and temperature. The cultural adaptations appear 7 ~ to have changed as well. At about 2,000 B.C., the climate began to approach present conditions. , ) The Middle Archaic Period marks the first time that there is documented evidence for the bottomland exploitation of a diverse complex of plant and animal resources (Lynott 1981b:104). It is believed that with this exploitation of the bottomlands, settlement patterns became aligned with the floodplain forests along most major drainages (Lynott 1981b:104). "During certain seasons, it was possible for large groups to congregate for short periods of time without exhausting local resources, but during lean times it was advantageous for the population to be dispersed" (Lynott 1981b:144). [Bais would correspond to the band annual range, outlined above. During the Middle Archaic Period there is evidence that the hunting of bison herds continued and this required large areas of land and a system of scouting to find herds. Also, a seasonal scheduling of activities was necessary to take advantage of migratory patterns, and cyclical abundance of herds.

At Richland/Chambers Reservoir, there is evidence showing major occupations representative of the Middle Archaic Period. With the end of the Middle Archaic Period there is evidence showing the first signs of regionialization, possibly indicating reciprocity within language groupings. This may have been brought about by an increase in population. Other Middle Archaic Period materials found in the region include dart points of the Carrollton, Elam, and Gary types (Shafer 1964:10). These have been found at sites directly in the Supercollider project area, particularly around Bardwell Lake. LATE ARCHAIC PERIOD (2,000 - 200 B.C.) ” There is more detailed information for prehistoric lifeways, environmental adaptations and demographic patterns for the Late Archaic Period. There is evidence that the territories of cultural groups during this time began to shrink, accompanied by increasing populations (Bruseth et al. 1987:237). There are significantly more sites related to tne Late Archaic Period than previous Periods, and these stratified and single component sites have received more detailed investigations (McGregor and Bruseth 1987; Prikryl 1987: 166; Peter and McGregor 1988). There is increased evidence for the reuse of camp sites and some indication that "populations began to congregate during the fall and winter when large quantities of food were locally available" (Lynott 1981b:105). This supports the theory that the population density continued to rise while the size of the hunting territory continued to shrink. As a result, he steady regionialization process from the Middle Archaic Period proceeded through the Late Archaic Period. It appears that the band level of society was slowly becoming more elaborated, possibly tribal, during this period. Also, during this period in North Central Texas, there was a shift in the raw materials used for tool construction, from non-local chert sources to local quartzite sources. This is noted by the steady increase in the use of Ogallala Quartzite which is found in the local Uvalde Gravels. This shift to local sources may have worked in conjunction with constraints on the size of territory exploited by a group, thereby (Geimonstratingja population increase (Prikryl 1987:170). Or this may be viewed as a result of maximization of the local environment and/or a decrease in the ability to exploit more distant resources due to a population increase (Prikry! 1987:170). In addition to the projectile points, there is evidence showing the use of pecking and polishing of stone to produce ornaments and implements such as spear-throwing weights and axeheads (Story 1990:213). In Central Texas, the burned rock middens found in the Middle Archaic Period cease in the Late Archaic Period in the eastern portion but continue in the west (Prewitt 1981:73). A portion of the Late Archaic Period is the continuation of the LaHarpe Aspect. The LaHarpe Aspect shows strong cultural ties with areas to the north and east (Prikryl 1987:166) and is associated with contracting based dart points, the most typical being the Gary point (Johnson 1962:268-280).

LS it 1 = \ J ‘| a) tote Archaic ( “? LaHarpe Aspect point types include Ellis, Edgewood, Elam, Godley, Dallas, and the slightly earlier Yarbrough and Trinity types (Prikryl 1987:166;). Prewitt (1981:73) views the Late Archaic Period in Central Texas as the Uvalde, Twin Sisters, and Driftwood Phases. With this Prewitt (1981:73-74) goes on to state that there was a slight decrease in the importance of hunting and a tendency toward a more generalized gathering subsistence base. This is continued through the Uvalde Phase, and during the Twin Sisters Phase, the subsistence base is heavily oriented toward gathering. Hunting importance is lowered. This is based on the low ratio of projectile points to other tools (Prewitt 1981:74). This pattern continued through the Driftwood Phase. Even though the importance of hunting is reduced, subsistence patterns for the Late Archaic Period in North Central Texas continued to be based on the hunting of bison and also antelope (Lynott 1981b; Prikry! 1987). This bsistence strategy also included the occasional exploitation of riverine faunal and floral resources. "Prairie and cross timbers subsistence was directed toward intensive exploitation of local bottomland resources" (Lynott 1981b:104). There is evidence elsewhere in North America for the development of horticulture during this period (Martin and Bruseth 1988:33) and the northern Texas region inhabitants may have received initial contact with the horticultural ideas, "but continued to pursue an essentially hunting and gathering lifestyle” (Lynott 1981b:105). The environment, as shown by evidence at archaeological sites, may have shifted slightly to wetter conditions during the Late Archaic Period. Human activities tend to bias palecenvironmental data due to differential selection of species and different processing techniques. This factor points out the need to collect paleoenvironmental information from non-site areas as well as culturally induced deposits. With wetter environmental conditions, the density of all vegetal resources would have increased, resulting in the expansion of the Eastern Cross Timbers woodlands, which would have resulted in an increase of the plants utilized for human consumption, as well as increased biomass for game animals (Prikryl 1987:170). There has been three and a half times more Late Archaic sites found than there has been Middle Archaic sites in the Upper Trinity (Prikryl 1987:166). Late Archaic Period sites are numerous and most sites have been found in floodplains, first order tributary streams, and along minor tributaries. The sites are larger or more frequently occupied, and are more widely distributed, however there is no evidence of sedentary villages. Camps and habitation areas were not occupied year-round, and movements remained in geographically circumscribed areas (Story 1981:146). Late Archaic Period sites have been recorded in North Central Texas and are relatively well represented within the project area. These sites contain the Yarbrough and Gary type points (Shafer 1964:10). Points of tne{Laiarpe Aspect have been found in Ellis county, pointing to a high probability of additional sites that may be present in the project area. The presently accepted end of the Late Archaic Period is with the apparent introduction of the bow and arrow and pottery (see below for pottery discussion). Inferentially, there was a complete shift from band level society to tribal society, with more rigid territoriality based on language limits. The expanding stem Scallorn arrow point type appeared around A.D. 700 (Story 1990:217). The bow and arrow introduction is 3-15 o-~)

implied at this time based on the appearance of small projectile points (Story 1990:213). With the bow and arrow, there probably is a drastic change in the hunting efficiency, marked with a higher abundance of food resources and a resulting increase in population. Also, the use of the arrow indicates individual hunting strategies (stalk) versus the dart where group (surround) strategies prevailed. However, there does appear to be a time transgressive shift in the replacement of the dart by the bow and arrow and the actual date may vary depending on geographic location and the nature of hunting strategies across Texas. Among the best evidence for late or transitional Archaic use and occupation of North Central Texas comes from the deepest layers of fill in large man-made depressions at the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch sites in Richland Creek (Story et al. 1990:228-229). These depressions, termed "Wylie Focus pits” are ‘problematical features which may indicate group aggregation and ceremonialism, including more elaborate burial practices, beginning ca. 200 B.C. and A.D. 1 (Bruseth et al. 1987; Story 1990:235). 4 we 2 - EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (200 B.C. - A.D. 800) It is generally accepted that the Archaic Period ends with the introduction of the bow and arrow and pottery. The date given for the first ceramics is estimated to be between A.D. 700 and 900 (Story 1990:217), although there is a possibility that early shell tempered sherds dating between A.D. 200-700 7 were present in the large pit featureg at Adams Ranch (Martin 1987:244) and Bird-Point Island (Bruseth Nor AT 4) er eol eo 1987:112-113; Bruseth and Martin 1987:164) in the Richland Creek Reservoir (Number 12 in Figure 3-6). There are a number of traits and inferred cultural behaviors which are shared with the peoples of the Late Archaic Period, but more importantly there are a number of cultural changes that do take place. These are the partial reliance on cultigens, the more prolonged stays at specific locations which represent sedentary settlements, the attention placed on social and ritual elaborations, technological innovations, and possibly (the most important) is the pottery making and the use of the bow and arrow (Story 1990:243); as well as the appearance of cemeteries (Prewitt 1981:74); although Late Archaic cemeteries are known elsewhere in Texas. Another important development in the post-Archaic is the cultural variety within the Early Ceramic Period. As with other transitional periods, the identification of specific cultural parameters indicating cultural change is difficult. The beginning of the Early Ceramic Period is identified with the initial presence of ceramics (pottery). The Early Ceramic Period corresponds to the broader Woodland Tradition of the Midwestern and Eastern United States (Story 1981:145-147). The Woodland Tradition sites are easily recognized by the thick, cordmarked vessels with conical bases (Story 1990:356). At this time there were also smoothed, flat-bottom vessels, Gary type dart points, some arrow points, especially the Scallorn type with its expanding stem dated ca. A.D. 700, cf. Story 1990:217), drills, scrapers, and grinding implements (Story 1990:356). The most common features of the Woodland Tradition are hearths and probable roasting ovens along with the less frequently occurring storage pits, burials, and possible structural remains (Story 1990:356). During the t ead cae )

Pr @ ™ oo Woodland Tradition, deer were consistently hunted, even more than bison. Apparently, major migratory patterns of bison had changed and bison were not common in this period (Dillehay 1974; Lynott 1979, 198la, 1981b). Rabbits and turtles were also hunted. Evidence at many sites suggests that the most common plant food source is the hickory nut (Martin 1987). In contrast to the results from the investigations at Richland Creek, 40 miles south of the SSC, the investigations at Joe Pool Lake 30 miles to the north of the SSC did not yield evidence of Early Ceramic cultures (Story 1990:248). This may be related to the relatively light overall settlement of the Joe Pool Lake area, which resembles that of the SSC project area itself. Limited evidence suggests that the Early Ceramic Period in North Central and East Texas evolved directly out of the earlier indigenous cultures of the Late Archaic Period. This is supported by evidence of the LaHarpe Aspect, which began in the Archaic period and continues into the Early Ceramic Period. The only difference between the earlier part of the LaHarpe Aspect and the later part of the LaHarpe Aspect is the presence of ceramics (Johnson 1962). The LaHarpe Aspect finally ends with the introduction of abundant variations of arrow points and decorated pottery which symbolizes a more sedentary mode of existence (Gohnson 1962:144). One portion of the later LaHarpe Aspect is the Fourche Maline Phase. This phase is represented primarily to the north, but some influences may have entered the SSC area. The artifacts associated with the Fourche Maline Phase include Williams Plain ceramics, stone gorgets, boat stones, double-bitted chipped stone axes, shell gorgets, bone atalat] hooks and corner-tanged knives (Johnson 1962:269). A noted by Story (1990:248), much remains to be unraveled of this period in North Central Texas. The ceramics of the Fourche Maline Phase culture are grog and bone tempered and are often left undecorated. These pots are flat based with flaring sides and are sometimes referred to as "flower-pots". Typologically this kind of pottery is called Williams Plain (Brown 1971:42-54). Williams Plain ceramics are almost always associated with Pre-Caddo occupations and normally date prior to A.D. 800. During the Early Ceramic Period there appears to be two distinct ceramic traditions. The grog and bone tempered paste tradition is associated with the Fourche Maline culture while the sandy paste tradition is associated with what has been recently called the Mossy Grove Tradition (Story 1990:256-259). This later tradition is located to the south of the SSC project area, along the Gulf Coast. While changes occurred in most aspects of the lifeways of Early Ceramic Period, subsistence patterns appear to have changed little. This is based on the lack of tropical cultigens, but squash (Curcurbita pepo) and sunflower seeds have been found in Early Ceramic Period sites (Story 1981:146). "Subsistence was probably based on an intensive foraging strategy and possibly included incipient cultivation of native food resources” (Story 1981:146). Ceramic vessels were an important innovation which possibly reflects alternative ways of food preparation that were not known in the earlier Archaic periods (Story 1981:146), and this could signify the beginning of intensified subsistence. The intensified subsistence base suggests a population increase and 3-17

population growth which restricted mobility (Bruseth and Martin 1987:284). The process from hunting and gathering to a fully sedentary lifestyle in North Central and East Texas was gradual, probably beginning sometime in the Late Archaic Period and not culminating until the beginning of the Caddoan era (Story 1981:146; Bruseth and Martin 1987:284). With sedentism, the need for cultural complexity increases. As the culture becomes more complex, one finds that ceremonialism becomes more evident in material culture remains. At this time period artificial earthen-mound construction began as did the practice of ceremonialism associated with the dead. Examples of this can be seen to the east of the project area but no evidence of this was discovered during survey work in this area. Interestingly, the 1901 map of Ellis County shows an Indian mound on South Prong Creek (within an unsurveyed portion of the West Campus), however, this is apparently an erosional remnant of the Austin Chalk, not a constructed mound. ®-Plains Woodland material (which is essentially a Great Plains culture with ties to the Hopewell trade- ceremonial networks) could also be in the SSC project area (Brooks and Drass 1984), However, no Plains Woodland manifestation has been found so far in or near the SSC project area. LATE CERAMIC PERIOD (A.D. 800 - 1600) 7 The Late Ceramic Period corresponds closely with the Late Prehistoric Period Given by others. The Late Ceramic Period is used here to incorporate a greater amount of prehistoric i from & same time. period. There is more information which pertains to this period than earlier periods. "Broad regional “Gifferences in patterns of adaptation continue to develop and become more strongly varied than previous periods" (Story 1981:144). The Late Ceramic Period is defined by the beginning of the southern Caddo manifestation of the Mississippian era (Story 1981:147-152). . The Late Ceramic Period incorporates all prehistoric Caddoan chronologies. This period is also represented by a proliferation of mound building associated with large cemeteries and nucleated villages. Social and/or economic differentiation along the intra-tribal level also became prevalent and was manifested by high status burials, corvee labor for civic-ceremonial mound construction, redistribution strategies and interregional trade (Story 1981; Thurmond 1985). In portions of East Texas, and along the Red River, burial mounds characterize this period. However, extensive surveys along the Trinity River and the Brazos River in this part of North Central Texas have failed to yield evidence of burial mounds, Caddoan "The most significant and complex cultural development to occur in the Late Ceramic Period west of the Mississippi River was the coalescence of Caddo and Caddoan-related speakers of the Trans-Mississippi South" (Schambach 1970, 1982). The Caddo manifestation traditionally has been divided into five groups, Caddo I - V. Story (1990:334) now suggests a new system containing the following: 3-18 Lr ea —S i ol C

The Fulton Aspect and the Late Ceramic Period as defined here, both end at A.D. 1600. As for the settlement patterns of the Caddoan people, we find “habitation loci, special purpose camps and other areas whure more ephemeral activities are carried out, burial grounds, and community (or ceremonial) centers" (Story 1990:334). Northeast Texas was “occupied by sedentary villagers who depended upon cultivated crops for a significant portion of their diet" (Story 1981:147). The habitation localities are identified as having refuse consisting of sheet trash and concentrated midden deposits as well as other cultural features (Story 1990:334). The artifacts associated with these habitation sites include broken or depleted lithic tools such as arrow points, drills, utilized flakes, celt fragments, chipping debris, potsherds, pipe fragments, and possibly floral and faunal remains (Story 1990:334). Story (1990:334) list other cultural features which also may occur and includes large and small pits, hearths, occasional concentrations of bummed rocks and a small number of structures. There are even possible bell shaped storage pits at some sites and a few burials. Most of the Caddoan habitation locations appear to be those of farmsteads or hamlets. Village sites are uncommon until the Fulton Aspect of the Late Caddoan Period (Anderson 1972:122). There is quite a lot of information known about the burial locations of the Caddoan people. The Caddoan burials are frequently accompanied by grave offerings and this has promoted vandalism and looting of Caddoan sites in East Texas. Differing sizes of burials and burial goods may represent differences in the sizes and numbers of communities contributing to the burials and the distinction of social class, both ascribed and achieved (Story 1990:338). The most common grave encountered, probably of low status individuals, is a single grave usually less than a meter deep. These burials are usually in or near the habitation site, often in areas with other burials or in formally defined cemeteries (Story 1990:339). The offerings to the dead consist of mostly pottery but often contain omaments like shell beads, personal items like weapons and tool kits, as well as lithics and ceramics (Story 1990:339). The differences in burials such as the grave goods is inferred as evidence for the existence of a complex social (and religious/political) system (Story 1990:339). "The most lavish and expensive (as measured in terms of exotic offerings and labor expended) interments were the shaft burials associated with earth mounds” and are presumably “reserved for only the highest ranking individual(s) in the society” (Story 1990:339). This suggests that there is strong evidence of a hierarchical structure based on the burial goods and the burial types or mounds. 3-19

At the close of the Gibson ‘Aspect and the beginning of the Fulton Aspect there is a shift in settlement pattern. The population moves into small villages and with that comes the loss of impressive mounds and status burials of the earlier Gibson Aspect (Anderson 1972:122). During the Late Ceramic Period a number of new traits appeared, including highly decorated ceramic vessels, the acquisition and circulation of marine shell (most notably conch), flat-topped mounds, standardization of ceremonial activities associated with the dead (commonly referred to as the Southern Cult), and villages with central plazas. These sites are found principally in southwest Arkansas, the extreme northeast corner of Texas, and in northeast Oklahoma. It has been suggested, using dental morphological data from a number of sites, that areas in Arkansas and Oklahoma, while distinctively Caddoan, display considerable physiological differences which may indicate ethnic or tribal differences (Rose et al. 1985; Roge and Hoffman 1986; Schambach 1990:67-68). Furthermore, there is another Caddo manifestation in eastern Texas south of the Red River which may be a third distinct ethnic or tribal group, however no dental studies have been done on these people at this time (Burnett 1990:385-418). There is evidence which suggests that some exchange of cultural traits did exist between the Caddoan people and Lower Mississippi River Valley Mississippian Tradition people. The extent of this interaction is not known but the Caddo shared most material culture traits amongst themselves rather than with adjacent groups. The Caddo have very distinctive traits in ceramic styles and motifs. These consist of formal and decorative features. Distinctive Caddoan vessel forms include carinated bowls, bowls with rim peaks, and long-necked bottles (Kreiger 1947:233; Webb 1961:19; Davis 1970:40; Hoffman 1969:160; Wyckoff 1974:65). Techniques used for decoration include engraving, excising, zoned punctation and polishing. These techniques are common in the creation of the characteristic Caddoan curvilinear designs such as interlocking scrolls, swills and concentric circles. Other vessels may display a combination of the curvilinear designs with the addition of a series of vertical, horizontal and/or diagonal lines. Pinched ridges, brushed-incised designs and applique fillets are also common Caddoan decorative techniques. The Caddo also used a red slip to cover the entire surface of a vessel. Engraved designs filled with a dry pigment, such as red ocher or white pigment, are also very characteristic Caddo decorative motifs. ~ The Caddo ceramic vessels found in Texas have some presence of fired clay fragments or crushed sherds as temper in their pastes. Most of the Caddo ceramics here are composed of grit-grog paste which contain a varying degree of bone, shell, sand, organic debris and limestone (Bell and Baerries 1951). The bone used as a temper is a crushed bone and this is associated with the early Caddo, principally the Gibson Aspect. The shell temper is also crushed and it appears to be associated with the later Caddoan ceramics of the Fulton Aspect. The shell tempering is not an indigenous Caddoan trait, and it may have been adopted from adjacent Plains Village populations (Orr 1952; Skinner et al. 1969:64; Story 1981:151), or the Lower Mississippi Valley. 3-20 aos oe me : Lo) sil

‘a a J e \ om (as) =) Several of the Fulton Aspect ceramic trends include an increase in brushed utility ware, coarse engraved patterns, an increase in wide mouthed vessels with out-flaring rims, and quadrated interlocking and spurred line scroll patterns (Wyckoff 1974:65). In addition to the ceramic types listed above are other traits of the Caddoan speaking people which include sedentary villages, reliance (ranging from light to strong) on maize agriculture , ranked societies and complex exchange networks (Story 1981:139). "Circular houses with interior support posts, certain clay pipe forms, and shaftlike burial pits with elaborate offerings" (Story 1978:57) are other archaeological traits which have been recognized as characteristically Caddoan. Some additional features for the Late Ceramic Period include rock-lined hearths and fire cracked rock and daub concentrations, The most noticeable change in the lithic tool assemblage is in the arrow point types. The bow and arrow hunting method produces changes in hunting techniques and probably improved hunting efficiency” (Story 1981:147). The lithic tool types of North Central Texas during the Late Ceramic Period are’ characterized by(an influx of Southern Plains}consisting of Washita, Harrell, and Fresno arrow points, snub- nosed scrapers, edge-beveled knives and flake drills (Prikryl 1987:178). The evidence for subsistence practices of the Caddo and other associated Native American groups is obtained from the analysis of fauna, floral and human skeletal remains and from ethnographic research done by the French and Spanish in the years from 1687-1772 (Anderson 1972:133). Subsistence appears to be from a mix of wild resources, plants and animals, fish, and cultivated crops such as corn and beans (Story 1990:343). Corn was the main domesticated staple with beans the second (Anderson 1972:133). White- tailed deer was the most often hunted animal but squirrel and rabbit, bird, and fish were also utilized as supplements to the diet (Story 1990:343). Over-all, by the Middle to Late Caddoan period, “the adaptive efficiency (as measured by nutritional status, incidence of infectious disease, and mean age of death) of both the subadults and adults was comparatively good, only to decline in the Late Caddoan period" (Story 1990:343). There have been a number of hypotheses suggested to explain the decline of the Caddoan groups for this period. The first of two suggested by Woodall (1972; Dillehay 1974; Lynott 1979) is the re-entry of the bison into the southern Plains after A.D. 1200, which may suggest a drier climate. Bison are thought to prefer the short grass prairie biome in which they develop larger herds. The second hypothesis is a gradual dispersal of population from the early ceremonial centers to hinterland communities. This dispersal could be due to the diminished return necessary to maintain social complexity. As simple societies expand and invest in more elaborate political expansion, there is an insufficient return to the local level, which engenders disaffection and re-segmentation (Sahlins 1963, 1968; Leach 1954; Tainter 1988:205). As for material found in the Superconducting Super Collider project area, there is strong evidence to suggest a shift back to bison hunting and a bison-oriented economy. This period in North Central Texas is characterized by an influx of southern Plains type tool assemblages consisting of Washita, Harrell, and Fresno arrow points, snub-nosed scrapers, edge-beveled knives and flake drills (@rikryl 1987:178).

have been at least two archaeological sites found in Dallas County which lends support to the bison- — oriented economy (Story 1990:359). One is a site containing two bison scapula hoes and a tibia digging stick. Another site consisted of eight bison scapula hoes associated with a human burial in Denton County 2 (Story 1990:359). Directly in the project area, arrow points of the Perdiz and{Scallorn|types (often found in t association with bison remains) have been found (Shafer 1964:10). s Most of the Late Ceramic Period sites in North Central Texas are concentrated at the eastern edge of the Eastern Cross Timbers. There arefhofLate Ceramic Period sites reported or identified in the Blackland Prairie _ areas themselves but there have beenfwarég found which do appear on the west side of the Blackland Prairies — along the Brazos and Little Rivers in Central Texas (S. Alan Skinner, personal communication 1989) and in Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988:367). Over 80% of all sites known to aaf to this period are found at the prairie/forest boundary, more than any other period (Prikryl 1987:179). This concentration of settlement is hypothesized to indicate local responses to the stresses induced by a drier climate, also forcing bison into the region from the High Plains. PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1536 - 1820) Some of the earliest Protohistoric Period people in North Central Texas were those of the Washita River Phase in Oklahoma. It has been stated that "sometime around A.D. 1450-1500, many of the Washita River Phase sites appear to have been abandoned, possibly as a result of population pressure from nomadic groups such as the Apache or Kiowa who were apparently moving into the Southem Plains” (Wedel 1961:131-148; Bell 1973:185; Schroeder 1962; Brooks and Drass 1984:33). This may have been caused by climatic stress and/or environmental changes or by political and economic factors introduced by Europeans. By A.D. 1550, these groups appear to have coalesced into fewer and larger villages, and some sites begin to yield occasional European trade goods. These villages were located on river terraces (Skinner and Gallagher 1974:8), mainly along the Red River. - Other native groups utilizing this area during the Protohistoric Period included the Wichita, the Tonkawa, the Waco, the Caddo (Bidai, Anadarko) and in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries a variety of groups which immigrated from the eastern United States including Cherokee, Chickasaw, Delaware, Kickapoo, Choctaw, Koasati, Alabama, as well as others (Skinner et al. 1978:28). These groups from the eastern United States were forced to immigrate to this region by pressure from the expanding Anglo-American frontier (Drinnon 1980; Henri 1986). By the time North Central Texas was being frequented by Europeans, the dominating groups were tribes of various Wichita speaking peoples. These included the Taovayas, Wichita proper, Yscanis, and the Tawakonis (Story 1990:363). In addition, this region was also occupied by the Kitsais, the Osages, the Apaches, the Comanche, and the Tonkawas and the later by Chickasaw and Choctaw (Story 1990:363). 3-22 . C i) ee

co J = — =) % = 3 9 om) One of these groups was a branch of the Wichita which was the Waco. The Wichita proper and the Waco groups survived as relatively coherent cultural entities until well into the nineteenth century in North Central Texas but other groups may have disappeared completely (Anthony and Brown 1990:9). Some of the first people in contact with the “outside” world in Texas may have been those contacted by the expedition sent out by the then-governor of Jamaica, Francisco Garay, who explored the mouth of the Rio Grande between 1519 and 1523. Another expedition was Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca and the survivors of the Narvaez expedition to the Texas coast in 1528 (Anthony and Brown 1990:9). In North Central Texas, most likely the first contact was with remnants of the De Soto Expedition in the fall of 1542 (Anderson 1972:133). In any case this early contact would not have had a great impact for several centuries, except possibly for the spread of contagious diseases. It is even possible that trade goods from the French reached this area even earlier. The Native Americans which De Soto met in Texas in 1542 were the Hasinai Confederacy which consisted of 9 or 11 Caddo-speaking tribes. This Confederacy may have been a result of the low population densities caused by diseases and warfare. French and Spanish observers recorded the customs of the Hasinai during the years of 1687-1772 (Anderson 1972:133). This period is marked by massive changes which in part may be the result of the introduction of the horse by the Spanish in 1675 (Anderson 1972:133). With the use of the horse, the Late Caddoan residence pattern changed from the sedentary forest hamlets to seasonal scheduling of nomadic hunting forays onto the Plains. However, this also brought about warfare with the Osage and Comanche who claimed the Plains hunting grounds. The subsistence pattern information gathered between 1687 and 1772 demonstrates how the men would hunt deer, ducks, geese and prairie chicken in winter time. Buffalo (Bison bison) hunting was done year- round with major hunts occurring in the winter time, since buffalo hunting required far distant travel to get to the region with the buffalo. Males would also clear and break the soil for planting. The women would do all of the planting, harvesting, cleaning and storage of crops and gathering of the wild plants. During the period 1772-1781, there was a severe drought (Stahle and Cleaveland 1988:59-74) which may have promoted the abandonment of agriculture which may have encouraged a shift to bison hunting as a major subsistence strategy. In the late 1830's Texas military leaders decided to remove all of the Native Americans from the state. In 1838, General Rusk's volunteers burned a Caddo village which was located near present-day Arlington (Skinner et al. 1978:29). The surviving Caddo left the area. In 1839, a group of Cherokee and Delaware re- established a large village (ca 1,000 persons) at approximately the same location, which was totally destroyed by General Tarrant in 1841 (Skinner et al. 1978:29). After these incidents, the population of the Native Americans in North Central Texas continued to decline until 1854 when all Indians were removed to a reservation on the Brazos River (Skinner et al. 1978:29). However, archival and in some cases biophysical and archaeological evidence is mounting to indicate that a significant number of Native Americans merged into Anglo-American society in North Central Texas. 3-23

An example of a Wichita Phase site would most likely consist of an agricultural village. This site could be quite large supporting 100 to 600 people (Richner and Bagot 1978:68). The village site consisted of large circular houses made of upright poles with grass thatching (Richner and Bagot 1978:68). There is a possibility of some type of fortification. The Wichita subsistence was based on a nomadic, equestrian plains bison hunting life style (Richner and Bagot 1978:68) and there may be evidence relating to this cultural group in the project area. Artifactual material recovered may also include European trade goods. The presence of trade goods would of course be the key for the identification of any of the Protohistoric Period sites. However, sites of immigrant Native Americans, particularly the Koasati and Cherokee, have been shown to contain material possessions and resemble those of Anglo-American Frontiersmen. PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES The results of specific studies that directly relate to the project area such as Bardwell Reservoir, Richland Creek, and Joe Pool Lake are discussed in this section (sec Figure 3-6). The earliest archaeological work in Ellis County was performed by citizens who were interested in their past. Judge O. E. Dunlap was interested in evidence of Pleistocene animals, and recovered a mastodon tooth during the excavation of bridge pilings along Waxahachie Creek in the 1910s (Green 1970). Other work included the systematic and well documented surface collections of a series of sites along lower Waxahachie and Chambers Creeks by Mr. C. K. Chandler and his family (then of Ennis, now residing in San Antonio). Mr. Chandler has provided collections for intensive analysis (see Appendix D, in preparation). Mr. Chandler also provided access to his information to Harry J. Shafer in his Bardwell Reservoir Survey (Shafer 1964) and a substantial collection from Pecan Springs (41EL11) was donated to TARL for the intensive work at the site (Sorrow 1966). In all, 43 archaeological sites (Table 3-1) have been recorded in the immediate vicinity of the SSC project area. The survey for Bardwell Reservoir (Shafer 1964) produced a total of 15 sites, 9 of which were undifferentiated prehistoric (41EL2, 41EL4, 41EL5, 41EL8, 41EL9, 41EL10, 41EL13, 41EL14, 41EL16) sites with light scatters of lithic debris. Six sites (41EL3, 41EL6, 41EL7, 41EL11, 41EL12, and 41EL15) had tools and point fragments and could contain Archaic components. Three sites also had Neo American (ceramic bearing) components (41EL6, 41EL7, 41EL11). Based on recent analysis of avocational collections, Paleo-Indian, and Early Archaic components are also present at 41EL5 and 41EL11. Only one site, 41EL11, was recommended for intensive investigations at Bardwell Reservoir (Number 6 in Figure 3-6). The excavations consisted of contiguous blocks and backhoe trenches. The soil was a Houston Black Clay over yellow clay, with most cultural remains being located in the black clay with features and some debris extending into a transitional zone. No cultural materials were recovered from the . yellow clay (Sorrow 1966:4). Two cultural stages, Archaic (Central Texas Archaic and East Texas La Harpe 3-24 Ss

artifacts) and Neo American (Austin and Toyah Foci and Gibson and Fulton Aspect) were identified with only slight stratification (Sorrow 1966:61-63). Other archaeological work in Ellis County has been limited to small areas such as Soil Conservation Service (SCS) dams and flood retarding structures, or utility (gas and water pipelines and powerlines) projects which are often narrow linear transects. The SCS did survey along two miles of upper Big Onion Creek, without recording a single site. The 23.4 mile water pipeline from Richland/Chambers Reservoir to Ennis was surveyed, with eleven localities (four prehistoric and seven historic) in Ellis County, none of which merited further work (Archaeology Research Program 1982). The prehistoric sites were all located on exposed Uvalde gravels, and contained tested cobbles, debitage, and tool fragments, none of which were temporally diagnostic. A linear transect for a powerline was surveyed from Waxahachie to Ennis (approximately 15 miles) by Espey Huston and Associates, but only two historic sites were recorded at TARL. The proposed lucation (ca. 200 acres) of the Waxahachie - Midlothian Airport yielded only two historic sites (Westbury 1986), one of which received National Register test evaluations (Westbury 1989). Finally, a 12 mile transect for the Rockett Water Supply Corporation was surveyed between Midlothian and Sterrett, and yielded four historic sites. The portion between Sterrett and the Rockett terminus, as well as all corporate lines was surveyed by Ferring (1983), and yielded no prehistoric or historic sites. As these surveys indicate, nearly all recorded prehistoric sites are located in the eastern project area where there are extensive Uvalde gravel veneers. These veneers also extend along Red Oak and Chambers Creeks, where sites are also known. In addition, there is a tendency for intensively occupied sites (41EL11) to be located near intermittent or permanent springs. In terms of major, comprehensive projects, only the Richland Chambers Reservoir (Number 12 in Figure 3-6) in Freestone and Navarro Counties, and Joe Pool Lake (Number 1 in Figure 3-6) in Dallas, Tarrant, and a small portion of Ellis County, are near the SSC project. These and other reservoir projects provide a broad regional network of study areas (Figure 3-5), mainly restricted to floodplain, and forests, in marked contract to the SSC, which is primarily uplands and prairies. In all, 15 prehistoric sites received extensive data recovery at Richland/Chambers Reservoir. At Joe Pool Lake, five prehistoric sites received ‘ extensive data recovery. Briefly, the results of the investigations at Richland/Chambers Reservoir indicate prehistoric occupation fromy€a. 3000 B.C.)to A.D. 1650, with the most occurring during the Richland Creek Phase (A.D. 700-900) and the Round Prairie Phase (A.D. 900-1300). During this time the climate was slowly drying while group mobility decreased. Subsistence strategies appeared not to change and was based on the collection of and storage of native foods (Bruseth et al. 1987:240-241). 3-25 \ S Le 6 [ & ee

Anthony and Brown 1990 At Joe Pool Lake, the overall site density and associated intensity and duration of occupation were much lower than at Richland/Chambers Reservoir. Evidence from the five prehistoric sites that received intensive excavations also revealed that the principal occupations were during the Late Prehistoric Period (A.D. 700-1200). Horticultural activities (Peter and McGregor 1988:131-198) combined with the iro exploitation of bison were indicated at Baggett Brancly(A.D. 7001000))and more intensive horticultural activities with maize were indicated at the Cobb-Pool site (A.D. 1000-1300). The SSC project area, as noted above, is located in upland environmental zones which do not normally receive broad archaeolugical investigations. Combined with the information from reservoir projects, the SSC project has the potential to shed some light on the settlement pattem of people living in or using the uplands versus those living in or using the floodplains. In all, 33 sites with prehistoric components were known prior to the initial SSC survey, and 15 of these were from Bardwell Reservoir. Currently, (October 11, 1990) the number of prehistoric sites has been increased by 30% and more prehistoric sites may be discovered when the remaining project area is surveyed. At the present time it is hypothesized that the SSC project area was not intensively occupied by prehistoric people, and was only lightly used for subsistence. River courses, springs, and the upland veneer gravels appeared to have the greatest attraction to prehistoric people. The most important research question is how do the recorded upland sites vary from the lowland sites which have been investigated in surrounding regions. 3-27 i. 9 = Le Co C

meee HISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND 4 by David H. Jurney This chapter presents the analysis of recorded information, informant reports, and landowner interviews that relate to the specific historic archaeological properties and communities within and around the project area, This historical overview is related to the known historical properties and the research questions appropriate to their archaeological context. The written record provides the specific dates of events, people, and their actions. Although as early as 1532 there is documentary evidence of Spanish and French activity in East Texas, no settlement is known for the upper Trinity, however some explorers may have passed near the SSC project area. It is possible that Luis de Moscoso led the survivors of Hernando de Soto's expedition through North Central Texas en route from the Mississippi River back to Mexico (Reese et al. 1986:154). In the eighteenth century, other expeditions, such as that by Athanase DeMezieres (Castaneda 1945:2-3) passed through East Texas, south of the project area. CULTURE HISTORY Initial Settlement In 1756, the presidio San Augustin de Ahumada and the mission of Nuestra Senora de la Luz were established on the banks of the lower Trinity River (Bolton 1914, Foscue 1960). Also, by the mid- eighteenth century both Spanish and French traders had developed exchange networks with Native Americans who resided in Texas. However, these networks did not match the extensive slave and deer hide trading system established by the Spanish, French, and English in the southeastern United States and Canada (Henri 1986). The social, economic, and political changes wrought on native societies there in the late eighteenth century led to increased emigration and long term use of Texas and regions west of the Mississippi for hunting forays by southeastern Native American groups such as the Choctaw as early as 1766 (Kinnaird and Kinnaird 1980:349-370) and the Cherokee (Clarke 1971:13-15), and Alabama-Koasati in the early 1800s (Flores 1985; Holley 1965:44 and 100). As a result of these early incursions in the Trans- Mississippi South there were conflicts between native (Tehuacana, Tonkawa, Waco, Wichita) and other immigrant Indians. During the late eighteenth century and the first three decades of the nineteenth century, these Native Americans formed a buffer between the cores of European and American settlement; primarily the Red River Valley, southeast Texas, and the Gulf Coast (principally Austin Colony) and Mexican 4-1

settlement through San Antonio; and the predatory Plains groups (at that time equipped with the horse) such as the Osage, Apache, and Comanche. Any settlements in the SSC project area dating to this period are hypothesized to be light, short term encampments with very little cultural debris remaining. Mexican Colonial The Spanish system of land grants was designed to provide land only to Spanish citizens. Some Americans began to take advantage of this by immigrating into Spanish territory. For instance Moses Austin immigrated into Spanish Louisiana in 1797 (what is today Missouri), renounced his American citizenship, and developed a strong relationship with Spanish officials (Haley 1985:9). After the Louisiana Purchase he began to plan trade missions to Spanish Texas and in 1819, following a financial panic, he followed Spanish requests to immigrate into Texas to secure an Anglo-American Colony, with himself as Empresario, This land allocation system allowed the empresario to charge fees from settlers and still obtain land in compensation for encouraging their settlement. Following the Mexican Revolution in 1821, Moses and Stephen Austin gained the opportunity to persuade the new government to allow the planned settlement which was approved with a new colonialization law in 1823, with each settler receiving a maximum of a league (4,428 acres) for ranching, and a labor (177 acres) for cultivation (Haley 1985:17). The Public Domain in the SSC project area within today's Ellis County was first distributed in the Mexican Colonial Period. This includes the eight leagues (35,424 acres) awarded to Thomas Jefferson Chambers in 1834. Chambers is typical of many American entrepreneurs (such as Moses and Stephen Austin) who were attempting to take advantage of the liberal Mexican land policies. Also, these entrepreneurs were in competition with Native Americans and Immigrant Indians in Texas. In 1826, Thomas J. Chambers a 24-year-old immigrant from Virginia went to Mexico to study its language and laws following the entrepreneurial spirit of Moses and Stephen Austin. By 1828 he had been appointed Surveyor General of the state of Coahuila and Texas, and was promoted to State Attorney in 1834. For his services, he received 35 leagues (over 150,000 acres), including the eight leagues in Navarro County (Glaspy 1981; Jurney and Glaspy 1987:40). This land acquisition along the upper Trinity River was in a consortium with Rafael de la Pena (actually his attorney, Nathaniel Townsend), Jose Manuel Bangs, Ira Lewis, and Isaac Dunahoe, all residing in Leona Vicario, of the State of Coahuila and Texas. Rafael de la Pena transferred his 11 leagues of land to Nathaniel Townsend on July 13, 1830; this was witnessed by T. J. Chambers, and the tract was surveyed by J. G. W. Pearson on October 23, 1834 (Texas General Land Office, Spanish Collections 130:17). Although there was land speculation during the Mexican Colonial Period involving lands within the SSC project area, no known settlements were produced. The only potential sites could be the temporary camps of the land surveyors, and the actual land tract corner posts or witness trees that they observed, During this same time, Immigrant Indians and Native Texas, Indians were skillfully denied land rights in the same region, primarily through diplomatic maneuvers such as those of Joel R. Poinsett, American 3

Ambassador to Mexico, when he prevented Richard Fields (Principal White Chief of the Cherokee) and John Dunn Hunter from securing the Cherokee Land Grant in East Texas (Drinnon 1972:xvi). Thus, Immigrant Indians and Native Texan Indians were seen as unwelcome competitors for Mexican lands which the Anglos wanted and conversely, any land surveyors or speculators were seen as direct threats to Native American lifeways and homes. Republic of Texas In 1836, Texas gained its independence through armed revolution from Mexico, and for a decade was an independent nation. In order to fill the coffers of the Treasury, Texas sold the only commodity it had, land. From 1836 to 1838, Texas organized a system of land allocation which was based on a network of land districts (Figure 4-1). This system allowed veterans of the war to be paid for their services through land grants. Recent immigrants could also receive land for minimal cost. Also, another empresario system was established to encourage further settlement. During the spring of 1838, a group of surveyors from Franklin, the seat of the Robertson Land District, began to survey large blocks of grants in the area later to become Ellis, Navarro, and Freestone Counties. B.J. Chambers, the son of T.J. Chambers, surveyed several tracts in the SSC project area for the Robertson Land District at this same time. Two parties, totalling 23 surveyors, had a rendezvous on upper Richland Creek, approximately 25 miles south of the SSC. They were ambushed in October 1838 bya large party of Kickapoo Indians on a bison hunt, and only one man, William Henderson, survived the battle (Samuels and Knox 1980; Jumey and Glaspy 1987:40). The presence of Kickapoo Indians in what is today Navarro County, approximately 30 miles south of the SSC project area indicates that they and other Immigrant Indians may have passed through the project area. Even though some land was granted within the SSC project area and was surveyed from 1834-1838, there was not any significant settlement, primarily due to these Native and Immigrant Indians, who retaliated against Anglo encroachment. It was not until the Cherokee, chief negiotiators for all Immigrant Indian groups, were forcefully removed (despite intercessions by Sam Houston) in 1839 that extensive settlement was possible in the project area. The young Texas Republic was without any financial structure and Public Domain was the only readily accessible commodity. The first land grant system in the Republic, as discussed above, still paralleled that of the Mexican Colonial Period (metes and bounds), and allowed individual selection of tracts as well as the empresario contract system which promoted wholesale grants to citizens (Shine 1969). The first grants were given along the Gulf coast, and available land rapidly became depleted, particularly the most desirable tracts. Also the size of grants was such that not all of the acreage could be located where the people first given grants lived or had first settled. Many of the 1838-1850 surveys in the SSC area (Figure 4-2) were surveyed to make up for unfiled grants from other Land Districts (see Appendix B), or were the balance remaining from the original grant. 4-3

Ney t (aaa) Ga Ge i ‘] Many of the early land surveys refer to the distance from Fort Graham in today's Hill County in order to locate in time and space the individual grant that they were surveying. These were the metes and bounds equivalent of a meridian, where surveys were tied into previously known and mapped locations. Fort Graham apparently served as a refuge in times of hostilities with immigrant and Native Indians as well as time of inclement weather such as did Kings Fort in Kaufman County to the east (e. g., McCaleb 1906:34- 40). The complicated division of Public Domain in Texas represents to an extent the division between the northern and southern United States. The northern United State used a rectangular grid system which was arbitrarily divided according to standard acreages (640, 320, 160 acre intervals) despite the landforms and available resources. In the southern United States, a metes and bounds system was used which allowed a settler to choose the landscape features he desired, if they were not already claimed and marked by other settlers or Indians. The Euro-American settlement in Texas was based on the sale of land according to a system which originated first from Spain and Mexico and included the empresario system which was maintained in the Republic Period. The Peters' Colony, an empresario contractor based in Louisville, Kentucky, within the Texas Republic used a N-S oriented (Township and Range baseline meridian modeled after the United States system of surveying) grid to divide their allotted land grants. The Nacogdoches Land District used a grid 45° west of north. The Robertson Land District used a grid oriented 35° west of north. There is no apparent reason why the Robertson and Nacogdoches systems follow this declination. All of these socio-political and cadastral systems collided in Ellis County (Figure 4-2). Appendix B presents the data compiled from the GLO records for 185 land tracts in the SSC project area. A brief discussion of the information is presented here. The Robertson Land District administered (surveyed) at least 123 of the 185 land tracts which were surveyed on-the-ground in the sample from Ellis County. However, not all of these tracts were granted by the Robertson Land District. In fact, other land districts comprised the largest input of actual grants (N=57), followed by the Mercer's Colony (N=30), Peters' Colony (N=18), and the Robertson Land District itself (N=18). The high incidence (62 of 185) of secondary relocation from other land districts (Figure 4-3 and 4-4) and the certified Peters’ and Mercer's Colonialists indicate that the Public Domain had been quite depleted prior to the onset of the Ellis County administration (beginning in 1850), which was completely responsible for all land Surveys after 1858 (N=62 or 185). The lag effect from the secondary location of parcels remaining from Republic of Texas land certificates continued until 1869. From 1870 onward, most grants were from Ellis County or the General Land Office and were administered through Ellis County and surveyed by its own surveyors (see below). A substantial number of the early land surveyors were instrumental in the evolution of local entrepreneurial systems based on land acquisition. B. J. Chambers, for example, also controlled land in Freestone County, Central Texas (Jurney 1990) in 1867 helped found Clebume in today's Johnson County to the west (Block 1970), along with W. F. Henderson, the Kickapoo battle survivor. D. R. Mitchell, J. E. Patton, and G. W. Cunningham played important roles in the Robertson Land District/Peters' Colony 4-4

mE BP wa ] ; [ conflict. In 1847-1848 Henry O. Hedgecoxe, the Texas administrator/surveyor for the Peters’ Colony identified James E. Patton and David R. Mitchell (Robertson), and A. G Walker (Nacogdoches) as the chief offenders of trespassing on Peters’ Colony lands (Connor 1959:89). The Peters’ Colony immigration would probably not have succeeded, but the natural expansion of the American frontier through this portion of Texas aided in their quota achievement (Connor 1959:90). From the SSC sample, Patton and Mitchell were indeed active in this area, but their surveys were mostly south of the Peters’ Colony Line. J. E. Patton established a farm in 1858 on Red Oak Creek, which is still owned by his descendants (Texas Family Land Registry 1975). G. W. Cunningham was one of the founders of Boz and married one of the daughters of J. D. Sims, a prominent early settler and landholder. He started a farm in 1856 (see sites 41EL80 and 41EL81), which is still owned by his descendants (Texas Family Land Registry 1978). The Red Oak Creek area (near today's Ovilla) was settled in the 1840s and was one of the first settlements. in what is today's Ellis County. John B. Billingsley settled with his father Samuel (see Appendix-B) in the Peters' Colony near Red Oak, and recalled several hunting expeditions that were used to supplement the agricultural production." In late 1844, four families with their hands and stock left the Red Oak settlement to be closer to the hunting grounds since the main bulk of the buffalo was on the musket (mesquite) prairie down on the Trinity River and on Chambers and Richland Creeks. There, by a spring, a good sized cabin and attached shed were located. Five men would leave to hunt buffalo, two men would remain with the women and children. The hunters would spend a week hunting buffalo, return to the cabin for a week to kill deer, and then return to the buffalo range" (Billingsley 1885; Glaspy 1981; Jurney and Glaspy 1987:42). Other Peters colonists settled slightly later in Ellis County. Peter Stout was listed as a resident of Tarrant County in 1850 (Connor 1959) but had settled on a second portion of his land grant (sites 41EL93 and 41EL95) by 1860, which was located on Grove Creek within the East Campus of the SSC. He and his family are buried in Palmer (Ellis County Cemetery Records 3:122 and 6:229). Legal descriptions in 1935 also refer to this land grant as the Old Stout Place (Ellis County Deed Book 83:139). According to the narrative written by Mrs. J. R. Dunaway in 1953 (Bethel United Methodist Church 1988), the settlement of the Chambers Creek area of Ellis County lagged nearly a decade behind Red Oak. In the years 1851 to 1853, E. M. Brack, J. D. Sims, P. C. Sims, and Nix (Nicholas?) Sims settled near High's Spring, about two miles southwest of Bethel Church (Figure 4-5). In 1853, a log schoolhouse was built on Gratehouse (Greathouse sic) Branch. E. M. Brack built a two room log house at Mackey Spring. P. C. Sims built a (frame?) house on todays Wilemon Place near Maypear] and Nicholas (Nix). P. Sims built the Old High House (frame) on the Sims Farm near Italy. E. M. Brack and P. C. Sims then built frame houses near Bethel, and built the first frame church in 1872. A frame school, closer to Boz, was built slightly earlier, and its location is within an unsurveyed portion of the West Campus. This school is on Baker Branch, which was named for a Mr. Baker of Denton County who was reportedly killed by Indians near there during the early years of settlement.

Eloquent descriptions of the SSC area prior to extensive settlement or land alteration are as follows. "The black soil did present drawbacks for travelers. The roads in North Central Texas were universally primitive, and the early settlers found them a serious obstacle. There were no bridges or graded roads," recalled Mrs. George James, who family traveled from Tennessee to the northeastern part of Dallas County in 1855. "When travelers came to one of those rushing streams they just had to wait until the water went down. Getting up and down those steep muddy banks was a hard problem. Wagons would often sink to the hubs. With each wheel loaded with sticky black mud that had to pried off with poles, the teams had to be doubled and hitched to a wagon to get across" (James 1927:3-4). Yet the land had an irresistible virgin beauty, which remained vividly in the memories of the early pioneers. "Our first impressions of Texas," wrote Mrs. James (1927:1-2), “were the vastness of the prairies and the long range of vision. It seemed we could see where the sky and earth met... When spring came the prairies were like a vast flower garden. Flowers of every hue spread out for miles." Her sentiments were echoed by John Billingsley, whose family crossed the Red River in 1844 after a difficult journey from Missouri. “This prairie land was then in its beauty,...no plow had ever skimmed its surface, no barbed wire, no wall or ditch crossed the trail of the Indian hunter, the wild deer in his flight or the wild horse in his ramble, A carpet of green grass now covered the land and our horses and oxen no longer rambled in search of food over this beautiful and rich prairie country we traveled” (Billingsley 1885:202). By 1846, Taos or Porters Bluff (at the junction of today's Ellis, Navarro, and Henderson Counties) had become an important community for packets and small steamers (Jester 1944; Jumey and Glaspy 1987:43). By 1848, roads were constructed originating from this town. At its peak, Taos had a 20 room hotel, homes, blacksmith, sawmill, boat landing, warehouses, and a ferry (Richner and Bagot 1978:196). Taos was twice destroyed by floods in 1866 and in 1878, when it was finally abandoned. In 1850, a north-south military road was constructed from Austin to Oklahoma, and is shown on the 1852 map of Peters Colony (Figure 4-6). A number of branches extended off this route in northern Ellis and southern Dallas Counties. Also, a route followed the crest of the Austin Chalk uplift, which was a reported branch of the Chisholm Trail according to Mrs. J. R. Dunaway (Brooks et al. 1964:70). This cattle trail was also known as the Shawnee Trail, which ended with with three branches to Kansas City, Sedalia, and St. Louis, Missouri (Stephens and Holmes 1989). As shown in Figure 4-6, land division was only partially completed by the Peters' Colony. Many of the tracts claimed by the Peters' Colony were in actuality already granted to others, and some of the tracts shown in Figure 4-6 as being granted were later cancelled by court action. Also, all original field notes were stolen from the Peters' Colony Office by irate settlers and were destroyed (Connor 1959). Many of these tracts had to be resurveyed. Plantations and Farmsteads 1850-1870 The entire region of central and northern Texas which contained the Blackland Prairie witnessed an era of growth prior to the Civil War. From the 1850s on intensive cotton production was exported from the 4-6

if _ Ca 3 co hm Es Gulf Coast prairies into the Blackland Prairies, which began to displace the more traditional yeoman crops: corn, wheat, rye, oats, barley, hay, and husbandry of cattle, hogs, horses (Bizzell 1924; Jurney and Glaspy 1987:42-44). that were used by the original settlers Prominent among the early plantationers was O.E. Dunlap, who immigrated from Mississippi with his father and slaves (Green 1970:254-257) settling on the John and Ann Adams Survey just prior to the Civil War. He expanded beyond farming, was a self-taught jurist, and also was president of the Cotton Association, Good Road Association, the Currency Association, and the American Exchange Banking System (Green 1970:165). This individual also was instrumental in the formation of the Ellis County Farm in 1883. In addition, his widowed mother married P. C. Sims (an early Boz settler) which united these prominent families and their lands. By 1850, the overland routes had been established through the project area (see Figure 4-6). The Old Springfield: Road from Hcuston to the north Texas area was one of the main routes, used primarily for driving cattle. The vast majority of immigration to this area at this time was originating from the southern States (Lee 1982), including a high proportion of slave owners (White 1940:904). Slave holding was an essential part of cotton production, but the intensity of this practice was never as great as along major river drainages of the Gulf Coastal Plain. As noted above, the Peters' Colony promoted immigration from midwestemers, the Ohio Valley, and Tennessee. In the 1850s, the cultural and territorial conflicts between these zones of settlement collided in Ellis County. One Peters’ Colonialist, Peter Stout (and his family), occupied two farmsteads in the East Campus area. Also, land tracts belonging to Samuel Billingsley and his son are within the SSC project area. Two major north-south arteries led out of Waxahachie, one followed the exposed Austin Chalk uplift along the headwaters of all drainages through Cedar Hill and into Dallas, while another (the eastern route) intersected a network of roads and led south crossing Grove Creek to Taos. John Billingsley recalled that “from the year 1848 to 1851 there were great changes in the country...people were moving in more each year, the water courses were being lined with settlements, farms and houses began to dot the prairie, dry goods and grocery stores were established in Dallas and a few in the county at different points” (Billingsley 1885:218). In 1859, on the eve of the Civil War, Texas was fifth in cotton production. In 1860-1861 the script grants (land given in compensation for expenditures) given to the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado RR Co. from Ellis County indicate that the railroad was considered an important mode of transportation which had to be developed in the SSC region. However, the war delayed the railroad and depleted the cotton industry. Also, during the 1850s-1860s Texas underwent the most prolonged drought in the last 300 years (Stahle and Cleaveland 1988:66), which greatly depleted the agricultural economy. Texas did not match the 1859 cotton production, probably due to the drought and the realignment of the labor force, again until 1875 (Agelasto et al. 1922:331). By 1879, Texas was the largest cotton producer of all states in the union, and remained so into the early twentieth century. 4-7

Civil War and Reconstruction The Civil War halted the settlement and economic growth of Ellis County, and most agricultural productions were donated to the Southern cause. The only Public Domain which was surveyed during this period was script to individuals who contributed to the war effort. After 1865, however, land surveying rapidly began again, and apparently the entire region again attracted settlement. For example, B. F. Forrester (site 41EL78) settled in the Boz community in 1869 and joined J. M. Dunaway (1855, site 41EL75) as the earliest resident farmers and landholders in the area. The principal labor source for cotton production, slaves, was lost after the Civil War. Blacks had a brief taste of social equality in the late 1860s and early 1870s due to the radical Republican influence over southern legislators. Fraternal organizations and some governmental positions were nc + available to African Americans. However, the “public” demand for self rule and white supremacy resulted in the reinstatement of the political milieu that had existed prior to the war. An example is the transactions between James Agee, Isaac and Ann Newton (colored), and William Smith. R. M. Wyatt, a local surveyor and land entrepreneur, filed an affadavit with the Texas General Land Office that Isaac and Ann Newton were working as agents for Smith, when they obtained their homestead in 1875 (see site 41EL104). R. M. Wyatt was the principal land surveyor for Ellis County after the Civil War, and also secured many tracts of vacant land, Due to the abolition of slavery, a new system of production became necessary in order to practice cotton agriculture. Tenant farmers (croppers, renters, or otherwise) became a major substitute for slave labor in the cotton belt. Tenant farming was both an economic system and a social institution in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. For the North Central Texas area, Saunders (1982:180) outlined the general principles behind this form of farming: : Briefly, tenant farming represents an economic system which, at a general level, can be divided _.into the land owning and non-land owning classes. In addition, this southern institution was “occupied by both white and black families at the owner/non-owner levels. Consequently, the most widely represented period presents a data base which may be classified along economic (owner vs. non-owner) and ethnic (white vs. black) divisions. Tenant farming may be defined as the right of an individual to farm a landowner's land for either a set fee paid in cash or by an exchange of a predetermined proportion of the final crop harvested for a particular period. Although the precise terms varied from state to state, the general agreements usually followed the terms presented in Table 4-1. The half system for the sharecropper and the one-quarter cotton and one-third com for the tenant farmer became the standard fees allowed by the State of Texas in 1913 (McElree 1917:45). Although cash tenants were formally recognized throughout all states as a specific type of tenant, they were extremely low in number and continued to decrease in frequency throughout the early twentieth century (Saunders 1982:180-182). Table 4-1 lists the types of tenancy and economic relationships and practices (after Goldenweiser and Boeger 1913). 4-8

Essentially, goods transported by rail facilitated the rapid growth of the cotton industry in the Blackland Prairie. Farmers were now able to ship their product to manufacturers while at the same time manufactured goods could be imported to the rural communities. Also, cotton ginning and pressing machinery could be imported to railroad centers, and farming cooperatives and businesses could greatly increase the efficiency and profits to be realized from cotton agriculture. As noted above, active development of the railroad began in 1860-1861 and recommenced in 1866, based on the granting of land script to railroad companies in Ellis County. The Houston and Texas Central Railroad (H&TC) joined Houston and Dallas and was completed in 1871. This line joined the Missouri Kansas & Texas Railroad at Denison to complete the rail line from Houston to St. Louis (Ellis County History Workshop 1972:51; Hardy-Heck-Moore Inc. 1990:45). Ennis was developed as a regional business and labor center following the completion of this railroad. Several

towns (e. g., Alsdorf, Ferris, Palmer, Trumbull, Garrett) were also established by the general railroad program of placing towns every 20 or 50 miles, and switching stations where needed. This railroad greatly influenced settlement along the eastern side of the project area. After Ennis was incorporated in 1872, pioneer immigrants from eastern Europe (Bavaria, Germany, Czechslovakia, etc.) began to settle there. Script land given to the railroads was available for settlement. - The success of one immigrant was passed back to the homeland, and informal networks were established that promoted subsequent immigration (Stollregen 1973). Nationally, a surge in immigration began around 1900, and many immigrants arrived in Ennis, such as Joe and Josie Dolezal from Bavaria (see 41EL1 19). The Waxahachie Tap Railroad was organized in 1875 and was finished in 1879, cutting through prime cotton country to the H&TC at Garrett. This line was joined by the Texas Midland Railroad in 1928, providing a connection through the Blackland Prairie cotton belt to Paris, Texas. This latter line was abandoned in 1943 becc ise of severe washouts (Ellis County History Workshop 1972:113; Hardy-Heck- Moore Inc. 1990:47). On the local level, the presence of the railroad allowed farmers and co-operatives to reach higher levels of cotton production and processing. Oil and bale presses (see site 41EL134) at local gins allowed greater efficiency and cost-benefit when products were sold. The railroad provided the means to tie households to National Markets. The late nineteenth century marked the beginning of a major change in lifeways, from self-sufficient farms to cash crop oriented agriculture. The Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railroad was built across the northwest comer of Ellis County in 1882, but had little effect on the project area. The Fort Worth and New Orleans (part of the old Buffalo Bayou Brazos and Colorado or Trinity Brazos) reached Waxahachie in 1882, passing through the center of the project. Some communities, such as Bardwell, relocated to gain access to this line. The Missouri, Kansas, & Texas Railroad followed the path of the Shawnee Trail and 1850 military road (today's U.S. Highway 77). It reached Sterrett in 1889 and Milford in 1890. The communities of Red Oak and Forreston in the SSC project area were greatly affected by this railroad. Part of this route in the southern part of the county was joined by the International and Great Northern in 1902, which extended up Chambers Creek near Boz and led to the northwest of Maypearl. -Many communities in the project area underwent several stages in their evolution. Figure 4-5, previously shown illustrates the steps in the formation of the Boz/Bethel community. This shows how early settlement began in the forested areas of Chambers Creek and Gratehouse (Greathouse sic) Branch, and shifted to the upland prairies by the 1870s. This trend in settlement appears to be universal in Texas and was discussed in the Billingsly (1885) diary. Streams provided forests for homes and fuel, and prairies were initially used for hunting and grazing. It was not until after the Civil War that settlers began to break the raw prairie lands, . The shift from self-sufficiency to a cash based economy also had repercussions in the case of invalid and/or indigent individuals. Such individuals had traditionally been cared for within the family, but Texas in 1869 realized that county poorhouses were necessary. Texas, as other states, drew upon the poor laws of 4-10 _ wee ss | ————a! ( Cc "| J —=

C4 = Elizabethan England and created a system of aid to avoid starvation, but was careful not to create comfort (Cottrell 1989:171). This attitude was reinforced in the new Texas Constitution of 1876, which maintained a provision for establishing county poorhouses and farms, and which continues today. Often jail trustees were used to provide heavy labor, while indigents, mentally ill patients, and the elderly did less strenuous work. The Ellis County Poor Farm was established in 1883, indicating that a social need was present. This farm became a productive asset to county revenues, due to the influence of O. E. Dunlap. The Ellis County Farm continued in operation until 1964. Climax and Decline of Tenant Farming 1900-1945 The practice of tenant farming increased steadily in the United States between 1880 and 1930 (Vance 1929; Cauley 1930; Wise 1937), with the most precipitous increase between 1910 and 1930 (Sanderson 1937). In Texas, the percentage of tenant farms increased from 37.5% in 1880 to 60.9% in 1930 (Cauley 1930; Sanderson 1937). The WPA files for Ellis County indicate that most land purchases and construction of dwellings were in this period (see Appendix B). In the 1911-1914 period O.E. Dunlap stated that Ellis County produced 10% of Texas’ cotton, which was 10% of the world's production, and the County Farm produced 1.5 bales per acre (Green 1970:254-255). The depression of the 1930s, combined with soil exhaustion, the cotton boll weevil, and the cotton market crash culminated in the end of farm tenancy as a major agricultural strategy, although it is present in various forms today. At the close of the 1930s and early 1940s, a complete shift in population occurred as rural families moved to urban areas. Many farms in the project area were abandoned at this time, and only a few remain standing today. Rural Development after 1945 The rural portions of the project area have undergone a considerable decrease in population since World War II. Most of this decrease has been in the 20-25-year-old age group (Lee 1982). Towns, on the other hand, have shown a growth. As traditional farms became influenced by developments in technology and federal land programs, rural lifeways have become more focused on a cash economy and the use of consumer goods. The most significant aspect of this has been the mass consumption of goods, both foods as well as commodities, appliances, etc. To a large extent, yeoman agriculture and the small family farm have been replaced by agribusiness and large corporations (Richner and Lee 1977; Lee 1982). Summary Traditional approaches to the study of landscape geography have been oriented toward broad regional models of the diffusion and evolution of traits. Some settlement models used in archaeological interpretation depict economic development as a sequence progressing from initial colonization, to the spread of agrarian systems, and finally to competition for limited space and resources (Hudson 1985; Skinner et al. 1981). Rural Texas settlement has been described as being scattered and semiclustered along 4-11

irregularly spaced roads, with perhaps churches and stores at crossroads (e. g., Buena Vista Church and School, see site 41EL100). These crossroad settlements sometimes grew to include 15-20 houses, major community cemeteries, blacksmith shops, and large general stores (Jordan 1973; Skinner 1983), as did the community of Boz. It has been suggested that the distances between such rural supply centers were standardized at 6-7 miles to allow the rural population access within a single day's travel time by horse and wagon (Hart 1976). Hart (1976) further suggests that farmstead dwellings and outbuildings were not placed in any particular relationship to each other, in accord with southern custom. Others, such as Glassie (1975), have suggested that some generalized patterning does exist in rural farmstead arrangement, and formal relationships among buildings and structures have been demonstrated on late nineteenth and twentieth century farmsteads in the Richland Creek (Moir and Jumey 1987) and Joe Pool Lake (Jumey et al. 1988) project areas.. Frontier settlement in East Texas concentrated first in the heavily timbered regions and then expanded along the interfingered prairie zones. Initial settlers apparently sought the openings in oak forests and the edges of timbered zones, where readjustment was not an extreme factor in the adaptation to an environment different than that from which they had come. During the latter half of the nineteenth century a combination of events and technological advances (i. e., railroads, drilling machines, windmills, reapers, steel plows, and mowers and threshers) allowed settlement to advance onto the extensive prairie grasslands. A successful farm today is measured by its owner's or manager's ability to combine several agricultural practices in the general operation of a farming enterprise (Kellog 1941:287). This is especially significant in terms of keeping these practices together, and balanced against costs and profits, as economic and social changes occur and technology progresses. The major failure of the tenant farm system can be attributed to its dependence on a single cash crop: cotton. It appears that the small family farm was diversified and continued to function quite well even into the twentieth century. These family systems ended, however, with the deaths and/or removal of those generations which fostered them. The descendants of the first and second wave of settlers either shifted gradually toward economic systems far removed from traditional rural agrarian pursuits, such as oil extraction, or relocated to urban areas. Also, many rural farms were operated by landlords who lived in town (i. e., Waxahachie, Ennis) and who either traveled to the farm, hired managers, or leased to tenants. Some farms in Ellis County have remained successful and have stayed within the same family for over 100 years. Table 4-2 lists the farms in Ellis County that have remained within families for over 100 years. In all, 24 farms are listed on the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry, kept by the Texas Department of Agriculture in Austin. Seven farms began in the 1850s (1852-1858), four in the 1860s, six in the 1870s, and seven in the 1880s. Although this is an excellent reference, listing on the family Land Heritage Registry is voluntary, and many older farms may not be included. A prime example is the J. M. Dunaway farm (41EL75) which began in 1855, is still in the family, but has not been listed. 4-12

| rc Ce 9 One of the variables which contributes to this success is apparently marriage and inheritance patterns, which have merged some of the major landholding families. Women have played significant roles in the continuity of a farmstead, and in Ellis County many women inherited sizeable portions of their father's farmsteads. The roles of men and women in the maintenance of the farm are discussed in Appendix C, from the perspectives of local residents. An example of how this marriage alliance worked is Mrs. Mary F. H. Elliot, who now owns two 100 year old farms, the Hines or Upper Hampton and the B. F. Forrester farm.

PREVIOUS HISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY The previous historic archaeological research in Ellis County has been limited to only a few recent projects. The Bardwell Reservoir studies (Shafer 1964; Sorrow 1966) completely omitted historic cultural resources from evaluation. This was the largest archaeological study in Ellis County which has been performed to date. The principal studies relating to historic cultural resources have involved large projects in neighboring counties. The archaeological evaluations of the proposed Tennessee Colony Reservoir touched on a corner of Ellis County and did include historic resources, two of which, Trinity City (41EL1) and Taos (Richner and Bagot 1978:196) are crucial to our understanding of the historical development of the region. In their integration of the historic period, Richner and Lee (1977:48-50) defined four periods of significant regional development: Frontier (1820-1840); Initial Cash Crop (1840-1870); Tenant Farming (1870-1940); and Agribusinéss (1940-Present). Although collections were made during the survey and evaluations of many historic sites were performed, no major excavations were conducted. From 1982-1984, extensive prehistoric and historic investigations were conducted for the Richland Creek Reservoir, located approximately 40 miles south of the SSC project area. Intensive historic excavations, archival searches, and informant interviews were conducted on a plantation site, 31 farmsteads, and 5 light industrial sites dating between 1855 and World War II (Moir and Jurney 1987; Jumey and Moir 1987). The results of these historic archaeological studies indicated that small landowners and tenant farmers practicing cotton agriculture dominated the settlement of the Richland Creek project area, principally occupying valley flanks and partially elevated bottomlands. The most intensive settlement began after 1860, and was densest from 1890 to 1920. Traditional lifeways were maintained until the 1930s and 1940s, and indicated a mixture of cultural elements from the upland and lowland areas of the southern United States. Archaeological deposits around farmsteads typically covered 1500 m2 to 3500 m2 adjacent to the dwelling, and contained an estimated 100,000 to 500,000 artifacts per site. Most farmsteads were occupied for 50 years or less. From 1984 to 1986, extensive prehistoric and historic investigations were conducted for Joe Pool Lake in Dallas, and Tarrant counties and a small portion of Ellis County. In all 13 historic properties received intensive study, 9 of which were landowners’ farmsteads, and 4 of which were tenant farmers’ dwellings. Middle to late nineteenth century (N=3), late nineteenth century (N=7), and twentieth century (N=3) sites were investigated by multidisciplinary methods. Cultural influences were derived from the upland area of the southern United States and from Midwestern regions. Overall, the Joe Pool Lake historic settlement pattern diverged from the trends observed among the cotton farmers of Richland Creek; and farmsteads there represent more diversified rural farming strategies from 1860 to 1930 including row crop agriculture. Settlements were located along the Austin Chalk Escarpment and the prairie interfluves, with few farms in the floodplain of Mountain Creek, 4-14 Co p= 4 — o—

ef a Cc Within Ellis County, only three small cultural resources projects have involved historic properties. In 1985, aca. 15 mile transect was surveyed for a powerline from Waxahachie to Ennis by Espey-Huston, Inc. Two historic sites, a dump (41EL31) and a farmstead (41EL32) were located, but were not deemed significant. An archaeological survey (Westbury 1986) and test excavations were conducted at two historic farmsteads within the proposed Waxahachie-Midlothian Airport (Westbury 1989). This area is within the ring of the SSC. Again, these historic properties were not deemed significant. In January 1990, a reconnaissance survey was conducted for a 12 mile water supply line between Midlothian and Sterrett (Anthony and Brown 1990), which crosses the northwestern part of the SSC project area, just north of the above-mentioned airport. Four historic sites (41EL54, 41EL55, 41EL56, and 41EL57), one with standing architecture (41EL57) were recorded. Shovel tests conducted at these sites indicate shallow deposits (‘ess than 10 cm). Occupied sites were evaluated, but did not receive shovel tests. All shovel tests conducted at these historic sites revealed shallow (less than 10 cm) deposits. Only a single site (41EL57) which was occupied, was thought to be significant (Anthony and Brown 1990:19-20). This site is adjacent to a shaft penetration. In summary, previous archaeological projects have focused primarily on surveys of historic properties in Ellis County. A single prehistoric site has received extensive excavations. Only nine historic sites have been recorded and only one of these sites has received test excavations to determine National Register eligibility. The SSC project will be the largest archaeological endeavor conducted to date in Ellis County. Already the number of historic sites on record has been multiplied over 7 times, (October 11, 1990), and other areas remain to be surveyed. 4-15

C } —— i SS we =) - = fe ey RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY ) by David H. Jumey The research orientation for the initial assessment of prehistoric and historic archaeological properties within the SSC Project area is human ecology. As defined in this work, human ecology includes not only the relationships between man and the biophysical environment, but also the interrelationships among/men and women}, including the political economy of human affairs. It is realized however that the probability of all types of environmental, subsistence, settlement, and material cultural information being present in the study area is not 100%. Also, the full range of human cultural affairs may not be totally documented through the archival or ethnohistorical records. Therefore the historical contexts (research questions) and potential research avenues that are proposed will be weighed against the known or possible data sets that can be recovered. The present project is an initial assessment of cultural resources within the project area and is not designed to answer the National Register eligibility or the known research potential for each property. This is mandated by several factors, the principal one being the fact that all land is still under private ownership and there is a no collection policy on private lands. Therefore archaeological reconnaissance was designed to identify all cultural properties, determine their boundaries and depths, and evaluate the material cultural content based on field observations of artifacts. Unfortunately, the material culture expertise of supervisory and field personnel varies, and firm chronological identifications of both prehistoric and historic remains were not totally successful. All temporally diagnostic artifacts were documented in field notes and photographs were taken of selected items. This phase was designed to produce as little alteration as possible to the resources, pending a future phase of study where more detailed documentation, formal test excavations, and controlled artifact collection can be implemented. Artifact collections and systematic test excavations are essential to complete the NR evaluations of each property that exhibits potential significance. Assessments of archaeological site significance will primarily be based on the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The significance for archaeological, agricultural, and cultural properties, usually 50 years old, is evaluated using one or more of four NRHP criteria. Those criteria state that the quality of significance may be embodied in property types such as a building, structure, district, site, object, or artifact that possesses integrity of location, setting, feeling, and association and: 5-1 *»

A. that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of history; or B. that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or C. that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction; or that represent the work of a master; or that possess high artistic values; or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or D. that have yielded or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory or history (Federal Register 1983 Volume 4, 1901: 44716-44739). Each archaeological property will be evaluated against all of these criteria. As noted above, it may not be possible to completely assess the significance of all properties based solely on reconnaissance information. Recommendations will be made for appropriate levels of investigation necessary to complete the preliminary assessments. Final assessments will be made in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and other interested parties. In addition to these criteria, the research questions within the broad Historic Contexts that have been developed (or are in draft form) for northeast Texas by the Texas Historical Commission for the Texas State Plan will also be used to evaluate the potential significance of each property. Presently, a single historic context, The Emergence of Sedentism in Northeast Texas (Perttula et al. 1989, 1990), has been published. Two additional contexts are currently being reviewed, Cultural Implications of Late Quaternary Environmental Change in Northeast Texas (Collins and Bousman 1990), and The Evolution of Agricultural Societies in Northeast Texas (Perttula 1990). A historic context is an organizational framework that identifies a group of related properties based on a shared theme which is bounded in geographical space and time. Historic contexts/themes may be constructed using existing information ranging from historical data to concepts, theories, or models, These contexts should neither be so broad as to include all property types under a single framework or so narrow as to focus on only one property type (Federal Register 1983:44718). A historic context has several components (Perttula 1990) which include: (a) themes; (b) geographical boundaries and chronological limits; (c) overview of the regional data base; (d) major problems or constraints of the data base to the development of the context; (€) property types that should be considered (for both historic and prehistoric groups); (f) treatment goals for the properties and objectives for the context; (g) regional synthesis of the data base; (h) study units for the context with a brief discussion of each; 5-2 C =) 5 =a c J ee

t = i = & os _ ca CI (i) an overall summary of the context. These components of a historic context not only aid in cultural resource management, but also through the development of regional and local management activities for the future in North Central Texas (Perttula 1990). Historic contexts are defined in the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Preservation Planning (1983 48 FR 44717). These broad thematic studies form the basis for making informed and justifiable decisions about identification, evaluation, registration, and treatment (48 FR 44717). Such historic contexts (48 FR 44718) can be developed at a variety of scales (e. g., state, regional, or local). Based on previous studies, including the present reconnaissance and the recovered archival and informant information, specific and local research questions have been developed for the SSC project area. Following more detailed evaluations, broader historic contexts may be developed for the SSC project area. These research questions also draw upon the even broader regional historic contexts for northeast Texas, when applicable. These contexts relate to the four study units of human ecology that have been used on major archaeological projects adjacent to the SSC area: (1) settlement patterning, (2) environmental and ecological reconstruction, (3) subsistence practices, and (4) analysis of material culture (Archaeology Research Program 1984; McGregor et al. 1987:11-20). The following represent preliminary research questions or themes that will be developed, expanded, and refined as new information is accumulated. Some of these may be further developed into broader historic contexts. The specific study units to be addressed under each research question are discussed below, but are not meant to be rigid or the sole questions that may be addressed as investigations progress.

The location of springs appear to have influenced settlement choices throughout prehistory. Sites with cultural materials which may have potential to address this question include 41EL98, 41EL99, 41EL110, 41EL116, 41EL119, 41EL127. 3. Did population increase promote the emergence of (sedentism of Ellis Count?) during the late Holocene ca. AD. 700 - A.D. 1450)? Population increase must be dealt with in a regional perspective, but some sites could potentially provide information in this direction. They include 41EL98, 41EL99, 41EL110, 41EL116, 41EL127, 4. How have changes in exploitation of lithic resources in Ellis County during the prehistoric period 10,000 B.C. - A.D. 1450 been reflected in the archaeological record? It is necessary to locate the distribution of lithic resources (e. g., veneer gravels) which have been exploited and those which have little evidence of exploitation. The veneer gravels on the County Farm 41EL58 were not exploited to a great extent, since only two tested cobbles were noted in 450 acres that were surveyed, while the lower density gravels at 41EL116 were intensively exploited. Temporal control is essential to address this question, but most sites can potentially address this question. The sites include 41EL58, 41EL96, 41EL97, 41EL98, 41EL99, 41EL106, 41EL108, 41EL110, 41EL114, 41EL116, 41EL118, 41EL119, 41EL127. Prehistoric Secondary Ouesti 5. How were bison fxploited by Native Americans in Ellis County during the protohistoric and Early Historic Periods, A.D. 1450 - 1840? At present, chronological control and evidence for bison are not available. Based on what appear to be post A.D. 1200 occupations, only two sites have potential to address this question, 41EL110 and 41EL116. 6. Have depositional systems and geomorphological conditions destroyed and/or preserved sites in Ellis County from 10000 B.C. - Present? Most of the sites could have the potential to address this question, but some have greater apparent potential. These include 41EL96, 41EL97, 41EL99, and 41EL110. 7.

The distribution of all prehistoric sites will be examined in relation to vegetation zones. Sites which have the greatest apparent potential to address this question include 41EL96, 41EL97, 41EL127. 8. Was there depopulation of Ellis County by Native Americans during the Protohistoric and Early Historic Periods A.D. 1450 - 1840? As with Research Question 3, this question required a regional perspective. Also chronometric control is essential, and information must be obtained from all cultural periods. At present, no single site is known to have the potential to address this question. Historic Pri Ouesti 9. To what extent did the influence of Mexico, the Texas Republic, and the State of Texas Land Entrepreneurs in the allocation of Public Domain affect the settlement of Ellis County from 1820 - 1880? Local and regional entrepreneurs owned many land tracts, and through their influence, land was redistributed. Sites that may have the potential to date such transactions include 41EL75, 41EL95, 41EL 104, 10. How have tradition and change been evidenced in agricultural practices and related residential occupation of Ellis County from 1830 - 1990? A spectrum of well dated sites is necessary to address this question. Sites which may have the potential to address these changes include 41EL59, 41EL62, 41EL75, 41EL77, 41EL79, 41EL80, 41EL81, 41EL82, 41EL84, 41EL88, 41EL109, 41EL120, 41EL121, 41EL124, 41EL135, 11, What are the economic and settlement responses to the introduction of the railroad and improved overland routes in Ellis County 1866 - 1990? Sites dating prior to and sites dating to after the railroad (1866-1872) are necessary to address this question. Identified properties which may have potential to address these questions are 41EL59, 41EL84, 41EL93, 41EL109, 41EL134. 12. Does farm success or failure relate more to environmental or to economic influences in Ellis County farm 1840 - 1990? The terminal dates for farmstead occupation are important for this question. Detailed archaeological control is necessary along with archives and informants. Sites which may have the potential to address this question include 41EL59, 41EL61, 41EL67, 41EL68, 41EL69, 41EL72, 41EL73,

What are the implications of marriage patterns in community formation in Ellis County 1840 - 1990? Inheritance passed through many women, and marriage patterns allowed the development of large holdings which in some cases have lasted 3 or more generations. Sites which have the potential to address this question include 41EL69, 41EL75, 41EL77, 41EL79, 41EL81, 41EL95, 41EL100. 14. How have ethnic groups been integrated in Ellis County 1840 - 1940? 15. Four major ethnic groups have been present in the study area; Anglo American, African American, Hispanic, and Eastern European. Sites for which ethnicity has been identified include 41EL74, 41EL81, 41EL84, 41EL100, 41EL104, 41EL119. How can informants’ mental maps of communities be incorporated into the archival and archaeological records in Ellis County 1900 - 1990? Informant interviews have produced one comprehensive and several fragmentary maps of Boz. Firm evidence from archaeology and archives can be used to examine the scope of mental recall. Sites which may aid in addressing this question include 41EL74, 41EL77, 41EL100. 16. What are the material culture correlates of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and time in Ellis County 1840 - 1940? A spectrum of sites is necessary to address this question. Sites which could potentially address this question include 41EL58, 41EL59, 41EL62, 41EL67, 41EL72, 41EL77, 41EL80, 41EL81, 41EL82, 41EL88, 41EL95, 41EL104, 41EL109, 41EL120. 17, What were the effects of the integration of social welfare through the County Poor Farm/Prison Farm system in Ellis County 1883 - 1962? This research question applied to a single site, 41EL58. Archival evidence that has been compiled indicates that the County Farm was instrumental in road building as well as producing crops and taking care of indigents.

— I ] As noted above, human ecology refers to the dual examination of human relationships to the biophysical environment as well as interrelationships in the cultural environment. Six (Research Questions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 12) of the seventeen research questions are directly related to paleoenvironmental reconstruction and the relationship of culture to environment. An overriding need to develop these research questions is chronometric dating of both cultural and natural deposits. These research questions focus most directly on the theme of human ecology and involve two major assumptions: (1) that the survival of human populations is dependent on learned behavioral responses to the biophysical and cultural environment; and (2) that cultures most likely to change will do so in response to stress. The culture-historical sequences identified for North Central Texas have been discussed in Chapter 3 for the prehistoric and Chapter 4 for the historic period. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions, along with cultural historical identification, have been major foci of archaeological investigations in two areas adjacent to the SSC project: the Richland Creek Reservoir approximately 40 miles south (Bruseth et al. 1987), and Joe Pool Lake approximately 25 miles north (Peter and McGregor 1988). In addition, archaeological surveys and excavations were conducted within the boundaries of Bardwell Reservoir. Only 15 sites dating from Archaic to Late Prehistoric were recorded (Schafer 1964), and only a single site, 41EL11, was selected for intensive excavation (Sorrow 1966). This site is located adjacent to three natural springs (C. K. Chandler, personal communication 1990). Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations at 41EL11 were identified in fair stratigraphic context, with burials, hearths, and pits identified. Faunal preservation at 41EL11 was excellent with several extirpated species identified, including bison and pronghorn antelope. Other projects in Ellis County have been more limited in scope and area and were focused on pedestrian surveys (Ferring 1983; Westbury 1986; Anthony and Brown 1990). In addition to these local studies, the archaeological background and overview of the Archaeology and Bioarchaeology of the Gulf Coastal Plain (Story et al. 1990) is an essential reference for the regional archaeological record. Human ecology is a research perspective which is focused on determining how human groups tespond(ed) to and influence(d) natural environments. These responses are manifested in culture and technology. To properly address this research perspective, it is necessary to have data from archaeological contexts that indicate the times and places where human activities occurred, and non-archaeological contexts where human activities have not disturbed the paleoenvironmental record. Chronological control is an essential element of both these aspects of Human Ecology. Environmental factors such as soils, access to and availability of water, and the composition of local floral and faunal communities have been demonstrated to have direct links to human activities as interpreted from the archaeological record. Geomorphological and cultural factors such as erosion, sedimentation, soil conditions, and modern land use practices have affected both archaeological and environmental records (Collins and Bousman 1990:3). These factors must be considered when identifying and locating cultural properties, evaluating their integrity and information yield, and developing cost effective programs of investigation and preservation. 5-7

Ecological Reconstruction Research Questions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 12 have great potential for evaluating the archaeological and environmental records within the SSC project. Rapid and widespread environmental changes since the terminal Pleistocene have altered the environmental setting of Ellis County. There is a high potential for site discovery, particularly since the project is primarily upland. which has been intensively plowed and ground cover is light. During the Pleistocene, valleys were deeply incised, and since then, there has been extensive valley infilling, potentially burying many sites, and altering or destroying others. Also, the crustal (tectonic) warping of the Austin Chalk has influenced drainage and alluviation patterns. Upland settings have not been conducive to site preservation, since soils have been maintained in balance, with little or no vertical accretion (Dave Goss, personal communication 1990). At the bases of s'>pes, colluvial and- alluvial process have potentially buried sites. This phenomenon has been observed by avocational archaeologists in Ellis County for over 30 years (C. K. Chandler, personal communication 1990). These areas, however, are not generally conducive for human activities. Steam margins and floodplains have the greatest potential yield of resources, were intensively occupied and exploited, and have deep deposits which bury and stratify human occupations, thus freezing many types of activities in the archaeological record. These areas also yield good environmental sequences. Site discovery and sampling of these deposits have low potential at the reconnaissance level of investigation, since significant sites or deposits may be covered by extensive mantles of alluvium. Other techniques such as geophysical modelling, mechanical digging, soil augering, or remote sensing need to be employed to discover sites in this setting, and have been employed when possible and feasible in this study. Property types expected to be relevant to cultural ecology include isolated activity areas, small encampments, resource extraction localities, habitations, and farmsteads, villages, cemeteries, and industrial facilities. The identification of prehistoric property types at the reconnaissance level is relatively tenuous, but chipping areas within the broadly scattered gravel veneers, isolated finds, and concentrations of cultural debris possibly indicating encampments or habitations can be identified. Prehistoric cemeteries and settlements are known to be present in Ellis County. For historical resources the identification of property types at the reconnaissance level is easier, since above ground structural remains and features are likely to be present. Also, archival and informant sources of information are readily available. Early maps, deed/title records, and historical summaries can be employed in the definition of property types. Historic property types which have been identified in the project include farmsteads with dwellings, sheds, barns, wells, and cisterns; schools and churches; cotton gins; and isolated structures such as wells in remote settings for watering cattle. Terminal Pleistocene climates appear to have been complex, with numerous and rapid fluxes in forestation and deforestation, erosion, and sedimentation. During the early Holocene climate began to warm, but with less moisture available than in the Pleistocene. This was followed in the mid Holocene by a dry 5-8 —J = fB ——

ps 1, | 3 cn) and warm to hot period where grasslands became widespread. Gradually forests began to increase, with short, brief periods of renewed grassland encroachment (Collins and Bousman 1990:105-106). Since Ellis County is located on a distinctive tension zone between forests and grasslands, such fluctuations should be readily preserved in the archaeological and environmental records. Also human groups practicing hunting and gathering lifeways are hypothesized to exhibit increased or decreased mobility in response to these varying conditions. During the historic period, prolonged periods of drought (1850-1860s and 1950s) and the phenomenon of False Spring have greatly altered the potential success or failure of crops and farmers. Prehistoric Settlement Patterns The role of population size on the settlement pattern of the SSC project area (Ellis County) and the Trinity Brazos River region as a whole is examined under three (3, 7, 8) research questions. Population is seen as producing circumstances where there is a point of diminishing return on the cultural effort necessary to meet human subsistence requirements. Sahlins (1963, 1968) and Leach (1954) have argued that as simpler societies increase in size and invest in political expansion, insufficient return to the local level engenders disaffection (Tainter 1988:205). This process requires resegmentation of the developed society, and has great relevance to the settlement or lack of settlement in a region. Population increase has been postulated to greatly influence strategies of settlement and subsistence of human societies. There is regional evidence, particularly in the increase of the number of sites dating to the late Archaic period that populations were substantially increasing. All types of landforms were occupied, particularly floodplains. Also, the high mobility of cultural groups noted during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene decreased possibly as a direct result of landscape infilling as cultural groups claimed more circumscribed areas. Ellis County is dominated by the tallgrass prairie, but most of the West Campus area is located on the uplifted Austin Chalk which contained short and medium grasses, and may have attracted bison herds in the past. The most important large animals of this zone were bison, antelope, bear, and, along wooded fringes, white-tailed deer. Dillehay (1974) has suggested that there were two periods where bison were absent from the southern plains and periphery (including Ellis County) 6000-5000 B.C. to 2000 B.C. and A.D. 500 - A.D. 1200-1300. This model is based on archaeological faunal assemblages. Lynott (1979) argues that bison were never present in large numbers in tallgrass prairies, but that after A.D. 1200 they did increase to some extent, White-tailed deer were a more dependable and stable resource for local populations. The implication for population increase is that adaptive strategies must be based on resources available year to year, and not dependent on broad migratory patterns. Also, patterns of stress will influence the particular adaptive strategies chosen, and affect the overall increase or rate of increase in population. Evidence from Joe Pool Lake indicates that horticultural activities with maize, combined with bison hunting (Research Question 5) were conducted at Baggett Branch (41DL149) ¢a. A.D. 700-1000. At the Cobb-Pool site more intensive horticultural activities with maize were conducted around A.D. 1000-1300 hoe Bisco was attrib ted ; 5-9 fo the LATE occu pation ab 4iDLiqd AdISoe

@ (obb- Pool (Peter and McGregor 1988:131-198). None of the occupations of these sites were deemed to be truly agricultural, and population was relatively low. No large population centers have been identified in the SSC Se project area but evidence from both Joe Pool Lake and Richland Creek indicates that improved hunting and gathering strategies, intensive use and storage of natural foods such as the prairie turnip (Bruseth et al. 1987), relative sedentism, and increase in population following the late Archaic period, were leading toward the development of more complex and populous societies ca(A.D. 1300.) 2 There is substantial evidence that bison exploitation (Research Question 5) may be addressed by archaeological and environmental studies in the SSC project. Bison remains were noted in the Pecan Springs excavations (Sorrow 1966) and bison remains have been observed in avocational collections from this site which have been retumed to the Corps of Engineers (Skipper Scott, personal communication 1989). In the channel of Richland Creek, a substantial deposit of bison bones was recovered in 1982 and 1983. These remains were examined by Dr. Eileen Johnson of Texas Tech University, who observed cuts (stone tool) and blow marks which may be indicative of human butchering activity. The bones were found in achannel lag deposit which is interpreted to be an out-of-context archaeological site. A single humerus was submitted for radiocarbon dating which produced a dendrocalibrated date of A.D. 17574121 (SMU 1944). All mandibles (N=17) were examined for age characteristics. Five general age categories were identified based on molar eruption and wear sequences; calves (N=3), young adults (N=2), adults (N=5), established adults (N=4), and old aged (N=3). This information indicates a healthy breeding herd population. Since this site is located about 40 miles south of the SSC project area, it is possible that such deposits may be encountered in the floodplains of Onion and Red Oak Creeks. Material Culture ‘Material cultural studies reflect the accessibility of natural resources (Research Questions 4, 11, 16) on the types of artifacts that can be found on both prehistoric (lithic resources) and historic (imported goods) sites. Also, certain patterns are becoming evident in the study of African-European-American artifact assemblages that indicate ethnicity. In addition, Native Americans who became assimilated into the Western European world economic system maintained a set of material cultural (ethnic) correlates that are identifiable in the archaeological record. Material culture provides the only direct link from the archaeological record to human behavior that is available, particularly during the prehistoric period. During the protohistoric and historical periods, ethnohistorical, archival, and informant information is available to elucidate human activities, but the archaeological record and material culture still provide the strongest link to reconstructing historical events and past activities, Claims for early human occupations (pre-Clovis) have been made throughout the New World. The Malakoff site, on the Trinity River in northwestern Henderson County is only 30 - 40 miles from the SSC project area, and consists of three human head images recovered from two commercial gravel sites between 5-10 5

2) I { mE & FF 1929 and 1939 (Sellards 1930, 1940, 1941, 1952; Slaughter et al. 1962:54; Aveleyva 1965:272-273; Agogino 1966, 1987). Based on the estimated age of these gravel deposits, it is thought that these could relate to pre-Clovis occupations of the region. Although there is no clearly defined context for these finds, two of these appear to be made by human action on concretions; the other is questionable (Story 1990:176). It is conceivable, but not likely, that such gravel deposits could be located in the SSC project area. Two established early cultures have a distinct set of stylistic and technological traits present in their material culture, and firm evidence has been accumulated to indicate their spatial and temporal contexts. The earliest dated material is for Clovis between 9500 and 9000 B.C. (West 1983). As mentioned in Chapter 3, the single most distinctive trait of these early cultures (Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff) is the manufacture of well made projectile points which contain several features: (1) a lanceolate outline, (2) ground basal and lateral margins, (3) thinned and/or fluted base, (4) selection of high quality raw material from specific sources, and (5) careful curation and resharpening of the blade point, often recycling into other tools such as knives, drills, and scrapers (Story 1990:177). Other temporally and culturally diagnostic tool types include the Albany knife, Red River knife (Johnson 1989), the Quince scraper (Johnson 1989; Perttula 1985), and Dalton adze. A large well made example of Scottsbluff is known from the project area (Maypearl 5 miles west) which is in the collection of an avocational archaeologist. Also, two basal fragments of Clovis points are known from 41EL5 (Meltzer 1987:32) and other finds have been noted in Navarro, Hill, Kaufman, Henderson, and Dallas Counties, surrounding the project area. The Archaic culture represents another cultural type and refers to hunting and gathering peoples from 7000 B.C. to ca. A.D. 700 in some areas of the Gulf Coastal Plain (Story 1990:211). During this period climatic changes possibly led to depopulation of some areas, but there is a Strong trend toward development of regionwide material cultural assemblages sharing technological and stylistic traits, which suggest gradually increasing sedentism, shared cultural knowledge through reciprocal arrangements in language areas, or extremely wide ranging movement of peoples. AS pointed out earlier, Archaic stone tools are generally less carefully crafted than those of early cultures, and less often were made from high quality stone derived from far distant sources. In addition to distinctive projectile point styles, stone lined hearths and baking pits and milling stones are present. Pecking and polishing of stone to make spear thrower weights, axeheads, and ornaments also appears (Story 1990:213). Generally the earliest Archaic tools are split stemmed projectile points; Waco sinkers; the Andice (or Calf Creek), Wells, and{Dawson{projectile points; and the Clear Fork gouge. The first securely dated Archaic artifacts in North Central Texas are from the Middle Archaic ca. 2500 B.C. and include the Bulverde and Carrollton points. Around 700 B.C. Castroville and Marshall are common. At this point, in time projectile points generally diminish in size and types such as Edgewood, Ellis, Trinity, and Palmillas are present, along with groundstone gorgets and boatstones. During the Late Archaic (ca. A.D. 1), the Yarbrough, Dallas, and Godley points are known, along with the Bristol biface. Later the lafge and small varieties of Gary and the notched axe are known. All or most of these point types 7 5-11 ? d ?

f ~ idane Borde De Share ite 2 have been identified in the collections of local and avocational archaeologists, and a fragment of a possible Andice was noted from a site in the East Campus. The Late prehistoric (post-Archaic) cultures are generally characterized by major technological changes, but some material/cultural traits and inferred behaviors are shared with the Late Archaic. The most striking changes are the beginning of pottery making and the shift to the bow and arrow. Also, there is a partial reliance on cultigens, more sedentary habitations, and social and ritual elaborations, as particularly evidenced in Grave good) and ornamentation. As discussed above, the Baggett Branch (41DL149) and Cobb Pool (41DL148) sites date to this period, and indicate the development of horticulture. Generally, this period was marked by a climate similar to today, with some periods of forest thinning. In general, ceramics first appear in the eastern part of the Gulf Coastal Plain and later in the western part (the:SSC project area). Along the Brazos River, and possibly in the SSC area, pottery was never very abundant. Clay, grog, and bone tempered pottery appears first (most likely affiliated with the Caddoan culture), with the possible exception of the shell tempered pottery (pre-Caddo?) found in the bottom of the Wylie Focus pit at the n Richland Creek (Bruseth and Martin 1987). Later, the Noconf Plain (a Plains Village manifestation), a shell tempered ware, appears. Both pottery technologies have been noted, although in low amounts, in local collections of avocational archaeologists. The adoption of the bow and arrow is believed to be indicated by the appearance of small projectile points made on flakes. These appear initially between ca, A.D. 500 and A.D. 700 (McGregor and Bruseth 1987:183). However, in some areas of North America, the dart and spear thrower were still being used by historic times (Dickson 1985:8-9). Arrow points with strongly expanded stems such as Scallorn, Colbert, Agee, and Homan are the earliest in North Central Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988:352-353). Those are succeeded by forms with slightly expanded or rectangular stems and on some specimens elaborations of the blade, such as Alba, Hayes, Bonham, Friley, Catahoula, and Steiner, thought to date ca. A.D. 800-900 to A.D. 1200 (Story 1990:267). Around A.D. 1200, the Perdiz type spreads over much of Texas from Mexico to the Sabine River, to just south of the Red River. During this period bison hunting and trading of bison products also increased, and the Perdiz point may correlate with this shift in subsistence. Perdiz points have been identified in local collections of avocational archaeologists. Triangular and side-notched arrow points (Reed, Washita, and Fresno) occur latest in the prehistoric tecord and are found along and north of the Red River. Unnotched triangular points (cf. Fresno) have been found from Norteno focus sites along the woodland margin (Duffield and Jelks 1961:71) and the historic Mayhey site (Girard 1982) in Lake Nacogdoches. During the early Historic Period, metal arrow points and guns replace stone-tipped arrows. Also, among Native Americans trade goods such as beads, silver ornaments, kettles, knives and other items appear. However, there has been little archaeological work conducted on this period, and the general rate of material culture assimilation has yet to be examined. Certain traits, such as the manufacture of traditional 5-12 NN i] oer

pottery and personal ornamentation appear to have been maintained by Native Americans of the Historic Period, which generally lasts to the 1830s and 1840s in North Central Texas. Although French and Spanish trade outposts were present in parts of Texas, there is little indication of this presence in the project area. Unless evidence to the contrary is obtained, the material culture of this period will not be discussed here, During the frontier and post frontier settlement period (Mexican colonial Texas Republic, and State of Texas) from the 1820s to the 1850s, many Native American material culture assemblages resemble those of Anglo-American settlers. Houses were generally horizontal log or mortise and tenon frame, single room structures with stone or mudcat chimneys. Transitional pearlwares and ironstones with hand painted geometric and floral designs are present. Handblown bottle glass, bone and Shell buttons, and gunflints were temporal diagnostic artifacts of this period. Following the Civil War, major shifts are noted in artifact assemblages. Decorated ceramics are rare in tural farmstead assemblages. Prior to 1870 cut nails were iron, and after 1870 they were made from steel. There was a regionwide shift to drawn wire steel nails around 1900. Several varieties of handmade brick were present, but around 1870-1880, mechanized process and higher firing temperatures were used. Fully modern bricks were manufactured in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Hand finished bottle necks, the snap case bottle form, and improved pontils were diagnostic of the 1870-1890 period. With the advent of the railroad in the 1860s - 1870s, goods imported from eastern U.S. markets increased in volume and variety on tural farmsteads. By 1900 steam cotton gins and sawmills were well established in Ellis County. In 1877, 13 steel bridges had been installed, and by 1900 the rural road system had been significantly improved. Historic and Settlement Subsistence Political and economical factors are addressed in historic settlement patterns and subsistence practices under Research Questions 9, 10, 13, 14, and 17. These factors are also related to the archival record, in that much that has been recorded is dependent on prevailing social attitudes of the period. This factor is also examined under Research Question 16, which examines the mental maps (or templates) of long-term residents of the area. The County Farm System reflects the prevailing political attitude toward destitute persons and was inherited from English Common Law. This system underwent major changes, but lasted nearly a century in Ellis County, and informant information (16) is related to understanding the history and value of this system of political economy. The historic settlement of Ellis County has been best documented through the distribution of the Public Domain. This process began near the end of the Mexican Colonial period (1833 - 1835) when many Anglo-American land entrepreneurs in Coahuila orchestrated the first land surveys in the county. Part of the East Campus and a penetration shaft fall in the Rafael de la Pena grant, which was assigned to and surveyed by his attorney, Nathaniel Hawthorne. Subsequently, Public Domain in Ellis County was divided by the Robertson Land District, Texas General Land Office, Peters' Colony, Mercer's Colony, and Ellis County Land District. 5-13

Animal husbandry and subsistence agriculture were the initial subsistence strategies employed in Ellis County. Grazing land was the principal resource and one that could be exploited with a minimal expenditure of energy. Also, until settlement centers and markets had been established and transportation routes improved, there was no cash outlet for crops. Therefore, animal husbandry was a principal pursuit during the initial historic period. The advent of the railroad radically changed settlement and subsistence pursuits. Land script was offered to railroads in compensation for laying tracks, in the early 1860s, and between 1866 and 1871 the first spur was completed. Other routes were added in 1879, 1882, 1885, 1890, and 1902. This period marks the shift from husbandry and subsistence agriculture to cotton farming and a cash economy. Imported pine lumber allowed the emergence of entirely new architectural styles. Farmsteads were started in many areas that had been taken out of Public Domain, several decades earlier, but which had never been settled. In the 1870s many unclaimed parcels of the Public Domain were settled and improved by resident yeoman agriculturalists. Also the first forms of tenancy evolved, particularly with the abolition of slavery and the eradication of the plantation system following the Civil War. . Marriage patterns noted in the early land records indicate a coordinated interaction among land entrepreneurs. For instance, Jefferson Madison Dunaway, a surveyor and chain carrier, married Sarah Brack, the daughter of an entrepreneur (E. M. Brack). E. M. Brack married Lucy P. Sims, the sister of Nicholas P. Sims. These early and other alliances led to the formation of rural communities such as Boz. In 1883, Ellis County formed the County Work Farm, through the vision and efforts of Oscar Dunlap. Dunlap sold all the land which comprised the County Farm. Initially he was the son of a slaveholder, and had worked his own plantation in Ellis County in the 1860s. Records kept by Dunlap and the Ellis County Commissioners Court indicate that indigent and mentally or physically deficient people were kept at the farm. Also prisoners from the county jail provided the most stressful physical labor. This County Farm was maintained through the Depression, when the Federal Government initiated a new system of social welfare. Ellis County still maintained its farm, particularly through the use of county jail inmates until 1964. Since then the Jand has been leased to several local farmers. TREATMENT GOALS AND PRIORITIES The preferred approach and optimum treatment of important historical, archaeological, and cultural resources is to preserve and protect them in place. This treatment should be considered early within the management and planning process. Unfortunately, this option is not practical or affordable in most cases and other treatment options must be developed and implemented. Preservation may be achieved by several methods, such as by redesigning project engineering to avoid potential destruction or protecting cultural properties from the effects of construction activities. If all of these or alternative measures cannot be effectively implemented, then a research effort should be carried out, in consultation with the SHPO, 5-14 = 5 a) ——s = 4 at (ed)

( 7 J a ACHP, avocational archaeologists and historians, and professional societies such as the Texas Archaeological Society, and other interested parties. A series of questions (Perttula 1990) should be considered to reach a decision about preservation, avoidance, or data recovery: (1) Will in situ preservation actually protect a site, or will it be exposed to vandalism by publicity (intentional and unintentional) or continue to be destroyed by weathering and erosion or by other natural processes? (2) Will the data recovery program (excavation or recordation) provide information sufficient to answer or address important research questions about local, regional, or national history or prehistory? (3) Will the costs of preservation and maintenance be commensurate to the costs and work effort mandated by data recovery and/or recordation? (4) Can the property or cultural resource provide information or benefits beyond archaeological research e ] value and data potential? For example, does the site/property have educational or interpretive potential, is it an integral component of a historic landscape, are there traditional religious or cultural values to the community or descendants? (5) If research is the only option, can the information contained in the site or property be recovered and preserved with state-of-the-art recovery techniques? No single approach or design is guaranteed to be effective, and management objectives require the cooperation of local parties, county and state officials, and national reviewers. Education is a primary concer and any treatment options should take into account opportunities to elucidate local history and to promoted education. Interpretive exhibits, living museums, public lectures, seminars, and workshops provide mechanisms by which the destruction of historic and archaeological resources can be alleviated or mitigated. An important cultural resources theme, extremely appropriate for the SSC project, would be “from the past to the future." METHODOLOGY The archaeological survey required by contract ESC-98201 with Universities Research Association, Inc. (URA) was undertaken by Archaeology Research Program (ARP) of Southern Methodist University (SMU). The initial proposal was for the pedestrian reconnaissance of fee-simple purchase areas (approximately 6000 acres) and a 600 ft corridor around the footprint (or ring). At the time of contract signing there was not an official footprint, and these estimates were made on the basis of preliminary scoping and release of public information. 5-15

In November 1989, work was requested to commence on the central core of the West Campus, for which land access had been granted, except for approximately 800 acres, for which access had been denied. Access has not yet (October 11, 1990) been granted for this property. Also at this time, geotechnical assistance was requested for a yet-to-be-determined number of borings, and for the ca. 500 acre County Farm, which at that time was under consideration for the location of the Magnet Development Laboratory (MDL). The methodology to be followed met, and in some cases exceeded, the methods stipulated by the Secretary of the Interior Standards and Guidelines for reconnaissance level investigations (Federal Register 1983:44722). Additional guidelines were developed in consultation with members of the Texas State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) in Austin, Texas, and members of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, E, G, and G, Inc. (EG&G), specifically for use on the geotechnical surveys (see Appendix A). . The scope of work for the archaeological survey was developed with several management considerations. First, all land was still in private ownership, and due to the possibility of crop damage, subsurface excavations, and artifact collections were not permitted in all cases. This was at the request of the Texas Natural Resources Laboratory Commission (TNRLC) who was responsible for making landowner contracts, acquiring access, and undertaking the sensitive process of land acquisition. Therefore, the 1989-1990 SSC archaeological survey was conducted to identify resources and to make recommendations for further work at the time when the pedestrian reconnaissance was not sufficient to determine National Register eligibility. The methodology employed included pedestrian reconnaissance; augering or shovel testing in disturbed landscapes with dense ground cover; examination, collection, and radiocarbon dating of deep cores from geotechnical boring; broad historical background research; and site specific informant and deed/title searches. Field Survey The field survey was conducted by a crew which consisted of a supervisor and at least three assistants. _ Ground conditions were monitored to avoid fields with standing crops and to select optimal field conditions, when possible, such as recently plowed areas, especially after a rain. It is fortunate that the survey was protracted over 9 months, which allowed site revisitation under a variety of ground conditions. The logistical problems encountered centered primarily on the rate of land access, which had to be coordinated with geotechnical investigations. However, there was a secondary benefit, since the ground in some areas could be surveyed during the winter, prior to planting in the spring, and following harvest in the summer. In the winter, pastures were very sparse with up to 50% or more ground exposure. Cultivated fields were selected after optimal conditions had been reached (i. e., plowed and rained upon). All boundaries of tracts that were surveyed were recorded on a daily basis, and the ground cover and field circumstances were recorded on project maps and field notes. The survey methods, the extent of coverage, and specific observations were recorded for each tract. All creek bank exposures were walked and banks were cut back to observe fresh soil profiles. 5-16 —= — —

(—) q J teh The field crew covered each tract in a systematic fashion, using a skirmish line and transect approach. Crew members were spaced 20 meters apart, and once a transect was completed across a specific tract, the crew was realigned at 20 meters, and the procedure was repeated. When ground visibility was poor (less than 20%) or when undisturbed soils could be defined by the lack of plow lines, terracing, or field deflation, shovel tests (30 x 30 x 35 cm) were conducted, if the landowner did not object, and if it did not damage crops. Shovel tests were not excavated in the yards of occupied dwellings. Fieldwork did not involve testing level excavations as specifically noted in RFPWS89-2. Site boundaries were defined by the distribution of surface features and structures and artifact scatters. Standing structures and distinctive features such as stream cut banks, erosional gullies, sheet erosion, and temporally diagnostic artifacts were photographed with black and white, and color film. Artifacts were not collected and _ were not placed out of context beyond a 5 m radius, in order to preserve the integrity of the deposit as much as possible, Sites were evaluated with the limited fieldwork and were regarded as obviously not significant (low priority), possibly eligible for the National Register (high priority), or status unknown (medium priority). All sites with standing structures were classified as high or medium priority since this was taken as evidence that the landscape was intact and further evaluations, including artifact collection and subsurface testing were necessary to properly evaluate age and site integrity. Structures or sites which were obviously less than 50 years old were classified as low priority. Prehistoric sites which had been intensively plowed were not necessarily classified as low priority (destroyed), since comprehensive surface collections and subsurface collections were necessary to evaluate their potential National Register eligibility or potential research value. All visible erosional cuts, vehicular ruts, and soil profiles were cut back and examined when available to determine site/soil depths. The use of shovel tests in archaeological research is primarily used for site discovery, not sampling. There is currently a dispute as to the effectiveness of shovel testing, with one perspective calling it the most effective discovery technique now available (Lightfoot 1989:413); and the other which discredits the method and calls for discard (Shott 1989:396). To find (87% chance) of small size (ca. five meters in diameter with 2 artifacts/m2) it would be necessary to excavate 1 x 1 m shovel tests at 4.3 m intervals on an hexagonal grid (Kintigh 1988:706). Such an intensive investment of labor is not feasible at the reconnaissance level, since costs would be exorbitant. Shovel tests are not normally used when freshly plowed fields can be examined (Scheele 1990:6) and for the SSC project area, approximately 80% of the landscape was freshly (within 3 months) plowed and had been rained upon prior to the survey. Since most of the project is in upland areas which have been deflated, the surface survey risk of missing buried sites (Lightfoot 1989:415) is minimized. All gullies, stream banks, and natural and artificial cuts in upland and floodplain settings were therefore closely scrutinized to further reduce this discovery bias. Each site discovered had a Texas (Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory - TARL) site form filled out during field survey. The artifacts which were observed were noted and described, and their locations were shown on field sketches, and/or USGS quadrangle maps. 5-17

The above field methods were applied to the advance clearing of geotechnical borings, but with slight variations. If cultural resources were encountered, all ground disturbing activities would halt and an alternate route or boring location would be investigated and clearly flagged to avoid the cultural resources. Also, properties adjacent to the access routes or borings were noted, but were not recorded in anticipation of more comprehensive recordation during the reconnaissance of fee simple purchase areas. A single geotechnical boring (BE8a) fell within a well developed floodplain, approximately 30 m south of Onion Creek. Soil cores were requested for radiocarbon dating and were delivered upon completion of the boring. Two samples, one from 3-4 ft below surface, and one from 4-5 ft below surface were submitted to the SMU radiocarbon laboratory for humate dating. The lower sample contained an abrupt boundary between a light tan upper soil with fragmentary snail shells, and a black buried soil. This buried soil was thought to be the Navarro (or Copan) paleosol, and the dating of these samples could potentially yield information on landscape formation and valley infilling. The results of the dating are discussed in Appendix A, but briefly, the results indicate that the buried paleosol, 4.7 to 5.0 ft, is modern, with 107.4340.76% carbon (SMU 2405), indicating an influx of radioactive carbon due to nuclear bomb testing. This sample contained 2.4 grams of carbon. The sample above this (4 to 4.7 ft below surface) produced a corrected radiocarbon date of 3190480 B.P. (SMU 2416), with 1.2 grams of carbon. This apparent inversion may be explained by rapid alluviation during the modem period, with older sediments derived from uplands nearby. Thus, over 4 feet of sediments have accumulated in this portion of Onion Creek within the last 50 to 150 years. This erosion rate is due primarily to the intensive levels of cultivation and landscape denudation that have occurred in the adjacent uplands, upstream, and within the floodplain itself. It is possible, however, that the BE8a core is from a refilled channel of Onion Creek. Mechanical excavation will be necessary to define the alluvial sequence in this area, and to explore the potential for deeply buried archaeological sites. Archival Research All site forms for Ellis County on record at TARL were examined, and a file of those within the SSC project was compiled for reference purposes. In addition miscellaneous files concerning Ellis County were examined, and all small survey reports were copied and placed into the master reference file. Pertinent literature such as the Bardwell Reservoir survey and excavations (Shafer 1964, Sorrow 1966) was also reviewed. The major research reports on Richland Creek Reservoir and Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988; Jurney et al. 1988) comprise the most relevant research materials. More recent small scale surveys were also-collected and placed in this reference file (Westbury 1986, 1989; Cole 1978; Anthony and Brown 1990, etc.). Historical accounts, reports, and narratives relating to Ellis County were examined by historical consultants and ARP staff. A broad brush overview was developed. However, secondary or tertiary references are not as acceptable for site specific research as primary ones, and efforts were directed toward the compilation of a reference file directly applicable to the project area.

C3 surveys provide the first recorded information on the ownership of land and the native landscape and vegetation. All files (see Appendix B) for the campus areas and the ring itself were examined and their information was recorded on tract sheets. This provides a direct reference for each original tract and indicates relevant information about the composition of vegetation of specific properties, the potential initial settlement dates (or lack of settlement), and the history of the distribution of Public Domain in Ellis County. Another primary reference was discovered in the basement of the Ellis County Courthouse. This is a series of surveys conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1935 - 1936 for all of Ellis County. Unfortunately these files are not curated or indexed, and at some point in the past they were severely water damaged. The numbering sequence for these files suggests that over 600 files have been destroyed. Despite this, a sample of 57 tracts was collected by renting a xerox machine and copying those tracts within and adjacent to the campus areas, shaft penetrations, and footprint itself. Files were missing for an additional 54 land grants. In all, over 30 WPA files were recovered for specific project areas. These files (see Appendix B) provide information on the deed/title and ownership of each tract; the area reserved for home, garden, pasture, fields, and wasteland; and specific information on dwellings, sheds, barns, and, in some Cases, their date of construction. These records allowed us to reconstruct the rural landscape of 1936, and gave us a site specific evaluation of historical and socioeconomic information, as well as the dates of construction and/or remodeling of structures in some cases. Maps provide the primary references that are crucial to the evaluation of settlement and as aids in dating the appearance or disappearance of sites. The oldest detailed map for the project area is the 1852 map that was prepared for the Peters' Colony (on file at Texas General Land Office). The next oldest map was obtained from Ellis Associates in Waxahachie, and is a 1901 map showing roads, communities, schools, churches, bridges, and other cultural features. A soil survey map, dating ca. 1910 showed the locations of roads, churches, and the GLO survey tracts, in relation to the then-defined soil types. A postal map, curated by the Sims Library in Waxahachie, is estimated to date to ca 1915, and shows many houses along rural routes. Finally, a series of Texas Highway Maps, in the Ellis County Museum provided information from the 1940s to 1960s that was useful for indicating the possible disappearance of buildings. Minor inaccuracies were observed in many of these maps, but these could usually be reconciled by cross referencing to other documents or by archaeological evidence. Informant Information This aspect of the background research includes three aspects: (1) the search for and documentation of avocational collections; (2) interviews with longterm residents concerning historical events, past lifeways, and site specific identification of former residents of recorded site; and (3) an analysis of questionnaires mailed to all landowners within the project area. 5-19

Some landowners allowed us to examine and photograph collections and relics from sites that we have recorded. However, the greatest value was derived from collections made over twenty years by two individuals, Mr. Charles Barton of Maypearl and Mr. Edwin Lott of Waxahachie. Although these collections are not from the project area itself, they are from areas adjacent to the project (one to the east and one to the west) and provide a wealth of comparative data that can be directly applied to cultural resources within the project area. Some of these artifacts can be associated with particular sites, but the collections as a whole are relatively difficult to associate with specific sites. Mr. C. K. Chandler, of San Antonio does have collections from specific sites around Bardwell Reservoir, and has agreed to include his material in this analysis. Interviews with long term residents of the project area have great potential to elucidate local history and to provide site specific information. This will be an ongoing activity during all phases of the SSC project. An initial series of 10 interviews was conducted by Michael Harris (Ph.D.) of the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University. These interviews were focused on the Boz area, since the most extensive project development will be in this area. Finally, a series of questionnaires were mailed to landowners in the project area. These questionnaires asked general questions about the nature of each land tract and elicited information about graves, archaeological finds, old buildings, and wells. In all, 410 landowners responded as of October 1990, and these questionnaires provide data that can be used to guide archaeological research in areas that have not been surveyed and to crosscheck current survey results. 5-20 i) | nee)

Ss Ge PREHISTORIC SITE DESCRIPTIONS 6 by Gathel M. Weston, Bill R. Chada, and David H. Jurney INTRODUCTION This chapter presents site descriptions of fifteen prehistoric cultural properties. Two of these prehistoric properties are also components of historic sites (41EL58 and 41EL19). The prehistoric property types represent spatially distinct clusters of prehistoric materials as well as isolated finds and low density deposits with unknown site function. Table 6-1 lists some of the information compiled for the prehistoric properties, including the area, cultural affiliation, average percentage of ground exposure, level of documentation, and amount of erosion. The sites are classified according to a general prioritization scale, as required by contract ESC-98201. These are not National Register (NR) eligibility scales, but reflect potential research value in terms of artifact yield and the level of work necessary to evaluate the NR significance of each property. A high classification (probably eligible for the National Register) indicates that surface collection and some subsurface testing may be necessary, including mechanized trenching to investigate the possibility of alluvial or colluvial burial of the presettlement landscape. A medium priority classification (unknown eligibility) indicates that there may be limited research value or NR significance to the property, even if evaluated on a more intensive level. A low classification (definitely not eligible for the National Register) indicates that the integrity and information yield is not thought to be significant; surface collection is the only level of further investigation that would be recommended, if any at all. The potential of each medium or high priority site to provide information to the Research Questions is discussed. However, with more extensive investigations, recommended in Chapter 8, different or new Research Questions may be appropriate. “ The site descriptions are organized according to the information currently available for each. The site description and location are presented in the first paragraph. This is followed by the environmental setting which includes the information recovered from the General Land Office Surveys (see Appendix B). If the site is located in one of the WPA survey tracts, the ca. 1936 and 1937 data on land modifications such as terracing and cultivation are presented in the third paragraph. The following paragraph presents the types of investigations conducted during fieldwork. Since artifact collections were not allowed, the fieldwork is fairly limited, however several of the most promising sites were revisited under various field conditions, and almost all have been plowed. The fifth paragraph presents the cultural materials that were observed, and any spatial associations that may have been present during survey. Finally, the evaluation of the site's potential 6-1

mw H WH fs) to address specific research questions (see Chapter 5) are presented and several data collections strategies are discussed (see Chapter 8 for details). 41ELS58 (SSC-1-1) This site is principally an historic site, the Ellis County Farm. However, Uvalde veneer gravels are present over the entire 450 complex and extend even farther beyond its boundaries. A few scarce gravels have been modified by chipping in such a manner that they could not have been fractured by agricultural machinery and plowing, therefore they are attributed to prehistoric activities. As such low density remnants of human behavior, they can only be interpreted as the remains of light testing of the gravels to see if they were Suitable for tools. The site is located 120 meters south of FM 878 and 840 meters north of FM 879, on the Waxahachie USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 3,586,360; northing 707,050. The latitude is 32° 23' 48", the longitude: 96° 47' 50" and the elevation ranges from a stream at 520 ft to uplands at 570 feet above mean sea level (ft amsl). The environmental setting of this site is a broad upland adjacent to a channelized tributary to Mustang Creek, There are two soil types on this upland, Houston Black clay with 0-1% slopes and Houston Black clay with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). There is a thin but continuous veneer of Uvalde gravels across this entire landform. In its native state this was a tallgrass prairie, with possibly some trees along the stream. The Uvalde gravels could only have been exposed after some event such as a prairie fire exposed them, In 1936, the WPA surveys indicate that 4 acres were reserved for the central complex, 10 acres for the garden, 285 acres in cultivation (184 corn and oats, remainder cotton), and 28 acres in pasture. The plat map indicates that the central domicile was at the present location and there was a cluster of buildings on the tributary to Mustang Creek. There have been numerous buildings at the site, which have been torn down and replaced by modern brick and frame structures. Some of these may have been dumped as landfill along Mustang Creek. The previous construction may have buried prehistoric materials along the creek. Elsewhere the site has been under almost continuous cultivation (four to eight times a year) for the last 110 years at the least. Fieldwork conducted at this site included pedestrian reconnaissance at 20 m intervals of all 450 acres. The site had been freshly plowed and rained upon prior to survey. In addition, the cut banks of the tributary to Mustang Creek, which has been incised into bedrock, were walked at close intervals (5 m). In all, approximately 20 km of this stream were investigated. Landfills of building debris which were dumped here in the 1960s and covered with soil have been exposed by recent erosion. Shovel tests were excavated within the central building complex. In all, 52 shovel test (35 x 35 cm) were excavated and ranged in depth from 20-40 cm. No prehistoric artifacts were found in any of these tests. The final phase of fieldwork at this site consisted of the collection of broken cobbles in a controlled sample. The transect that was chosen was located west of the western field road at the site, which is within a freshly plowed border of a cotton field. 6-2

The transect was 100 m long and 5 m wide. Six broken cobbles ranging from 3 cm to 10 cm in diameter were collected. Only one exhibited multiple flake scars which indicate human modification. The type locality for the Houston Black Clay is within the County Farm (Brooks et al. 1964:64). In the description of this soil (see Chapter 2), the Uvalde pebbles are mentioned only in the A1P soil horizon, from 0-6 inches below surface. There were no other gravels mentioned, to a depth of 80 inches below surface. Thus, the Uvalde gravels appear to be only a surface veneer, with no depth. However, the erosion and landfilling along Mustang Creek may have buried a portion of the original landscape containing gravels. If so, these may answer the question of whether the gravels are culturally modified or are a result of intensive plowing. The Uvalde veneer deposit merits further work, if nothing more than to provide a representative sample of a lightly used veneer deposit far from a stream or spring that would have attracted settlement. Since it is located near the headwaters of streams it may provide useful comparative data for intensively exploited veneer deposits on lower stream courses, such as in the East Campus (Research Question 4). _ 41EL86 (SSC-5-29): Hidden Valley Site This site is simply a single chert biface,which was recovered from a deflated bedrock (Austin Chalk) exposure 1000 meters west of Arrowhead Road and 480 meters south of FM 1446. Since it was recovered in an area with absolutely no other prehistoric materials (West Campus), it was given a site number. It is located on the Boz Quadrangle map. The UTM Zone is 14, with coordinates easting 692,990; northing 3,581,180. The latitude is 32° 21' 10", the longitude is 96° 56' 57", and the elevation is 730 ft ams. This site is located on an upland slope 120 meters north of Gratehouse Branch, today called Greathouse (sic) Branch. It is in an area of sparse grasses and eroded land surfaces with ground visibility ranging from 50% to 100%. The soil type is Eddy gravelly clay loam with exposed bedrock in many areas, including the site. In its native state, this was a medium to tallgrass prairie, with possible some trees along Greathouse Branch. Fieldwork consisted of a close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. The artifact and site area were photographed (Plate 6-1) and the site was plotted on a USGS map. Due to this being an isolated find, no site map was completed. Additional survey was performed outside the project area (but within the land tract) to see if materials were adjacent to or within Greathouse Branch. Approximately 0.6 kilometer of stream bed was walked and the gravels and banks closely examined for buried cultural materials. This site consists of one bifacially worked cobble that is battered at one end. The lithic material is believed to be Edwards chert. There is little or no basis to accurately determine the cultural affiliation of the site based on the single bifacially worked cobble of Edwards chert. No other cultural material was found in the area and no other lithic materials of any sort, except for Austin chalk fragments, were observed. While this is the only prehistoric site recorded on the West Campus, it is an isolated find. Visibility in the area was good to excellent, and any other cultural materials should have been located if they had been 6-3 ca cc =) fi — Keel Ga) ee)

present. Furthermore, this is an erosional environment with no possibility of buried deposits in the immediate vicinity. This site is classified as low priority and no further work is recommended. 41EL96 (SSC-6-40): The Bull Snake Site This is a 10,000 square meter lithic scatter which is on the side slope of the Grove Creek valley. It is located 270 meters west of Ebenezer Rd., 1.96 km south of FM 878, and 560 meters north of Tammy Lane on the Palmer quadrangle map. The UTM Zone is 14, with coordinates easting 715,960; northing 3,587,490. The latitude is 32° 24' 18", longitude: 96° 42' 14", and the elevation is 460 ft amsl. This site (Figure 6-1) is located on the slope bordering the southern edge of the Grove Creek floodplain. The site Starts at the top of the slope and extends downslope. Grove Creek is located 340 meters north of the site. The vegetation consists of dense grasses and wildflowers with a soil type of Sumter clay. The Sumter clay is an eroded Regosol, formed from Marl, with no A horizon (Brooks et al. 1964:68). The soil depth ranges from 0-10 cm with no soil cover in some erosional areas. Ground exposure ranges from 30% to 50% in vegetated areas to 100% in erosional areas. It its native state this was a tallgrass prairie bordering a floodplain forest. This site is located in a land grant which was surveyed in 1858. In 1937, this was an intensively cultivated tract which had several tenant structure and barns. Fifty-five acres were terraced at that time. The importance of this information is that an intensive agricultural enterprise has been conducted for over 90 years on this landscape. This intense cultivation has contributed to the erosion at the site. Fieldwork consisted of a 5 meter close interval survey, mapping of erosional features, and documenting surface artifacts. The sidewalls of gullies were examined for soil development and buried cultural remains. All sediments were derived from the Taylor Marl formation that underlies this area. There is a possibility of buried deposits at the base of the slope. In addition, flood channels and the course of Grove Creek were walked and closely examined for buried cultural materials or secondary lag deposits. In all, approximately 2 kilometers were covered along Grove Creek, and its flood channels. The original size of the site may have been smaller than 10,000 square meters. Most of the material was found in the upper portion of a wide, shallow gully (Plate 6-2) that starts at the top of the slope edge. An Ogailala quartzite biface, a chert bifacial thinning flake, 5 quartzite flakes, and 3 chert flakes were found. Some of the chert was tentatively identified as a variety of chert from the Western Cross Timbers area. No features were observed, No diagnostic artifacts were observed, so no age estimate is possible. This site has suffered from severe erosion, plowing, and cattle activity. While site integrity is believed to be low, it is given a high priority classification, since the site is located in a fee-simple purchase area, and it contains lithic debris which may provide information about the use of local and non-local lithic resources (Research Question 4). Surface collection and testing along the base of the slope are necessary to determine the potential information yield and if buried deposits are present at the edge of the floodplain. 6-4 e | a a => & | — (aa)

Both local Ogallala quartzite and non-local cherts (bifacial thinning flakes) were noted at this site, indicating the possibility of recovery of data pertaining to Research Question 4. 41EL97 (SSC-6-41): The Mulberry Overlook Site This is a light lithic scatter which has been exposed in two erosional areas, It is located 300 meters east of Ebenezer Rd.,1.13 km south of FM 878 on the Palmer quadrangle. The UTM Zone is 14, with coordinates easting: 716,160, northing: 3,588,360. The latitude is 32° 24' 47", the longitude is 96° 42' 05", and the elevation is 450 ft amsl. This site consists of two exposed lithic scatters approximately 100 meters apart (Figure 6-2), covering a total of 6000 square meters. One scatter is on the eastern point of the low tidge while the other is on the northern face, with the greatest density of objects located at the top of the slope. Both areas were exposed by erosion with 60-100% ground exposure. Uneroded grass pasture (Plate 6- 3) separates the two areas, with 50% ground exposure. This site is located on a low ridge that projects onto the floodplain of Bone Branch and Grove Creek. Bone Branch is 100 meters to the north and Grove Creek is 450 meters to the south, with the confluence of these two water courses located 1100 meters to the east. The area is a grass pasture with 50-60% exposure. The soil type is Houston Black clay adjacent to Sumter clay with a depth of 0 to 20 cm. There is no A horizon present. This site is located in a tract on Grove Creek which was surveyed in 1858. Both upland prairies and bottomland forest were noted, with dispersed cottonwood, elm, ash, and willow in low-lying areas. These trees were scattered, with a substantial understory of grasses. In 1937, this was an intensively cultivated farm which was operated by tenants growing cotton. Fifty- five acres were terraced at that time. This intensive agricultural enterprise was conducted for over 90 years on this landscape, both altering the deposit as well as exposing it through erosion. Fieldwork conducted at the site included of a close 5 meter interval pedestrian reconnaissance. The cut bank of the slope adjacent to Bone Branch (100 meters north) was examined for buried cultural remains and soil horizons. Also, the entire course of Bone Branch through the East Campus was walked and the cut banks and lag sediments were closely examined for cultural materials. In all, over 2 kilometers along Bone Branch were covered. A single shovel test (35 x 35 x 35 cm) was excavated on the point of the ridge between the two erosional areas where flakes were observed. The soil was a homogenous dark clay with fragments of snail shells. No artifacts were present. Since this site is on an upland promontory, it is in a non-aggrading setting, and the area has been plowed in the past. However, there is a potential for subsurface features or horizontal separation of archaeological components. Material observed consisted of 5 quartzite and 3 chert flakes, 4 "tested" quartzite cobbles, several pieces of fire cracked rock, and a bifacial thinning flake. The chert on this site is similar to that found on 41EL96. No features were observed, and no diagnostic artifacts were located. This site has been impacted by erosion, cattle activity, and, in all likelihood, by plowing, indicated by upland terracing. However, the impacts do not appear to have been as severe as in other portions of the John 6-5 —— | _] =z

= a i ‘Crane Survey. Portions of this site may remain intact on the ridge top or may be buried along the toe slope. This site is classified as a high priority. Surface collection and testing along the slope base are recommended. If subsurface features are present or buried deposits are located, the archaeological remains could potentially be used to address Research Questions 4, 6, and 7. 41EL98 (SSC-6-42): The Strathissa Point Site This site is a 6000 square meter lithic scatter, which may have been used as a temporary camp, since broken tools were present. It is located 1.36 km. east of Ebenezer Rd., 2.25 km north of FM 879, and 300 meters south of Tammy Lane on the Palmer quadrangle. The UTM zone is 14, with coordinates easting 717,650; northing 3,586,530. The latitude is 32° 23° 46", the longitude 96° 41' 10", and the elevation is 450 ft ams. The Strathissa Point site is located on an upland point that projects onto the Cottonwood Creek floodplain, with the creek 16U meters to the south. The site is in a terraced and plowed field currently planted in corn with 100% ground exposure. The slopes bordering this cornfield have a heavy growth of grasses, weeds, and wildflowers, and have been buried by sediments from the top of the ridge. The soil type is Houston Black Clay with a depth of 30 cm. Dispersed Uvalde gravels mantle the landscape. Site 41EL98 is located in the John Burnett Survey which was surveyed in 1859. At that time, the vegetation was entirely prairie, except for distant cottonwoods at the south corner. When this land tract was inventoried by the WPA, it was on the Ackley farm, which was in total cultivation. In 1937, 40 acres, probably including site 41EL98, based on its position on the landform, were terraced. This indicates that there has been continual cultivation of this site for at least 100 years. Fieldwork consisted of close interval (2 meter) surveys. The distributions of artifacts were mapped and distinctive artifacts were photographed. The course of Cottonwood Creek was walked and cut banks and sediments were closely examined for buried or eroded artifacts. In all, over 2 kilometers of Cottonwood Creek were covered. This site was revisited six months after the first visit, after plowing. The distribution of cultural materials was still noted, but was lighter than before, since there had been no rain to sieve the artifacts. This site (Figure 6-3) consists of a relatively light scatter of cultural materials with the greatest density at the top edge of the slope. Approximately 20 quartzite flakes and 10 chert cortical flakes were observed during the first visit. Two quartzite biface fragments and a dart fragment made of dark pray chert were also observed. No good diagnostic artifacts were found. The dart point is too fragmented for identification, but it may date to the Archaic Period. The fact that broken points and biface fragments were present suggests that this site may be more than just a simple chipping area. Chert on this site is different than the material observed on sites 41EL96 and 41EL97, but similar to chert observed on 41EL119, located approximately 3.7 km to the south. No features were observed at this site. During the second visit, only three Ogallala flakes and two chert flakes were noted in the densest area of debris. 6-6

nme Hee He He HHH Hm EF la __ This site has been extensively plowed for over 100 years, with portions possibly extending downslope. Current plans call for the southwest IR area of the East Campus to be constructed at this location, potentially destroying this site. Since a substantial number of artifacts and definable tool categories were recorded, this site could potentially yield an artifact assemblage that could address Research Questions 2, 3, and 4. The effects of agriculture on site preservation (Research Question 6) can also be examined. Surface collections can be a cost-effective method of examining the artifact content, and some testing excavations are necessary to determine the subsurface content of the site. At present this appears to be a low density single component camp site. It is located on a prominent landform with a broad vista, and may have served in the monitoring of game movements or the interactions between human groups. Mechanical excavations at the slope base are necessary to determine if buried deposits are present. This site is classified as high priority, especially since it may be completely destroyed. 41EL99 (SSC-6-43): The Red Oak Hope Site This is a small lithic site, approximately 500 square meters which is on the southern slope of the Red Oak Creek valley. It is located 950 meters north of FM 878 and 2 km west of FM 813 on the Palmer quadrangle. The UTM zone is 14, with coordinates easting 715,940 and northing 3,590,420. The latitude is 32° 25' 54" and the longitude is 96° 42' 12", with an elevation of 500 ft amsl. This upland site is located at the top of the slope bordering the southern edge of the floodplain of Red Oak Creek. Red Oak Creek is 280 meters to the north. This area is grass pasture (20% to 50% ground exposure) with small trees and brush scattered on the slopes and floodplain. The soil type at the site is Houston Black Clay on the level upland and Sumter clay on the slope. Soil depth is 20 to 30 cm with soil build-up along fences indicating previous cultivation. In 1834 the northeast comer of the vast Pena Survey fell in prairie. When it was surveyed for Bullock in 1842, only prairie was noted, with elm and cottonwood observed in the northeast comer in a low-lying area. The WPA inventory, taken in 1937, indicates a sizeable farming operation, belonging to the Samuel Harper Estate dating to 1885 (ECDB 41:358). This was an intensive agricultural operation which promoted much of the gully erosion in the area. What is important to the integrity of prehistoric site 41EL99 is that intensive agriculture has been conducted in this area for at least 110 years. However, some cultural materials at the base of the slope and within the floodplain may have been buried by the eroded sediments from the uplands. Fieldwork consisted of a close interval (2 meter) pedestrian reconnaissance of the site. Two quartzite flakes and a quartzite core were found in a 500 square meter area (Figure 6-4). While this is a light concentration, it was recorded as a site due to both its proximity to Red Oak Creek's floodplain and the poor visibility in the area. Grass cover is heavy at the base of the slope and there is little erosion currently present in the immediate vicinity. No features were observed. The banks of Red Oak Creek were closely 6-7

_ 4 examined and the bed was walked to see if buried or eroded cultural materials may be present. In all, 1 kilometer of stream channel was covered adjacent to this site. This site has most likely been disturbed by plowing but is not currently being disturbed by erosion. Cattle activity in the area appears to be light. The construction of a tunnel access in this area may completely destroy this site. This site appears to be low density; however, buried deposits may be present, and the site is classified as medium priority. The site could potentially address Research Questions 1, 2, 3, and 4, and if buried deposits are present, Research Question 6. Further evaluations are recommended to determine if more substantial deposits are present. 41EL106 (SSC-7-49): The Odd Shot Site This site is a light lithic scatter which is located 300 meters north of FM 879 and 140 meters east of an abandoned road. The abandoned road runs north from FM 879 and is 780 meters east of the junction of FM 879 and FM 1722 and 3.55 km west of I 45. The UTM zone is 14, with coordinates easting 718,060 and northing 3,584,600. The latitude is 32° 22' 44" and the longitude is 96° 40° 55", with an elevation of 460 ft amsl. This site is located on a slight rise between two old drainage channels. The area is upland slope with an intermittent stream located 120 meters downslope to the east. This stream drains into Cottonwood Creek, located 1.8 km to the north. The area cover is thin grasses and wildflowers with extensive erosional exposures. Soil type is Houston clay with a soil depth of 20 cm. Soil depths lower on the slopes were noted to be greater, with depths up to 2 meters or more observed. This deep accumulation may be due to cultivated upland fields. Historic material, commercial brick, metal, and bottle glass buried up to 50 cm below the current ground surface further indicates that these deep deposits are a recent occurrence and that prehistoric materials that could be intact are deeply buried. Mechanical excavations are the only feasible method of exploring this possibility. This site is located within the Demetrius Hays Survey, which was laid out in 1861. At that time the vegetation was primarily prairie with dispersed mesquite and hackberry in the uplands and cottonwood and hackberry in low-lying areas. In 1937 the WPA inventory indicates that this survey was divided into 12 tracts. All were heavily cultivated with erosion and terracing present. Fieldwork consisted of a close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. The disturbances to the site were mapped and the site limits defined. Since there is a broadly dispersed veneer of gravels on this landform (Plate 6-4), evidence of cultural activities may extend further than observed from surface evidence alone. The gullies were closely examined for soil profiles and artifacts, and approximately 2 kilometers of the intermittent stream to the east were walked and were closely examined for buried cultural materials. This site consists of a 2500 square meter lithic scatter (Figure 6-5). Artifacts observed were quartzite cores, tested cobbles, flakes, an expended core or rough biface, and possible hammerstones, totaling 6-8

approximately 50 artifacts. There were also several unbroken quartzite cobbles and pebbles observed. No diagnostic artifacts were noted. This site is a possible chipping area where the Uvalde gravels were exploited. Agricultural activities may also have produced some of the breakage and chipping noted on the Ogallala gravels. Deposits of quartzite gravels have a discontinuous distribution in this area and represent the only local lithic resource. This site, along with 41EL108, 41EL114, and 41EL119, offers the opportunity to investigate the exploitation of lithic resources by the aboriginal inhabitants of the project area. This site appears to have low integrity, especially since it is located on a non-aggrading landform. Plowing, cattle activity, and erosion have all impacted this site. The WPA survey for this area reports that the area was severely eroded in the late 1930s and was in need of agricultural terracing. Due to these impacts, this site is classified as medium priority. However, the veneer gravels could provide information relevant to Research Question 4. A surface collection, and possible point plot mapping of the cultural materials are recommended to develop a sample of the types of lithic material available and nature of cultural versus mechanical modification. 41EL108 (SSC-7-51):The Second Chance Site This site is a light lithic scatter which is located 870 meters north of FM 879 and 20 meters east of an abandoned road on the Palmer quadrangle. The abandoned road is 780 meters east of the junction of FM 879 and FM 1722, and runs north from FM 879. The UTM zone is 14 with coordinates easting 717,970 and northing 3,585,120. The latitude is 32° 23' 01" and the longitude is 96° 41' 00" with an elevation of 470 ft amsl. This site is similar to 41EL106 in that it is located on a slight rise between two old drainage channels (Figure 6-6). The area is upland slope with a intermittent stream located 200 meters downslope to the east. This stream drains into Cottonwood Creek, located 1.2 km to the north. The area is vegetated with thin grasses and wildflowers (80% ground exposure) and has extensive erosional areas (100% ground exposure). The soil type is Houston clay with a depth of 20 cm. The 1961 aerials indicate extreme gullying in this area (Brooks et al. 1964). Today, the hill slope has been leveled and terraced, with a sparse cover of grasses. The landform is being re-eroded, with a system of incipient gullies starting from the upper edge of the slope. Fieldwork consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. Cattle trails which were incised 20 cm into the soil along the slope, were cut back at 20 m intervals to expose soil profiles, but all were culturally sterile and no A horizon soil was present. In addition, approximately 2 kilometers of the stream were walked, and the cut banks were closely examined for buried cultural materials. This site is smaller than 41EL106, covering 1000 square meters (Figure 6-6). It is basically a light lithic scatter (Plate 6-5), with both quartzite and chert flakes, one crudely retouched chert cortical flake, and a possibly heat-treated quartzite flake. A total of ten artifacts were noted. No features were observed. Although veneer gravels cover a broad area, only a few artifacts were observed and the gravels were highly dispersed, 6-9

compared to the veneer gravels at 41EL58. Since the site boundaries were ambiguous, the site was plotted on the USGS map based on landform geometry. This site has been disturbed by plowing, erosion, and cattle activity. Integrity is low. This site is possibly a chipping area where the Uvalde gravels were exploited and could potentially offer the opportunity to investigate the exploitation of lithic resources by the aboriginal inhabitants of the project area (Research Question 4). However, this site is classified as low priority due to its low density and low integrity. 41EL110 (SSC-7-53): Bill's Arroyo Site This site consists of redeposited prehistoric and historic artifact in the bottom of a gully. The sidewall of the gully contained a single quartzite flake at 1.5 m below the ground surface. The site is located 1 km north of FM 879, 240 meters east of an abandoned road, and 780 meters east of the junction between FM 879 and FM 1722 on the Palmer quadrangle. The road runs north from FM 879. The UTM zone 1s 14, with coordinates easting 718,150 and northing 3,585,280. The latitude is 32° 23' 05", the longitude is 96° 40° 57", and the elevation is 440 ft amsl. This site is located in an actively eroding gully covering approximately 500 square meters. This gully is at the base of an upland slope that borders an intermittent stream draining into Cottonwood Creek. At its greatest depth this gully is over 2 meters in depth and is over 50 meters long. The vegetation in the surrounding area is grass and wildflowers with none growing in the gully (100% ground exposure). A small mesquite tree is at the head of the gully (nick point) and will soon topple into the gully itself. Soil is Houston clay with a depth to 1.5 meters or more. This site is located within the Demetrius Hays Survey, which was laid out in 1861. At that time the vegetation was primarily prairie with dispersed mesquite and hackberry in the uplands and cottonwood and hackberry in low-lying areas. In 1937 the WPA inventory indicates that this survey was divided into 12 tracts. All were heavily cultivated, with erosion and terracing present. Due to the depth and width of the gully (2 to 5 meters), this area was surveyed with two people in the gully itself, surveying the gully floor and sidewalls, while two additional crew members surveyed on either side of the gully. The surrounding area was given a close interval (5 meters) pedestrian survey (Figure 6-7). No historic or prehistoric material was found outside of the gully. The gully has exposed only a small area of the site, which may be deeply buried. A soil column was cut back, revealing 25 cm of a dark A horizon over 1.3 m of yellow clay with calcium carbonate concretions. All of this gully (SO meters) was closely examined, and the intermittent stream was walked in its entirety to see if buried or eroded cultural materials were present, In all, approximately 2 kilometers of stream bank exposures were covered. In addition, a bucket auger was used to core the sediments adjacent to the gully. Due to the extremely hard clay, only 25 cm of the A horizon could be sampled. This gully has a large quantity of nineteenth and twentieth century trash in it, along with quartzite cobbles, shatter, possible cores, and a third molar of a herbivore, all located on the floor of the gully. 6-10 £ ew) CS ==) grins = ca ss es

Approximately 15 prehistoric artifacts were observed. This material was considered to be in secondary context and is not the primary concern here. What is of concern is a single chert bifacial thinning flake found eroding out of the sidewall of the gully (Plate 6-6). This flake was found 1.5 meters below the current ground surface. It is possible that this flake is on the presettlement landscape and was buried by erosion from upland fields. No other material was found eroding out of the gully walls. It is also possible that this artifact was buried after the severe gullies shown on the 1960 aerial (Brooks et al. 1964) were landscaped and filled. The single flake may represent a buried site at this location. Other material found on the gully floor shows that this vicinity was utilized during an undefined span of the prehistoric period. If so, this site offers the only possibility of finding a relatively undisturbed prehistoric site in this area. This is classified as a high priority site. Testing is recommended which includes mechanical trenching and screening of soil columns. If it can be determined that intact deposits are present, this site could address Research Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. It is possible that Research Question 5 can be addressed as well, since a bovid molar was recovered. However, this may be from recent cattle. 41EL113 (SSC-7-56): The Cottonwood Overlook Site This is a very light lithic scatter which is located 1.6 km north of FM 879, and 240 m west of an abandoned road on the Palmer quadrangle. The abandoned road is 780 meters east of the junction between FM 879 and FM 1722, and runs to the north at that point. The UTM zone is 14 with coordinates easting 716,660 and northing 3,585,850. The latitude is 32° 23' 25", the longitude is 96° 41' 10", and the elevation is 460 ft amsl. This site is located at the upland edge of the slope bordering the Cottonwood Creek floodplain. An intermittent stream is 120 meters to the west, and Cottonwood Creek is 400 meters to the north. The area is planted in Johnson grass and has Belladonna growing throughout the area. The soil type is Houston clay with a depth of 20 cm. A thin veneer of gravels is present, with ground exposure ranging from 50% to 80%. This was a tallgrass prairie in its native state. Fieldwork conducted at the site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian reconnaissance. Since there are very few artifacts, the veneer was mapped on the USGS map. A site sketch map (Figure 6-8) was produced on the basis of landform and the low density scatter of veneer gravels and flakes. A 830 meter section of Cottonwood Creek adjacent to this site was surveyed. The cut banks and channel lag sediments were Closely examined for buried or eroded cultural materials, This site is a light, 3000 square meter scatter of possible expended quartzite cores and hammerstones (Plate 6-7), about 15 items in all. These also may have been produced during plowing or brushhogging of the site. Further work on the cultural modification of items, compared to mechanical breakage will be necessary to determine which are truly culturally modified items.

C3 flakes with good bulbs of percussion were found. A chert bifacial thinning flake was noted downslope to the north. This area has been extensively terraced in an attempt to control erosion. This terracing, plowing, and erosion have all greatly disturbed this site. The lack of temporally or functionally diagnostic artifacts detracts from the site's potential to address the Research Questions. Since there were so few items noted in a context of good surface exposures, this site is classified as low priority, and no further work is recommended. 41EL114 (SSC-7-57): The Kelso Site This is another light lithic scatter located approximately 1.6 km north of 41EL113. There are relatively more veneer gravels present than at 41EL113, but much fewer than at 41EL58. The site is located 1.14 km east of the junction between FM 879 and FM 1722, or 1.95 km east of Ebenezer Road, on the north side of FM 879 (site may continue south of FM 879 as well) on the Palmer quadrangle. The UTM zone is 14, with coordinates easting 718,290 and northing 3,584,340. The latitude is 32° 22" 34", and the longitude is 96° 40' 48", with an elevation of 470 ft amsl. The Kelso Site is located on the top of an upland slope and continues downslope toward an intermittent stream, 100 meters to the west. Vegetation is pasture and lawn grass, with ground exposure ranging from 30% to 50% with limited areas of 100% exposure. Creek bank cuts provide continuous coverage of the intermittent stream valley, There was 1.0 m of dark black clay over 2 m of olive gray clay to the base of the stream. Soil type is Houston Black clay with a depth of 20 cm. A broad, moderate density (e.g., 10 m intervals between cobbles) veneer of gravel is present. In its native state this was a tallgrass prairie with some trees such as cottonwood and mesquite along the stream. In 1861 the vegetation was primarily prairie with dispersed mesquite and hackberry in the uplands and cottonwood and hackberry in low-lying areas. In 1937 the WPA inventory indicates that this survey was divided into 12 tracts. All were heavily cultivated with erosion and terracing present. This indicates that severe alterations to the original landscape have been produced and may have eroded or protected portions of the site, based on their location on the landform. Fieldwork conducted at the site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian reconnaissance. The veneer gravel deposit was mapped on the USGS map. Since the site is so broad, this is a generalized map. The intermittent stream adjacent to the site (Figure 6-9) was walked in its entirety to see if buried or eroded cultural materials were present. In all, approximately 2 kilometers were covered. Fresh cuts were examined and cut back to see if buried soil horizons were present This site is a 15,000+ square meter lithic scatter (Plate 6-8). It consists of a moderately dense concentration of quartzite and chert flakes, cores, and tested cobbles, totaling approximately 100 items. Some of the broken cobbles could have been produced by plowing or brushhogging. Unbroken cobbles are 6-12

relatively abundant compared to 41EL113, but are much less frequent than at 41EL58. No diagnostic artifacts or features were observed. Parts of this site have been disturbed by the construction of a house and shed and landscaping around them. Other areas have been impacted by road construction, and horses have impacted other parts of the site. The entire site may have been plowed at some time in the past, and terraces are present. Even with all this disturbance, some areas of this site may still maintain good site integrity, especially if some areas along the intermittent stream were filled during construction, thereby burying cultural deposits. Mechanical excavations may be necessary to determine if this has occurred. This site has the potential for helping in the development of an understanding of the prehistoric exploitation of gravel veneer quarries (Research Question 4). Due to impacts from historic construction and agricultural practices, the site is classified as medium priority. Since the site does not appear to be in an area subject to direct construction impacts, no further work is recommended at this time. 41EL116 (SSC-7-59): The Garrett Site This site consists of two clusters of lithic material, among which several broken tools were noted. It is possible that this may have been a short term lithic procurement or tool refurbishing camp. The site is 1.1 km east of FM 1722 and 550 meters south of FM 879. The UTM zone is 14, with coordinates easting 718,340 and northing 3,583,730. The latitude is 32° 22' 19", the longitude is 96° 40' 44" and the elevation is 540 ft amsl. This upland site straddles a shallow drainage channel. It is in a heavily grazed pasture (50% to 60% ground exposure) and has a soil type of Houston clay with a soil depth of 20 cm. In areas where cattle have grazed and walked, there is 100% ground exposure. In 1854 he vegetation was primarily prairie with dispersed mesquite and elm. Ash, willow, and cottonwood were present in low-lying areas. The road from Dallas to Taos and the road from Waxahachie to Taos passed through this survey in the 1840s-1850s. The WPA files indicate that this was one of the most intensively cultivated areas within the entire project area in the 1930s. Fieldwork conducted at the site included close interval (2 meter) pedestrian reconnaissance. All diagnostic artifacts were closely examined and photographed, and a sketch map was completed. Care was taken not to significantly alter the position of artifacts on the surface. The cut banks of the drainage or gully were walked to see if cultural materials were exposed or eroded. In all, approximately 0.5 kilometers of stream exposure was covered. This site consists of two separate lithic scatters (Figure 6-10). The larger of the two, totaling about 3000 square meters, is on the southwest side of a shallow drainage channel, and the second section on the northeast side of this drainage totaling approximately 600 square meters. Artifacts observed at this site (Plate 6-9) include quartzite flakes, shatter, and cores, broken chalcedony (?) cobbles, a small (3 cm x 1.5 cm) white chert biface that has been tentatively identified as a "Granbury" (Sorrow 1966) point, a side 6-13

scraper, and a triangular gouge or scraper. A total of approximately 35 artifacts was observed. It has been speculated that this was a hide processing area, based on the gouge. No features were observed. The "Granbury" point identified at this site may be associated with the Central Texas Aspect of the Late Ceramic Period. A previously known major archaeological site, the Pecan Springs Site (41EL11), has produced a number of Granbury type points (Sorrow 1966). However, this point type is not a currently recognized variety (Turner and Hester 1985; Prikryl 1987) The Pecan Springs Site is located approximately three miles to the south of the Garrett Site. A problem with the Pecan Springs Site is that it is a multicomponent site, containing Archaic through Late Ceramic Period materials. If the Garrett Site contains only a single component, the importance of the site would be greatly enhanced. The site is classified as high priority based on the current information. This site has been plowed in the past, even though it is presently used only as pasture. The area has not been terraced, as have the fields to the west (see 41EL118) and north (see 41EL113). Erosional patterns appear to be forming incipieut gullying. Although it has been intensively cultivated and is located in a non- aggrading setting, there is some apparent clustering of cultural materials. This site has the potential to help in understanding changes in subsistence practices and exploitation of bison after 1200 A.D. (Research Question 5), assuming the hide scraper or gouge was used on bison. Also, the types of lithic material are varied and there could be a sufficient number of functionally diagnostic artifacts present to address Research Questions 1, 2, 3, and 4. The site is classified as high priority, and further investigations are recommended, 41EL118 (SSC-8-61) This is also a light lithic scatter which appears to have some clustering of materials, based on the exposed remains. The site is located 900 meters east of FM 1722, 580 meters south of FM 879, 2.7 km west of the town of Garrett, and north of the Southern Pacific Railroad line on the Ennis West quadrangle. The UTM zone is 14, with coordinates easting 718,110 and northing 3,583,700. The latitude is 32° 22' 15", the longitude is 96° 40' 55"and the elevation is 530 ft amsl. This is an upland site located on the adjacent sides of a shallow, grass-covered drainage channel. The area is a terraced grass pasture. The soil type is Houston clay with a depth of 30 cm. Ground exposure ranges from 30% to 50%. In its native state he vegetation was primarily prairie with dispersed mesquite and elm. Ash, willow, and cottonwood were present in low-lying areas. The road from Dallas to Taos and the road from Waxahachie to Taos passed through this area in the 1840s and 1850s. The WPA files indicate that this was one of the most intensively cultivated areas within the entire project area during the 1930s. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. The site was plotted on the USGS map, but due to the low density of materials, only a general site area (Figure 6-11) could be defined. 6-14 a] € ee = EC =) = = fs Ss) Ea | ad =a | Ne Cc)

This site consists of a light lithic scatter in two sections, one on either side of a shallow drainage channel (Plate 6-10). Cultural material noted included quartzite flakes, a chert bifacial thinning flake, and chert scatter. Total site size is about 10,000 square meters with a total of approximately 20 artifacts. This site has been disturbed by erosion, plowing, construction of agricultural terraces, and cattle activity. It is classified as low priority. However, since both non-local chert and local Ogallala quartzite flakes are present, a surface collection may yield information relevant to Research Question 4. 41EL119 (SSC-8-62): Dolezal Site This is an extensive lithic scatter which has at least five definable clusters of chipping debris, based on several walkovers. The site is located 1.2 km east of FM 1722 and 500 meters north of Prachyl Road. The UTM zone is 14, with coordinates easting 718,900 and northing 3,583,100. The latitude is 32° 91' 55", the longitude is 96° 40" 20", and the elevation is 500 ft amsl. This is an.upland site that extends from the top of a hill and downslope toward a small creek called Wolf Branch. The entire area has been plowed in the past and is currently planted in grass. The soil type is Houston Black clay with a depth of 50 cm. Ground exposures range from 30% to 50% with exposures of 100% along the hillside. An extremely large gravel veneer exists in this area. In its native state the vegetation was primarily prairie with dispersed mesquite and elm. Ash, willow, and cottonwood were present in low-lying areas The road from Dallas to Taos and the road from Waxahachie to Taos passed through this area in the 1840s and 1850s. The WPA files indicate that this was one of the most intensively cultivated areas within the entire project area. Fieldwork conducted at this site included a close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. The site was plotted on a USGS map, but due to its large size, the sketch map shows only general boundaries (Figure 6- 12). The apparent clusters of debitage were not mapped, awaiting more intensive and detailed maps in subsequent phases of investigation. The current landowner was interviewed, and photographs taken of this collection. Approximately 0.5 kilometer of Wolf Branch was walked to see if buried or eroded cultural materials were present. This site is an extensive lithic scatter (Plate 6-11) covering at least 20 acres. Materials that were observed included over 100 quartzite flakes, cores, and chert flakes. As noted above there was a subtle distribution pattern of lithic debitage at this site. There were at least five clusters of debris noted, separated by "dead ground". Once detailed mapping is performed, it may be possible to refine this impression of clustering. The chert that was observed is similar to chert found on site 41EL98. No prehistoric features were observed, The site area has an extensive deposit of Uvalde gravels dispersed as a broad veneer on this landform, which is still less concentrated and with smaller cobbles than at 41EL58. The current owner (Robert Mitchell) has three points that were found by the previous owner (Joe Dolezal). These points have been tentatively identified as an Early Archaic Andice point and two Gary points, giving this site a time 6-15 {| Cc) ee = 6S eS Se Bs

span from Early to Late Archaic. Mr. Mitchell has also found a large fossilized joint near Wolf Branch, raising the possibility of buried deposits in this location. This site has been plowed and terraced. Also, when the hay is harvested, a bushhog is used to cut the grass. This machine may have contributed to some of the breakage noted among the cobbles. In the area of the garden, a lawn mower and the bushhog were used to remove the plants, and extreme breakage and chipping of the cobbles were caused by these machines. Parts of the site have been used to graze cattle and the central portion has a historic farm house and yard (discussed in Chapter 7) which was occupied from the late 1890s to the present. All of these activities have impacted the site. The size and quantity of material at this site could allow the collection of an interpretable assemblage of artifacts. It is classified as a high priority site and is relevant to the study of lithic resource exploitation (Research Question 4) and changes in subsistence practices over time (Research Questions 1 and 2). Surface collections and-replicative experiments are necessary to differentiate mechanical breakage from cultural modifications.- 41EL127 (SSC-11-70) This is a light lithic scatter at the southern edge of the floodplain of Big Onion Creek. It is located 150 meters east of Feaster Road, 720 meters north of State Hwy. 34, and 3.75 km northwest of the city of Avalon. The UTM zone is 14, with coordinates easting 710,660 and northing 3,567,800. The latitude is 31° 13' 13”, the longitude is 96° 45' 50" and the elevation is 445 ft ams]. This site is at the toe of the southern slope bordering Big Onion Creek's floodplain. The entire area was planted in cotton, but the crop failed this year, leaving the area with virtually no ground cover (100% ground exposure). The soil type is Houston black clay with a soil depth of 20 cm and possibly deeper. At Big Onion Creek (see BE8a, Appendix A), up to 2 meters of soil were observed. In its native state the vegetation consisted of tallgrass prairie and floodplain forest. Fieldwork conducted at the site included a close interval (2 meter) pedestrian reconnaissance. The distribution of artifacts was mapped, and the general site area was estimated based on the associated landforms. The cut banks of Big Onion Creek and two tributaries were walked to see if buried cultural materials were present. Channel lag sediments were also examined for eroded materials. In all, approximately 2 kilometers were covered. The site was revisited three months after the first visit, following plowing. Even though the soil had not been rained upon, additional Ogallala quartzite flakes were noted in the same location, Two chert bifacial thinning flakes and a quartzite flake were discovered during the first visit in a 300 square meter area at this location (Figure 6-13). During the second visit an additional two Ogallala quartzite flakes and three unmodified cobbles were noted. The position of these items at the base of the slope bordering Big Onion Creek's floodplain (Plate 6-12) raises the possibility of a buried site at this location. No features were observed. 6-16

F] This area has been extensively plowed and a farm road is located just south of the site location, and both these factors have impacted the site. Erosion, on the other hand, has most likely buried the deposits at the base of the slope and have protected the site. Site integrity is expected to be good, if this is the case. There will be a penetration shaft (E8) in this area. Since this site is located in the southernmost project area, near Chambers Creek, this area could potentially yield information relevant to Research Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. Even though there were only ten artifacts noted, local collectors report cultural materials on the adjacent uplands. Therefore, this site is classified as high priority. Surface collection and mechanized testing, combined with screening of sediments from soil columns is recommended. 6-17

= (ae ae ae t 7 4 HISTORIC SITE DESCRIPTIONS by Gathel M. Weston, Bill R. Chada, and David H. Jurney INTRODUCTION This chapter presents site descriptions of sixty-four historic cultural properties. These represent spatially distinct clusters of historic materials as well as standing structures and features. Table 7-1 lists some of the information compiled for the historic properties, including the area, time period of occupation, average percentage of ground exposure, level of documentation, and amount of erosion. The sites are classified according to a general prioritization scale, as required by contract ESC-98201. These are not National Register (NR) eligibility scales, but reflect potential research value in terms of artifact yield and the level of work necessary to evaluate the NR significance of each property. A high classification (probably eligible for the National Register) indicates that surface collection and subsurface testing are necessary. A medium priority (unknown eligibility) classification indicates that there may be limited research value or NR significance to the property, but further evaluation, particularly archival research and site visitation, is justified. A low classification (definitely not eligible for the National Register) indicates that the integrity and information yield is not thought to be significant, and further investigation is not recommended at this time. Eight cartographic resources were used for evaluating the appearance/disappearance of historic sites. Four of these maps are Ellis County highway maps acquired from the Ellis County Museum. These four maps are dated 1941, 1955, 1959, and 1964, and show the highways and rural roads in the county along with farmsteads (no individual buildings represented), civil facilities, and industrial facilities. While the three latest editions appear to be accurate, the 1941 highway map is often inaccurate in the placement of roads and farmsteads. Three other maps predate the 1941 highway map. The first is a 1901 map of Ellis County that shows the roads and voting districts in the county at that time. This map, unfortunately, does not show the location of farmsteads or other structures. Community structures such as churches and schools, bridges, and industrial facilities such as cotton gins are shown as well. The second map is a U.S. Postal Service route map. While undated, the configuration of roads is close to the 1901 Ellis County map. It is estimated that this map dates approximately from 1915, but may be from as early as 1905. In any event, this map pre- dates the WPA survey of the 1930s and the 1941 highway map and is the oldest map currently identified that shows the location of structures in Ellis County. 7-1

The oldest map currently available is the 1852 Hedgecoxe map of the Peters’ Colony, which shows roads and some land grants. A more refined map of land grants has been compiled from original General Land Office surveys dating from 1834-1888. All GLO tracts for the survey areas were collected, and provide important baseline information about initial land ownership, and, in some cases, residence or non-residence. The final map used for each site is the most recent USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle map available for each area. These maps date to 1960 to 1963 and were updated in 1978. Additional sources of archival information include the genealogical section of the Sims Library, and the 1936-1937 tract surveys of farms done by the Works Progress Administration, which are stored in the basement of the Ellis County Courthouse. Deed records, and Commissioner's Court records on file with the Ellis County Clerk of Court were also examined. Genealogical and historical information for Boz and Oak were provided by Monnie Bratcher and Randall Tarin, among others (see Appendix C). Interviews were conducted vith landowners and long term residents to identify previous occupants of sites anu to shed light on past lifeways. The following site discussion are organized according to a generally fixed format. The principal exception is the Ellis County Farm (41EL58) which was written in January 1990, to provide advance information on the historical significance of this property which was included in the the scope of work after contract award. A set of Ellis County highway maps showing the County farm is included, and these were used for all historic sites, but all locations on these maps have not been included in this report. Also some sites were recorded from a distance due to lack of landowner access or recording after the fieldwork had been temporarily halted, not all information is presently available. The legal location and setting of each property type is presented first. This is followed by a discussion of the environmental setting. The third paragraph presents deed/title, informant, WPA survey data, and other archival information. This is followed by an explicit statement of the fieldwork which was conducted, usually including mention of multiple visits. Additional visits have been made at some properties in the immediate purchase areas by SMU, TNRLC, SSCL, THC, and other personnel. The fifth paragraph discusses the material culture and estimated age of the remains at each site. The final paragraph lists the priority and provides a preliminary evaluation of each Site. 41EL58 (SSC-1-1): Ellis County Work Farm This site is principally an historic site consisting of approximately 450 acres of farmland with a central complex (approximately 10 acres) of buildings, barns, fences, and corrals (Figure 7-1). The central compound is located 120 meters south of FM 878 and 840 meters north of FM 879 on the Waxahachie USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 3,586,360, northing 707,050. The latitude is 32° 23' 48", longitude 96° 47' 50", and elevation is 550 feet above mean sea level. 7-2

The County Farm is located on the southeast comer of the T-intersection of FM 878 and a northwest to southeast gravel road connecting FM 878 and FM 879. The site is shown on the 1901 Ellis County Map, and the 1941, 1955, 1959, and 1964 Ellis County Highway Maps (Figures 7-2, 7-3, 7-4, 7-5, 7-6). The farm is located on a relatively flat open upland area between the tributaries to Mustang Creek. Ground visibility is poor (30%) in the ten acre central complex due to tall Bermuda grass and weeds. Mesquite and other trees dot the yard and grow along the fencelines. The remainder of the farm was plowed and completely exposed (100% visibility). In 1961, agricultural terraces were constructed over the cultivated areas based on aerials that were flown on that date (Brooks et al.1964). The site currently consists of a ruined commercial brick jail (Plate 7-1), the 1937 Poor House (Plate 7-2), one small outbuilding which was probably used as a milk house (Plates 7-3 and 7-4), one large (Plates 7-5 and 7-6) and one small barn, which has been identified as a wash house (Plate 7-7). Plate 7-8 shows the layout of most of the central complex. All buildings are vacant and standing or partially ruined. The only surface artifacts noted were building rubble, commercial bricks, iron bars, and wood. The environmental setting of this site is a broad upland adjacent to a channelized tributary to Mustang Creek. There are two soil types on this upland, Houston Black clay with 0-1% slopes and Houston Black clay with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). There is a thin but continuous veneer of Uvalde gravels across this entire landform. The A horizon is from 20-40 cm thick. In its native state the vegetation consisted of tallgrass prairie. In 1936, the WPA surveys indicate that 4 acres were reserved for the central complex, 10 acres for the garden, 285 acres in cultivation (184 corn and oats, remainder cotton), and 28 acres in pasture. The central dwelling was an 80 x 100 ft brick structure built in 1921. Four frame residences (40 x 24 ft) were built in 1885, and another (32 x 18 ft), in 1912; 1 brick residence (20 x 40 ft) was used for storage, and another brick residence was used for prisoners. In addition there were 5 barns and four sheds. The plat map indicates that the central domicile was at the present location and that there was a cluster of buildings on the tributary to Mustang Creek. Informants report that this area contained the syrup mill and the "pest" house which was used for those with contagious diseases (Ray McCullough, personal communication, 1990). In all, three cemeteries have been located on various portions of the County Farm. Surface evidence is minimal, but iron pipe, stone markers, and bricks were used to mark some graves and plots. Some depressions mark the locations of collapsed coffins. The Ellis County Farm property consists of six tracts, primarily in the J.B. and Ann Adams Survey, with smaller parcels in the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railroad Company and the A. Larrison Surveys. These tracts were deeded to Ellis County on May 15, 1882; October 4, 1883; and July 3, 1885 (Ellis County Deed Book [ECDB] 326:498, 37:226, and 35:48). Since the entire 450 acre farm was considered a complete property, it was given the temporary designation SSC-1-1 (Superconducting Super Collider Project - first project week - first site). 7-3 i = | } nl

Judge Oscar Dunlap sold the land (Table 7-2) which contains the Ellis County Farm to Ellis County in transactions dating from 1882-1885. He had settled in Ellis County in the 1860s, had farmed for several decades, and was a self-taught lawyer and jurist. An autobiography (journal) written by Dunlap's servant, Ely Green (1912-1919), sheds additional light on Dunlap's association with the Ellis County Farm in the 1910s. Apparently Dunlap maintained complete records (possibly with the Commissioners Court) on the operation of the County Farm, including crop yields and deaths (Green 1970:251). Three instances were reported where black men over 65 were conscripted for not paying poll tax (Green 1970:218). Also, it was reported that minor offenses (30 days) were used to gain labor on the farm (Green 1970:234). Green (1970:254) describes a visit to the farm, mentioning a gate and stockade office. On a subsequent visit, following the death of a young white army enlistee from St. Louis, a corral was also described. At present, this is the earliest (ca. 1914) information on the original landscape of the County Farm. In 1974, Ellis County attempted to sell the farm, when it was described in several Waxahachie Daily Light articles. A commemorative cornerstone was described for the poor house which dated to 1937. This stone, set in the southeast corner of the building, has since been vandalized and stolen. A small brick structure that current informants could not identify was termed a milkhouse.

Right of Way strip contains 0.147 acres more or less A thorough review of County Death Records and Commissioners Court records provided the identities of at least 71 people at the County Farm (Table 7-3). Additional information from these records is presented in Appendix B. Deaths were first recorded in the 1890s, peaked from 1895-1898, and continued until 1946. There is a significant period from 1906 to 1915 when death records are not present. This is the period when Judge Dunlap encountered problems with the administration of the farm (Green 1970:218-251). Twenty- nine individuals who died were African-American, twenty-three were Anglo-American, and three were Hispanic Americans. The races of 16 individuals were not specified. The Report of the Superintendent issued in 1893 provides a representative sample of the crops that were produced, and the types of activities that occurred on the farm. This report is part of the Commissioners Court records on file with the Ellis County Clerk of Court (see Appendix B). Stock included 25 mules, 1 horse, 40 hogs, and 33 head of cattle. Crops included "20 acres of wheat sown, not good; 43 acres oats, good; 120 acres corn, good; 13 acres milo; 7 acres sorghum". Work included “graded 16 miles Dallas-Marfa Road (+9mi, +9mi), and fitted 17 culverts on Ennis Corsicana Road" and "paid $10 to Linda Bowman for attending sick pauper Mrs. Mary White. Paid $10 for ticket to Galveston for sick pauper Smith." A list of residents in the Commissioners Court that was dated May 10, 1898 itemized "10 paupers” and noted that "8 were discharged"; also listed were "9 lunatics and 1 deceased (John Brisben April 15, 1898)". On August 10, 1890, the list of residents noted "five lunatics, one deceased (June 29, 1889) pauper, ten paupers, and five were discharged". The report of the superintendent on November 14, 1898 stated "62 convicts discharged and 30 convicts on the farm”. The area south of the bridge on FM 878 which crosses the tributary to Mustang Creek has received extensive land modifications (Figure 7-7). In 1885, a pond (still remaining) was built here, and this is the reported location of the molasses mill and the Pest House. Also, a sandstone grave marker is present in this area, A large volume of brick, sandstone, granite, marble, and metal structural debris has been dumped as a 7-5

“a J = landfill along the creek, and up old lateral erosional gullies in this area. These deposits are now being re- eroded. At present, it is thought that this debris was derived from the two buildings that were shown on the Highway Maps (1.e. Pest House). Also, some debris may be present from the ca. 1900 - 1937+ single structure shown as the Ellis County Farm, and the buildings that were constructed in 1885. Fieldwork conducted at the site included close interval (5m) and standard interval (20 m ) survey, photodocumentation and test excavations around the standing buildings. The compound area has intact archaeological deposits dating to the 1880s. The only known impacts are from livestock activity and the removal of older structures at the site. Erosion within this area of the site is minimal. A series of 52 shovel tests were placed around the large foundation of the poor house (built in 1937) and within the central complex (see below). These shovel tests were generally 35 x 35 cm and extended to 20-40 cm below surface. The densest remains were encountered between the jail and the Poor House. Figure 7-8 illustrates the distribution of arufacts within the central compound at 41EL58. The most extensive distribution of materials was in the yard between the Poor House and jail. Subsurface features include a walk by the jail (N70 E100) and a water pipe from the jail's water tower (N70 E90). The artifact concentration (primarily architectural items) between the jail and pauper house is where at least one former structure stood. Summary of the Historical and Archaeological Significance of the Ellis County Poor Farm The Ellis County Poor Farm represents the fading elements of a working farm used to house and sustain paupers and convicts. Although the present buildings were constructed between 1936 and 1952, even they represent the county's response to post-depression and post World War Ii changes in civil responsibility for indigent people as well as county prisoners. One of the standard benefits of poor farm residence was a grave and a coffin. Records of the individuals buried throughout Texas in county farm cemeteries reflect highly variable patterns. Hundreds of individuals are indicated in some cases, while in others, graves are only marked by scattered bricks or a historical marker. One cemetery has been documented from extant maps for the Ellis County Poor Farm. Although reportedly marked with iron pipe, not a single grave can be discerned, and no markers are present. At least 71 individuals have been identified who died at and were buried within the County Farm. Causes of death included murder, suicide, senility, heart failure, Brights disease, syphilis, malaria, burning, and paralysis. A second cemetery has been located along the tributary to Mustang Creek, and adjacent to a pond which was constructed initially in 1885. The construction of 1950s buildings and landfilling along the tributary to Mustang Creek has obliterated the original landscape. A third cemetery was reported by a local informant, in a remote location along the tributary. This last cemetery had three depressions in alignment, a single iron _ pipe, and several scattered commercial bricks. 7-6

= a i ) The foundations of the original Poor Farm building (1901-1941) remain in the central compound. Foundations of two 1950s buildings and graded drive areas remain near the stock tank by the tributary to Mustang Creek. The entire tributary to the Mustang Creek valley, and old lateral gullies have dumps of barbed wire, refuse, and structural debris. Large pieces of cut sandstone, marble, and granite and vast quantities of Texas, Ferris, Palmer, Atlas, and Globe commercial bricks (twentieth century) were present in this landfill. In the 1960s the SCS sponsored agricultural terrace and erosion stabilization, which has sealed much of these post 1941 to 1960s dumps. Some areas of 1901-1941 dumping may be sealed under the current landscape of the tributary to Mustang Creek. The dumps are now being eroded, and further examination is recommended. The central complex and the tributary to Mustang Creek area of the Ellis County Poor Farm have buried archaeological deposits dating from the 1882-1885 period. Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) (1990) give this site a high priority (HHM #2826), and date it to the 1920s. This site has the potential to yield information relevant to Research Questions 16 and 17, and is classified as high priority for archaeology. Ellis County has transferred title for 300 acres, including the central complex to TNRLC, with the objective of preserving some of the history of this important site. Local historians and archaeologists are also extremely interested in recovering further information about this site. 41EL59 (SSC-1-2) This site consists of a 2000 square meter artifact scatter and a cistern (Plate 7-9) with a standing commercial brick neck. The site is located 400 meters south of FM 1446 and 350 meters east of Arrowhead Road on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. It lies in the middle of a field approximately 6 km north of Boz, and .5 km south of the former community center of Buena Vista. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 694,120, and northing 3,582,000. The latitude is 32° 21° 36", longitude 96° 56° 13", and elevation is 750 feet above mean sea level (ft amsl). This is an upland site located on a slight rise in an otherwise level farm field. An intermittent stream is located 700 meters to the east, with this stream draining into South Prong Creek 2.8 km to the northwest of the site. The area was planted in winter wheat at the time of survey with 100% ground exposure. The soil type is Eddy gravelly clay loam with a soil depth of 10 cm and many limestone cobbles are present on the ground surface. The original grantee for this land was Barksdale W. Wade, who received a 152 acre grant from Mercer's Colony on April 29, 1850. It was surveyed by Posey G. Gordon on July 26, 1856 for the Robertson Land District. This tract has been subdivided. The WPA file for this tract has apparently been destroyed. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval survey (5 meters). All features were noted and photographed. The distribution of artifacts was determined and mapped on the USGS quadrangle. No site sketch was prepared.

,& as besos} } No foundation or other structural remains were noted other than the standing commercial brick neck. Artifacts noted include two agate doorknobs; decorated whiteware; metal fragments; stoneware; blue spatterware (1860-1870); extruded brick fragments with potash glaze (ca 1880-1890); commercial brick fragments (twentieth century, "Ferris" brick); clear, manganese solarized, aqua, and dark olive green glass; a bottle of Dr. Dickey’s Old Reliable Eyewash; and several hand-finished bottle necks. Based on the age of the archaeological materials, and the lack of any structure shown on the 1941 to 1964 Ellis County highway maps and the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute Quadrangle map, cultural remains at this site have not been altered by post World War II occupation. Although better age estimates could not be obtained during surface survey, the site may have been occupied as early as the 1850- 1860s, until the 1920s. This structure is not on the postal route map (ca 1915) and may possibly indicate an earlier terminal date for this site. Although most of the sheet refuse, yard structures, and structural remains have been extensively plowed, the artifacts can provide a good picture of the evolution of an upland Ellis County farmstead through the nineteenth century. Some subsurface features, in addition to the cistern, may also be present. This site has the potential to yield information relevant to Research Questions 10, 11, 12, and 16. It is classified as high priority. A testing phase and extensive surface collection is proposed in order to evaluate the National Register significance of this property. 41EL60 (SSC-1-3) The site is located immediately south of a northeast trending dirt road and 650 meters south of FM 1446. The majority of this site is east of Arrowhead Road, and approximately 15% is located west of Arrowhead Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 693,950, northing 3,581,570. The latitude is 32° 21' 22", and elevation ranges from 740-750 feet above mean sea level. This is a level upland site with Greathouse (sic) Branch located 700 meters to the west. The vegetation consists of grasses and weeds with bois d'arc and small elms along the road and fenceline. The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 25 cm. The ground exposure varies from 30% to 50%, with 100% exposure in a field road and adjacent cultivated fields. This site is part of a 125 acre Mercer's Colony grant given to Thomas Norvell. The certificate was transferred to William F. Henderson and then to David Fearis. W.F. Henderson was a survivor of the Kickapoo attack on Robertson Land District surveyors camped on Richland Creek (approximately 40 miles south of the SSC) in 1838, and was a surveyor and land speculator. He, along with B.J. Chambers founded the town of Cleburne in Johnson County (Block 1970), where both resided. Posey Gordon surveyed the tract containing site 41EL60 for the Robertson Land District; the date is unknown but was possibly in 1856 or 1857. The original tract is intact with minor alterations from road construction. 7-8

Fieldwork conducted at this site included of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All features were noted and photographed. The distribution of artifacts was determined and mapped on the USGS quadrangle map. No site sketch was prepared. This site consists of a very deep cistern (Plate 7-10) with a standing commercial brick neck, a fallen commercial brick chimney, and a 3000 square meter artifact scatter that extends to the west side of Arrowhead road. Artifacts that were noted include tin; wood; modem cans and bottles; manganese solarized (1890-1910), amber, clear, green, and milk glass; stoneware; decorated whiteware (one painted blue on both sides, one with embossed flower design); and a writing slate fragment (1880-1900). : Based on artifact types, this site has an estimated occupational time period of the 1900s to the 1960s. The postal route map (ca. 1915), all four Ellis County highway maps, and the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map show structures at this location, supporting this age estimate. Impacis at this site include removal of structures, road construction and improvements, and a minor amount of erosion. While this site may have good integrity, the artifact types indicate intense use of this site during the third quarter of the twentieth century, which lowers the potential research value of this site. The serial use and occupancy of this site detracts from its potential to address the Research Questions. Archival research and informant information indicate that this site was not occupied by historically significant persons. This site is classified as low priority and no further work is recommended. 41EL61 (SSC-1-4) This site (Figure 7-9) consists of a cistern with a standing commercial brick neck, a 1500 square meter scatter of artifacts, a pile of boards, window glass, and a small depression with tin and wood in it (2 meters in diameter). The site is located 1.06 km south of FM. 1446 and 40 meters east of Ewing Road on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,050, northing 3,581,000. The latitude is 32° 21' 33", longitude 96° 55' 38", and elevation is 710 feet above mean sea level. This upland site is located 120 meters southwest of an intermittent stream that drains into South Prong Creek, 2.1 km to the northeast. The vegetation consists of Johnson grass and hackberry trees. The soil type is Stephen silty clay with a depth of 10-25 cm. Ground visibility varies from 50-60% with 100% visibility in field roads. This site is located in the Placido Olivari grant, which was granted by the Bexar Land District on February 26, 1837. This grant was sold to Calvin Emmons on August 28, 1837. The actual land tract was surveyed in 1846. At that time the area was entirely prairie with two walnut trees observed along South Prong Creek at the eastern edge of the tract. The WPA file for this tract has been destroyed. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All features were noted and photographed. The distributions of surface artifacts and features were mapped. Artifacts include 7-9 es

two styles of commercial brick (twentieth century), stoneware, decorated whiteware, manganese solarized glass (1890-1910), and milk glass. The site is located on a slight rise at the contact of an open pasture and a small hackberry grove. The cistern and board pile are located at the edge of an open pasture, while the depression and artifact scatter are found in a small grove of hackberry trees to the north. The site is not shown on any of the Ellis County highway maps or the postal route map (ca. 1915), although there is a structure shown in this vicinity that is believed to be 41EL135. The 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map shows no structures at 41EL61, which supports the accuracy of the highway maps. From this information and the artifact types, this site is believed to have had a relatively brief occupational period from around the turn of the century until the 1920s or 1930s. However, since there are many surface remains, this site may have stood until recently and simply was not mapped, particularly if hidden from view by the trees. Impacts to this site are limited to the removal of structures (or their decay) and plowing of a limited portion of the site. Plowing (to the south of the cistern) and bulldozing of structures may have already impacted the site. Some intact deposits probably remain; erosion is minimal. A majority of the site appears to be within a grove of trees and to have been spared from cultivation. Further work is needed at this site in order to better determine its integrity. The assumed short occupational period of this site and the time span from the turn of the century to the Depression could make it important for the understanding of changes in agricultural practices during this period and the success or failure of farms due to economic and environmental factors (Research Question 12). The recent age of the site detracts, however, from the historical significance of the property. At present this site is classified as a low priority. If directly impacted by construction further evaluation may be necessary. 41EL62 (SSC-1-5) This site (Figure 7-10) consists of a standing wooden frame house (Plate 7-11), a cistern with standing brick neck, a collapsing wood and tin corral, and a 500 square meter artifact scatter in an adjacent plowed field. The site is located 100 meters south of FM 1446 and 620 meters east of Arrowhead Road on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 694,220, northing 3,582,320. The latitude is 32° 21' 47", longitude 96° 56° 08", and elevation ranges from 740-750 feet above mean sea level. This upland site is located 240 meters southwest of an intermittent stream that drains into South Prong Creek, 2.5 km to the northeast. The area of the site containing features is dominated with locust, bois d’arc, and hackberry trees with grasses and cactus comprising the undergrowth (50% exposure); the artifact scatter was observed in a plowed field (100% exposure). The soil type is Eddy gravelly clay loam with a maximum depth of 25 cm (Brooks et al. 1964). r ; ——! ‘ k co — enees)

i) The original grantee for this land was Barksdale W. Wade, who received a 152 acre grant from Mercer's Colony on April 29, 1850. It was surveyed by Posey G. Gordon on July 26, 1856 for the Robertson Land District. This tract has been subdivided. Fieldwork conducted at this site included a close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All features were mapped, documented, and photographed. The distribution of artifacts was determined in relation to the features. Total site size is 1600 square meters. Artifacts that were noted include rubber tires and commercial brick fragments (twentieth century) around the corral; and recent metal, glass, and aluminum around the cistern, The artifact scatter in the plowed field includes aqua, manganese solarized, clear, dark blue, brown, light green, and milk glass; brick fragments; a ceramic insulator; and a large sewing thread bobbin (metal). All of this material dates to the twentieth century and many items are less than two decades ol. The area around the house and corral to the north, south, and west appears to be relatively undisturbed, while the pasture to the east has been heavily plowed for several years. The site is shown on the postal route map (ca. 1915), on all four Ellis County highway maps, and the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map. This information, along with artifact types, indicates an occupation time period of around 1900 to the 1970s. Utilization during the third quarter of the twentieth century has been intense, which in itself is an impact on the integrity of the site. Since there is a standing structure at this site, there is a good possibility that intact deposits are present. The site is classified as medium priority, primarily based on the existence of structures. This site could potentially yield information relevant to Research Questions 10 and 16. This site should receive further evaluations if directly impacted. 41EL63 (SSC-1-6) This site consists of a 600 square meter artifact scatter. No cistern or building remains were found. The site is located 670 meters east of Arrowhead Road and 1.08 km north of FM 66, along an intermittent drainage running northeast on the north slope of a rise on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 694,740, northing 3,581,490. The latitude is 32° 21' 18", longitude 96° 55' 50", and elevation ranges from 730-740 feet above mean sea level. This site is located in an intermittent upland stream that drains into South Prong Creek, located 2.6 km "to the northeast. The vegetation consists of grasses with small concentrations of bois d’arc trees in the area. The soil type is Stephen/Eddy silty clay with a depth of 15 cm. Ground exposure ranges from 50% to 60%. This site is part of a 125 acre Mercer's Colony grant given to Thomas Norvell. The certificate was transferred to William F. Henderson and then to David Fearis. Posey Gordon surveyed the tract for the Robertson Land District; the date is unknown but was possibly in 1856 or 1857. The original tract is intact with minor alterations from road construction. 7-11

Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All features were noted and photographed. The distribution of artifacts was determined and mapped on the USGS quadrangle map. Since there were no surface features. a site sketch was not prepared. Artifacts include stoneware (one possible butter chum neck, one light blue painted on both sides, some plain); tin; milk glass canning lids; a light blue bottle neck with threads; an amber bottle neck without threads; crumbly brick fragments (possibly handmade?); whiteware; one clear bottle base with bubbles and maker's mark; dark and light blue, manganese solarized, aqua, clear and amber vessel glass; and an old Coke bottle. The majority of these items date to the twentieth century. There are no structures indicated at this site on the postal route map (ca. 1915), on any of the Ellis County highway maps, or the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map. The location, age of artifacts, size of scatter, and absence of any known structures at this site indicates that it is most likely a durnp site. Artifact scatters of this type have been encountered numerous times during this survey. Considering the lack of association of this dump with a known occupational site, this site is of little scientific importance and is classified as low priority. No further work is recommended. 41EL64 (SSC-2-7) This site consists of a large, diffuse, 4000 square meter scatter of artifacts with no definable core. The site is located 300 meters south of FM 66 and 1.1 km east of Arrowhead Road on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,620, northing 3,580,380. The latitude is 32° 20' 42", longitude 96° 55' 16", and elevation ranges from 710-720 feet above mean sea level. This is an upland site located next to an intermittent stream that forms part of the headwaters of Big Onion Creek. Parts of this stream have been channelized but the overall topography of the area indicates that this was once a natural drainage course. The vegetation consists of grasses (50% ground exposure) with willow trees along the stream channel. The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 25 cm. = This site is located in a grant to Alanson Ferguson (1-783) which was given by the General Land Office in Austin on December 4, 1850. Ferguson sold this unlocated certificate to James B. Shaw, who sold it to Mathew Cartwright. Cartwright patented this certificate. The field notes for this tract are missing in the GLO files, apparently misplaced, therefore the actual dates of these transactions cannot be determined (John Molleston, General Land Office Archives, personal communication 1990). If this tract was occupied in the 1850s, it was most likely by Mathew Cartwright. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. Since this area had been plowed and the grass was sparse, no shovel tests were needed to determine the boundaries of the artifact scatter. The distribution of artifacts was determined and mapped on the USGS quadrangle map. No site sketch was prepared. 7-12 ee BS & wf L ea ee SS

;, See a Artifacts include commercial brick fragments; plain and embossed whiteware; aqua, solarized manganese, clear and amber glass; and a hard plastic doll's arm. One glass bottle base has the maker's mark of the Hazel Atlas Glass Company, a mark that was used between 1920 and 1964. Charcoal and non-native schist and bituminous coal were also noted. No structures, indication of structures, or features were observed, No structures are shown on any of the highway maps and the 1901 Ellis County map records no roads at this location. Based on this cartographic information, the location of the site bordering a drainage channel, and the diffuse nature of the scatter, this site is thought to have been a dump used between the 1900s and 1960s. Even if this site represents a farmstead site, it now has extremely low integrity after years of plowing and the impact from stream channelization. Archival research and informant reports do not indicate any special historical significance of this area. The site is classified as low priority with little potential to address the historic Research Questions. No further work is recommended. 41EL65 (SSC-2-8) This site consists of a 1500 square meter scatter of artifacts. The site is located 80 meters south of FM.66 and 475 meters east of intersection of Arrowhead Road and FM 66 on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,100, northing 3,580,310. The latitude is 32° 20' 39", longitude 96° 55’ 36", and elevation ranges from 740-750 feet above mean sea level. Site 41EL65 is located in the uplands which is located 430 meters northeast of an intermittent stream that forms part of the headwaters of Big Onion Creek. The area is currently a plowed field (100% ground exposure) with Austin silty clay soil that has a depth of 25 cm. In its native state, the vegetation consisted of tallgrass prairie. This site, as well as site 41EL64, is located in a grant to Alanson Ferguson (1-783) which was given by the General Land Office in Austin on December 4, 1850. Ferguson sold this unlocated certificate to James B. Shaw, who sold it to Mathew Cartwright. Cartwright patented this certificate. The field notes for this tract are missing in the GLO files, apparently misplaced, therefore dates of these transactions cannot be determined at present. If this tract was occupied in the 1850s, it was most likely by Mathew Cartwright. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All features were noted and photographed. The artifact distribution was defined and distinctive artifacts described. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no site sketch was prepared. Clear, amber, green, and solarized manganese glass; one cast iron fragment; plain and embossed whiteware; commercial brick fragments; and mortar were observed within the 1500 square meter artifact scatter. One broken piece of clear glass, possibly a soda water bottle, was recovered and appears to have been bottled in Waxahachie. These artifacts date mostly from the 1930s to the 1960s. 7-13

The site is located along a fenceline 100 meters south of FM 66. The area between the fenceline and highway contains two modem houses, which covered an unknown portion of the site. The area north of the recorded scatter most likely once contained a historic farmstead. A farmstead is shown at this location on the postal route map (ca. 1915) and all four of the Ellis County highway maps. The 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map shows three dwellings at this location, two of which are 1978 additions to the map, apparently the two modem structures observed during survey. The postal survey map records this as the McCarter house. Demolition of the original house, construction of the two modern houses, and plowing have all impacted this site. Site integrity is very low. Archival and informant information do not indicate any important historical association with this site and no archaeological evidence for Cartwright's possible occupation was noted. This site is classified as low priority and no further work is recommended. / 41EL66 (SSC-2-9) : This site consists of a cistern with a standing commercial brick neck (Plate 7-12), a sunken area filled with tin, two wooden piers, and a 2000 square meter artifact scatter. The site is located south of Hwy 66, 1.0 km east of Arrowhead Road, and 550 meters north of Maypearl Road on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,820, northing 3,579,850. The latitude is 32° 20' 25", longitude 96° 55’ 09", and elevation is 740 feet above mean sea level. This upland site is located on the southeast tip of a northwest-southeast trending ridge, 480 meters west of Cottonwood Branch, that drains into Chambers Creek located 8.4 km to the south. The vegetation consists of Bermuda grass, locust and bois d'arc trees which cover the southwestern portion of the site (20% to 40% exposure), with the northwest portion having been plowed (100% ground exposure). The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 25 cm. . This site is located on the Alanson Ferguson land grant (1-783) which was given by the General Land Office in Austin on December 4, 1850. This land grant also contains sites 41EL64 and 41EL65. Ferguson sold this unlocated certificate to James B. Shaw, who sold it to Mathew Cartwright. Cartwright patented this certificate. The field notes for this tract are missing in the GLO files, apparently misplaced. If this tract was occupied in the 1850s, it was probably by Mathew Cartwright. Fieldwork conducted at this site included of a close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. The distribution of artifacts was determined and mapped on the USGS quadrangle map. Distinctive artifacts were photographed. No site sketch was prepared. Artifacts include window glass; blue, clear, amber, manganese solarized, aqua, and dark green vessel glass; translucent milk glass; brick fragments; roller skate parts; stoneware; whiteware (one piece hand painted); one metal key; metal fragments; wire nails; wire; tin; one shell button; and several large tractor implements. These items date from ca. 1900 to 1960. 7-14

nh ia EE lB The site is shown on the postal route map (ca. 1915) and on ail four Ellis County highway maps but is not on the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map. The estimated period of occupancy is from 1900 to the late 1950s, based on both archaeological and cartographic evidence. Plowing has disturbed the northern and eastern part of the site, and a dirt road has also damaged the site. Erosion is minor, confined mainly to the road. Archival information does not indicate any special historical significance, and no archaeological evidence for Cartwright's occupation was noted. The lengthy period of occupation (probably serial tenants) of this farmstead lessens its value to address the historic Research Questions. This site is classified as low priority and no further work is recommended. 41EL67 (SSC-3-10) The site (Figure 7-11) consists of a standing, 1.5 story, metal-sided, frame (all wire nails and pine shiplap lumber) house (Plate 7-13); a barn (Plate 7-14); and a detached garage’ covering a totat area of 6000 square mieters. The site is located 20 meters north of Old Maypearl Road and 120 meters east of the intersection of Old Maypearl Road and Arrowhead Road on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 696,160, northing 3,579,440. The latitude is 32° 20° 11", longitude 96° 54’ 56", and elevation is 720 feet above mean sea level. Site 41EL67 is located in the uplands 360 meters southwest of the upper drainage of Big Onion Creek. The vegetation is sparse Bermuda grass (50% ground exposure) with small elm trees lining the backyard fence. The soil is Austin silty clay with a depth of 25 cm. This site, along with sites 41EL64, 41EL65, 41EL66, is located in a grant to Alanson Ferguson (1- 783) which was given by the General Land Office in Austin on December 4, 1850. The same deed information for these sites applies to site 41EL67. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. The distributions of features and artifacts were mapped. Diagnostic artifacts were noted and photographed when present. The personal possessions that belonged to the previous occupants were closely examined for information relating to the use of the site. Artifacts found in paths and eroded areas (100% exposure) include a glass marble; a key; a manganese solarized glass bottle neck with no seam (1890s); light green, dark blue, clear and aqua glass; whiteware (some decorated); stoneware; a metal buckle; and twentieth century brick and flower pot fragments. Three large farm implements (plows and planters) are in the pasture behind the backyard. The backyard contains a cistem (Plate 7-15) with a standing commercial brick neck, an old stove, and a large propane tank. The house contains lots of junk and clothing, as well as a diploma dated 1922 (Alberta Smith, College of Industrial Arts, Denton), a cavalry picture from 1915, magazines dating from the 1950s to 1982, a box of Columbian Cyclopedia volumes (copyright 1890), an old washing machine, evaporative air conditioning unit, and a gas stove and heater. Letters indicated that H.G. Herrington and his wife Alberta Smith lived in 7-15

this house. The house beams (sawn pine) are resting on slabs of fossiliferous limestone, and the house has metal siding. The site is shown on all four Ellis County highway maps, and the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map. The current landowner indicated that the pasture between 41EL66 and 41EL67 has never been plowed, so most of the site should be undisturbed. The only impacts noted were the construction of a pond which may have cut into a dump, as glass and stoneware are eroding out of the banks, and the dirt road which runs from Maypearl Road, between the house and barn, northwest to site 41EL66. Occupation of this site appears to date from 1920s to the 1980s. Site integrity is excellent but the long serial occupation of this farmstead may prevent the separation of archaeological components. Hardy-Heck- Moore (1990) date the structure (based only on windshield survey and stylistic considerations) to ca. 1885 (#4630) and give it a high priority. The site is classified as medium priority for archaeology since the landscape is intact. The archaeological deposits could yield information related to Research Questions 12 and 16; however, the integrity and spatial separation of components has yet to be determined. Further evaluations are necessary if this site is impacted. 41EL68 (SSC-3-11) This site consists of two components (Figure 7-12); a currently occupied farmstead and a 15,000 square meter artifact scatter. The site is located 1.06 km south of Hwy 66, 550 meters north of Old Maypearl Road, and extends 180 meters east of Arrowhead Road on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,120, northing 3,579,400. The latitude is 32° 20° 11", longitude 96° 55' 35", and elevation is 740 feet above mean sea level. Site 41EL68 is a level upland site west of the Cottonwood Branch of Chambers Creek. The vegetation is Bermuda grass in the farm yard (30% ground exposure) and wheat in the surrounding fields (80% exposure). The soil type is Austin silty clay with a 25 cm depth. In 1855 this was primarily prairie, with some walnut trees noted in low-lying areas. This site is located on one of three John Roberts Surveys granted by Mercer's Colony and Hunt County in October 1855. The 152 acre tract containing 41EL68 was surveyed in July 1856. In 1936 the tract had been reduced to 148.4 acres, and was owned by William Sidney Stroud, who leased it to tenants (third and fourths). Stroud had purchased the tract from William Brandage in 1892 (ECDB 70:345). In all, 2 acres were reserved for home, 0.4 acre for garden, 139 acres in cultivation (45 in oats, corn, and wheat; with the remainder in cotton), and 5 acres wasteland. At that time 75 acres were in need of terracing. The main residences were a four room bungalow (built in 1926) and a shack. Also, three sheds and a barn were present. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. The above ground features and structures were mapped. All artifact scatters were noted and all temporally or functionally diagnostic artifacts were described and photographed. 7-16

| [ y~ 4 — (0 One component of this site is a farmstead that dates to the 1920s or 1930s. This is a single story hip- gabled house with a garage addition. The house is currently occupied and is in excellent condition. The current owner, Ollie Mae Wilburn, reports that the original house burned down before 1944, with the current house built on the previous structure's foundation. A well is located north of the house (Plate 7-16). A barn is located to the east of the house (Plate 7-17) and a second, collapsing barn is south of the first. The second component is a 15,000 square meter artifact scatter between Arrowhead Road and the farmyard, on both sides of the driveway. Artifacts include whiteware; stoneware; ca. 1890 transitional pressed brick fragments (Plate 7-17); manganese solarized, aqua, clear, amber, and milk glass fragments; burnt limestone; a blue glass bead; and a clear bottle neck without a seam. These artifacts are estimated to date from 1890, and are believed to relate to the occupation of the earlier structure which bumed. All four Ellis County highway maps and the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map show‘a structure at this location. The postal route map (ca. 1915), however, does not show any structure at this location. It appears that a farm was at this: site from about 1890 and lasted no more than twenty years before being burned. The second farm house was then built on the foundation of the first. If the maps we have are accurate, this site remained vacant for a short period of time between building episodes. The original farmstead has been disturbed by the construction of the second. Plowing has also disturbed the original habitation site. The second farmstead is less disturbed but has been modified by lengthy occupation. The mixed components of this site, disturbance of original deposits, and alterations to the dwelling make it undesirable for separation of archaeological components. Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) has also recorded this site (#4628), dating the current house to 1925 and giving it a low priority. The archaeological classification is medium priority due to the presence of standing structures. This site probably has some potential to address Research Question 12. Minimal evaluation will be necessary if this site is impacted. 41EL69 (SSC-3-12) This site consists of a very large collapsed cistern, barn, sheds, and corral, and a large pile of bricks extending over 2500 square meters (Figure 7-13). The site is located 20 meters northeast of Old Maypearl Road and 600 meters west of Arrowhead Road, and 400 meters east of Bethel Road between FM 66 and FM 1493 on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 694,730, northing 3,578,560. The latitude is 32° 19’ 45", longitude 96° 55° 52”, and elevation is 685 feet above mean sea level. This upland site is located 145 meters east of the Cottonwood Branch of Chambers Creek. The vegetation consists of grasses (30% ground exposure) with small trees lining the fence. Cattle trails and field roads offer 100% ground exposure across the site. The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 20 cm. 7-17

This site is one of two 320 acre tracts granted by Navarro County to Lewis Goddard (date not recorded). The tract was surveyed by W.W. Parks on March 22, 1855 for the Robertson Land District. The presettlement vegetation was primarily prairie with pecan and gum bumelia in low-lying areas. In 1936 this tract was owned by Mrs. Edna Orr of Waxahachie, Texas, who leased it to tenants. She obtained the tract as a gift (inheritance?) in 1916 (ECDB 273-571). In all, 1 acre was reserved for home, 1 acre for garden, 97 acres in cultivation (35 com, 62 cotton) and 10 acres in pasture. At that time 30 acres were in need of terracing. The house was a 5 room, 1.5 story dwelling measuring 32 x 26 feet. Also, a shed and bam were present. The house needed repairs and painting at that time. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. Many structural remains on the ground surface allowed accurate assessment of site boundaries. Surface features and the distribution of artifacts were mapped, and distinctive artifacts were noted and photographed. . This 2500 square meter site (Figure 7-13) currently includes a very large collapsed cistern, barn, sheds, and corral, and a large pile of bricks. The brick pile contains two different types of commercial brick, many coated with smoothed cement. The older bricks appear to have been bumed, while the newer ones do not. Piers are located within 10 meters of the brick pile. In addition, burnt timbers (some with cut nails); metal pipe and debris; porcelain; whiteware; clear, light green, and light manganese solarized glass were observed. These items date from ca. 1890 to 1960s. , It is apparent that the dwelling which was located here burned within the last 10 to 20 years. Impacts, besides the destruction of this house, include cattle, which are still grazing around the site, and erosion in several areas. From the few artifacts that were observed, the estimated occupational time period is from 1890 to 1970, and archival research supports that date. A farm is shown at this location on the postal route map (ca. 1915), all four Ellis County highway maps, and the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map. . This site is classified as medium priority since there is adequate historical documentation and structural remains. The site has potential to yield information relevant to Research Question 12 and possibly Research Question 13. Further evaluation will be necessary, especially since current plans call for a cooling pond at this location. 41EL70 (SSC-3-13) This site consists of a small, 200 square meter artifact scatter representing the remains of a structure and associated refuse and a section of unplowed ground with light artifacts. The two area are separated by a plowed field. The site is located 200 meters northwest of the Old Maypearl Road between FM 66 and FM 1493 near intersection of Bethel Road and approximately 980 meters west of Arrowhead Road on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 694,360, northing 3,578,460. The latitude is 32° 19' 42", longitude 96° 56° 05", and elevation is 690 feet above mean sea level. 7-18 =i) == ===)

Ss 4 = i This is an upland site located 200 meters west of the Cottonwood Branch of Chambers Creek. The vegetation consists of locust and fruit trees, and tall grasses (50% exposure), with an adjacent field (100% exposure) which has been recently plowed. The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 10 cm. This site (along with 41EL69) is one of two 320 acres tracts granted by Navarro County to Lewis Goddard (date not recorded). The tract was surveyed by W. W. Parks on March 22, 1855 for the Robertson Land District. The presettlement vegetation was primarily prairie with pecan and gum bumedlia present in low-lying areas, In 1936, this tract was owned by J. W. and Lula Whitefield, Waxahachie, Texas, who leased it to tenants. They purchased the tract in 1931 from B. F. Forrester (ECDB 304:346). In all, 1 acre was reserved for home, 1 acre garden, 79 acres in cultivation (10 corn, 69 cotton) and 14 acres in wasteland. At that time, 35 acres were in need of terracing. The structures included a shack and a shed. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (S meter) pedestrian survey. This site was plotted on the USGS map and distinctive artifacts noted, but no site map was prepared. This site contains two sections separated by a plowed field. The first is a small artifact scatter just across the fence from Maypeari Road, and just to the right of the gate and corral. This 200 square meter scatter contains brick and metal fragments, stoneware, and clear and manganese solarized glass. This scatter clearly represents the remains of a structure and associated refuse. The second area is a section of unplowed ground 200 meters to the north. This contains a fruit tree and two honey locust trees, as well as honey locust undergrowth, tall grasses and weeds. A cement water tank, an upside down metal tank (possibly covering a pump), corrugated tin and barbed wire were noted. An overhead electrical wire leads to this area. Whiteware and clear, aqua, and brown glass were found under the fruit tree, while aqua, clear, and green glass were found under the honey locusts. No artifacts were found in the plowed fields. No structures are shown at this site on the postal route map (ca. 1915), any of the Ellis County highway maps nor the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map. The only recorded structures were the shed and shack recorded in 1936. It is believed that this site is the Whitefield tenant dwelling and that it had a short occupational period, from the 1920s to the 1940s. This location has been used as a cattle watering station and possibly a dump since that time. Archival researches and informant interviews did not indicate any special historical significance. The site is classified as a low priority site and no further work is recommended. 41EL71 (SSC-3-14) This site consists of the remains of farm related structures and machinery including a cement covered brick porch, a brick scatter, farm machinery and a possible cistern. The site is located 50 meters east and 20 meters south of the intersection of Old Maypearl Road and Bethel Road on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 694,480, northing 3,578,320. The latitude is 32° 19° 37", longitude 96° 56’ 03", and elevation is 690 feet above mean sea level. 7-19

This upland site is located 240 meters west of the Cottonwood Branch of Chambers Creek. The vegetation consists of Bermuda grass with four trees, including two small pecan trees, and two rose bushes. The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 20 cm. The ground exposure was 50%. This site is located in the William S. Estes Survey, a Mercer's Colony Grant to the heirs of Estes from Kaufman County, which was transferred to Blumford Shankle in 1855, and was surveyed in 1857. At that time this was total prairie. In 1936 the 59 acre tract containing 41EL71 was owned by Mrs. Dollie Underwood who purchased the tract in 1935 (ECDB 325:299) and who operated the farm. At that time all 59 acres were in cultivation and no improvements were present. All 59 acres were in need of terracing. &. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All surface features were noted and documented, and distinctive artifacts were photographed. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no sketch map of the site was completed due to its recent age. -~ This site consists of a cement covered brick porch, a 1500 square meter scatter of Palmer and newer brick, a depression with the roof of a collapsed feeder covering it (possibly a cistern), a large farm machine (cultivator), and a collapsed and broken metal windmill tower. No other artifacts were noted. This site is found only on the 1955 Ellis County highway map; it is not shown on the postal route map (ca. 1915), the 1941, 1959, or 1964 highway maps, or the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map. From this information, the fact that there were no improvements recorded in 1936, and the type and limited quantity of artifacts, this site is believed to date from the 1940s to the late 1950s. This site consists entirely of farm related structures and was never used as a domicile. In 1936 it was a working farm without improvements. Archival and informant information indicate that this site was not associated with historically significant individuals and is not archaeologically significant. This site is classified as low priority and no further work is recommended. 41EL72 (SSC-3-15) This site represents the remains of a farm complex. A collapsed cistern and a 50 square meter artifact scatter are present. The site is located 50 meters east of Bethel Road and 350 meters south of Old Maypearl Road between FM 66 and FM 1493 on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 694,620, northing 3,578,070. The latitude is 32° 19° 28", longitude 96° 55' 57", and elevation ranges from 620-630 feet above mean sea level. Site 41EL72 is located in the uplands 100 meters west of the Cottonwood Branch of Chambers Creek. The vegetation currently consists of Bermuda grass and the soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 20 cm. This site is 300 meters southeast of 41EL71. Ground exposure ranges from 30% to 50% except in areas where cattle have congregated, resulting in 100% ground exposure. 7-20

; — This site is located in the William S. Estes Survey, a Mercer's Colony Grant to the heirs of Estes from Kaufman County, which was transferred to Blumford Shankle in 1855, and was surveyed in 1857. At that time this was total prairie. In 1936 the 101 acre tract containing 41EL72 was owned by W.T. Bearden and Mrs. Ella Hollabough of Midlothian, Texas, who worked their own farm. They purchased the farm in two increments: in 1925 (ECDB 322:120) and in 1935 (ECDB 327:520). One acre was reserved for a home, 0.5 acre for garden, and 94.5 acres in cultivation (47 acres corm, remainder cotton), and 5 acres in pasture. All 101 acres were in need of terracing. The main house (rebuilt in 1933) was a 7 room residence measuring 42 x 32 feet, and an adjacent shack was present. A single barn completed the structural inventory. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All surface features were noted and documented, and distinctive artifacts were noted. The site was plotted en the USGS quadrangle map, but a sketch map of the site was not completed. This site now consists of a collapsed cistern and an exposed 50 square meter artifact scatter. Artifacts include one horseshoe; aqua (very light), manganese solarized, and amber vessel glass; window glass; cable; corrugated tin; and barbed wire. These items date from 1910 to 1960. Sheet erosion, destruction of the house, possible plowing of the field, and cattle activity have impacted this site with an estimated 50% or less of the site remaining intact. The site is shown on the 1941 and 1955 Ellis County highway map. Archival information indicates that this site is a farm complex which began in the 1930s and was part of the Bearden-Hollabough estate, who were related by marriage to the Dunaway family. The site could potentially address Research Questions 12, 13, and 16. At present this site is classified as medium priority since the collapsed barn indicates that the historic landscape is intact. Further evaluations, including test excavations and informant/archival research, may be necessary to determine if the site is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. 41EL73 (SSC-3-16) This farmstead site includes a currently occupied house, and an associated artifact scatter. The site is located 40 meters north of Boz Road and 20 meters east of Arrowhead Road on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,950, northing 3,577,500. The latitude is 32° 19° 08", longitude 96° 55° 06", and elevation is 649 feet above mean sea level. This is an upland site 100 meters from an intermittent stream that drains into Baker Branch, 1.6 km to the south. In 1852 this area was prairie with a few willows along drainage channels. The vegetation currently consists of Bermuda grass in the farm yard and surrounding fields with ground exposure ranging from 30% to 50%. The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 10 to 20 cm. The vegetation was all prairie grasses in 1852. 7-21

This site is part of the George Casey grant. Casey received a bounty certificate from the Secretary of War on May, 1838, for service at San Jacinto during the Texas Revolution. The 640 acre tract was surveyed by G.W. Cunningham on June 30, 1852 for the Robertson surveying district. The original tract has been split into fifteen different tracts. George Casey sold another certificate in Frio County unlocated to Nathaniel Townsend, who was a land entrepreneur who obtained the Raphael de la Pena Survey. In 1936 this site was located on a 177 acre tract owned by O.B. and Hollis (sp?) Dunaway who leased to tenants (on a third and fourths rental basis, see Chapter 4). They had received the tract through inheritance in 1903 (ECDB 141:194). All 177 acres were in cultivation with 70 acres in corn and oats and 107 acres in cotton. At that time 88 acres needed terracing. No improvements were noted in 1936. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. The standing structures and features were mapped and photographed. The soil depth was determined by examining adjacent ditches and ‘animal (dog and armadillo) excavations around the house. There is a bungalow house with a hipped gable roof at this location (Figure 7-14), along with a three- sided cattle shelter, a corrugated metal shed, a commercial brick cistem with a square neck, a metal water tank, and a propane tank, The house is currently occupied and has been modified with the addition of a car port and shed on the northeast side of the structure. The yard in the immediate vicinity of the house was not surveyed or shovel tested for artifacts since it was occupied. The farm yard totals approximately 2500 square meters. A 600 square meter artifact scatter is ocated 150 meters to the north of the farmyard, bordering the channel of an intermittent stream. Artifacts observed here included clear, amber, aqua, and manganese solarized glass; brick; thin metal fragments; decorated and plain whiteware; and milk glass. One whiteware fragment has part of a bluish-green crown shaped maker's mark. These items date to the first three decades of the twentieth century. The farmstead is shown on all four of the Ellis County highway maps and the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map. The WPA survey does not record a structure at this location in 1936 nor does the postal route map (ca. 1915). Based on this information and the style of the house, the farmstead has an estimated time period of occupation from the late 1930s-to the present. The dump located 150 meters to the north predates the current farmstead and may not be associated with it. Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) recorded a structure (#4648) at this location during their architectural inventory of Ellis County. They recorded the structure as a modified L-plan with an estimated date of - construction of 1915. A garage and shed are also recorded for this site. While our field identification of this - structure as a bungalow may be in error, archival sources indicate the Hardy-Heck-Moore's 1915 date is too : early for this structure. Plowing and erosion have impacted the dump site but the farmstead itself appears to have had little impact to its integrity. Further archaeological and architectural evaluations are necessary at this Site, especially due to the discrepancies between our interpretation of the farmstead and Hardy-Heck-Moore 7-22 SES Ss ( =) as = a Hz C e== 4 i

LE (1990)'s interpretation. There has probably been serial use of this site as well as intensive modern use. This site could potentially contain information relevant to Research Question 12. This site is classified as ’ medium priority and further evaluations are recommended. 41EL74 (SSC-3-17) A tenant house, barn, and associated artifact scatter are present at this site. The site is located 250 meters south of Boz Road and 1.13 km west of Curry Road, on a northeast-southwest trending ridge and along a north-south dirt track. It is approximately 1.85 km northeast of Boz. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 696,460, northing 3,577,400. The latitude is 32° 19' 04", longitude 96° 54’ 47", and elevation is 650 feet above mean sea level. This i is a level upland site located 600 meters west of Baker Branch. The vegetation consists of sparse grasses with 50% to 80% ground exposure. The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 20 cm. In 1852 this area was entirely prairie. This site is part of a 320 acre tract from Mercer's Colony and Liberty County which was granted to William R. Herron on June 8, 1850. Herron transferred 200 acres to E.M. Brack on May 8, 1852 and it was surveyed by G.W. Cunningham for the Robertson Land District on June 4, 1852. This tract is still intact. Herron retained the remaining 120 acres of his grant. This tract is located to the northeast of the 200 acre tract and is discussed under the description for site 41EL84. Fieldwork at this site included a close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. The distributions of structures and surface artifacts were mapped and photographed. Distinctive and/or diagnostic artifacts were noted and photographed as well. This site (Figure 7-15) consists of a tenant house (Plate 7-19), barn (Plate 7-20), and a 2500 square meter artifact scatter. The house is a three room shotgun structure, 11 meters long by 5 meters wide. It is constructed with vertical plank and is covered by asphalt siding and a tin roof. A 7 meter by 4 meter barn constructed with vertical planking and asphalt siding, with a tin roof, is located 75 meters to the south. A collapsed feeder is just south of the barn. Artifacts observed include plain and decorated whiteware (green painted and blue transfer print); soda bottles; brick fragments; plastic buttons; a glass marble; a cylinder lock; porcelain; green, blue, manganese solarized, clear, and amber glass; a metal hoop (wheel rim); assorted pieces of heavy metal; green milk glass; a small child's toy; an aqua bottleneck with no seam; and an adjustable metal wrench, These items date from the tum of the century to the present. The site is shown on the postal route map (ca. 1915), all four Ellis County highway maps, and the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map. The date of occupation is estimated to be from around 1900 to 1950s. 7-23 (To — a

sa J | J = i ) This site has been impacted by plowing and erosion. The site is classified as medium priority, but the serial occupation and use of the site detracts from its research value. The site could contain information relevant to Research Questions 14 and 15. Further evaluations may be necessary to determine the National Register of Historic Places eligibility. 41EL75 (SSC-3-18): Dunaway Farmstead This site is the Dunaway farmstead. The farm contains standing structures and is currently occupied. The site is located 800 meters east of Bethel Road on a dirt road 550 meters south of Boz Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 697,300, northing 3,576,660. The latitude is 32° 18’ 49", longitude 96° 54° 55", and elevation is 650 feet above mean sea level. This farmstead is located on level upland 370 meters east of an intermittent stream that drains into Baker Branch 800 meters to the south. The farmyard is in grass with various ornamental bushes on three sides of the house. The surrounding fields have been plowed in the past year; currently the eastern and northern fields are used as pasture with 30% to 50% ground exposure. The southern field was recently plowed with 100% exposure. No artifacts were observed in this area. The soil type is Stephen silty clay with a depth of 20 cm. Site 41EL75 is located on the Jesse J. Mays (Hays, sic) survey, a Mercer's Colony grant awarded April 18, 1850. The tract was surveyed in 1855. At that time, the area was covered primarily by prairie with hackberry and elm in low-lying areas. Jefferson Madison Dunaway obtained this tract in 1855 (ECDB B:154), at which time he constructed his first house. The Dunaway estate was divided among the heirs G.F., J.R., and O.B. Dunaway of Ellis County and J.E. Dunaway of Tarrant County) in 1903 (ECDB 141: 188 and 192). When the WPA enumeration was conducted in 1936, site 41EL75 was included as a part of the William. R. Herron Survey file, since J.R. Dunaway included this in his 120 acre farm obtained from his maternal grandfather, E.M. Brack. Many other tracts of land were owned by Dunaway family members in the project area. For this farmstead, 2 acres were reserved for the home, 0.5 acre for garden, 97.5 in cultivation (65 corn, 32.5 cotton) and 20 in wasteland. The main dwelling, which is still standing today, was a 1.5 story, 8 room residence measuring 40 x 50 feet which was built in 1855 and remodeled in 1876. This dwelling may be similar to 41EL80, which was a two room, braced frame structure built from hewn oaks beams (locally produced) and sawn pine studs (imported), and with high potential for tree-ring dating. A second dwelling was a 6 room residence measuring 32 x 40 feet. In addition, 2 shacks were present on the farm. Five sheds and two bars completed the farm inventory. The Dunaway farmstead currently consists of a house, small barn, small shed, a one acre farmyard, and a commercial brick cistern with a standing neck (Figure 7-16). What was apparently the second house (1936) was in the field behind the Dunaway house and has burned. Including this area, total site size is 6000 7-24

eran i} square meters. The Dunaway house is currently in good condition and the barn is in fair condition. Due to the well maintained lawn, no artifacts were observed. Fieldwork conducted at this site included a close interval (5 m) pedestrian survey. It has been revisited several times by ARP personnel, along with Sam Baker (SSCL) and Mike Smith (TNRLC). The structures have been mapped as well as photographed. This site is one of the most important cultural properties identified during survey. It has been owned and occupied by three generations of the Dunaway family and has suffered from few adverse impacts. It is currently registered as a State Historic Landmark and is believed to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. This site has the potential to address Research Questions 9, 10, and 13. Full mitigation is recommended, and preservation strongly encouraged. This site is considered to be the keystone to our understanding of the historic background and development of the West Campus area. There is high potential for tree-ring dating of the initial construction and remodeling episodes, both with baldcypress as well as pine and oak. Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) also consider this site (#4658) to have high priority. 41EL76 (SSC-3-19) Two areas of scattered artifacts, and a water pipe are currently visible at this site. The site is located 2.65 km west of FM 876, 3.38 km south of FM 66, at the west comer of the intersection Boz Road (FM 1493) and Curry Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 697,220, northing 3,578,240. The latitude is 32° 19° 31”, longitude 96° 54’ 16", and elevation is 670 feet above mean sea level. This site occupies an upland rise between Big Onion Creek 400 meters to the east and Baker Branch 340 meters to the west. The vegetation is grass with a single pecan tree (30% ground exposure), and with approximately 60% of the site in a plowed field (100% ground exposure). The soil type is Austin silty clay to a depth of 10 to 20 cm with exposed fragments of bedrock. The vegetation was all prairie in 1852. This site is part of the George Casey grant. Casey received a bounty certificate from the Secretary of War on May, 1838, for service at San Jacinto during the Texas Revolution. The 640 acre tract was surveyed by G.W. Cunningham on June 30, 1852, for the Robertson Land District. The original tract has been split into fifteen different tracts. George Casey sold another unlocated Frio County certificate to Nathaniel Townsend, who was a land entrepreneur who also obtained the Raphael de la Pena Survey. Fieldwork conducted at at this site included a close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. The distribution of artifacts and structural debris was mapped. Distinctive and diagnostic artifacts were described and photographed in the field. The site (Figure 7-17) consists of a 4100 square meter dense artifact scatter with an additional 1500 square meter light scatter to the north and west. Artifacts include brick and mortar fragments; concrete; metal fragments; one piece of porcelain (with two dark blue stripes); stoneware; whiteware (some decorated); boards; clear, aqua, light green, manganese solarized, amber, and dark blue vessel glass; and milk glass.

] large percentage of artifacts in the northwest portion of the site were bummed, possibly debris from a bum- barrel used to dispose of trash. In general, most of the artifacts date from 1890 to 1960. A water pump is the only feature visible. This site was identified on the postal route map (ca. 1915), all four Ellis County highway maps, but not the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute Quadrangle map. A structure is shown at this location on the Soil Conservation Service soil maps (Brooks et al. 1964), compiled from a survey completed in 1960. Plowing, erosion, and destruction of the house have all impacted this site, and site integrity is believed to be around 50%. This site is classified as a low priority site based on site integrity, intense twentieth century occupation, and lack of features. Archival and informant information indicate that no significant historic events or persons are associated with this site. No further work is recommended. 41EL77 (SSC-4-20): Forrester Farmstead This site, the remains of the Forrester farmstead, includes an abandoned house, bam, corral, cisterns, a scatter of brick and an artifact scatter. The site is located 144 meters north of Boz Road and 270 meters east of Bethel Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,400, northing 3,577,200. The latitude is 32° 18' 59”, longitude 96° 55' 28", and elevation is 670 feet above mean sea level. This is an upland site located 430 meters east of the Cottonwood Branch of Chambers Creek. The vegetation consists of grass, elm and bois d'arc trees, and thom bushes. The ground exposure varies from 30% to 50% with some eroded areas completely exposed. The soil type is Stephens silty clay with a depth of 10 to 20 cm. The B.F. Forrester Farmstead is registered in the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry (Texas Department of Agriculture 1978:16). B.F. Forrester came to Ellis County, Texas, in 1865, a 17 year old Confederate veteran. His wife Frances Forrester (Fannie Green) came to Ellis County in 1859 from Lafayette County, Missouri, with her father, Ira Green. The Forresters married in 1868, purchased 160 acres of the W.S. Estes Survey on December 30, 1869 and built a home out of lumber hauled overland from Nacogdoches. This original structure may be similar to the one at 41EL80, which is a hewn braced frame using local oaks and pine studs and pine or baldcypress siding which was imported. There is high potential for tree-ring dating of construction and remodeling episodes at 41EL77. Forrester later added 1223 acres to this original homestead. Forrester broke virgin prairie when he started his farm and raised cotton, corn, hay, sugar cane (sorghum?), grains, and livestock. He attended Bethel Methodist Church, was chairman of the Democratic Party, and sponsored the construction of the Boz cotton and oil mill around the tum-of-the-century. His estate was divided in 1916 (see WPA discussion below). Emma Ruth Forrester inherited the original 160 _ acre tract and enlarged it by 1549 acres when she married Charles Nelson Hampton. The Upper Hampton 7-26

Place, started by Hines, is also listed on the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry (Texas Department of Agriculture 1976) Corn, cotton, hay, sugar cane, grains, and livestock remained the staple crops but improved farming and conservation practices were necessary to maintain this level of intensive agriculture. Mrs Mary Frances Hampton Elliot inherited this property in 1944, at which time the farm had decreased to 942 acres. Mrs. Elliot added 1372 additional acres, lived at the farm and managed it herself, raising cotton, grain, sorghum, wheat, and hay. In 1936 this 130 acre tract was owned by Mrs. Emma Hampton of Waxahachie, who leased it to tenants. She acquired the property as a gift in 1916 (ECDB 273:569). One acre was reserved for the homes, 0.5 for garden, 108.5 in cultivation (45 com, oats, hay; remainder cotton), and 20 acres were in pasture. All 130 acres were in need of terracing. A 1.5 story residence with 6 rooms, measuring 40 x 48 feet, and two shacks were occupied on the farm. In addition there were 4 sheds and a barn. In combination with WPA and GLO files,-a clearer picture of the occupants of 41EL78 can be reconstructed. This was the initial B. F. Forrester Farmstead. Mrs. J. J. Bearden, Ellie Hollabough, and Dollie Underwood were other heirs to the estate. Interviews with local residents have indicated some of the complicated marriage and inheritance patterns of the Boz area, illustrated by this complicated inheritance. Fieldwork conducted at this site included a close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All surface features were mapped and distinctive artifacts were noted and described. In addition formal interviews were conducted with local residents, who provided identities of former residents. This 2500 square meter site (Figure 7-18) consists of a two story T-plan frame house (Plate 7-21), bam, corral, 2 cisterns, and a large scatter of Palmer brick. The house is in good condition for an abandoned structure, even though one of its two chimneys (built of sawn limestone blocks) has collapsed. A cistern and pump (Plate 7-22) are directly behind the house. The 6 meter by 12 meter barn is located 30 meters west of the house, with a second cistern and pile of boards and sheet metal located 30 meters further west. The artifact scatter is located in a plowed field to the east of the house. Porcelain; whiteware; stoneware; manganese solarized glass; two shades of green glass, and aqua and clear glass; metal; and commercial brick fragments were observed. These items date from 1890 to 1950. This site is recorded on the postal route map (ca. 1915), all four Ellis County highway maps, and the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute Quadrangle map. Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) has recorded this site (#4647) and gave it a construction date of 1885 with a high priority classification, From archival information, this house may actually have an initial construction date of 1869 with multiple construction/remodelling episodes represented afterwards. The farm yard does not appear to have been plowed, with plowing confined to the eastern portion of the site area. The major impact on this site has been weathering and the site is estimated to be approximately 85% complete. A two story mortise and beam structure in McKinney, Texas, has been tree-ring dated to 1856, which corresponds with archival and informant data on the wholesale shipment of large dwellings onto the 7-27 ey

, = blackland prairies Jurney 1987). Baldcypress, pine, and oak siding and large framing elements were shipped from east Texas to areas with few forest resources such as Ellis County's upland prairies. Site 41EL77, along with 41EL75 and 41EL80, has high potential for tree-ring dating. This site also has the potential to have isolatable components related to the 121 year occupation of the site. The information could be used to address Research Questions 10, 12, 13, 15, and 16, and is classified as high priority. Further archival, architectural, and archaeological evaluations are recommended for this high priority site. 41EL78 (SSC-4-21) This site, the likely remains of a homestead and tenant farm, currently consists of an artifact scatter and cistern. The site is located 120 meters east of Bethe! Road, 360 meters north of Boz Road on the east side of a north-south trending ridge. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,120, northing 3,577,300. The latitude is 32° 19' 03", longitude 96° 55° 37", and elevation is 650 feet above mean sea level. This is an upland site located 250 meters to the northwest of 41EL77. The nearest water source, located 120 meters to the west, is the Cottonwood Branch of Chambers Creek. The site is in a cultivated field (100% ground exposure) with locust trees lining the fences. The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 20 cm. Fragments of the Austin chalk bedrock are present in the plowed soil, which is common in the Boz area. This site is located within the May 22, 1850 Mercer's Colony grant to William S. Estes. Estes sold the certificate to Blumford Shankle on March 12, 1855. The tract was then surveyed in 1855. At that time the vegetation was all prairie. Since Shankle was a prominent land speculator with several tracts in the SSC area, it is doubtful that he resided on this tract. In 1936 this 130 acre tract was owned by Mrs. Emma Hampton of Waxahachie, who leased it to tenants. She acquired the property as a gift in 1916 (ECDB 273:569). One acre was reserved for the homes, 0.5 for garden, 108.5 was in cultivation (45 com, oats, hay; remainder cotton), and 20 acres were in pasture. All 130 acres were in need of terracing. A 1.5 story residence (41EL77) with 6 rooms, measuring 40 x 48 feet, and two shacks were occupied on the farm. In addition, there were 4 sheds and a barn. Fieldwork conducted at this site included a close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All surface features were mapped. Distinctive artifacts were described and photographed and left in place. This site (Figure 7-19) consists of a 2250 square meter artifact scatter and cistern. Artifacts include pinkish, light blue, manganese solarized, clear, and amber glass; painted porcelain; whiteware; stoneware; crumbling brick (handmade?); and metal fragments. The cistern is filled in with fence posts, wire, metal, soda glass, milk glass, porcelain, stoneware and brick fragments. No other features were observed. The artifacts observed date from 1910 to 1960. This site is shown on the postal route map (ca. 1915) and the 1941, 1955, and 1959 Ellis County highway maps. It does not appear on the 1964 Ellis County highway map, the Soil Conservation Service's 7-28

soil maps from their 1961 survey (Brooks et al. 1964), or the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map. This information and artifacts suggest a date of 1890-1950s for occupation of this site. This site has been extensively plowed over the last 30 years and has been impacted by cattle. Although the site may have started as a homestead, it was leased to tenants in the 1930s, Scrial occupation probably continued to the 1960s. Archival and informant information confirm that this site was not associated with significant historical events. The site is classified as low priority, and no further work is recommended. 41EL79 (SSC-4-22) The site is located 48 meters south of Old Maypearl Road, 800 meters east of Arrowhead Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,960, northing 3,579,240. The latitude is 32° 20° 05", longitude 96° 55° 05", and elevation is 720 feet above mean sea level. This is an upland site located 500 meters east of the Cottonwood Branch of Chambers Creek. The site is located in a plowed field (100% ground exposure) with 20 cm deep Austin silty clay. The vegetation was all prairie in 1852. This site is part of the George Casey grant. Casey received a bounty certificate from the Secretary of War on May, 1838, for service at San Jacinto during the Texas Revolution. The 640 acre tract was surveyed by G.W. Cunningham on June 30, 1952, for the Robertson Land District. The original tract has been split into fifteen different tracts. George Casey sold another unlocated certificate in Frio County to Nathaniel Hawthorne, who was a land entrepreneur who also obtained the Raphael de la Pena Survey. In 1936 this site was located on a 79 acre tract owned by J. R. Dunaway, who leased it to tenants (third and fourths). He had obtained the property through inheritance in 1903 (ECDB 141:192). In all, 2 acres were reserved for home, 0.5 acre for garden, 75.5 acres in cultivation (40 oats, hay; 35.5 cotton) and 1 acre was in pasture. All 79 acres were in need of terracing. Two dwellings were present, a three room residence measuring 36 x 32 feet and a shack. A shed and a barn rounded out the inventory. Fieldwork conducted at this site included a close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All surface features were mapped. Distinctive artifacts were described and photographed and left in place. This site currently consists (Figure 7-20) of a 3000 square meter artifact scatter. Artifacts include a blue glass cup handle; whiteware; yellow painted whiteware; a manganese solarized bottle neck without seams (1880-1890); amber, manganese solarized, light green, aqua, and dark blue glass; melted glass; stoneware; English made porcelain; burnt sandstone; commercial brick; and metal fragments. Most of these items date from 1900 to 1930. Two cistems, cattle feeders, and fences were also observed. Structures are shown at this site only on the postal route map (ca. 1915). The site would appear to date from ca. 1890 to the 1930s. The structures noted in 1936 indicate that a substantial farm complex was present. 7-29

a The short occupation period and the fact that it is known to have been a tenant farm owned by one of the earliest families to settle in Ellis County makes this site important in the understanding of the tenant farm system in Ellis County (Research Questions 10 and 13). This site is classified as medium priority and further evaluation is recommended. 41EL80 (SSC-4-23) The site is located on a east-west road between Arrowhead Road and Curry Road. 70 meters west of Sims Road, 1.05 km east of Arrowhead Road and 500 meters east of Curry Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 697,600, northing 3,576,700. The latitude is 32° 18' 41", longitude 96° 54' 03", and elevation is 680 feet above mean sea level. This upland site is located 480 meters south of an intermittent stream that drains into Baker Branch, 640 meters to the northwest. The vegetation consists of grasses and weeds (20-30% ground exposure) with one large pecan tree. Part of the site area is in a plowed field (100% ground exposure). The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 20 cm. This site is part of James Jefferson Mallard's land grant. He received his grant for 320 acres from Mercer's Colony on February 17, 1852. G.W. Cunningham surveyed the tract for the Robertson Land District on July 17, 1854. This tract has been split up and recombined with other tracts. Fieldwork conducted at this site included a close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All surface features were mapped. Distinctive artifacts were described and photographed and left in place in the field. This site (Figure 7-21) consists of two abandoned houses (Plates 7-23 and 7-24), three outbuildings, a concrete storm cellar, a pump shed (Plate 7-25), and a very deep, collapsed well, and an artifact scatter all covering 18,000 square meters. This site appears to be an integral complex and may actually include 41EL81. The largest house (Plate 7-23) has an original core which was a braced frame made of hewn oaks (local) with sawn pine studs and siding, and cut nails. A fireplace chimney was present constructed of sawn limestone block set on sandstone slabs. The braced frame house was subsequently enlarged with sawn pine lumber (box and strip), and has high potential for tree-ring dating of construction and remodeling episodes. The second house (Plate 7-24) was made of sawn pine lumber (box and strip) with all wire nails. During the field survey the yard was in tall, dense grass with little visibility. A plowed field that forms the northern portion of the site yielded manganese solarized, aqua, amber, milk, and clear glass; an amber bottleneck without threads (ca. 1880-1890); aqua stoneware tile; whiteware with green stencil pattern; porcelain; cut nails; and brick fragments. These items date from ca. 1880 to 1960. This site appears on the postal route map (ca. 1915), all of the Ellis County highway maps except for 1941, and the USGS map. It is believed the absence of this site from the 1941 Ellis County highway map reflects the inaccuracy of the 1941 map, since artifact types and the structural type point to an initial occupation of around 1890 for the larger of the two houses and a date of 1910 for the second, smaller house. 7-30

Es ia . Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) has recorded these two houses and assigns a date of 1885 for the larger (#4661) house (described as a L-plan) and 1915 for the smaller house (#4662). We estimate occupation to have continued until around 1960. Integrity is good, around 95%, with only a limited portion of the site having been plowed. Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) consider this to be a high priority site. Currently we consider it to be medium priority and recommend further architectural and archaeological evaluation. There is extensive reuse of the site during the twentieth century. This site could potentially address Research Questions 10, 12, and 16. Archival research is needed to better understand the possible association between this farmstead and site 41EL81 located 200 meters to the west. 41EL81 (SSC-4-24) The site is located 24 meters north of a northeast-southwest trending dirt road, 720 meters west of Curry Road, 260 meters west of Sims Road, 1.35 km south of Boz Road and 850 meters east of Arrowhead Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 697,300, northing 3,576,660. The latitude is 32° 18' 40", longitude 96° 54' 15", and elevation ranges from 660-670 feet above mean sea level. This upland site is located 500 meters east of Baker Branch. The vegetation in this area is grasses (20% exposure) with the surrounding fields being used as grazed pasture (50% ground exposure). The soil type is the ubiquitous Austin silty clay with a depth of 10 to 20 cm. John Davenport received the 218 acre land grant on which this site is located. The land certificate was granted by Mercer's Colony on January 16, 1850 and transferred by Davenport to Obediah Stevenson on October 18, 1853. G.W. Cunningham surveyed this tract for the Robertson Land District on July 15, 1854. This tract has been split up and recombined with other tracts. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All structures and surface features were closely examined, photographed, and mapped. Temporally diagnostic artifacts were examined, photographed, and left in the field. This 4000 square meter site (Figure 7-22) consists of two houses; a one story rectangular house located 25 meters north of the road, and a one story modified L-plan house with a chimney is located 100 meters north of the road and 25 meters further west of the first house. There is also a shed and a barn at this site. Artifacts found scattered behind the L-plan structure included porcelain, whiteware, clear and amber glass, thin metal, clear cut glass, stoneware, brick, and old soda bottles. These items date from ca 1900-1960. This site appears on the postal route map (ca. 1915), all four Ellis County highway maps, and the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map. The 1941 highway map is once again questionable, showing a road layout that does not agree with our other maps. Site integrity is good, about 95%, with impact from the plowing of a small portion of the site and some cattle activity. 7-31

J Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) date these structures at 1920 for the modified L-plan house(#4663) and 1895 for the rectangular house (#4664). They consider these two houses and the two houses from 41EL80 to have formed a small rural community and give them all high priority. Our date for these houses is based on the artifact scatter found behind the modified L-plan house. A date of 1920 as initial occupation is given to this structure, which agrees with Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990)'s estimate. Since no artifacts were observed in the immediate vicinity of the second house, we can offer no support or refutation for the 1895 date assigned by Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990). Occupation is believed to have continued until around 1960. We currently consider this site to be of medium priority and recommend further architectural and archaeological evaluation. Archival research is needed to better understand the connection of this farmstead to houses at site 41EL80 located 200 meters to the east. If this indeed can be considered a cohesive rural community, then Research Questions 10, 13, 14, and 16 may be addressed. 41EL82 (SSC-4-25) The site is located 20 meters west of Bethel Road, 700 meters south of Old Maypearl Road and 820 meters north of the intersection of Boz Road and Old Maypearl Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 694,740, northing 3,577,710. The latitude is 32° 19’ 17", longitude 96° 55‘ 53", and elevation is 670 feet above mean sea level. 41EL82 is located between two arms of the upper drainage of Cottonwood Branch, with a distance of 200 meters to the closest stream. The area is currently covered with closely grazed grasses with 50% to 60% ground exposure, The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 20 cm. This site is part of the George W. Whitfield (sic) script land grant. This tract was granted by Ellis County and was surveyed for Ellis County by R.M. Wyatt on March 24, 1869. This tract is now split into three tracts. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All structures and surface features were closely examined, photographed, and mapped. Distinctive artifacts were noted, described, photographed, and left in place. The site (Figure 7-23) consists of a 1.5 story central-hall house (Plate 7-26), standing commercial brick cistern, collapsed shed, and the remains of a barn. The wood frame house, which is in poor condition, has an asphalt shingle roof and composition shingle siding. An addition has been added to the rear of the house. The barn now consists of wood piers and sill beams and a scatter of boards and sheet metal. The collapsed shed is immediately behind the house. A 2500 square meter artifact scatter consisting of tin, boards, metal and car parts, bottles, and commercial brick fragments surrounds the features. A dump in the southwest comer of the farm yard has numerous bottles (mainly soda bottles dating to the 1960s), car and tractor parts, wire, lawn mowers, and two children’s riding toys. 7-32

f 7) a Occupation of the site is estimated to date from around 1900 to the 1960s with intense utilization in * the third quarter of the twentieth century. Since few diagnostic artifacts were found during survey, this is a crude estimate. The dump area indicates mass consumption of commercial foods at the site. Hardy-Heck- Moore (1990)'s evaluation of this house (#4620) dates it to 1885 to 1890. This site appears on all four Ellis County highway maps and the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map, which confirms its presence at this location for the last fifty years. Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) assigned a medium priority to this site. Weathering and bovine activity have been the major impacts to this site, with modifications to the house also impacting its integrity. Integrity is estimated to be only 75% even though there is still a standing structure at this site. This site is classified as medium priority, agreeing with Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990)'s assessment. Further evaluation is recommended to clarify the age of this farmstead, since there may bea potential to yield information on Research Questions 10, 12, and 16. 41EL83 (SSC-4-26) The site is located 220 meters south of FM 1446 and 540 meters east of Arrowhead Road, 120 meters south of site 41EL62 (SSC-1-5) and 240 meters north of 41EL59 (SSC-1-2). The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 694,180, northing 3,582,200. The latitude is 32° 21° 44", longitude 96° 56° 10", and elevation is 745 feet above mean sea level. This upland site is located in a wooded area between 41EL59 and 41EL62 at the head of an intermittent stream. The woods are a thick secondary growth of honey locust, small tress and bushes. Visibility is poor (20%) due to dense grasses and weeds. The soil type is Eddy gravelly clay loam with a depth of 20 cm. The original grantee for this land was Barksdale W. Wade, who received a 152 acre grant from Mercer's Colony on April 29, 1850. It was surveyed by Posey G. Gordon on July 26, 1856 for the Robertson Land District. This tract has been subdivided. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All structural ruins and surface features were closely examined, photographed, and mapped. The presence of artifacts and debris on the ground surface indicates fairly recent occupation. The site consists of a fallen commercial brick chimney, scattered commercial brick and boards, and fairly modern bottles with screw and crimped cap tops. The main scatter of artifacts measures approximately 50 square meters, although tin and bottles are scattered over a 2000 square meter area. No cistern or well was observed. The 1955 Ellis County highway map and the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map show a structure at this site. No structures appear at this location on the 1959 and 1964 Ellis County highway maps or the Soil Conservation Service soil map (Brooks et al., 1964). Whether this site is on the 7-33

1941 highway map is unclear since this map shows farmsteads and not individual structures, nor is it clear if this site is shown on the postal route map (ca. 1915). It appears that structures remained at this site until the late 1950s with utilization of this area as a dump from 1960 onward. Site integrity appears to be low, with plowing, cattle activity, removal of structural ruins, and dumping having disturbed the site. Archival research does not indicate any association with historically significant individuals or events. This site is classified as low priority. Due to the recent age of the structure and site, it is not likely to yield information relevant to the historic Research Questions. 41EL84 (SSC-4-27) The site is located 20 meters west of Arrowhead Road, 540 meters east of Bethel Road, 1.2 km south of Boz Road and 1.08 «m. west of 41EL80 (SSC-4-23). The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 696,580, northing 3,576,360. The latitude is 32° 18' 30", longitude 96° 54' 49", and elevation ranges from 610-620 feet above mean sea level. This site is located directly adjacent to Baker Branch. General Land Office records indicate the nineteenth century vegetation consisted of prairie with elm and willows observed along the stream. Currently the site has grass cover with a dense stand of honey locust trees. The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 20 cm. Ground visibility ranged from 30% to 50%, with 100% exposure in some areas. The original grantee for this tract was William B. Herron, who received his grant from Mercer's Colony on June 8, 1850. The property was surveyed by G.W. Cunningham on June 4, 1852, for the Robertson Land District. The tract was split with 200 acres being assigned to E.M. Brack and 120 acres retained by William Herron. This 120 acre tract appears to still retain its original property boundaries. The 200 acre parcel is to the southwest and is discussed in the description of site 41EL74. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All structures and surface features were closely examined, photographed, and mapped. Diagnostic artifacts were noted and described and left in the field. This 3600 square meter site (Figure 7-24) consists of a standing one story, two room house; shed; bam; and two wells with pumps. The house measures 4 by 9 meters, is of frame construction, and contains a gas heater (Detroit Jewel). A glass marble and lock were located near the house door. The barn is located 50 meters west of the house and measures 8 by 10 meters. The southern pump is across Baker Branch from the house and was manufactured by F. E. Myers and Bro. Co. with a neck of Palmer brick. The northern pump, located about 25 meters behind the house, is electric. A 200 square meter artifact scatter west of the house includes light green, clear, and amber glass; painted milk glass; plain and decorated whiteware with a transfer print; porcelain; cast iron fragments; and brick fragments. All of these items post-date 1920. 7-34 a C {— {__} eS aa] ay 3) T~ ™

A shed is located west of the house and barn, across a fenceline. A 500 square meter artifact scatter surrounds the shed and contains a horseshoe, wooden boards, sheet metal, bricks, and manganese solarized and clear glass. Due to its location across a fenceline and the older artifacts associated with this structure, this shed probably is associated with a second farmstead that is shown on the 1955, 1959, and 1964 Ellis County maps west of 41EL84. This second farmstead is not shown on the 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map or the Soil Conservation Service's soil maps (Brooks et al.1964). The 1938 WPA survey reported no improvements for the tract. The 1955, 1959, and 1964 Ellis County highway maps all show two farmsteads in this general location, one by Baker Branch and a second further west. The 1960 (1978 update) USGS Boz 7.5 minute quadrangle map shows the house and barn at this location with no structures to the west. The 1941 Ellis County highway map shows just one farmstead at this location while the postal route map (ca. 1915) is unclear as to structures. : Occupation of the site is estimated to date from 1920 to 1960. The second farmstead to the west appears to date from around 1900. Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) have also recorded this site (#4659), reporting a two room, one story wooden house, barn, and cistern/well across the creek. They estimated the date of construction as 1925 and assigned a low priority to this site. Integrity for 41EL84 appears to be good with structures remaining at the site and no evidence that the site has been plowed since abandonment. A medium priority has been assigned to this house. Further archival and informant information may demonstrate that this site could address Research Questions 10, 11, and 14, 41EL85 (SSC-5-28) The site is located 25 meters south of Buena Vista Road, 850 meters west of Arrowhead Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 692,910, northing 3,581,670. The latitude is 32° 21' 25", longitude 96° 57’ 00", and elevation is 750 feet above mean sea level. Site 41EL85 is located in the uplands and is currently used as pasture. Small intermittent streams that form the headwaters of Greathouse Branch are the nearest water source, 300 meters to the south. The larger South Prong Creek is 4 km to the east. The soil type at this location is Eddy gravelly clay loam. The presettlement vegetation was solely prairie. Ground visibility ranges from 30% to 100% in the portions of the site exposed by cattle traffic. Site 41EL85 is located on the Simon White Survey for 640 acres. This tract was assigned to James Phillips (deceased), surveyed in 1874, and then sold to Emma Cantrell in 1877. Emma Cantrell could have been the first occupant of this tract, but the structures which were noted during field survey do not date this early. The WPA file for this tract was destroyed by water damage in the Ellis County Courthouse. Fieldwork conducted at this site included two independent close interval (5 meter) pedestrian surveys. All structures and surface features were closely examined, photographed, and mapped. Distinctive artifacts 7-35

= } were noted, described, photographed, and left in place. Intensive cattle activity had produced erosion around the dwelling, exposing bedrock. This early twentieth century farmstead at the western edge of the West Campus consists of two standing structures (Figure 7-25). The structure nearest Buena Vista Road (Plates 7-27 and 7-28) is a cross- gable house (specified as T-plan in Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990)'s evaluation, #4610). Recycling of a earlier Structure is indicated by the eastem wing of the house. This wing is clapboard over a board and batten construction. The internal superstructure is partially constructed using cut nails and sawn pine lumber and is estimated to date from ca. 1890. These sills and wall studs were recycled from another structure which does not appear to have been located at this site. The other three wings of the structure consist of clapboard over stud frame and are constructed entirely with wire nails, with an estimated date of ca. 1930. Sawn lumber was used throughout, with 2 x 8 inch pine sills in the east wing and 10 x 10 inch pine sills in the rest of the structure. The sills rest on both cedar and bois d'arc pilings. This structure is in poor condition; between its initial survey on May 7, 1990 and a follow-up survey on July 6, 1990, one sill supporting the western wing had collapsed. The second structure 100 meters to the southwest is a partially collapsed pole barn dating to approximately 1940. A scatter of lumber 10 meters southwest of the house may be from a third, collapsed structure. A cistern located 4 meters from the house is constructed of both machine made and hand made brick. A second cistern 120 meters from the house is constructed entirely of commercial brick and was used to water livestock. Milk glass, window glass, whitewares, and a glass marble were observed around the house, all of which date to the twentieth century. These items were exposed in the cattle traffic area. The observed artifact scatter and yard features (fence, trees, cistern) cover 3600 square meters. : Structures appear at this location on the postal route map (ca. 1915), all of the Ellis County highway maps, and the 1960 USGS map (1978 update). The major disturbance to this site has been from bovine activity. The site area is curently used as pasture. Modern metal stock troughs in the farm yard indicate heavy utilization of the immediate vicinity. It does not appear that the immediate vicinity of the house has been plowed; therefore the farmyard should still be reasonably intact, with some mixing due to cattle trampling. Based on all appearances of the farmstead and the organization of structures, the house, barn, and wells were constructed around 1930-1940, using some recycled materials. Since it was built of commercially milled pine lumber, there is low potential for tree-ring dating. This site does not appear to contain information relevant to the historic Research Questions and is classified as low priority. No further work is recommended. 41EL87 (SSC-5-31) The site is located 700 meters south of FM 1446, 440 meters east of Ewing Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,160, 7-36

northing 3,582,400. The latitude is 32° 21' 47", longitude 96° 55° 35", and elevation is 680 feet above mean sea level. This artifact scatter borders an intermittent stream that drains the surrounding upland area. The soil type is a Stephen-Eddy complex with soil depth from 5 to 20 cm. The presettlement vegetation was prairie. Heavy cattle traffic has produced 100% ground visibility. This site is located in the Placido Olivari grant, granted from the Bexar Land District on February 26, 1837. This grant was sold to Calvin Emmons on August 28, 1837. The actual land tract was surveyed in 1846. At that time the area was entirely prairie with two walnut trees observed along South Prong Creek at the eastern edge of the tract. The WPA file for this tract has been destroyed. Fieldwork conducted at this site included a close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All structures and surface features were closely examined and mapped. Diagnostic artifacts were noted, photographed, described, and left in the field. This site (Figure 7-26) is currently being used as a cattle watering and feeding area (Plate 7-29) and includes a moder semi-trailer that has been converted into an outbuilding. The site itself consists of a relatively heavy scatter of whiteware, blue and green glass, and manganese solarized glass, dating from 1890 to 1940. The main artifact scatter is approximately 1500 square meters with an additional 500 square meter scatter eroding downslope. Approximately 20 meters south of the artifact scatter is a dump containing recent farm equipment, chain-link fence, and painted lumber. This site has been severely disturbed by bovine activity, erosion, dumping, and plowing. This disturbance, plus the absence of any features, leaves little doubt as to the nearly complete lack of integrity at this site. Also, no structures are shown at this location on the postal route map (ca. 1915) or any of the Ellis County highway maps. A structure is shown on the 1978 USGS map for this location, but this is most likely the outbuilding/trailer discussed above. Archival and informant research does not indicate any special historical significance. This area is currently used as a dump and has been used as such for at least twenty years. This site is classified as low priority and has little potential to address the Historic Research Questions; no further work is recommended. 41EL88 (SSC-5-32) The site is located 540 meters north of FM 1446, 660 meters west of Hoyt Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 693,010, northing 3,582,400. The latitude is 32° 21' 49", longitude 96° 56' 56", and elevation is 770 feet above mean sea level. Site 41EL88 is an upland site nearly a kilometer from the nearest water source, an intermittent stream draining into South Prong Creek. The soil type is Eddy gravelly clay loam with a depth of approximately 10 cm. This area was open prairie in 1855. Ground visibility was excellent, ranging from 80% to 100% except for the area immediately surrounding the house. 7-37 eS

| 41EL88 is part of the John Estes land grant. This was granted to the heirs of John and Sarah Estes on May 2, 1850 by Mercer's Colony and Kaufman County. This 295 acre grant was transferred to Blumford Shankle who located the property on March 3, 1855. W.W. Parks surveyed this tract for the Robertson Land District on October 19, 1855. In 1936 this tract belonged to J.C. Turner, who obtained the property in 1904 (ECDB 150:209). Site 41EL88 was his residence at that time. In all, two acres were reserved for the home, 0.5 acre for garden, 150 acres for cultivation (70 com and oats, 80 cotton) and 40 acres in pasture. Two dwellings were present: a nine room 1.5 story residence measuring 40 x 42 feet, which was built in 1895; and a five room "shack" measuring 32 x 36 feet. which was built in 1927. In addition to the dwellings, nine sheds and a barn were present. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All structures and surface fedtures were closely examined, photographed, and mapped. Diagnostic artifacts were described, photographed, and left in the field. This site (Figure 7-27) currently consists of a dense 6000 square meter scatter of manganese solarized glass, window glass, whiteware, blue glass, wire nails, milk glass, and metal fragments dating from ca. 1900 to the present, The western side of the site is currently used as a cattle pen; the eastern side contains an occupied 1 story house. The house is in excellent condition and has been extensively modified. Since this house does not appear to have nine rooms, it may be the 1927 structure described by the WPA survey as a shack. Alternatively, the older structures may have been tom down and replaced by a newer dwelling. Within the cattle pen is a concrete stock trough and possible well (Plate 7-30) that may relate to an earlier use of this site. A farmstead is shown at this location on all four Ellis County highway maps and the 1960 USGS map (1978 update). No structures are shown here on the postal route map (ca. 1915), which conflicts with the WPA data and suggests that the postal map may not be completely accurate. The occupation at 41EL88 is estimated to date from 1895 to 1990. The removal of the original farmhouse, cattle tampling, and plowing have disturbed the integrity of this site. The area immediately surrounding the house may still maintain a good deal of integrity, but the serial occupation of this house detracts from the integrity of the deposits. Archival information indicates that J.C. Turner was a prominent local rancher and was an officer of the Ellis County Agricultural Extension Service. This site could potentially address Research Questions 10, 12, and 16. Since there are standing structures, there could be some intact deposits relating to Turner’s and earlier occupations. Further evaluations are recommended. 41EL89 (SSC-6-33) The site is located 900 meters south of FM 1446, 1.3 km east of Ewing Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,720, 7-38

mH Es a t northing 3,582,850. The latitude is 32° 22' 02", longitude 96° 55' 10”, and elevation is 750 feet above mean sea level. This site (Figure 7-28) is located at the top edge of an upland slope, approximately 120 meters south of an intermittent stream that flows into South Prong Creek located 970 km to the east. The soil type is a Stephen-Eddy complex with a depth of 5 to 10 cm at the top of the slope. Downslope there has been extensive erosion with bedrock exposed in many areas giving 100% ground exposure. In other sloping areas there are sparse grasses that provide 80% ground exposure, on the upper slope margins there are heavier grasses and brush with only 20% ground exposure. This site is located in the Placido Olivari survey (1-4811/2, A812), granted from the Bexar Land District on February 26, 1837. This grant was sold to Calvin Emmons on August 28, 1837. The actual land tract was surveyed in 1846. At that time the area was entirely prairie with two walnut trees observed along South Prong Creek at the eastern edge of the tract. The WPA file for this tract has been destroyed. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All surface features, site impacts, erosional areas, and artifact scatters were closely examined, photographed, and mapped. Diagnostic artifacts were noted, described, and photographed and left in the field. The site consists of a dense 2000 square meter artifact scatter (Plate 7-31) consisting of manganese solarized glass, whiteware, a ceramic caster, metal fragments, buckles, snaps, cut nails, stoneware, and commercial brick. The majority of these artifacts were observed in a wide, shallow gully. The heaviest concentration of artifacts is at the head of the gully at the top of the slope. Artifacts can also be observed at the top of the slope in an area of at least 1000 square meters but exact density cannot be estimated due to heavy ground cover. The material that was observed dates from ca. 1900 to 1930. This site appears only on the postal route map (ca. 1915). Occupation is estimated to range from 1890 to 1930 with a strong 1920 to 1930 component. Erosion and plowing have severely impacted this site and exposed most of the artifacts. The site has been classified as low priority. It is felt that the deposits will not provide information relevant to any of the Research Questions and no further work is recomm :nded. 41EL90 (SSC-6-34) The site is located 350 meters south of FM 1446, 1180 meters east of Crownover Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,800, northing 3,583,140. The latitude is 32° 22' 12", longitude 96° 55° 05", and elevation is 650 feet above mean sea level. This is an upland site on a gentle slope bordering an intermittent stream that drains into South Prong Creek, 725 meters to the east. The house is 140 meters north of this intermittent stream. The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 20 cm. Ground visibility ranges from 10% to 20% with 100% visibility at the western edge of the site. 7-39

This site is located in the Placido Olivari survey (1-4811/2, A812), which was granted by the Bexar Land District on February 26, 1837. This grant was sold to Calvin Emmons on August 28, 1837. The actual land tract was surveyed in 1846. At that time the area was entirely prairie with two walnut trees observed along South Prong Creek at the eastern edge of the tract. The WPA file for this tract has been destroyed. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All structures and surface features were closely examined, photographed, and mapped. This farmstead site (Figure 7-29) consists of a house (Plate 7-32) and modern well covering 3600 square meters with dump areas outside of the site limits. No barn or outbuildings are present. The entire area is densely vegctated, and this plus the large number of bees and wasps inhabiting the house, have made a closer survey difficult. The house is pine clapboard over sawn and milled pine studs, wit’. cut nails in the framing and wire nails in the clapboard. This house appears on the postal route map (ca. 1915) and the 1960 USGS map. It is not on any of the Ellis County highway maps even though it undoubtedly was present. Its location makes it impossible to see from the closest road, which may explain its absence from these maps. Initial construction is estimated to date to ca. 1890-1900 with a rear addition added at a later date, based on the milled pine lumber and cut and wire nails. The condition of the house, which is fair, and modern refuse indicate that the house was most likely occupied until approximately 20 years ago. The area surrounding the house has been used as a dump in recent years, with piping, sheet metal, a 1970s Ford Mustang II, and lumber making up the majority of discarded material. There is evidence for several episodes of burning of trash, and pits have been dug into bedrock to accommodate the refuse. Since there is standing architecture it is possible that this site does have some integrity. However, archival information indicates little historical significance. There is some potential to address Research Question 12. The site is classified as medium priority and further evaluation of the historical and archaeological contexts are recommended. 41EL91 (SSC-6-35) The site is 100 meters east of Ebenezer Road, 620 meters north of Tammy Lane. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 716,350, northing 3,587,520. The latitude is 32° 24° 20", longitude 96° 41° 59", and elevation is 480 feet above mean sea level. This upland site is located 30 meters from the top of the slope bordering the Grove Creek floodplain. Grove Creek is 380 meters north of the site and Cottonwood Creek is 1.25 km to the south. The vegetation is primarily grass (40% to 70% ground exposure) with a few scattered small trees along the slopes. The site and entire field were plowed in August, 1990, providing 100% ground exposure. The soil type is Houston clay with a depth of 20 cm. There are two creeks in this area called "Cottonwood".

these two creeks is the one referred to in this section. The creek called Cottonwood to the north is actually outside of the project area. A third creek which flows through Boz in western Ellis County is referred to in this report as "Cottonwood Branch" by local informants although it is unnamed on the USGS and other maps. This site is located on the boundary between the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railroad Company (BBB&C RR Co.) and the Peter Stout Survey. Peter Stout was a Peters’ Colonialist who lived in Tarrant County in 1850 but had moved to Ellis County by 1860. Peter Stout or his descendents may have resided at either site 41EL91, 41EL93, or 41EL95. Site 41EL95 is the most likely location of Peter Stout's initial farm, based on artifacts that were present. Peter Stout was granted the tract containing these sites in 1850 and had it surveyed in 1851. The vegetation consisted of elm, ash, and hackberry adjacent to prairie. A legal suit between Stout and Randolph Townsend (4-25-1860), who was the heir to the Pena Survey through Nathaniel Townsend, ended in a judgement in Stout's favor. The WPA files for the Stout Survey have apparently been destroyed. ~ Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All surface features and diagnostic artifacts were closely examined, photographed, and mapped. The site was revisited after it was plowed in August, 1990. The site boundaries, depth of deposit (20 cm), and artifact distributions were confirmed. ) Site 41EL91 is a farmstead site (Figure 7-30) without standing structures. Two features were observed: the first is a commercial brick fireplace foundation (Plate 7-33) located 100 meters east of Ebenezer Road, and the second is a collapsed outbuilding 20 meters east of Ebenezer Road. Bois d'arc piers were also observed in the area of the fireplace, along with a 5000 square meter artifact scatter. This scatter consists of bottle glass, tableware, commercial brick, and stove parts. When the site was plowed, the fireplace foundation was avoided, but the piers were plowed over. Initial occupation appears to be around 1890 with an intense 1940 to 1960 occupation. A farmstead or structures are shown here on the postal route map (ca. 1915), the 1941, 1955, and 1959 Ellis County highway maps, ana the 1960 USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle map (1978 update). The site area, which is currently pasture, has been recently plowed and has suffered some cattle trampling exposing cultural materials. Even with this disturbance this site still exhibits fair integrity. However, with the intense post World War II occupation, this site offers little potential to address the historic Research Questions. This site is classified as low priority and no further work is recommended. 41EL92 (SSC-6-36) The site is located 880 meters east of Ebenezer Road and 160 meters north of Tammy Lane. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 717,130, northing 3,587,000.

C J This level upland site has intermittent drainage channels located 150 meters to the southwest and 260 meters to the northwest. Grove Creek is located 1.05 km to the north and Cottonwood Creek is located 950 meters to the south. The soil is Houston black clay with a depth of 20 cm. Ground exposure varies between 100% in plowed areas to 30% in vegetated areas. This site is located on the boundary between the R.A. Davis and BBB&C RR Company Surveys, falling primarily in the BBB&C RR Company tract. The railroad's tract was laid out in 1861, and was a Script grant compensating the railroad for laying tracks. This area was entirely prairie, with a single cottonwood noted in a low-lying area. R.A. Davis, a prominent land surveyor and land entrepreneur, obtained a 145 acre portion of the BBB&C RR Company Survey, which was inherited by Mrs. J. B. George in 1901. In 1937, both sites 41EL92 and 41EL94 were shown on the WPA plot map. Three acres ‘ were reserved for the homes, 1 acre for garden, 132 acres in cultivation (20 corn and oats, and remainder in cotton), 4 acres in wasteland and 5 acres in pasture. The residences both had four rooms, measuring 28 x 34 feet and 22 x 30 feet, and were in good condition. Fieldwork conducted at this site included two independent close interval (5 meter) pedestrian surveys. All structures and surface features were closely examined, photographed, and mapped. Diagnostic artifacts were examined and documented and left in the field. At site 41EL92 (Figure 7-31) the location of a house and two outbuildings has been identified. The house site is in a cotton field and is marked by a moderately dense scatter of commercial brick, bottle glass, and tableware covering 5000 square meters. Next to this area, at the end of a farm road, are the remains of two farm buildings. This area is heavily overgrown and has not been plowed. Concrete piers, wood, and sheet metal were observed in this area. The artifacts date from ca. 1890-1900 to 1960, This site appears on the postal route map (ca. 1915), all Ellis County highway maps except for the 1941 version, and the 1963 USGS quadrangle map (1978 update). The artifacts that were observed indicate occupation starting around 1890-1900 and continuing until approximately 1960, with a large portion being mid-twentieth century. The house site has been extensively plowed and appears to have little or no integrity left. The area containing the outbuildings has not been extensively disturbed but only represents approximately 30% of the existing site. ) The archival information indicates that this site was serially occupied by tenants and does not have historic significance. There is little potential for this site to contribute information relevant to the Research Questions. It is classified as low priority and no further work is recommended. 41EL93 (SSC-6-37) Peter Stout Tenant The site is located 1.05 km east of Ebenezer Road and 930 meters north of Tammy Lane. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 717,280, northing 3,587,470. The latitude is 32° 24' 18", longitude 96° 41' 24", and elevation is 470 feet above mean sea level. 7-42

oo. LS se i ei f ] g i { } This is an upland site near the top edge of a slope bordering the Grove Creek floodplain. An intermittent stream is 140 meters to the west and Grove Creek is 500 meters to the north. The vegetation consists partly of a grove of bois d'arc trees with a sparse grass undergrowth (50% to 70% ground exposure) adjacent to a plowed cotton field (100% ground exposure). The soil type is Houston black clay with a depth of 20 cm. This site is located on the boundary between the BBB&C RR Co. and the Peter Stout Surveys. Peter Stout was a Peters’ Colonialist who lived in Tarrant County in 1850 (Connor 1959) but had moved to Ellis County by 1860, according to census records. Peter Stout or his descendents may have resided at either site 41EL91, 41EL93, or 41EL95. He was granted the tract containing these sites in 1850 and had it surveyed in 1851, The vegetation consisted of elm, ash, and hackberry adjacent to prairie. A legal suit between Stout and Randolph Townsend (4-25-1860), who was the heir to the Pena Survey through Nathaniel Townsend, ended in a judgement in Stout's favor. The WPA files for the Stout Survey have apparently been destroyed. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. Diagnostic artifacts were examined and photographed and left in the field. The bois d’arc trees and the associated artifact distributions were mapped. This farmstead site (Figure 7-32) is partially located in a grove of bois d'arc trees (Plates 7-34 and 7-35) with approximately 20% of the site extending into a plowed cotton field. The bois d'arc trees were planted by the sites’ occupants, and this represents a hedge. While no features were observed, a 2500 square meter artifact scatter consisting of manganese solarized glass, whiteware, bottle glass, and a spoon was observed. The artifacts indicated a short time span of approximately 1890 to 1920 for occupation of this site, with the number of artifacts indicating fairly intensive use of this location. No structures appear at this site on any of the postal and highway maps maps, which may indicate that the terminal date of this site predates any of these maps. Also, since the site is quite distant (.25 mile) from the nearest road, it may not have been mapped at any time. While plowing has disturbed approximately 20% of this site, the central portion within the bois d'arc hedge appears to be relatively undisturbed with no plowing evident. Minor erosion and structure removal have been the major disturbances. The temporal range of the artifacts corresponds with the period of ownership by Peter Stout. The site may have been used by his children or by tenants. The possible association with historically significant persons, the relatively short occupation period, and good integrity indicates that this site has potential to provide information regarding farm success (Research Question 12) and the settlement responses to the introduction of the railroad (Research Question 11). This site is classified as high priority and further evaluations are recommended. : 41EL94 (SSC-6-38) The site is located 940 meters east of Ebenezer Road, 25 meters south of Tammy Lane. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 7-43

No features were observed. The time period of occupation indicated is from approximately 1900 to 1970. Structures are shown at this location only on the postal route map (ca. 1915) and the 1941 Ellis County highway map. This site has been extensively plowed and disturbed. Also, the serial occupancy and use detracts from the potential to address the Historic Research Questions. Archival research indicates no historic significance for this site or its occupants.

— ie This site is located on the boundary between the BBB&C RR Co. and the Peter Stout Surveys. Peter Stout was a Peters' Colonialist who lived in Tarrant County in 1850 (Connor 1951) but had moved to Ellis County by 1860, according to the census records. Peter Stout or his descendents may have resided at either site 41EL91, 41EL93, or 41EL95. He was granted the tract containing these sites in 1850 and had it surveyed in 1851. The vegetation consisted of elm, ash, and hackberry adjacent to prairie. A legal suit between Stout and Randolph Townsend (4-25-1860), who was the heir to the Pena Survey through Nathaniel Townsend, ended in a judgement in Stout's favor. The WPA files for the Stout Survey have apparently been destroyed. The Searches and Researches of Ellis County (2, 3), which are on file at the Sims Library, mention Peter Stout. This information was reprinted in the Ennis Daily News (February 1978) and the Palmer Rustler Special Edition (1928): "Among the first to brave the hardships and privations in taking out homestead rights within a radius of 15 miles of Palmer, where Palmer now stands were Peter Stout, Solomon Barron, Al Stacks, Lambert Pace, Smith Greathouse, and a few others." (Palmer Rustler 1928) Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. Diagnostic artifacts were examined and photographed and left in the field. The site is currently a moderately dense to dense historic artifact scatter totaling 5000 square meters, starting under a grove of hackberry trees and extending downslope. Artifacts include manganese solarized glass, cut nails, blue and green shell edge ceramics dating from 1840s to 1850s, tableware dating from the 1870s to 1880s, and hotel ware from the 1950s or 1960s. Intense twentieth century utilization of this site is indicated by the relative abundance of artifacts from this period observed. Structures are marked at this location on the postal route map (ca. 1915) and the 1941 and 1955 Ellis County highway map. Occupation is estimated to date from the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century. This is most likely the original Peter Stout farmstead. It is known from census records that Stout moved from Tarrant County to Ellis County between 1850 and 1860 (Ellis County Genealogy Society 1985: 25) and the material culture corresponds to that period. Disturbances to the site include erosion of the site's northern fourth, some cattle trampling, and possible plowing, and it has had intensive twentieth century use, mixing the components. However, this site could have the potential to address questions about the pattern of settlement, marriage alliances, community formation, and material culture questions (Research Questions 9, 12, 13, and 16). It is located just outside the East Campus, but may suffer indirect impacts. It is classified as high priority, and further evaluations are recommended. 7-45

41EL100 (SSC-7-44) The site is located at the northeast corner of the intersection of Hoyt Road and FM 1446 (Buena Vista Road). The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 693,890, northing 3,582,330. The latitude is 32° 21' 42", longitude 96° 56' 20", and elevation is 750 feet above mean sea level. This site is located in an upland area bordered on the north by an intermittent stream. The soil is Eddy gravelly clay loam with a maximum depth of 10 cm. Ground visibility ranges from 30% to 50% and chalk rock fragments were exposed on the ground surface. The main portion of this site is part of the grant given to George W. Keen by Mercer's Colony and Kaufman County on May 2, 1850. This tract was surveyed by R.A. Davis on May 19, 1860 for Ellis County. This tract has been split and subdivided. The WPA files for this survey have .,parently been destroyed. In 1936 the adjacent tract to the west belonged to J.C. Turner who obtained the property in 1904 (ECDB 150:209) with 0.5 acres reserved for the Buena Vista School. The plat map indicates a structure west of Hoyt Road. The area around this structure has been used for storing gravel by the county road department and is no longer standing. In fact, up to 2 meters of gravel has been spread in this area, potentially burying archaeological evidence of this mapped structure. It is possible that several buildings were present east and west of Hoyt Road. The Buena Vista School was shown on the 1901 map of Ellis County and may have been constructed at or just before the turn of the century. The postal route map (ca. 1915) and Ellis County highway maps from 1941 and 1955 show the school at this location. Mrs. Jennie Ruth Paul Tucker lived near this school. She reported that the Buena Vista School sat directly in what is today Hoyt Road, with a road to the east and around the west, both joining FM 1446. The eastern curve still remains, with a cistern adjacent to the east. The western curve is within the gravel stockpile area. The Buena Vista Methodist Church sat to the north and west of the western curve. A tabernacle (outdoor picnic area) was located north of the church, adjacent to the intermittent stream. Both the church and tabernacle are potentially buried under the gravel stockpile. No cemetery was located with this church, but a small store may have been present (Jennie Tucker, personal communication, 1990). Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All features were examined, photographed, and mapped. A single shovel test (35 x 35 x 10 cm) was placed 5 m south of the SSC-1 datum. Soil depth was only 10 cm, when bedrock was encountered. The intermittent stream has been incised into bedrock due to the intense flooding from adjacent fields. The profile in this area consists of a surface layer (0-25cm) of redeposited soil. From 25-40 cm, a lens of the gravel stockpile and a large concrete slab were present. This slab covers an original Eddy gravelly loam soil from 40-60 cm below the present ground surface. No artifacts were noted in this soil, which is located north of the tabernacle. Below this soil, a weathered chalk was encountered from 60-80 cm, which rested on bedrock. 7-46 J 3 = | == =

mane ai Just east of the school's original location, concrete steps, a cistern (Plate 7-36) and concrete slab, and four short iron pipes are present (Figure 7-33). Also, two scions of an ornamented hedge are present. A few bricks and bottle glass fragments were observed. It appears unlikely that the site has been plowed and a curve in the road once crossed the site. This site represents the core of a rural community, Buena Vista. It served to integrate various families and ethnic groups (Research Questions 13 and 14). Cultural remains west of Hoyt Road may be buried under more than a meter of gravel. The site may be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. This site is considered to be one of the more important sites found during survey, being relevant to community and settlement patterning. It is classified as high priority and needs further evaluation. 41EL101 (SSC-7-45) The site is located 1.1 km west of Hoyt Road, 1.1 km north of FM 1446 (Buena Vista Road). The site is on the-Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 692,460, northing 3,582,700. The latitude is 32° 22' 00", longitude 96° 57' 14", and elevation is 780 feet above mean sea level. This farmstead site is located in a level upland area. At a distance of 640 meters, an intermittent stream that flows into Oak Branch is the nearest water source. The soil type is Stephen silty clay with a depth of 10 to 20 cm. Part of the site has been recently plowed and planted in Johnson grass (80% ground exposure) while the site of the farm house itself is overgrown with grasses, wild flowers, and mesquite trees (20% ground exposure). In 1855, this was open prairie. Site 41EL101 is part of the Mercer's Colony and Kaufman County grant to the heirs of John and Sarah Estes, May 2, 1850. This grant was transferred to Blumford Shankle on May 5, 1855, who located the property in October 1855. Since Shankle was a local land speculator, it is unlikely that he resided on this tract. In 1936 this tract belonged to D. H. and Frances Gross, who leased it to tenants. They had purchased the property in 1899 (ECDB 112:255). In all, 0.5 acre was reserved for home, 0.5 acre for garden, 65 acres were in cultivation (50 corn oats, 15 cotton) and 4 acres in pasture. At that time 10 acres were terraced and 60 acres were in need of terracing. The house was a six room residence measuring 36 x 40 feet and was built about 1906. Four sheds and a barn were also present. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All features were examined, photographed, and mapped. All diagnostic artifacts were examined and documented and left in the field. | The site (Figure 7-34) consists of a light, extensive scatter of artifacts in the plowed field and a cistern (Plate 7-37), modern dump, and sheet metal in the uncultivated portion of the site. The artifact scatter is approximately 12,000 square meters in size and consists of manganese solarized glass, wine bottle bases, a bottle base with modified pontil (1860s), whiteware, cut nails, and one ceramic fragment marked “J.&G. 7-47

rE eeabin af om MEAKIN, Hanley, England." This is the only site where late nineteenth century wine bottles were found. The artifacts observed date from 1860 to 1960. The observed artifact density is greatest at the fenceline separating the plowed field from the unplowed farmyard. This site appears on the postal route map (ca. 1915), the 1941, 1955, and 1959 Ellis County highway map, and the 1960 USGS quadrangle map (1978 update). While the current site area totals 12,000 square meters, it is estimated that the original site totaled approximately 5000 square meters, of which 1000 square meters is currently in cultivation and the rest within the uncultivated area. This area, which is presumed to contain the house site, has been disturbed by the dumping of recent trash in one area 10 meters west of the cistern. Considering the condition and distribution of the twisted sheet metal on the site, a tornado may have also disturbed this site. It does not appear that this area has been plowed since the farmstead was abandoned, and within this area the integrity of the site is fairly good. Althongh this site may date to 1860, extensive alterations and additions were made around 1906. The WPA records also indicate that there were serial occupations of this site. Also, this site is almost completely outside of the project area. The only portion of the site within the project area is the intensely plowed portion in the field of Johnson grass. This site is classified as low priority and no further work is recommended at this site. 41EL102 (SSC-6-46) The site is located on the south side of FM 878,1.16 km east of Ebenezer Road, 2.0 km west of FM 878 intersection with FM 813. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 716,410, northing 3,589,540. The latitude is 32° 25' 25", longitude 96° 42' 00", and elevation is 470 feet above mean sea level. This level upland site is located 150 meters west of an intermittent stream that flows into Red Oak Creek 1.5 km to the north. Bone Branch is 1.1 km to the south of the site and Grove Creek is an additional 200 meters to the south of Bone Branch. The soil type is Houston black clay with a depth of 20 cm. The vegetation consisted of a grass lawn (20% to 30% visibility). Site 41EL102 is located in the Rafael de la Pena survey, granted in 1834 and surveyed in 1835 by the government of Mexico..This portion of the Pena Survey was granted to Richard Brenham at an unknown time. Brenham then sold this tract to Mary B. Bullock and Mary W. Chambers in 1854. Bullock and Chambers were the first potential occupants of this tract. When this tract was surveyed in 1843 it was entirely in prairie with elm, ash, mulberry, and cottonwood along the streams. Fieldwork at this site was limited due to the current occupation. A visual record was all that was performed. Further work may be necessary after land access is obtained or the property is purchased. This site is a ca. 1930s tenant house (Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) 468). It is a front gable bungalow with modifications and is in poor condition. The yard contained a number of vehicles and farm equipment in various states of disrepair. Total site area is approximately 2000 square meters. 7-48

This farmstead appears on all four Ellis County highway maps and the 1963 USGS quadrangle map (1978 update). The house and farm yard have seen heavy utilization over the years as well as serial occupancy. It is unlikely that any cultural remains relevant to the Research Questions still have integrity. This site has a low priority. No further work is recommended at this time. 41EL103 (SSC-7-46) The site is located 3.2 km south of FM 875 and 2.45 km east of Baucum Road. It is on the north side of an abandoned road that is shown on 1941 Ellis County highway map. The site is on the Midlothian USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 691,410, northing 3,584,990. The latitude is 32° 23' 15", longitude 96° 57' 55", and elevation is 770 feet above mean sea level. This site is in an upland area that is heavily dissected by gullies and larger drainage channels. The site itself is on a small rise that overlooks an intermittent stream 100 meters to the north. Another intermittent stream is 550 meters to the south, the headwaters of Oak Branch are 800 meters to the west, and South Prong Creek is 2 km to the east. The soil type is Eddy gravelly loan with a depth of 0 to 10 cm. Sumac is the dominant vegetation with a ground cover of grasses and wildflowers (ground exposure of 40% to 60%). This site is located in the John Pitts Survey (B890), a 320 acre bounty grant for service during the Texas war for independence; however, an additional survey is listed for Pitts in Johnson County (Miller 1967:530). Pitts sold this tract to M.S. Durham, J.M. Wilson, and W.C. Moody. W.C. Moody owned the adjacent land tract. The tract in Ellis County was surveyed in 1858. The vegetation was primarily prairie with gum bumelia, elm, dogwood, plum, and hackberry thickets. Fieldwork conducted at this site included close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All features and diagnostic artifacts were examined and documented and the site was plotted on the USGS map. Artifacts were left in the field. -41EL103 is a 2000 square meter historic farmstead that was most likely occupied by tenants. No structures remain, but there is a cistern constructed of commercial brick. Bois d'arc house piers south of the cistern (Plate 7-38) mark the site of the house itself, and a scatter of milk glass and whiteware are diagnostic of a 1920 to 1940 occupation. Both the house and road are shown on the 1941 Ellis County highway map, but neither house nor road are on the 1955 or later versions of the highway map or the postal route map (ca. 1915). This site appears to have good integrity. While it may have been plowed, the existence of the original foundation piers in a limited area indicates that this area has not been extensively cultivated after abandonment. Cattle are currently grazed in the area but do not appear to have had a major impact on the site. Archival and informant research does not indicate any special historic significance. Since there has probably been serial occupation, this site has low potential to address the Research Questions. It is classified as low priority and no further work is recommended. 7-49 rh 2 Ai a C4 = oo)

i 41EL104 (SSC-7-47) The site is located 170 meters south of FM 875, 700 meters east of the intersection of FM 875 and McAlpin Road, and 1.1 km west of Skinner Road. The site is on the Midlothian USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 693,040, northing 3,587,540. The latitude is 32° 24' 36", longitude 96° 56' 49", and elevation is 760 feet above mean sea level. This is a level upland site currently used to graze cattle. A branch of South Prong Creek is 160 meters to the west, and the South Prong itself is 1.1 km to the southwest. The area is entirely in grass but there are trees lining the fenceline to the south and the branch to the west. The soil type is Eddy gravelly clay loam with a depth of only 10 cm. Ground visibility was 80% to 100% due to heavy grazing of the grass and cattle traffic, and a field road passed through with 100% visibility the site area. This was entirely prairie in 1875. : This’site is located on a 134 acre tract that was a pre-exemption grant from Ellis County in 1874 to James Agee. George C. Parks surveyed this tract for Ellis County on August 13, 1874. Agee assigned (sold) this grant to Isaac and Ann Newton (African-American) on November 1, 1875 who assigned the grant to William Smith on April 1, 1876. An affidavit signed by R.M. Wyatt on January 3, 1878 stated that Isaac and Ann Newton were tenants on this tract for Smith, but that Ann Newton was trying to claim the property. The WPA survey for the Agee tract indicates that it was divided among three tracts: a 9 acre tract owned by Mrs O.B. Dunaway and Mrs. Ora Miller; a 57 acre tract in the Ed Miller estate; and a 67 acre tract owned by R.S. Morris. These tracts were joined to farms in adjacent surveys. Even though no house is indicated on the Agee tract, it is probable that it was listed on the inventory of an adjacent tract, like the Dunaway house. The 9 acre tract was totally cultivated (oats) and operated by a tenant who also worked 151 acres in the D.P. Fearis survey. The 57 acre tract was totally cultivated (cotton) and was leased to tenants who also worked 880 acres out of 13 different surveys. The 67 acre tract had 45 acres in cultivation (32 in oats, remainder cotton) and 25 acres in pasture and was worked by a tenant who also worked 52 acres out of the Nimrod J. J. B. L. Edwards Survey. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All structures and surface features were documented, photographed, and mapped. Distinctive artifacts were examined and documented, and left in the field. Site 41EL104 has an eastward facing Cumberland style house (Plate 7-39) dating to the 1890s (Figure 7-35). It is constructed with baldcypress clapboard, with cut nails used throughout. There is high potential for tree-ring dating of the siding. The siding is attached with cut nails that have a “finishing” type head. There is a kitchen ell addition on the rear of the structure and evidence of a sawn chalk rock fireplace and chimney on the south end of the house which have been removed. There is no cistern or well in the immediate vicinity of the house, although a cistern made of commercial brick is 30 meters to the 7-50

northwest. An artifact scatter totaling SOOO square meters surrounds the house and consists of manganese solarized glass, whiteware, cut nails, a glass button, stenciled plates, and a fragment of a ground rim frit jar. These items date from the 1880s to the 1930s. A structure appears at this site on the 1941 Ellis County highway map. It is not on the later maps or USGS quadrangle, and the postal route map (ca. 1915) is unclear for this location. With the lack of any structure mentioned in the WPA survey, the history of this structure at this site can best be understood by studying the architecture and archaeology. From observation it does not appear that this structure has been moved but was originally built at this location. In recent years the house has been used as a barn, and cattle traffic has impacted the site. Even so, the house is still in fairly good shape for its age and the surrounding farmyard retains good integrity. Archival information indicates that this site played a significant role in land settlement (Research Question 9), ethnic integration (Research Ouestion 14), and can aid in understanding the cultural correlations of ethnicity (Research Question 16). This site is classified as high priority and will be disturbed by the construction of an access road. Further evaluation is recommended. 41EL105 (SSC-7-48) The site is located 50 meters north of FM 879 and 100 meters east of an abandoned road. The abandoned road is 780 meters east of the intersection of FM 879 and FM 1722, and runs to the north from FM 879. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 718,020, northing 3,584,330. The latitude is 32° 22' 35", longitude 96° 40° 57", and elevation is 470 feet above mean sea level. This site is located on sloping upland 120 meters west of a intermittent stream that flows into Cottonwood Creek 2.1 km to the north. The vegetation in the area consists of thick grasses and wildflowers (20% to 30% ground exposure). The soil type is Houston black clay with an A horizon depth of 20 cm. There is recent evidence of severe erosion in this area. | This site is located in the Demetrius Hays survey, which was laid out by his heirs in 1861. At that time the vegetation was primarily prairie with dispersed mesquite and hackberry in the uplands and cottonwood and hackberry in low-lying areas. The land was apparently sold to Uriah P. Smith, but the Hays heirs won a court case voiding Smith's claim. In 1937, this site was located on a tract owned by O. and Lovilla Lisman of Garrett, Texas, who leased the farm to tenants. They had obtained the property in 1935 (ECDB 312:189). No houses or improvements were present at that time. In all, 24 acres were in cultivation G in maize, the remainder in cotton), 25 acres were in wasteland, and 4 acres were in pasture, Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All surface features and structures were examined, documented, photographed, and mapped. Few artifacts were observed. This site (approximately 3000 square meters) consists of a single structure (Figure 7-36). While it has been reported that this structure was originally a house (Plate 7-40), there is little evidence to indicate that it 7-51 ot a] S| C

was a domicile. The structure currently consists of three rooms, the larger two have large sliding doors that appear to have been used for vehicle access (these may have been service bays). The third room is an office in the southwest corner of the structure. This office has a large, thick plate glass window, one door leading to the outside, and a second door with a window that leads into the first of the other two rooms. A sign from a Lincoln-Mercury service facility was observed in this office. This building was at some time wired for electricity and several outlets line the walls of the two larger rooms. A built-in work table is at the back of the first bay. No artifacts were observed in the immediate vicinity of the structure. Features that may be associated with this structure are located 100 meters away at the northeast comer of FM 879 and the abandoned road. These are two rectangular concrete foundations that may have served as a sign base at sometime in the past. Two underground gasoline storage tanks seen in the area are not associated with this site; they were brought in by a local landowner to use as culverts and then abandoned. From informant it..erviews and observation, it would appear that this structure has had several functions in its lifetime, the last of which was as a barn. The irregular sizes of the windows in this structure also point to possible recycling of an earlier structure. This structure was constructed using wire nails. All evidence points to a post 1937 construction of this building. It appears on the 1955, 1959, and 1964 Ellis County highway map and the 1963 USGS quadrangle map (1978 update). This structure was possibly used as a service station or machine shop. Since this structure has had several building phases and uses, along with disturbances from plowing and cattle trampling, site integrity appears to be fairly low. There is little potential for addressing the historic Research Questions. This site is classified as low priority and no further work is recommended. 41EL107 (SSC-7-50) The site is located 460 meters north of FM 879 on the east side of an abandoned road. The abandoned road is 780 meters east of the intersection of the FM 879 and FM 1722, and runs north from FM 879. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 717,960, northing 3,584,740. The latitude is 32° 22' 48", longitude 96° 41' 00", and elevation is 470 feet above mean sea level. This gently sloping upland site is 160 meters from an intermittent creek. This unnamed creek drains into Cottonwood Creek, located 1.7 km to the north. The area is entirely in grasses and wildflowers with 50% ground exposure. The soil type is Houston clay with a depth of 20 cm. This site is located in the Demetrius Hays survey, which was laid out by his heirs in 1861. At that time the vegetation was primarily prairie with dispersed mesquite and hackberry in the uplands and cottonwood and hackberry in low-lying areas. The land was apparently sold to Uriah P. Smith, but the Hays heirs won a court case voiding Smith's claim. In 1937, this site was located on a tract owned by O. and Lovilla Lisman of Garrett, Texas, who leased the farm to tenants. They had obtained the property in 1935 (ECDB 312:189). No houses or improvements were present at that time. In all, 24 acres were in cultivation 7-52 at ta 5» f= a =

= & Ge (3 in maize, remainder in cotton), 25 acres were in wasteland, and 4 acres were in pasture. The term "maize" is often used to refer to milo, not corn. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (S meter) pedestrian survey. All diagnostic artifacts were noted and described, and their distribution was recorded. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no sketch map of the site was completed. This farmstead site consists of a 4000 square meter scatter of late nineteenth and early twentieth century artifacts. Artifacts include whiteware, porcelain, metal stove parts, a ceramic doll's head fragment, manganese solarized glass, commercial brick, and a late (1880-1890) shell edge ceramic fragment. No features are directly associated with this site but a seep well was observed 30 meters to the northwest in the bottom of a grassed-over gully (Plate 7-41). This seep well has a one piece, terra cotta neck which is 70 cm in diameter. Occupation of this sice may have started in the 1880s and continued to the 1930s. The majority of cultural materials date after 1900. A farmstead is shown at this location on the postal route map (ca. 1915) and no other, supporting the estimated dates for this site. Other archival information also indicates that this farm may have been abandoned by 1937. This is considered to be a medium priority site. Disturbances have come from erosion and plowing with an estimated 50% of the site remaining intact. This site has the potential to address Research Question 16 and further evaluation is recommended. 41EL109 (SSC-7-52) The site is located 1.04 km north of FM 879, east of an abandoned road. The abandoned road is 780 meters east of the junction between FM 879 and FM 1722, and runs north from FM 879. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 717,940, northing 3.585,320. The latitude is 32° 23° 08", longitude 96° 41° 00", and elevation is 460 feet above mean sea level. | This site is a upland site with one possible structure location, based on scattered artifacts on a small rise north of a small, wide, and shallow drainage channel. A second artifact scatter is 50 meters downslope to the south, about halfway between the top of the rise and the bottom of the channel. The area is currently in grasses and wildflowers (50% ground visibility) with a hedge row marking the house site (Plate 7-42) at the top of the rise. The soil is Houston clay with an A horizon depth of 20 cm. This site is located in the Demetrius Hays Survey, which was laid out by his heirs in 1861. At that time the vegetation was primarily prairie with dispersed mesquite and hackberry in the uplands and cottonwood and hackberry in low-lying areas. The land was allegedly sold to Uriah P. Smith, but the Hays heirs won a court case voiding Smith's claim. In 1937, this site was located on a tract belonging to the D.S. Lisman Estate, Waxahachie, Texas. Lisman had obtained the property in two purchases, one in 1892 (ECDB 76:63) and one in 1894 (ECDB 81:198). The property was leased to tenants who lived on the tract. 7-53

=a Ee a oF In all 0.5 acre was reserved for home, 0.5 acre for garden, 41.5 in cultivation (7 acres corn and oats, remainder cotton), and 8 acres were in pasture. At that time 15 acres had been terraced and 26.5 acres were in need of terracing. The dwelling had four rooms, measured 30 x 22 feet, and was built in 1900. A single bam was present. The house needed roof repairs and paint; the barn was in bad condition. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meters) pedestrian survey. All diagnostic artifacts were noted and described and their distribution recorded. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no sketch map of the site was completed. The older of the two components at this farmstead consists of a 1000 square meter scatter of artifacts that consist of early machine-made brick, whiteware, bottle glass, stoneware, and metal fragments. These items date from ca. 1900 to the 1930s. The second component has an additional 1000 square meter scatter consisting of commercial brick (marked with "Standard"), a silver plated spoon (marked “Shelton Silver Plate), bottle glass, whiteware, metal fragments, u-bolt, and a saw or mower blade fragment. The time range for this artifact component is from ca. 1910 to the 1940s. A capped cistern or well is also located in the area of the second artifact scatter. This second scatter may represent a second house, the location of an outbuilding, or simply be an area of dumping. The estimated occupation periods for both components is supported by the cartographic data. A farmstead is shown at this location on the postal route map (ca. 1915) and the 1941 Ellis County highway map. No structures are shown at this site after 1941. The WPA survey indicates that at least one dwelling, probable the one on Ievel ground was built in 1900. While some erosion has impacted this site, at least part of it has not been plowed, as shown by the continued existence of the decorative hedge row. Approximately 65% of this site is estimated to be intact. Although there may be some serial occupation, this site may have the potential to address Research Questions 10, 11, and 16. It has been classified as a medium priority and further evaluation is recommended. 41EL111 (SSC-7-54) The site is located 570 meters north of FM 879 on the west side of an abandoned road, by a large ranch gate which is located on the top of a rise. The abandoned road is 780 meters east of the intersection of FM 879 and FM 1722, and runs to the north from FM 879. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 717,890, northing 3,584,810. The latitude is 32° 22' 51", longitude 96° 41' 03", and elevation is 470 feet above mean sea level. This upland site is located on top of a rise 240 meters from an intermittent creek that drains into Cottonwood Creek which is 1.55 km to the north. This area is a heavily grazed pasture. In 1857 the area ‘ was entirely prairie with hackberry and cottonwood in the low-lying areas. The soil type is Houston clay with a depth of 20 cm and ground exposures range from 40% to 60% with some areas of 100% exposure due to cattle traffic. 7-54

This site is in the Eady Jordan Survey, a 640 acre survey granted from the Nacogdoches Land District in 1855. The tract was surveyed in 1857. The WPA file for this tract has been destroyed. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All diagnostic artifacts were noted and described and their distribution recorded. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no sketch map of the site was completed. This historic site (Plate 7-43) consists of a cistern constructed with commercial brick with adjacent concrete piers to the east. The collapsed remains of a wooden structure are twenty-five meters to the northwest. A 2000 square meter artifact scatter surrounds the cistern and structural ruins and consists of commercial brick, whiteware, manganese solarized glass, and porcelain. The archaeological remains at this site resemble those of a typical tenant domicile which was small and of relatively cheap construction, associated with plain ceramics. The period of occupation (as estimated from the artifacts and features) is from ca. 1900 to 1940s. It is shown om the postal route map (ca. 1915) and the 1941 Ellis County highway map. The integrity of the site appears good, with possibly as much as 90% of it remaining intact. Some erosion has impacted the site as well as some cattle trampling. The area does not appear to have been plowed since the site was abandoned. This site is classified as medium priority with potential to address Research Question 16. Further evaluation is recommended. 41EL112 (SSC-7-55) The site is located 1.69 km. north of FM 879, 20 meters east of an abandoned road. The abandoned road is 780 meters east of the junction between FM 879 and FM 1722, and runs to the north from FM 879. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 717,930, northing 3,585,950. The latitude is 32° 23' 58", longitude 96° 41' 00", and elevation is 470 feet above mean sea level. This site is another in the series of farmsteads found along this abandoned road. This upland site borders the southern slope of Cottonwood Creek's floodplain. Cottonwood Creek itself is located 350 meters to the north of the site. The area has agricultural terraces and is currently crowded with heavy grasses, weeds, and wildflowers. A living red cedar tree and a dead one mark part of an old field line along an agricultural terrace. Ground exposure is widely variable and ranges from 10% to 80%. The soil is a Houston-Sumter complex with an A horizon depth of 20 cm. The soil has been eroded due to its position at the upper portion of a slope, with intensively cultivated fields to the southwest. This site is located in the Demetrius Hays survey, which was laid out by his heirs in 1861. At that time the vegetation was primarily prairie with dispersed mesquite and hackberry in the uplands and cottonwood and hackberry in low-lying areas. The land was allegedly sold to Uriah P. Smith, but the Hays heirs won a court case voiding Smith's claim. In 1937, this site was located on a tract owned by O. and Lovilla Lisman of Garrett, Texas, who leased the farm to tenants.

EE 5 AL a i (ECDB 312:189). No houses or improvements were present at that time. In all, 24 acres were in cultivation (3 in maize, remainder in cotton) 25 acres were in wasteland, and 4 acres were in pasture. As noted earlier, the term "maize" is often used locally to denote milo, not com. In 1937, this site was located on a tract owned by the Union Central Life Insurance Company of Cincinnati, Ohio (ECDB 146:221, ECDB 325:83). The farm was leased to tenants who lived on the tract. In all 60 acres were in cultivation, (20 corn and oats; 40 cotton) with 3 acres wasteland and 8 acres meadow. The house was a five room residence, measuring 28 x 40 feet, and was built in 1890. A shed and bam were also present. The house needed roof repairs and paint, and the barn and shed were in bad condition. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All diagnostic artifacts were noted and described and their proveniences were recorded. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map. A single shovel (35 x 35 x 35 cm) test was excavated beside an SSC datum (Figure 7-37). The soil was a homogeneous clay, and no artifacts were noted. This’site now consists of commercial bricks ("Palmer") scattered under two red cedar trees (Plate 7-44). No other artifacts are visible in the immediate vicinity, but a scatter of artifacts was found eroding downslope. Also, grading of the old road bed along the west side of the site has exposed materials related to the occupation. These items consisted of manganese solarized glass, whiteware, bottle glass, window glass, a fruit jar rim, and porcelain. The total site size is estimated at 4000 square meters, and the period of occupation is estimated to be from approximately 1890 to 1940. The site integrity is poor with as little as 10% of the farmstead remaining intact. Disturbance of the site has been from plowing, terracing, road construction, and heavy erosion. Archival information indicates serial occupation by tenants. Little potential to address the Research Questions is offered by this site and it has been classified as low priority. No further work is recommended. 41EL115 (SSC-7-58) The site is located 15 meters south of FM 879 and 1.15 km east of FM 1722. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 718,300, northing 3,584,240. The latitude is 32° 22' 32", longitude 96° 40° 47", and elevation is 470 feet above mean sea level. Site 41EL115 is located in the uplands on a rise between two intermittent drainage channels, the closest being 150 meters away. The surrounding area is heavily overgrown with grasses, weeds, and hackberry trees (50% ground visibility). The soil type is Houston clay with a soil depth of 20 cm. The vegetation was primarily prairie in 1854, with dispersed mesquite and elm. Ash, willows, and cottonwood were present in low-lying areas This site is located in the Claiborne Garrett Survey which was granted to his heirs by the San Augustine Land District on February 3, 1838. It was surveyed in 1854. The road from Dallas to Taos and the road from Waxahachie to Taos passed through this survey at that time. 7-56

By the time of WPA survey in 1937, the Garrett Survey had been cut into over 69 parcels. These parcels have since been redivided. Due to the complicated nature of this land division it was not possible to pinpoint the 1937 owner of the tract containing site 41EL115. Files for this tract are extremely difficult to interpret and further research is necessary to identify the 1937 landowner. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All diagnostic artifacts were noted and described and their distributions were recorded. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no sketch map of the site was completed due to the recent age of the site. The site basically consists of a house foundation which is composed of concrete front and rear porch pads, concrete steps, and four concrete pier foundations. The house structure itself appears to have been 10 x 10 meters in size. No other features were observed. A metal barn located 35 meters southwest of the house foundation is a modern poie barn. Ceramic tableware and decorative pieces found at the site date from the 1930s to the 1950s. Aduitional artifacts dating from 1890 to 1900 were found 20 meters west of the house site. These items predate the structural remains at this site and may represent a early dump rather than a domicile. The items were found in an old outwash and may have been dumped in order to control erosion. A structure at this location appears on the all of the Ellis County highways maps and the 1963 USGS map (1978 update). A cartographic symbol covers this location on the postal route map (ca. 1915) and it is not possible to determine if a structure was shown on this map. While site integrity appears to be good, the recent age of this site and mixed components detracts from its potential to address the Research Questions. It is classified as low priority, and no further work is recommended. 41EL117 (SSC-8-60) The site is located 550 meters east of Ebenezer Road and 20 meters south of Tammy Lane. The site is on_the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 716,540, northing 3,586,820. The latitude is 32° 23' 27", longitude 96° 41' 42", and elevation is 475 feet above mean sea level. This site is located in a level upland area that is currently cultivated, with crops rotating between cotton and com. An intermittent drainage channel is located 250 meters to the east and Cottonwood Creek is located 600 meters to the south. The soil type is Houston black clay with a depth of 20 to 30 cm. Since this area was recently plowed and rained upon, visibility was 100%. This land grant was granted to the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railroad Company by Ellis County on June 14, 1860 and was surveyed by John S. Richardson on February 27, 1861. In recent years the tract has been combined with other tracts. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All diagnostic artifacts were noted and described and their distributions were recorded. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no sketch map of the site was completed. 7-57 = > &) 7 DS J

= aE He He HE EF This site is a 6000 square meter scatter of historic artifacts in a plowed field. A central area covering 900 square meters is dominated by a scatter of commercial brick imprinted with "Palmer". A dense scatter of cut nails, manganese solarized glass, whiteware, a cue ball (?), milk glass, and recent makeup bottles and jars extends beyond this central area. These items date from ca. 1890 to the 1960s. No features were observed. This site appears on the postal route map (ca. 1915), on the 1955, 1959, and 1964 Ellis County highway maps, and on the 1963 USGS map (1978 update). The estimated period of occupation is between ca. 1890 and the late 1960s. The low site integrity and the long period of serial occupation combined gives this site little potential to address the Research Questions. This site is classified as low priority and no further work is recommended. 41EL119 (SSC-8-62): Dolezal Farmstead The site is located 1.2 km east of FM 1722 and 500 meters north of Prachyl Road. The site is on the Ennis West USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 718,900, northing 3,583,100. The latitude is 32° 21' 55", longitude 96° 40° 20", and elevation is 500 feet above mean sea level. This is an upland site with the farmstead sitting on top of a hill overlooking Wolf Branch. This site also includes a prehistoric component that covers approximately twenty acres, spanning an area from the north field behind the farmyard, continuing south encompassing the farmyard, and spreading about half of the way downslope toward Wolf Branch. The entire farm is currently in Johnson grass or other grasses (30% to 50% exposure), with the only currently cultivated area being the vegetable garden (100% exposure). The soil type is Houston black clay with a depth of 50 cm or more. The vegetation was primarily prairie in 1854, with dispersed mesquite and elm. Ash, willows, and cottonwood were present in low-lying areas. This site is located in the Claiborne Garrett Survey which was granted to his heirs by the San Augustine Land District on February 3, 1838. It was surveyed in 1854. The road from Dallas to Taos and the road from Waxahachie to Taos passed through this survey at that time. The files at the Ellis County Tax Assessor's Office provided a means of identifying the 1937 owner of the tract containing site 41EL119 and 41EL120. In 1937 this site was located in a 100 acre tract owned by Joe and Josie Dolezal, who lived on this tract. They had purchased it in 1917 for $15,251 (ECDB 231:316). In all, 1 acre was reserved for the home, 1 acre for the garden, 88 acres in cultivation (15 corn and oats; 73 cotton), and 10 acres in pasture. The dwelling measured 32 x 36 feet; a shed measured 12 x 14 feet; and a barn measured 30 x 34 feet. All were in good condition. The Ellis County Museum has the original copy of the Immigration and Naturalization files for Ellis County. Joe and Josie Dolezal were listed as immigrants from Bechyne, Bohemia. Joe was bom there on October 30, 1879 and emigrated (at the age of 23) from Brunen, Germany in 1902. He (and possibly Josie) 7-58

arrived in New York City aboard the Rhenia in 1902. They initially filed for citizenship on January 24, 1911, nine years after their arrival. At the time of their filing, June 12, 1916, the family consisted of Joe, Jr., born October 1, 1907; Rosa, born January 20, 1909; Emma, born May 18, 1911; Jettie, born October 10, 1913; and Agnes, born April 8, 1916. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All structures and diagnostic artifacts were noted, described, and photographed. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no sketch map of the site was completed. Interviews were conducted with the present inhabitant (Jerry Dolezal) and the landowner (Robert Mitchell). The historic component at 41EL119 consists of a farm house (Plate 7-45), six outbuildings, two cisterns, and various pieces of horse-drawn farm equipment. The structural remains cover approximately 4000 square meters. The house is in fair condition while the outbuildings (Plate 7-46) and farm equipment have been better maintained and are in good condition. The one story frame house is cross-gable, reported by the previous owner to have been built around 1890. An addition was added to the front of the house around 1924. The siding and porch (part of the 1924 addition) have wire nails used in their construction. The outbuildings are all painted and were constructed with wire nails. A trash (recent) filled cistern sits at the southwest comer of the house and a second cistern is 40 meters to the south by the largest of the outbuildings. A wagon which was purchased in 1918 sits in the farmyard. This wagon is in excellent condition. Bottle glass, ceramics, and handmade brick were noted in the yard and around the outbuildings. A few pieces of stoneware were observed in the garden. The overall size of this component of this site is approximately 4000 square meters. Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) also recorded this site (#978) during their survey of Ellis County. They recorded it as a one story house with an asymmetrical plan. The condition is stated as being poor and the date of construction is estimated to be 1900. No other structures are reported. Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) gave this house high priority and consider it to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. _ The current occupant of this house (Jerry Dolezal) stated that the house was “a hundred yvars old”. His brother Joe inherited the farm, and sold it to Mr. Mitchell. Jerry Dolezal currently operates the farm. The house is known to predate the 1917 purchase. This farmstead does not appear on the postal route map (ca. 1915) or the 1941 Ellis County map, but is on all other maps. The 1941 map is obviously in error, but this appears to be common for farmsteads located well off the road, such as this farm. All of the outbuildings are believed to have been built from 1917 to 1940. The largest barn at this site is reported to have been built using material from a previous farmstead that was located on this farm (41EL120), a set of structures tom down in 1917, The archaeological deposits, architectural remains, and historical and informant information all indicate that this site is important to the understanding of ethnic integration in the rural community (Research Question 14). An important question is how did the Ennis-Garrett area become an attractive location and focal point for Eastern European immigration at the tum of the century? Also, what agricultural parameters 7-59 Cad @=)

(ecological and economic) promoted their farmsteading? Finally, are there archaeological attributes that may be used to identify Eastern European immigrants of North Central Texas? This site is classified as high priority and further evaluation is recommended. 41EL120 (SSC-8-63) The site is located 1.2 km east of FM 1722 and 30 meters north of Prachyl Road. It is located on the same farm as 41EL119. The site is on the Ennis West USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 719,240, northing 3,582,750. The latitude is 32° 21' 43", longitude 96° 40' 11", and elevation is 499 feet above mean sea level. Site 41EL120 is located in a low area 70 meters from the Wolf Branch of Mustang Creek. The area is in Johnson grass with a variety of different weeds intruding (30% to 50% ground exposure). The soil type is Houston clay with an A horizon depth of 20 cm. This.site is located in the Claiborne Garrett Survey which was granted to his heirs by the San Augustine Land District on February 3, 1838. It was surveyed in 1854. The road from Dallas to Taos and the road from Waxahachie to Taos passed through this survey at that time. This site is located in a 100 acre tract owned by Joe and Josie Dolezal, who purchased it in 1917 for $15,251 (ECDB 231:316). Site 41EL120 is not thought to be any of the structures listed for site 41EL119. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All diagnostic artifacts were noted, described, and photographed, and their distributions were recorded. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no sketch map of the site was completed. The current landowner (Robert Mitchell) informed us that there was a house, along with two cistems here until 1917, when the house was torn down. He has found three spoons at this site including one that is handmade. A light scatter of artifacts were observed that included manganese solarized glass, whiteware, whiteware with transfer prints, and bottle glass. These items date from 1880 to 1930. No visible features remain (Plates 7-47 and 7-48). The overall area of artifact scatter and structure locations is approximately 2500 square meters. Mr. Jerry Dolezal, who lives in the house at 41EL119 and farmed this area with his brother (Joe) says that the house on 41EL120 was old when his family purchased this farm. The house appears only on the postal route map (ca. 1915). Since 1917 this site has been intensively cultivated and very little site integrity remains. It is possible that this site has separate components and can aid in addressing Research Questions 10, 12, and 16. It is classified as medium priority and further evaluations are recommended. 41EL121 (SSC-9-64) The site is located 600 meters north of Honeysuckle Road and 1.7 km east of Skinner Road. The site is on the Midlothian USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are 7-60 => ce 1 C

easting 694,610, northing 3,590,360. The latitude is 32° 26' 06", longitude 96° 55' 48", and elevation is 690 feet above mean sea level. This is a level upland site 320 meters from an intermittent stream that drains into Waxahachie Creek 900 meters to the northwest. The area has been intensely cultivated in the recent past but is currently fallow. The soil type is Eddy gravelly clay loam with exposed bedrock fragments. The soil depth is 10 cm, and ground exposure ranges from 30% to 60% with 100% visibility in the field road that crosses the site. This site is located in the Andrew Raimer survey which was a pre-exemption certificate granted to him in 1870. He had settled on the tract in 1867, when the tract was surveyed. The vegetation was primarily prairie with highly dispersed elms. In 1936 site 41EL121 was located on a 70 acre tract owned by Miss Lena Andrews of Waxahachie, Texas, who leased it to tenants ( on a third and fourths basis, see Chapter 4). They had obtained the property (inheritance?) from Mrs. A.T. King in 1935 (ECDB 324:578). At that time there were no improvements or structures.on the place. In all 52.5 acres were in cultivation (12 corn and oats, and the remainder cotton) and 65 acres were in pasture. All 117 acres were in need of terracing. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All diagnostic artifacts were noted and described and their distribution recorded. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no sketch map of the site was completed. This site was reported to the survey crew by the current landowner. According to the landowner, this was the former location of a tenant farmer who lived there when the entire area was cultivated in cotton. All that remains of the site is a well covered with sheet metal and a very light scatter of artifacts. Items observed were whiteware, commercial brick, bottle glass, and manganese solarized glass, dating from ca. 1900 to 1930. Site size was estimated to be approximately 2000 square meters. This tenant house only appears on the postal route map (ca. 1915). From this information, the WPA information, and artifact types, it appears that the period of occupation dates from around 1900 to no later than 1930. This site has been disturbed by plowing and vehicular traffic on a field road that crosses the site. Archival information suggests that this could be a homestead dating to 1867 with the structures having been removed by 1937. Informants indicate that tenants subsequently occupied the site. Even though there has been serial use of this site, it has the potential to address Research Questions 10 and 12. This site is classified as medium priority and further evaluation is recommended. 41EL122 (SSC-10-65) The site is 20 meters west of Sutton Road and 660 meters south of Hunsucker Road, and is situated on the north side of a dirt farm road. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 713,580, northing 3,594,720.

[4 { d This is an upland site in an area with very little relief. The nearest water source is Brushy Creek, 1.8 km to the north. The area is currently a wheat field with an overabundance of weeds and a stand of hackberry trees west of the site. The soil type is Houston black clay with an A horizon depth of 20 cm. Ground exposure is only about 30%. This site is located on the James M. Riggs survey which was a Peters’ Colony grant that was surveyed in 1853. At that time the vegetation was primarily prairie with hackberry in low-lying areas, There were dispersed elms, red haw, gum bumelia, and hackberry in the prairies. In 1937, site 41EL122 was located on a 70 acre tract owned by Miss Lena Andrews of Waxahachie, Texas, who leased it to tenants (on a third and fourths basis, see Chapter 4). She inherited the tract in 1911 (ECDB 191-478). At that time there were no improvements, with all acreage cultivated for cotton. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All diagnostic artifacts were noted and described and the site was photographed. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no sketch map of the site was completed. This site consists of a small (900 square meter) scatter of twentieth century artifacts. Bottle glass, whiteware, and commercial bricks were observed. No features were observed (Plates 7-49 and 7-50). The site appears on all four Ellis County highway maps, 1941 to 1964. From this information and the WPA information, the period of occupation appears to date from around 1940 to the 1960s. This area has been plowed for wheat and other crops, which has reduced the site integrity to no higher than 30%. The site was originally surveyed for a Bureau of Economic Geology drill site (see Appendix A). This drill site was moved 70 meters to the southeast in order to avoid this site. This site is outside of the fee simple purchase area. No disturbance is anticipated from this project. The recent age and serial occupancy of this site contribute to a low priority classification. No further work is recommended. 41EL123 (SSC-10-66) The site (Plate 7-50) is located 20 meters west of Bethel Road and 20 meters south of Higgins Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 696,840, northing 3,574,280. The latitude is 32° 17' 22", longitude 96° 54° 05", and elevation is 580 feet above mean sea level. 41EL123 is an upland site located at the upper edge of a slope on the east side of Baker Branch's small floodplain. The area is heavily overgrown with weeds and is not currently utilized for any purpose other than dumping trash. The soil type is Eddy gravelly loam with a depth of 10 cm. Ground exposure ranges from 30% to 90%. ) This site is located on the boundary of the James Jordan and Edward T. Branch Surveys. James Jordan was granted his land in 1839 and it was surveyed in 1853. At that time the vegetation was primarily prairie with dispersed elm and mesquite. There were elms concentrated in the low-lying areas as well. Edward T. Branch was granted his land in 1838 from Liberty County. In 1840 his tract was surveyed by B.J. 7-62

f | Ps mm EE T Chambers, a prominent land surveyor and entrepreneur, and the son of T. J. Chambers, the Governor of Coahuila and a famous entrepreneur as well. At that time vegetation was recorded as predominantly prairie with pecan, red haw, and mesquite in low-lying areas. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. All features and diagnostic artifacts were noted, described, and photographed. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map and a sketch map of the site was completed. This site is the location of a house that apparently bummed down within the last ten to fifteen years. A bumed refrigerator, charcoal, bottle glass, bricks impressed with "Palmer", and recent trash cover an area of 1600 square meters. These items date from 1900 to 1960. A barn is to the west of the house site. This bam is constructed with wire nails and is in poor condition. No other features are associated with this twentieth century site. A farmstead is shown at this location on the 1955, 1959, and 1964 Ellis County highway maps and the 1960 USGS map. While original occupation may date to the first quarter of the twentieth century, the major portion of the artifacts point to intensive post World War II use. The most probable period of occupation is from the 1940s to 1970s. Site integrity appears to be good; however, archival and informant information do not indicate any historical significance. The recent age of the site, the intense post World War II utilization, and possible serial occupancy detract from its potential to address the Research Questions. This site is classified as low priority and no further work is recommended. 41EL124 (SSC-10-67) The site is located 780 meters west of Bethel Road and 80 meters south of Higgins Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 696,240, northing 3,573,830. The latitude is 32° 54' 58”, longitude 96° 54‘ 58", and elevation is 570 feet above mean sea level. This farmstead is located at the western edge of a small floodplain of Baker Branch. The farm yard sits at the top of the floodplain slope with Baker Branch 160 meters downslope from the house. The soil type is Austin silty clay with an A horizon depth of 20 cm. The area is currently in pasture (20% visibility) with stands of elm and bois d'arc trees around the house and barn and trees and dense undergrowth lining Baker Branch. Edward T. Branch was granted his land in 1838 from Liberty County. In 1840 his tract was surveyed by B.J. Chambers, a prominent land surveyor and entrepreneur, and the son of T.J.

and photographed. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map and a sketch map of the site was completed. There are currently three structures at this site (Figure 7-38): a house, a barn, and a chicken coop (Plates 7-51 and 7-52), distributed over 2400 square meters. The house is a two story Cumberland style with kitchen ell. It has a central chimney and is constructed with wire nails. The house is in very good condition for an abandoned structure and has suffered no vandalism or removal of any of its structure. Some white paint still adheres to the siding of the house. Forty meters to the south of the house is a barn, which is also constructed with wire nails. The barn is in poor shape and is starting to lean. A small corral is at the southern end of the barn. Located 10 meters to the southeast of the house is a chicken coop that is still in good repair. It does not appear to be as old as the house and barn. The only other feature observed is a cistern constructed with commercial brick. The cistern is located 7 meters south of the southwest comer of the house. Artifacts were difficult to locate due to the heavy ground cover. Bottle glass, whiteware, and one fragment of handpainted porcelain were observed, all of which date to the twentieth century. The only other items observed were a dump 30 meters south of the barn. This dump contained domestic refuse from the 1970s. There is a farmstead marked at this location on all four Ellis County Highway maps and the 1960 Boz USGS Quadrangle map (1978 update). This site does not appear on the postal route map (ca. 1915). By structure type, construction method, cartographic information, and artifact types, it is believed that this house dates to ca. 1915 and to have been occupied until approximately 1970. Hardy-Heck-Moore (1990) have recorded this site, dating it to 1880 and classifying it as high priority. Site integrity is judged to be excellent with three structures and the cistern still intact. It does not appear that the farmyard has been plowed, nor has it seen use as a cattle grazing or feeding area. The dense vegetation and trees have protected the site from erosion. Since standing structures are present, there is a potential for intact archaeological deposits. Therefore, this site is classified as a medium priority. Further evaluations are necessary to determine if this site has the potential to address the Research Questions (e.g. Research Questions 10 and 12). 41EL125 (SSC-10-68) The site is located 940 meters west of Sutton and 520 meters north of Farrar Road. The site is on the Palmer USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 713,070, northing 3,593,780. The latitude is 32° 27’ 44", longitude 96° 43° 59", and elevation is 499 feet above mean sea level. This is an upland site in an area of very little relief.

cS This site is located on the James M. Riggs survey which was a Peters’ Colony grant that was surveyed in 1853. At that time, the vegetation was primarily prairie with hackberry in low-lying areas. There were dispersed elms, red haw, gum bumelia, and hackberry in the prairies. In 1937 site 41EL125 was located in the northwest corner of a tract belonging to the P.R. Pierce estate. It was leased to tenants (on a third and fourths basis, see Chapter 4). Pierce purchased the property in 1885 and 1886 (ECDB 37:491 and ECDB 42:36). At that time there were no improvements in the vicinity of 41EL125, because the main farm complex was on the south side of the tract. In all, 1 acre was reserved for home, 1 acre for garden, and 100 acres in cultivation (35 corn and oats, 65 cotton). The structures located to the south of 41EL125 included one 4 room residence measuring 32 x 32 feet built in 1899, one 8 x 14 feet shack built in 1887, and one 10 x 12 feet shack built in 1899. Also, three sheds (9 x 10 feet, 10 x 12 feet, 10 x 10 feet) and a barn (20 x 40 feet) were built in 1899. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meters) pedestrian survey. All diagnostic artifacts were noted and described. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no sketch map of the site was completed. This site is a very light 3000 square meter scatter of whiteware, bottle glass, and a single seashell (such as those sold in gift shops). There are no features visible. No structure appears at this location on any of our maps, nor does the WPA survey record improvements at this location. This site is believed to be a dump used from the 1920s to the 1940s. While most domestic dumps found during survey have been in or adjacent to drainage channels, this area is almost completely without relief, making a dump in the middle of a field as likely a spot as anywhere else. Site integrity is very low after having been plowed for many years. It has also been impacted by the drilling of a monitoring well. Total avoidance of this site proved impossible and impact from drilling activity was limited to the previously plowed periphery of the site. It is classified as low priority due to the fact that it does not appear to represent a habitation or farmyard and offers little or no potential to address the Research Questions. No further work is recommended. 41EL126 (SSC-11-69) The site is located 10 meters east of Feaster Road, 750 meters north of State FM 34, 3.6 km northwest of the city of Avalon. The site is on the Avalon USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 710,560, northing 3,567,780. The latitude is 31° 13° 11", longitude 96° 45" 55", and elevation is 460 feet above mean sea level. Site 41EL126 is located on the slope bordering Big Onion Creek's floodplain, 600 meters from the creek itself. The site begins in a relatively level area next to the road and continues downslope. The area is currently a failed cotton field with limited weed cover (80% to 100% ground exposure). The soil type is Houston clay with a depth of 20 cm. 7-65

This site is located on the James Spillman Survey. This was a bounty and donation warrant for service in 1838. When surveyed in 1846 this area was primarily prairie with highly dispersed elm, hackberry, and mesquite. The WPA files for this tract have been destroyed. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (S meter) pedestrian survey. All diagnostic artifacts were noted, described, and photographed. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map, but no sketch map of the site was completed. This is a farmstead site consisting of a light, 10,000 square meter artifact scatter. The material consists of whiteware, manganese solarized glass, and bottle glass. No features were observed during survey. The original size of this site was approximately 4000 square meters, estimated from the 1961 aerial map (Brooks et al., 1964). The farmyard is still visible on this map but the structures were no longer present. Structures are shown at this location on the postal route map (ca. 1915) and the 1941 Ellis County highway map. The time period of occupation is estimated to be from ca. 1910 to the 1940s. Site integrity is low, with plowing, erosion, and the construction of a graded farm road having impacted the site and dispersed the artifacts. This site is not currently within the project area but penetration shaft site E8 is to the northeast of this site. Due to previous impacts, this site is classified as low priority. It appears to have little potential to address any of the Research Questions and no further work is recommended. 41EL129 (SSC-12-72) The site is 20 meters south of Maypearl Road and 500 meters west of Bethel Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 694,000, northing 3,578,060. The latitude is 32° 19° 27", longitude 96° 56° 20", and elevation is 680 feet above mean sea level. .. This upland farmstead site is located 100 meters from an intermittent stream that drains into Greathouse Branch 850 meters to the west. There is a maintained grass lawn around the house and a dense stand of trees with heavy undergrowth surrounding the outbuildings. The surrounding fields are planted in Johnson grass. The soil type is Eddy Gravelly Clay loam with a depth of 10 cm, and with bedrock fragments dispersed throughout the soil. Ground exposure was 20% to 40%. This site is located in the Thomas Shockley Survey which was granted from Van Zandt County. It was surveyed in 1858. At that time prairie was the dominant vegetation with cottonwood, elm, and pecan along Greathouse Branch, The WPA files for this tract have apparently been destroyed. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey. Since the house is occupied, no survey was conducted in the farmyard itself. All features were noted, described, and photographed. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map and a sketch map of the site was completed. 7-66 = . =e]

= (6 This site is an inactive farmstead (Figure 7-39) covering approximately 4000 square meters including the outbuildings. While the house is still occupied (Plate 7-53), the surrounding fields are not worked from this farm. The house is a front gable bungalow in good condition. A small outbuilding is located behind (south of) the house, and two barns are located west of the house. An abandoned tractor from the 1970s is east of the house and a flatbed farm truck (1960s) is abandoned in one of the barns. From its architectural style the house is estimated to be from 1910 to 1930. A farmstead is shown at this location on the postal route map (ca. 1915). The farmstead also appears on all other maps. Hardy-Heck- Moore (1990) have also recorded this site, dating it to 1935 and giving it a low priority. Since standing buildings are present, this site is classified as medium priority. However, the architectural and archival information indicate that this site may be too recent to address any of the Research Questions. Further evaluation is recommended, particularly since the site is located near Greathouse Branch, where prehistoric artifacts have been reported by avocational archaeologists and by the landowner questionnaires, The intact farmscape may have preserved prehistoric remains. 41EL130 The site is located 1.2 km east of Oak Branch Road, 1.25 km south of FM 66, 100 meters north of Maypearl Road, and 560 meters west of Bethel Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 693,760, northing 3,578,300. The latitude is 32° 19' 35", longitude 96° 56° 29", and elevation is 695 feet above mean sea level. This is an upland site located on a rise 200 meters from an intermittent stream that drains into Greathouse Branch, 600 meters to the west. The area is entirely in grasses with an Eddy soil type that ranges from 10 to 20 cm in depth. Visibility varies greatly, with approximately 20% ground exposure immediately around the house, and up to 100% in many areas of the farm yard. Buried water piping has become exposed in the farmyard, which helped confirm that the soil depth was less than 20 cm. This site is located on one of seven tracts granted as script to M.D. Bullion. The tract containing site 41EL129 was surveyed in 1863. The land was patented in 1864 (ECDB F:472). At that time the vegetation was primarily prairie with widely dispersed elm and gum bumelia. In 1936, the 104 acre tract containing site 41EL129 was owned by B.F. Forrester, who managed a 1200 acre farm and lived at 41EL77. There was a lien of $1800 from the Land Bank Commission, Houston, Texas (ECDB 120:515). Forrester had purchased the 104 acre tract for $8000 in 1912 (ECDB 202:250). In all 1.5 acres were reserved for home, 1 acre for garden, 93.75 acres in cultivation (40 corn oats hay, 53.75 cotton) and 5 acres were in need of terracing (see site 41EL77 for further details). Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (S meters) pedestrian survey except for the area surrounding the immediate vicinity of the house. All features and diagnostic artifacts were noted, described and photographed. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map and a sketch map of the site was completed. Dogs that have been kept in the yard have excavated many holes 15 cm deep to bedrock. 7-67

This site is a 1.5 story T-plan house (Figure 7-40) currently owned and occupied by William Gaston and his wife. Mr. Gaston acquired the house (Plate 7-54), which was being used for grain storage, from his father in 1940. At that time the house was remodeled for Mr. Gaston's residence. During remodeling a “Liberty” magazine dating to 1882 was found under the attic floor boards, which places a possible construction date for the house. The structure is reported to have been originally constructed entirely out of baldcypress, however only the siding was probably baldcypress. It appears on all maps. Two outbuildings associated with this house are modern in origin, the original barn having been removed at some time in the past. The farmyard (approximately 4000 square meters) has seen extensive modification since 1940 with the addition of a chain-link fence around the house and a piping system from a seep well located 250 meters downslope from the house. Site integrity is estimated at approximately 50%. The house is currently in excellent condition. Present archival information is inconclusive about this site and additional archival and informant information is necessary to further evaluate this site. It is classified as medium priority. Photographic documentation and tree-ring samples are recommended once this property is acquired. Due to the long, extensive occupation, this site could prove to be too mixed to provide information relevant to the historic Research Questions. 41EL131(SSC-12-74) The site is located 1.05 km south of Old Maypearl Road, 890 meters west of Bethel Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 694,040, northing 3,577,200. The latitude is 32° 19° 00", longitude 96° 56° 20", and elevation is 680 feet above mean sea level. This is a level upland site 760 meters from Greathouse (sic) Branch. The area is a heavily grazed grass pasture intermixed with thistles and milkweed. The soil type is Eddy gravelly clay loam with a depth of 5 to 10 cm. Fragments of bedrock are exposed in the soil and visibility is approximately 70%. This site is located on the Josiah Wilshire Survey, which was surveyed in 1853. At that time the dominant vegetation was prairie with pecan and elm along Greathouse Branch. The WPA file for this tract has apparently been destroyed. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of close interval (5 meter) pedestrian survey and shovel tests. All features and diagnostic artifacts were noted, described, and photographed. The site was plotted on the USGS quadrangle map and a sketch map of the site was completed. Two shovel tests (35 x 35 x 10 cm) were excavated, and indicated that only 10 cm of soil was present over bedrock. The shovel tests confirmed the soil depth but did not uncover any artifacts except to reveal that the field road was at one time covered with crushed gravel. This site (Figure 7-41) consists of a front-gabled, single story, six room house (Plate 7-55) and surrounding farmyard covering approximately 4000 square meters. The 12 x 14 meter house was constructed 7-68 cS }

entirely with wire nails and sits on bois d'arc piers. Both front and rear porches have been removed. The house has a built-in glass-front china cabinet, no fireplace, and a wide (8') central hallway that runs the length of the house. Other features include the remains of a metal windmill, well head, and water tank, a metal corral, concrete stock trough, and a dump containing modem bricks, burned wood, chain-link fencing, and a refrigerator. Artifacts observed included wire nails, high gloss whiteware, 2 manganese solarized glass fragments from a heavy goblet, and two stainless steel fire extinguisher tanks with safety inspection tags dated 1975. The house itself contains cement bags, hay, and three pinball machines. An estimated occupation date between 1915 to 1970 has been given based on construction type and artifacts. This was further reinforced by a local informant (Dale Sherman) who reports that the house was constructed between 1915 and 1920 and was occupied by the landowner. _ The house has in recent years been used for storage and its yard used as a cattle feeding area. Even considering its long and varied use, the house is in fairly good condition and the yard maintains much of its integrity. It only appears on the 1960 USGS map, but it is so far from the paved roads that it is no surprise that it does not appear on the highway maps. Since the site has standing structures, it is classified as medium priority. Tree-ring samples, photographic documentation, and further testing are recommended to determine if the site contains information relevant to the historic Research Questions. 41EL132 (SSC-13-75) This site (approximately 2000 square meters) consists of a cistern located on top of a small upland rise. A farmstead appears here on the postal route map (ca. 1915) and the 1941 Ellis County highway map. This site was observed from the road after field survey had been temporarily halted and must be surveyed at a later date. Due to the incomplete reconnaissance, it is classified as medium priority. Further evaluations are recommended. 41EL133 (SSC-IN-76) The site is located 60 meters southeast of Old Maypearl Road, 1.15 km northeast of Bethel Road, and 1.71 km south of FM 66. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,415, northing 3,578,880. The latitude is 32° 19' 23", longitude 96° 55' 26", and elevation is 700 feet above mean sea level. This is an upland site located near the upper drainage of both the Baker and Cottonwood Branches of Chambers Creek. Cottonwood Branch is 200 meters from the site, with Chambers Creek approximately 8.5 km to the south. The vegetation in the area is currently Bermuda grass and hackberry trees with 30% to 50% ground exposure and 100% exposure under the house. The soil type is Austin silty clay with a depth of 10 cm. The vegetation was all prairie in 1852. This site is part of the George Casey grant. Casey received a bounty certificate from the Secretary of War on May, 1838 for service at San Jacinto during the Texas Revolution. The 640 acre tract was surveyed 7-69 C5

ea by G.W. Cunningham on June 30, 1952 for the Robertson Land District. The original tract has been split into fifteen different tracts. George Casey sold another unlocated certificate in Frio County to Nathaniel Townsend, a land entrepreneur who obtained the Raphael de la Pena Survey. In 1936 this isolated structure was located on a 100 acre tract owned by L.C. Alexander, who leased it to tenants (third and fourths). He had purchased the tract for $7000 in 1935 (ECDB 327:306). In all 1 acre was reserved for home, 0.25 acre for garden, 94.75 acres in cultivation (49 corn, remainder cotton), 4 acres in wasteland, and 2 acres in pasture. At that time 40 acres had been terraced and 60 acres were in need of terracing. The main dwelling had 5 rooms, measured 42 x 48 feet, and had been built in 1936. Informants report that it burned around World War II. A shack, five sheds, and a bam round out the inventory. -Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of a visit by David Jumey (ARP), Sam Baker (SSCL), Mike Smith (TNRLC) and the landowner, Mrs. Sukla. The site was mapped and evaluated and a close interval (2 meter) pedestrian survey was conducted across the site. This site consists of a two room house with a hipped gable roof and its surrounding yard (Figure 7-42). The structure currently has a tin roof (the original roof had wooden shingles). The house has pine sills on sandstone piers, tar paper siding, and was constructed with wire nails. The structure is in good condition, but the piers and foundation joists appear to be newer than the rest of the structure, possibly indicating that this structure was moved to this site from another earlier site. Artifactual materials that were present included sawn beef bone, baby food jars, and canning jars. Very lithe domestic debris was observed. The entire site covers about 1500 square meters. The estimated occupation for this site is 1930 to 1960. Due to the excellent preservation of the structure and the lack of domestic debris, the dwelling could have been moved onto its present setting. It is classified as a low priority site and has little potential to address the historic Research Questions. No further work is recommended. 41EL134 (SSC-IN-77): Boz Cotton Gin The site is located 40 meters west of the Greathouse Road/Bethel Road intersection, on both sides of Greathouse Road, in the Community of Boz. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 694,210, northing 3,576,320. The latitude is 32° 19" 35", longitude 96° 55 06", and elevation is 630 feet above mean sea level. This industrial site is located on low ground 100 meters east of the Cottonwood Branch of Chambers Creek, the latter which is approximately 6.2 km to the south. Hackberry trees and grasses dominate the vegetation and the soil is Eddy gravelly clay loam with a depth of up to 35 cm. The area had been recently mowed and had 50% to 60% ground visibility. This site falls at the junction of two of the W.M. Tumer Surveys and the Heirs of Benjamin Barton Survey. Turner's tracts were surveyed in the 1855. Vegetation consisted of prairie with scattered elms. The survey for the Heirs of Benjamin Barton (granted from Rusk Country) was laid out in 1867. These three 7-70

surveys contain the entire community of Boz, which apparently began to form immediately prior to the Civil War. Fieldwork conducted at this site consisted of a visit by David Jurney (ARP), Sam Baker (SSCL), Mike Smith (TNRLC) and the landowner, Mr. Roger Williams. The site was mapped and evaluated and a close interval (2 meter) pedestrian survey was conducted across the site. The stream bank provided over 200 meters of continuous soil profiles down to bedrock, and was closely examined. The Boz Cotton Gin was located at this site (Figure 7-43), which was both steam and electric powered. The complex was rather large and is estimated to have covered over 6000 square meters. Originally built as a steam-powered gin around 1900, it is believed to have been converted to electric or had additional electric facilities constructed by the 1930s. The three room gin office is still standing (Figure 7-44). It is a 6 x 6 meter wooden structure with a hip roof and wire nail construction. One corner beam has broken cut nails, evidence of recycling from an earlier structure. This structure probably dates from the electrification phase of the gin, around 1930. No other complete structure exists, but a cotton press and foundation, boiler base, coal bins, and wells still exist. The cotton press is still intact and could provide excellent information on this no-longer existent technology. Coal, commercial brick (1900-10), manganese solarized glass, and recent refuse are scattered about this 6000 square meter site. Impacts on this site have included the removal of structures, the construction of a modern septic system, and weathering. Approximately 50% of this site remains intact. This site has the potential to yield information relevant to Research Questions 10, 11, and 12, and is classified as high priority. Also, this is the only industrial facility identified in any of the impact areas and can provide pertinent information on early cotton gin technology and twentieth century technological innovations (e.g. steam to electricity). 41EL135 (SSC-5-30) The site is located 1.1 km south of FM 1446 and 550 meters northeast of Ewing Road. The site is on the Boz USGS Quadrangle Map. The UTM Zone is 14, and the coordinates (in meters) are easting 695,420, northing 3,582,180. The latitude is 32° 21° 40", longitude 96° 55° 24", and elevation is 710 feet above mean sea level. This upland site is located 300 meters south of an intermittent stream that drains into South Prong Creek, which is 1.68 km to the east. Grasses and heavy weed growth cover the site. The area has an Eddy soil and a soil depth of 10 cm. ; This site is located in the Placido Olivari survey (1-481!/2, A812), granted in Bexar Land District on February 26, 1837. This grant was sold to Calvin Emmons on August 28, 1837. The actual land tract was surveyed in 1846. At that time the area was entirely prairie with two walnut trees observed along South Prong Creek at the eastern edge of the tract. The WPA file for this tract has been destroyed. 7-71

Fieldwork at this site was limited to visual survey. This site was recorded from the adjacent property. Access for pedestrian survey had not been gained before fieldwork had been curtailed. This site was recorded in advance of pedestrian survey. This is a farmstead site with one standing structure (Plate 7-56), a barn, the partial remains of a second outbuilding, and possibly the foundation of a house. There is a artifact scatter of about 4000 square meters. This scatter consists of blue glass, whiteware, and a lead bullet. Due to ground cover and lack of land access, these items were only visible at the northern edge of the site across a fenceline. The area in which artifacts were observed is a heavily grazed pasture with good visibility (60%). A farmstead is shown at this location on the 1941, 1955, 1959, and 1964 Ellis County Highway maps. The 1960 (1978 update) USGS map of Boz quadrangle shows three structures at this location. The postal route map (ca. 1915) shows no structures at this location. Based on this information and on artifact types, this site is estimateu to date from the 1920s and to have been occupied until the late 1950s or early 1960s. The farmyard itself has not been disturbed by plowing. Some cattle activity and the removal/destruction of the house appear to be the major impacts to this site. This site has tentatively been identified as medium priority since the landscape is still intact and structures are still present. A full pedestrian survey was not performed due to landowner refusal of access. Further archaeological and architectural evaluations are recommended. 7-72

| J pertinent to SSC properties and are developed to treat each property according to its potential National Register eligibility. For some properties, the next step is to gather additional physical or historical information in order to document or characterize their importance and prescribe an appropriate set of mitigative options that relate to proposed or anticipated project impacts. For many other properties, the work conducted to date provides not only enough information to determine their National Register importance, especially regarding Criterion D, but also as in HHM's study, in terms of Criteria A, B, and C. For these proposed ineligible properties, a determination of concensus should be sought from the appropriate review agencies. TABLE 8-1 THE NATIONAL REGISTER CRITERIA FOR SIGNIFICANCE The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and: A. that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or B. that are associated with the lives or persons significant to our past; or C. that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or D. that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. Criteria Considerations and Exceptions Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years shall not be considered eligible for the National Register. However, such properties will qualify if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria or if they fall within the following categories: 1. a religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance; or 2. a building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant primarily for architectural value, or which is the only surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic person or event; or 3. a birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no other appropriate site or building directly associated with his or her productive life; or 4. a cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events; or — §-2

MAJOR RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 8 An intensive archaeological and historical survey has been completed by Southern Methodist University for a large proportion of the lands and areas to be developed as part of the Superconducting Super Collider in Ellis County, Texas. As the previous chapters have indicated, this work has been focused on by Randall W. Moir, James M. Adovasio, and David H. Jumey specific, well defined tracts and parcels located within areas proposed to receive direct impacts or to be purchased in fee-simple or as easements. These studies by SMU have been conducted concurrently with another study by Hardy, Heck, and Moore, Inc., which has focused on architectural properties within all of Ellis County. The work by HHM consisted of a windshield survey which inventoried 3,714 structures in Ellis County and ranked them using a prioritization scale involving high, medium, and low priority categories for preliminary National Register Eligibility evaluations. A draft report covering HHM's work was received by SMU in July 1990, and pertinent information has been included in this report. A final report by HHM was received by SMU in October 1990 and information from it is currently being integrated into SMU's data base and site files. This chapter summarizes the major results of SMU's focused study on particular tracts and proposed project lands. Historic and archaeological properties greater than 50 years old and located within SMU's study areas were evaluated for their potential significance using National Register Criteria A, B, C and D. Table 8-1 provides these criteria and their definitions. Since HHM's study specifically focused on Criterion C but also included Criteria A, B, and to a lesser extent, D, this report deals most directly with Criteria A, B,.and D. Consequently, an archaeological property is reviewed not only for its artifactual contents but also for its association with significant events or broader patterns of events important to local and regional history, and finally for the importance of the people who lived or worked there. For prehistoric archaeological properties, Criterion A could include sites which may reflect band-based or more substantial population movements from the Brazos to the Trinity River drainages or from the High Plains to the East Texas woodlands when proper supporting evidence is identifiable. A Caddo mound site, for example, is also important under Criterion A as well as D. As these examples indicate, cultural properties may contain the variety of significance for their association with a particular event, place, setting, materials, or craftsmanship which goes beyond simply architecture or artifacts to embrace other qualities and entities important to a community's past and a region's history. This chapter reviews SMU's survey findings in regards to all four National Register Criteria and several sets of preliminary research questions useful for establishing contextual statements and evaluations (see Chapter 5). Recommendations presented here are naturally a direct result of the specific areas of significance 8-1 yy r fo

5. a reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with the same association has survived; or 6. a property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own historical significance; or 7. a property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance. Finally, this chapter provides a brief overview of SMU's intensive survey of about 9635 acres. An additional 1100 acres of fee-simple purchase areas and 4740 acres, under which the ring and subsurface facilities will be located, remain to be surveyed. Specific research contexts are also reviewed to address properties considered eligible under Criteria A, B, C, and D. In addition, recommendations for further work and also for potential treatments are reviewed. In regards to data collection options, strategies for addressing historic ard prehistoric properties are also summarized. This chapter concludes with a listing of all the properties identified by SMU and some of those recorded by HHM to date that are located in the SSC's primary impact areas. A few land tracts as well as most of the ring have not been reconnoitered (totaling 5840 acres) to date and so the results given here do not cover areas where landowner permission has not been received or land access has been denied. DELINEATION OF AREAS SURVEYED BY SMU The survey conducted by SMU may be broken down into the following six major component parts or subareas: West Campus (7500 acres), East Campus (1500 acres), Central Facility (450 acres; i.e., County Farm Lands), 25 Shaft Penetration Sites with 1256 acres, 129 Geotechnical drill sites (totalling approximately 350 acres), and SSC Ring Corridor (54 linear miles of 1000 ft wide corridor below which the SSC tunnel will be mined). The first three project areas do not overlap, while the last three (Shaft, Drill, Ring locations) overlap each other as well as some of the acreage defined by the first two locations (see Figures 8-1 and 8-2). Only the Central Facility does not overlap any other category of lands listed in this scheme. Table 8-2 indicates the status of SMU's Archaeological and historical intensive surveys for each of the six major SSC project areas as of September 1, 1990.

These are estimates only. These locations will mostly be incorporated in the ring corridor survey. Field investigations, informant interviews, and archival research were used to identify all known or likely properties over fifty years old or any property potentially eligible for the National Register younger than 50 years old. A pedestrian survey with shovel testing in poor ground visibility areas identified many new prehistoric and historic archaeological properties and increased the total number recorded at TARL for the entire county by 36%. Informant and local historical documents have identified another 12 properties not recognized to date without having these sources pinpoint their precise locations. As a result, a total of 77 archaeological and historical properties (13 prehistoric, 2 prehistoric/historic, and 62 historic) have been recorded to date. Since not all proposed project areas have been surveyed, we expect that another dozen to two dozen properties may be added after these areas are surveyed on the ground. Additionally, there is a high potential for buried archaeological sites in the South Prong Creek, Big Onion Creek, and Red Oak Creek penetration areas (M1, E8, M9). SUMMARY OF FINDINGS BY MAJOR SURVEY AREA Figures 8-1 and 8-2 show the locations of major SSC project lands, the location of specific historical and prehistoric properties, recorded during our survey (stars, open and closed circles) and the general eligibility status or priority ranking of each property using high/medium/low designations. The triangles in Figures 8-1 and 8-2 indicate the locations of some previously recorded sites (dark triangles-prehistoric, open triangles-historic), immediately adjacent to the SSC. High priority properties (stars) are deemed potentially eligible based on current information. Medium priority properties (dots) need further evaluation and consultation to make final eligibility determinations. Low priority (open circles) do not merit further work due to poor preservation of their contents, poor overall integrity, recent age, or lack of historic associations or scientific information. Tables 8-3 and 8-4 provide additional information on each site according to its TARL (alphanumeric) designation (e.g., 41EL121). The locations of some historic properties of notable interest to the SSC project fall well outside direct impact zones are also depicted on Figures 8-1 and 8-2. These particular properties were discussed in detail in Chapters 3 and 4 (see also Appendix C) and provide a broader historical framework for understanding the set of properties falling within the SSC project lands. The four major project areas surveyed to date are summarized next and these subsections provide a synopsis of the results to date. 8-4 C ie)

West Campus The West Campus, located about 3.5 miles west of Waxahachie, is the largest single block of land to be acquired by the SSC, covering approximately 7500 acres. Forty-one archaeological properties (1 prehistoric, 40 historic) were recorded in approximately 6500 acres surveyed to date. The town of Boz, located in the West Campus, contains multiple historic resources which have not been fully recorded to date and would increase the number of historic properties by an estimated 10%. This number does not include another 10 (approximate) properties less than fifty years old, many of which have been addressed and duly noted by HHM (1990) in their comprehensive windshield survey of standing structures. While several more important archaeological and historical properties may emerge from the intensive survey of Boz itself, we do not expect, for the most part, any sizeable increase in high priority properties under Criteria A, B, C, or D. East Campus The East Campus, starting about two miles northwest of Ennis, is the second largest component of the SSC, covering approximately 1500 acres. It is much more linear in configuration than the West Campus (Figure 8-1). Twenty-eight archaeological sites (11 prehistoric, 1 prehistoric/historic, and 16 historic) were recorded in approximately 1000 acres surveyed to date. As these preliminary data revealed, archaeological sites seem to be more common in the East Campus area (1 site per 36 acres) than in the West Campus (1 site per 158 acres). This may be due in part to location or environmental setting. The West Campus is situated entirely on the Austin chalk uplands (600 to 700 ft amsl) where historic farmsteads tend to be larger and prehistoric sites are extremely rare. Historic farmsteads seem to be smaller with a greater emphasis on tenant farming in areas around the East Campus (400 to 500 ft amsl). Prehistoric sites are also much more common in the East Campus, possibly due to the presence of naturally occurring lithic sources (Uvalde gravels) used to make stone tools. Also, the larger drainages and presence of springs may have drawn prehistoric peoples, as well at the closer proximity to the Trinity River just to the east. Central Facility The Central Facility, located 2.5 miles east of Waxahachie, is the third largest land unit of the SSC which may be used in the future for ancillary support of the project. It covers approximately 450 acres and has both historic and prehistoric components. Its tract limits follow the nineteenth century boundaries of the Ellis County Work Farm (41EL58). The Uvalde gravels also cover this general area, and some cobbles appear to have been modified by human activities (knapping as well as plowing). The tract also contains 8-5

archaeological remains dating to the 1880s, standing twentieth century buildings, and at least three historic period cemeteries. Shaft Penetrations The remaining SSC Project areas consist of 25 shaft penetrations (including cooling ponds and storage of excavated materials) which cover approximately 1256 acres. Three of these, E7, E9, and F7, have not been surveyed due to standing crops and landowner refusal of access. In all, seven sites (2 prehistoric, 5 historic) were recorded in approximately 1106 acres that were surveyed. « PRIMARY RESEARCH CONTEXT One of the primary research directions or overriding research framework behind the SSC archaeological and historical investigations is focused on human adaptations and human ecology of the Blackland Prairie in North Central Texas. While this focus for research and framework for property significance evaluations encompasses a broad array of historic and archaeological contexts, it does not eliminate the role that the National Register Criteria play in helping to identify significant properties. Instead, the human ecology research framework provides the fabric upon which individual threads or properties gain greater importance to our understanding of past peoples, places, periods, and events. The SSC project area is located in a major upland ecosystem known as the Blackland Prairies, which trend from northeast to southwest, and are flanked on both the east and west by very different ecosystems offering very different resources. Across the Blackland Prairies are major and minor tributaries which contain very different ecological resources than the adjacent upland blackland prairies and also offer both travel corridors as well as local obstructions depending upon seasonal conditions. ‘+ To the east of the SSC area, the Trinity River valley provides a zone of high biological potential. The Trinity River also served as a barrier to east-west travel, especially when flooded. Routes of travel were primarily north-south along the drainage divide of the Trinity and Brazos Rivers. The sediments which have been dumped into the Trinity River trench date through the Holocene into the Pleistocene. The forested Trinity bottomlands were the most extensive forested area in Ellis County. Narrower corridors of forested bottomlands projected westward along Chambers, Waxahachie, and Red Oak Creeks. The Trinity forest was composed primarily of post oak (20%), hackberry (16%) and ash (14%), and was conducive to the increased population of deer, wild turkey, bear, and other foragers of the forest. Also, seasonally available resources included waterfowl and fish. The Blackland Prairies located west of the Trinity forests range from gently rolling to level plains which were covered by dense tallgrasses throughout most, if not all of the Holocene and possibly portions 8-6 , —— = = > wd =

c~) of the Pleistocene. In the eastern and southern portions of the SSC, which lie within the blackland prairie zone, the valleys of Red Oak, Waxahachie, and Chambers Creeks were dominated by elm (30%) and hackberry (20%), with cottonwoods in lowlying or marshy areas. The portions of the upland blackland prairies fringing these stream valleys contained a transitional vegetation zone with saplings and mature trees dispersed within the tallgrass. Tree species included elm (27%), mesquite (23%), hackberry (16%), and cottonwood (11%). The lack of any substantial numbers of mast-producing oak trees provided a lower biomass for animal populations than in the Trinity floodplain forest. The majority of the West Campus falls in the medium to tallgrass prairie of the Austin Chalk. This was a relatively sparse environment with few water sources, primarily seasonal flow from surficial fissures. However some streams such as Greathouse Branch to the west did maintain water flow and the small floodplain contained mixed oak, pecan, and walnut forest. Therefore this vegetation zone undoubtedly atiracted deer, wild turkey and possibly small herds of bison. In Johnson County farther to the west, the Eastern Crosstimbers run north-south and was the nearest major forest to the west of the SSC. Even father west, the Brazos River supported a floodplain forest, but the dominant vegetation in this direction was prairie. Farther west of the Brazos Valley, the High Plains begins and contained shortgrass prairies and larger populations of herbivores. Consequently, the SSC project lands fall in a crucial ecosystem that itself forms a broad ecotone between deciduous forests to the east and shortgrass prairies to the west. Human use or lack of use of the SSC general area is both influenced by and a product of the Trinity prehistoric populations and those in adjacent areas. In this regard, even short term and low density lithic scatters potentially provide critical information on both transhumance and sedentism in a hinterland setting. Thus studies and research domains like those cited in Talmadge and Chessler (1977) have great applicability to research contexts and to the SSC National Register evaluations. Bottomland Versus Upland Studies The preliminary Research Questions outlined in Chapter 5 provide an empirical means of evaluating the potential eligibility of each site for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Also, the nature and contents of each site can be evaluated against their potential to address each Research Question. These Research Questions are not meant to be rigid, and will be refined and focused as more information is received from each site. The location of the SSC project area is quite different than the reservoir projects from which most of the prehistoric and historic archaeological evidence has been recovered in North Central Texas. In contrast to the previous studies, nearly universally conducted in lowland and generally better watered settings, the SSC area allows examination of a very different facet of human adaptation that is not possible in large scale Reservoir projects. Prehistoric archaeological sites in lowland settings which normally receive the greatest research attention, and which are usually considered National Register eligible, are in many cases “artifact mines” representing many different occupations by multiple generations and for ethnic/cultural groups, although some stratified alluvial sites are coming to light & North Central Texas. In contrast, the upland sites

and behaviors that:can be firmly tied to temporal or cultural associations. As such, these limited activity sites will lead to a fuller understanding of a portion of prehistoric settlement systems that has never been addressed in Texas. Despite the relatively large areas surveyed thus far in this project, the extant data base is superficially depauperate. The term "superficially" is used deliberately because despite the genuine paucity of prehistoric sites as well as their apparently meager artifact inventories, there is an extensive and potentially useful suite of methods which can be economically and judiciously employed not only to greatly enhance our knowledge of the prehistory and paleoenvironment of the study area, generally, but also to answer, refine and supplement the Research Questions outlined in Chapter 5. The same observations are applicable to the inventory of historic sites developed to date. Of course, by so doing, the resolution of the questions already posed in Chapter 5 as well as others raised in the course of this research provide an empirical means of evaluating the potential eligibility of each site to the National Register of Historic Places. “ — Marginal Versus Non-Marginal Resources Based on the research conducted to date, it is our consensus that the SSC study area is, in every sense of the term, marginal both prehistorically and historically (during the pre-railroad, 1870s period). Unfortunately, the term "marginal" has assumed negative connotations in CRM planning where none are actually implied by that label sui generis. We stress that by marginal, we are employing the term in a non- pejorative, strictly archaeological sense and are referring to a state or condition in which the apparent prehistoric and historic record of the study area is simply outside of or more accurately, peripheral to the mainstream of socio-cultural development as known elsewhere in adjacent portions of Texas. Put another way, marginality of and by itself is neither "good" nor "bad", “significant” nor “insignificant”. It is a condition or state which the vast majority of the world's archaeological and historic sites occupy yet marginality per se is a poorly studied phenomenon archaeologically or historically. ‘¢ In the specific context of the SSC study area, marginality describes a condition or set cf interactive conditions in which both the archaeological manifestations and the geoarchaeological settings in which they occur are different in degree and kind from their counterparts to the north and southwest and east. The sites, as noted above, are ephemeral and seem to reflect on the basis of surficial materials, transient utilization by highly mobile groups for short periods of time. Moreover, the array of distinct behavioral sets reflected by these sites seems, again on the basis of surface remains, to be highly circumscribed. It is, in our view, highly significant that several large scale and small scale projects recently executed in CRM contexts rather precisely address the issue of marginality both methodologically and theoretically. Moreover, it is useful in the context of this discussion that one of the principal investigators of several of those projects is also now an active participant in the SSC project. eS: = as CS) acum

t C7 ZT mE Comparative Studies in Marginality Recent CRM studies which have thoroughly addressed the archaeology of marginal areas include the massive Nashville District Corps of Engineers efforts in the Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway, the Huntington District Corps of Engineers studies in the Paintsville Lake Reservoir Area of Kentucky (Adovasio 1982) and the U.S. Forest Service multidisciplinary research in the Badlands of North Dakota. Individual smaller scale projects with similar goals notably include SMU's Joe Pool Lake project and parts of the Richland Creek project as well as the University of Pittsburgh investigations in Berks County, Pennsylvania. In all of these cases, the archaeological (and historical) sites and complexes identified and examined lay well outside of so-called "mainstream" developments in their respective regions. Moreover, most of the individual sites in all of these peripheral areas were at first glance as apparently "insignificant" as many of those identified to date in the SSC project area. This is especially true in the Paintsville Reservoir, North Dakota and Berks County situations cited above. The Paintsville Reservoir in Johnson and Morgan Counties, eastern Kentucky is even today a remote region physically isolated from the major tributary valleys like the Ohio River adjacent to it. However, the entire occupational sequence now known in this portion of the midwest is represented within the Reservoir boundaries at best by sites far less extensive and/or spectacular than their chronological peers nearby. Careful examination of selected sites and site types of all time periods allowed for the development of tightly controlled local chronology as well as for the elucidation of a wide array of cultural and behavioral patterns of groups operating in the "boondocks" of the midwest (Adovasio 1982). A broadly similar situation was evidenced in the Mackenzie County Badlands of North Dakota where "conventional wisdom" dismissed the possibility of significant archaeological sites and suggested instead that no long-term human occupation, utilization or even transit corridor ever characterized this extremely inhospitable region during the bulk of the Holocene. It is significant in this context that this picture of the Badlands exhibits certain broad characteristics not unlike those evidenced in the SSC study area. The Mackenzie County Badlands are an upland region, generally poorly watered, heavily dissected and with substantially fewer resources than the major river valleys on its periphery. However, like the SSC project area there are significant lithic resources in the form of local gravel veneers. Phase 1 research in this area conducted under the auspices of U.S. Forest Service and explicitly aimed at the location of low visibility, ephemeral sites, resulted in the location of hundreds of individual, predominantly single component loci which in overall size and properties clearly approximate many of those in the SSC study area, Rather than ignore these seemingly insignificant loci, the Forest Service mandated detailed scrutiny of many of them. This examination included instrument plotting of surface artifacts with attendant collection of the mapped artifacts followed by extensive shovel probing and ultimately the emplacement of numerous randomized test excavations at each selected locus. This in turn led to a series of large scale excavations on 8-9

certain properties which revealed not only deeply stratified sites invisible from the surface, but also resulted in the establishment of a series of local land/resource use patterns which could be directly linked to populations based in ecologically more inviting areas on the peripheries of the Badlands (East et al. 1982a, 1982b, 1983a, 1983b). In the Berks County situation, a relatively small (29m by 50m) and quite unobtrusive lithic scatter lying in the right of way of a Texas Eastern Gas Company pipeline was intensively examined both in the field and the laboratory and yielded invaluable data on a class of site which until that time had been ignored completely in local archaeological research designs. Berks County, like Johnson and Morgan Counties, Kentucky, and the Dakota Badlands is clearly on the fringes of major developments in the Archaic and Woodland periods of local prehistory but its investigation shed much light on the role of less preferred habitats in the activities of aboriginal hunter-gatherers in the greater Schuykill drainage of Pennsylvania (East et al. 1989). + Another example of intensive and productive archaeological investigations of marginal upland sites is Windy Ridge, a Middle Archaic site in South Carolina (House and Wogaman 1978). This site has no vertical stratification, but sampling and block excavations (point plotting of artifacts) yielded firm evidence of clustering ranging from casual loci where one or two cores were worked to relatively intense clusters of projectile points and tools of Morrow Mountain affiliation. At Windy Ridge, Archaic groups apparently used the site as a location for refurbishing their tool kits, leaving broken and resharpened tools and removing desirable raw materials (John House, Arkansas Archeological Survey, personal communication 1990). In the Southwest, archaeologists (Carmichael 1985; Cordell et al 1987; Johnson and Upham1986) have recently begun to focus on sites associated with mobile hunter-gatherers, which have been generally overlooked in favor of more obtrusive remains associated with sedentary populations. Upham (1988:245- 261) presents two examples of surveys in the Colorado Plateau region where limited activity sites (i.e., marginal) were systematically recorded and investigated. The results of these studies show radically different adaptive stragegies than previously supposed. The tempo of cultural development appears to be episodic, punctuated by periods of rapid cultural change, where large groups of mobile hunter-gatherers were assimilated into sedentary lifeways, and concludes that low visibility or marginal remains must be investigated along with more obtrusive sites in order to fully explain regional occupational pattems (Upham 1988:257-258). This approach augments the phase-based approach to cultural-historical reconstruction currently employed in archaeology and emphasises the heterogenous nature of local and regional settlement patterns. The importance of small, surface, and other marginal types of prehistoric sites, is unquestioned in order for archaeology to explore the full dimensions of past human experience. Also, since small sites often represent “instant” archaeological time (Mosely and Mackey 1972) where assemblages may be relatively pure and unmixed by subsequent occupations, limited activity sites can be helpful in delineating culturally 8-10

i 4 meaningful assemblages the analysis of which can be directed toward the study of larger more complex sites. Investigations of small, plowed, or other types of marginal sites (Binford 1970; Leeds 1974; McManamon; Robertson 1976: Roper 1976; Talmage and Chessler 1977) indicate that meaningful information and important data can be recovered from careful field examinations. In many areas of the United States where large stratified sites simply do not exist, excepiff within valley margins, small, seemingly insignificant upland siteg) may be used to understand the broader settlement system and cultural adaptations (Dancey 1974). It is absolutely necessary that small, marginal, and plowed sites be carefully considered in the development of cultural resource management plans and research designs and not simply a priori dismiss this class of cultural resource (Cowgill 1975; Asch 1975; McManamon 1976; Schiffer 1976). We believe the lesson from these studies in the present context is obvious. It is our contention that the (SC area ig at least as marginal)as any of these discussed here. Moreover, it is equally apparent that careful scrutiny of selected sites within the SSC area - if properly executed - could provide the same or even greater levels of information on the phenomena of marginality than any of the studies conducted to date inside or outside of Texas. Though focusing on the issue of marginality, investigation of selected prehistoric and historic sites in the SSC study area will also yield data on more conventional issues in local Texas prehistory. Specific research issues and suggested methodologies are detailed below. ORIENTATION FOR PREHISTORIC RESEARCH The prehistoric research questions for the SSC area originally articulated in Chapter 5 as well as the broader issue of marginality discussed here and the potential ability of the SSC sites to address them are presently hampered by the lack of surface collections or any detailed stratigraphic data from any of the identified sites. Resolution of these questions is also severely constrained by the fact that substantial portions of the "ring" area have not yet been systematically examined. Moreover, there is a distinct possibility that buried archaeological sites with no surface components exist in portions of the study area where aggredation has demonstrably occurred. To date, none of these localities has been invasively probed either to delimit sites or buried paleosols or their episodically stable surfaces. As a result, our present site sample must be considered presently unrepresentative of the full suite of archaeological resources which may exist in the study area. ° In all, thirteen prehistoric sites and two multicomponent prehistoric/historic sites have been recorded in the SSC project area. These range from isolated finds to light scatters of chipping debris and broken tools. Artifacts noted include broken dart points and tools made from non-local cherts. Based on the fragmentary items, some of the dart points may date from the Early or Middle Archaic. Six sites (41EL98, 41EL99, 41EL110, 41EL116, 41EL119, and 41EL127) have yielded sufficiently large and variegated assemblages to provide information on individual site use, differential occupation of the region through time, prehistoric 8-11 shove! a +e ted .

technology, paleoclimate and related issues. Collectively, these sites may well span the entire occupational history of the SSC area. The E8 penetration in Big Onion Creek may also yield paleoclimatic information which potentially is chronometrically circumscribable. Sites located near springs may also provide information relative to site or regional abandonment during the warm to hot middle Holocene (9000 B.C.-5000 B.C.), and include 41EL98, 41EL99, 41EL110, 41EL116, 41EL119, and 41EL127. The presence of springs may have attracted prehistoric poeoples during seasonally dry periods or extended droughts. The emergence of sedentism and information on population increase could potentially be addressed by sites 41EL98, 41EL99, 41EL110, 41EL116, and 41EL127. Again, chronometric control and a regional perspective on settlement trends will be necessary to properly address this question. «The exploitation of lithic resources has the best potential for being addressed, and sites which could provide relévant data include 41EL58, 41EL96, 41EL97, 41EL98, 41EL99, 41EL106, 41EL108, 41EL110, 41EL114, 41EL118, 41EL119, and 41EL127. Based on surface examinations, a range of lithic reduction strategies is represented at these sites. Also, certain types of materials may have been removed from the Uvalde veneer gravels, and it may be possible to model what types of materials were seledea by prehistoric groups through time. Finally some lithic materials are definitely nonlocal in origin. The use of nonlocal cherts suggests (1) that groups (or bands) were engaged in long range movements which took them to sources of cherts such as the Red River or Brazos River, or (2) nonlocal cherts and possibly tools were being exchanged as a part of broader regional systems of reciprocity involving several groups (bands) who most likely (but not necessarily) spoke similar languages. Secondary Research Questions for the prehistoric period have been included for additional comparison of archaeological properties, but further information will be necessary to evaluate each site's potential to address them. The presence of bison requires preservation of faunal remains in datable contexts. Sites which could potentially address the use of bison include 41EL110 and 41EL116. As discussed in Chapter 5, bison remains have been recovered from riverine contexts within 50 miles of the SSC and similar deposits may be present in those floodplain areas of Big Onion and Red Oak Creeks which will be impacted. by penetration shafts. Sites in depositional settings which may have protected archaeological remains include 41EL96, 41EL97, 41EL99, and 41EL110. These areas have received alluvial and/or colluvial deposition and stratified deposits may be present. Also historic land modification processes may have buried the original prehistoric landscape. Additionally, a systematic geologically and geomorphologically based deep testing plan should be initiated to address the identification of buried sites in these SSC contexts. The distribution of all prehistoric sites will be evaluated against the presettlement vegetation for Ellis County. Sites which may potentially contain paleobotanical information include 41EL96, 41EL97, and -41EL127, Since the vegetation greatly influences the animals available for subsistence and material goods, the paleoenvironmental information has great relevance to past human activities and settlement strategies. 8-12 = a is r t ——— L —— 6 e = me F { Le co

= & & previous studies have been conducted on them. a eeeeneeennnnn As noted above,some sites appear to represent short term uses of strategic landforms. Veneer gravels of Ogallala quartzites are one type of strategic resource, which may also have attract prehistoric activity. The -——— scientific value of such limited activity upland sites in North Central Texas is enhanced by the fact that no ? ORIENTATION FOR HISTORIC RESEARCH Studies of upland historic sites have also been relatively limited in Texas, with the major focus again from Reservoir projects (Moir and Jumey 1987; Jumey and Moir 1987; Jumey et al 1988). In some lignite mines, a limited number of historic farmsteads have recently received attention. Over the last decade historical archaeologists have conducted multidisciplinary approaches to the study of the recent past that involve many disciplines and alleviate any weaknesses inherent in a single field. For instance, cultural geographers have employed strict diffusionist paradigms and closed system models in their mapping of cultural areas, overlooking the fact that culture is an open social system (Green and Perlman 1985:6). Architectural historians focus on floorplans and ornamental details to establish dates of construction that in actuality denote periods of popularity. Often integral contruction technology and the over physical and historical context is overlooked in such attempts at absolute dating. Oral history is a valuable method of providing humanistic details about cultural properties or study regions, but these depend on the quality of mental recall, cultural biases of the informants, and after-the-fact perceptions of preceeding events or circumstances. History is totally dependent on the written record, which is frequently non-comprehensive in scope, dependent on the personal record (e.g., many deed records and tax rolls have bumed along with courthouses), and biased toward the history of socially prominent individuals. For instance, Carlson (1983), in the urban investigation of the Richard Carter family many types of documents that allowed the reconstruction of a fuller family profile. For tenant farmers, many ethnic minorities, and even some landowners (¢.g., the history of the Mingo Burleson family in Richland Creek; Jurney and Moir 1987), such a complete family history is lacking or is fragmentary. The investigations proposed for the significant historic cultural resources within the SSC will attempt to minimize the weaknesses of these disciplines and instead maximize their strengths through a synergistic approach. Dendrochronology, for instance, will be employed to determine the dates of construction of buildings as well as remodeling episodes. This information will then be compared to deed, tax, and census records, along with oral history and architectural analysis to reach a more comprenhensive picture of the historical context for a given property. Archaeological investigations will supplement this approach to determine if a structure has always served as a domicile or if it has always been at the present location. This approach, employing nonarchaeological professionals and multiple lines of evidence, is a dynamic method which will allow proper coordination of research necessary to apply federal guidelines in cultural 8-13

resources evaluations (Freeman 1990:383). These resources taken together offer a more detailed, representative picture of the local population and focus data recovery techniques on problems and issues that cannot be easily answered by a single body of information (Freeman 1990:384). - In all of Ellis County, only 10 historic sites were recorded prior to the SSC project, and none had received excavations or intensive investigations. The upland settings where the SSC project area are located were used in the prerailroad historic period for overland transportation, free-range husbandry and row crop agriculture. Following the railroad, Ellis County was linked to major regional markets, involving Dallas- Fort Worth, Waco, Clebume, Corsicana, and Kaufman. In all, 62 historic sites (including dwellings, cotton gins, churches, schools, farmsteads) and two multicomponent prehistoric/historic sites (County Farm, farmstead) have been recorded. These properties provide the opportunity to study the full scale of settlement patterning in upland settings, which has not been accomplished to date in North Central Texas. “The distribution of the Public Domain and land speculation greatly influenced the settlement of Ellis County. Many of the General Land Office and Ellis County surveyors (see Appendix B) such as B. J. Chambers, J. E. Patton, G. W. Cunningham, R. A. Davis, and R. M. Wyatt surveyed land within the SSC project area, and several actually owned some of the tracts which will be affected by the project. Also several early settlers (E. M. Brack, J. M. Dunaway, Samuel and John Billingsley, Peter Stout, O. E. Dunlap, P. C. Sims, B. F. Forrester) developed relatively large estates which contained a number of the cultural resources described in this report. Historic sites located on tracts belonging to land speculators and entrepreneurs may yield archaeological and archival evidence of their influence on settlement, and include 41EL75 (J. M. Dunaway), 41EL77 (B. F. Forrester), 41EL80 and 41EL81 (G. W. Cunningham), 41EL93 and 41EL95 (Peter Stout), and 41EL104 (a homestead which involved suspicious activities of R. M. Wyatt, see Chapter 7). E. M. Brack was one of these early land entrepreneurs, and his daughter married J. M. Dunaway (41EL75). His homesite is located within the project area, but is within an area of Boz which has not yet ben surveyed (see Appendix C) x The residential occupations of sites may contain archaeological evidence of the material possessions as well as technological innovations and change of these early settlers and their descendants. Sites which could potentially address this question include 41EL59, 41EL62, 41EL75, 41EL77, 41EL79, 41EL80, 41EL81, 41EL82, 41EL84, 41EL88, 41EL109, 41EL120, 41EL121, 41EL124, and 41EL135. Archival and informant information for all of these properties has not been fully collected and a number of elderly individuals are currently (November 1990) being interviewed. For instance, Jerry Dolezal still lives at one of his family's homesteads (41EL119) and can provide many further details on land use and the material culture that circulated through the household. Economic and settlement responses to the introduction of the railroad may be addressed by sites dating prior to and after the railroad (1866-1872) and include 41EL59, 41EL84, 41EL93, 41EL109, and 41EL134. ~The railroad caused a major shift in the economic practices that the occupants of these sites followed. For example, cotton agriculture was not a major enterprise prior to the railroad because of the high costs for 8-14 =)

i ) transportation. The East Campus area near Ennis was the first to obtain the railroad (ca. 1871), and farming practices shifted to cotton growing much earlier there than in the West Campus area, which did not obtain a railroad until the early twentieth century (see Chapter 4). Farm success and failure can be measured by both long occupations and short occupations of sites, and information relative to this question could be provided by sites 41EL59, 41EL61, 41EL67, 41EL68, 41EL69, 41EL72, 41EL73, 41EL77, 41EL80, 41EL82, 41EL88, 41EL90, 41EL93, 41EL95, 41EL120, 41EL121, 41EL124, and 41EL134. The relative success of a farm can be obtained not only through the archival record by examining tax and deed records, but also by farm creation and abandonment and examination of artifact assemblages to determine influxes of new goods and commercially purchased items. Secondary Research Questions may also be addressed by the data contained in historic archaeological sites. Informant and archival information is also available for the sites relevant to these questions. Marriage patterns greatly influenced the community formation and the structure of farms in Ellis County, with many women inheriting farms and maintaining them during their lives. Sites which may address the implications of this Research Question include 41EL69, 41EL75, 41EL77, 41EL79, 41EL81, 41EL95, and 41EL100. Sarah Brack, the daughter of Judge E.M. Brack, married J.M. Dunaway and together they formed on of the most extensive estates in the West Campus area. Several descendants and relatives still live in the area and provide cultural continuity from initial frontier settlement to the present day. The identification of ethnicity is possible through archival research and informants, and sites which could provide information on ethnic integration include 41EL74, 41EL81, 41EL84, 41EL100, 41EL104, and 41EL119. The history of Isaac and Ann Newton (41EL104) can possibly illustrate how many African Americans were incorporated into the social fabric of the West Campus area. Also the Dolezal family (41EL119), Bavarian immigrants in the early twentieth century illustrate a national trend of European immigration, from which many of today's occupants in the East Campus area derived their cultural heritage. Informants also can provide mental maps of sites and communities, and archaeological evidence can be used to corroborate or elucidate this information. Sites which could potentially address this question include 41EL74, 41EL77, and 41EL100. For instance, current residents of Boz have provided information on cultural properties there which have not yet been inventoried, as well as some that indicate the timing of marriages and domestic occupations. Another wealth of information is recorded on the tombstones in Jocal cemeteries, such as at Bethel Church, which can provide firm dates on births and deaths as well as family members which may not be recalled by others. Material cultural correlates of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and time can possibly be provided by sites 41EL58, 41EL59, 41EL62, 41EL67, 41EL72, 41EL77, 41EL80, 41EL81, 41EL82, 41EL88, 41EL95, 41EL104, 41EL109, and 41EL120. Socioeconomic status has implications in the settlement patterning which may point to when the early settlers finally achieved financial success and either moved their household from the initial homestead (e.g. 41EL80 and 41EL81), or turned the farm over to tenants 8-15

and moved into town (41EL75). This research question is the most applicable to the archaeological record and can provide educational materials for displays as well as research. The effects of the integration of social welfare through the operations of the County Poor Farm can be examined archaeologically at site 41EL58. Also, as shown in Appendix B, the County Farm was a major influence in the maintenance of the county's road system. The informant and archival records associated with this cultural resource also can provide additional information on this facility which was a focal aspect of the county's history from the 1880s to the 1960's. The research and investigations to be proposed for historic properties in the SSC will provide Ellis County residents with a detailed synergistic view of their county's rural heritage as viewed through the sites and communities to be studied. In comparison to other major CRM investigations, the SSC will be focused specifically on Blackland Prairies and upland drainages with deciduous forests that make up the majority of Ellis County by area. =. OPTIONS FOR SSC RESEARCH DOMAINS In the short view, the archaeological and historic survey of the Superconducting Supercollider Study Area has been very informative. The great majority of the impact zones and easements have been examined and based on non-invasive scrutiny, a large "sample" of potentially representative historic and prehistoric sites have been identified. However, as so-called "traditional" and CRM archaeological consensus dictates, the present effort represents only a first step not an end product in a much more involved research and mitigative undertaking. Since much of the SSC involves "marginal" types of resources these next steps are not expected to be overwhelming but do require a well-founded approach. = This well-founded approach requires us to look closely at the types of cultural and environmental resources present and match them with the necessary applied technology available to recover data pertinent to the research design. Perceiving the research potentials of SSC upland sites literally means maximizing their informational value. The SSC sitesShould be explored with cost-effective state-of-the-art methods to produce a series of data sets which will add immensly to Texas archaeolo d equally implement the letter and spirit of Federal and State cultural resource management legislations. The overall research strategy and specific excavation methods proposed below, in conjunction with detailed analysis, integration, synthesis, and publication of results of materials will accomplish these CRM goals. In so doing, a significant increment will be added to the corpus of Texas prehistory and history and hopefully a model of how such upland site characterizations and mitigative efforts can proceed in the future will emerge. Not all of the techniques presented below wil be needed or required to pursue SSC research domains. They are listed here, however, to provide the full range of options possible, but not mandated for any particular property at this time. - 8-16 C | = =) C- em | =]

a Es a ee fe 1 , Geoarchaeological Analysis An in-depth understanding of the regional geology is necessary for the proposed research. First, it is essential to reconstruct the study area's physical and environmental setting during the period(s) of aboriginal occupation. This will involve a detailed reconstruction of the topographic setting of each site to be excavated, and as far as possible, a reconstruction of the paleohydrology for the purpose of estimating not only water resources available to the occupants but also the effects of water related site degradation. Second, it is necessary to develop an inventory of the locally available geological resources. This will allow for an analysis of the sources of lithic materials, sources for ceramic paste and temper, and availability of any structural building materials. The establishment of the region's topographic setting during the time of its aboriginal occupation is critical in ‘determining whether erosional and/or climatic changes contributed to the termination or modification of any part of the cultural sequence (Donahue 1985). Establishment of a reference collection of local rock and soil types is important in determining the province of artifactual raw materials, especially lithics and ceramics, as well as that of any structural building materials. Lithic Analysis We plan to characterize the range of@ay-recovered)lithic material in terms of mineralogy and rock type and to establish whether any "exotic" lithic materials exist within the study area (Banks 1990), and if so, to determine their probable province and methods of acquisition. We also wish to ascertain whether the lithic resources have been heat-treated to improve their knapping qualities. The Uvalde gravels, which are the principal local lithic raw materials, have not been systematically mapped or described (Banks 1990). Two general methods will be used to characterize lithic resources. First, thin sections of representative samples will be prepared for examination with the petrographic microscope. In addition, thin sections of possible source materials will be made. Second, the mineralogy and elemental composition of different lithic types will be determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic absorption (AA). Where necessary, computer controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) and electron micro-probe analysis will be utilized. The exact number of all of these analyses that will be required shall be determined by individual work orders. These analyses will allow us to characterize the range of utilized lithic resources. They will also potentially allow the determination of internal and external trade/exchange patterns, In addition, petrographic and XRD examination should allow us to determine whether heat treatment was employed in the manufacture of lithic artifacts, the nature of the heat treatment, and what effect this treatment had on the flaking or knapping properties of lithic raw materials. Finally, lithic materials will be heated experimentally and the results of these treatments will be compared with the artifacts and the source material. 8-17

All lithic artifact analyses will be performed according to the provenience categories and sampling design established during field investigations. All lithic artifacts recovered from each stratum within the sites will be analyzed for lithic raw material type and sorted into discrete technomorphological categories. Detailed discriminant attribute analysis will be performed on all worked/formed implements, cores and core fragments, and utilized flakes. The unmodified debitage, which is expected to be numerically predominant among the flaked stone artifacts, will be randomly sampled for attribute analysis. Technomorphological attribute analysis for each selected specimen seeks to establish diachronic variations in lithic raw material preferences, lithic raw material procurement techniques, the processes of lithic reduction, the stages of lithic manufacture, the range of represented manufacturing techniques, and potentially, the use and techniques of heat treatment in the production of lithic artifacts. +A subsample of the selected unmodified debitage and utilized flakes will be randomly drawn for functional analysis, blood residue analysis, and identification of use-wear patterns (see Functional Analysis). The:unmodified debitage subsample will serve as a control to establish a baseline for the minimum amount of use-wear present on flaked stone tool edges and surfaces. This control will also serve as a check on any demonstrable selection preferences among various types of utilized flakes. Morphological, technological, and functional attribute analyses will be conducted on all ground stone artifacts. This analysis will attempt to identify: 1) local sources of lithic raw material for the production of ground stone implements (i.e., manos, metates, pestles, hammerstones, mauls, etc.); 2) stages and techniques in manufacture; and 3) dynamics of tool use, such as direction, duration, and the intensity of motion used in producing the tool. All lithic analysis procedures are designed to describe and define the lithic artifacts as well as the associated technologies and production processes utilized by the aboriginal populations of the study area. Special attention will be devoted to the ecological parameters affecting the manufacture and use of these tool kits: 4 Intrasite spatial and temporal distribution studies within each lithic tool type as well as for other classes of lithic artifacts can be expected to yield data on the nature of site utilization through time. Similarly, identification and/or confirmation of lithic raw material sources may produce new insights into the nature and extent of aboriginal human populations within the study area. Lithic morphology traditions in the study area should also become apparent as should functional similarities and differences in tools represented at each of the sites. Specific methods of lithic analysis to accomplish each of these goals of investigation are discussed in the following section. Morphological Analysis _ . . As indicated previously, morphological analysis will be undertaken for the entire drawn sample of worked/formed flaked stone and for all ground stone artifacts from undisturbed contexts. The primary purpose of this analysis is to provide (via detailed, consistent description and measurement of each selected 8-18 Sy GS

Cc) tool) a notion of the stylistic variability among lithic artifact types through time and space for each of the archaeological sites. This is a necessary step to any subsequent attempt to explain or account for artifact homogeneity or heterogeneity within the overall lithic assemblage. Discrete attributes of shape, configuration, size, raw material, flaking patterns, presence or absence of grinding, indications of hafting, and other characteristics of tool macromorphology will be recorded and used to refine the classification of diagnostic (i.e., named) projectile point types and so-called “non-diagnostic” projectile point types, bifaces, unifaces, etc. Both qualitative attributes and measurements for each artifact will be coded in machine-readable form for computer storage, retrieval, and analysis. Specific categories of lithic examination are encoded on standardized lithic analysis forms. This phase of lithic analysis establishes artifact morphotypes used to compare lithic assemblages among the represented site components. The results of morphological analysis will be intégrated with those from the technological and functional analyses to establish the extent to which tool form may have affected or was affected by tool use and the processes by which such tools are made. The database built up via such comparisons is useful in establishing technomorphological types for all categories of worked/shaped flaked stone and ground stone implements. Technomorphological types, in turn, can be used to investigate spatial and temporal variability among different lithic activity sets, these are lithic tool types which most frequently are found together and therefore covary over time and space. Lithic activity sets, in turn, are important indications of the aboriginal human behaviors which created or used these tool sets in culturally defined ways. Lithic analysis, therefore, is a means for understanding a cultural system. Technological Analysis As previously indicated, technological analysis will be conducted for the entire drawn sample of flaked stone and for all ground stone artifacts from excavations in the study area. All of the sampled unmodified debitage, cores and core fragments, utilized flakes, worked/shaped flaked stone implements, and all complete and fragmentary ground stone artifacts will be analyzed to identify the full range of lithic technological variability represented within the site assemblages. Both continuous and discrete technological attribute sets for identifying flaked stone and ground stone tool modification and reduction processes will be assessed. Attributes ranging from raw material acquisition, or its entry into the aboriginal lithic technology "system," to patterns of implement discard or presumed loss will be recorded. Patterns of lithic raw material procurement and preference, processes of primary and secondary raw material reduction, stages of tool manufacture, patterns of breakage, the range of manufacturing techniques employed, patterns of international heat treatment (e.g., is heat treatment used with only particular raw material types?), as well as patterns of tool rejuvenation, reworking, and discard will be assessed using standardized sheets. The resultant data will be coded for computer storage, retrieval, and analysis. 8-19

The proposed analysis of the unmodified lithic debitage utilizes many variables (including flake size) that are sensitive to and reflective of the general process of flaked stone reduction. Specific factors affecting flaked stone tool manufacture will be evaluated which have been shown in other studies to correlate with specific aspects of human behavior (e.g., tool rejuvenation). Finally, the proposed technological analysis of flaked stone artifacts from the study area will include an investigation of the effects of intentional heat treatment on the flaking or knapping properties of chert and other lithic raw material. As a last step in this phase of the lithic analysis, samples from the archaeological sites that appear to have been heat treated will be scrutinized using the same scientific methods of investigation. This step will permit comparison of aboriginally treated and laboratory treated lithic material. These analytical methods may help to determine whether putative thermally altered lithics in the archaeological assemblage were, in fact, aboriginally heat-treated and, if so, under what conditions such treatment was carried out. Replication and comparison with archaeological specimens should enhance knowledge about the exact physical changes that occur within these lithic raw materials that facilitate knapping. Results of the technological attribute analysis will, of course, be incorporated with those from the morphological and functional analyses to determine the extent to which strictly technological parameters affect or condition final tool appearance and the functional capabilities of lithic artifacts. Demonstrated changes or adaptations in lithic tool technology will be assessed for how they covary with changes in tool morphology and function for each site component. Functional Analysis A functional analysis will be conducted for all of the identified flaked stone technomorphological types (including worked/shaped implements, utilized flakes, cores and core fragments, and apparently unmodified debitage), For the most common flaked stone tool types, a subsample will be drawn for functional analysis. For less common types, all examples in the original sample will be analyzed. Functional anclysis will be conducted for all of the selected ground stone artifacts. The primary goal of this analysis is to establish the ways in which components of the lithic assemblage were utilized aboriginally. This can be accomplished by examining macrowear and microwear patterns and by blood antigen analysis. Examination of stone tool edges for blood antigen residues is a new technique in lithic use-wear analysis (Loy 1983; Downs 1985; Yohe et al. in press; Hyland, Tersak, Adovasio, and Siegel 1990). Blood antigen is relatively resistant and is more likely to be preserved in dry microenvironments and/or within a clay-rich soil matrix. Given favorable preservation, the technique is not constrained by the duration of an artifact's deposition. All requisite instrumentation and technical expertise for performing this type of - analysis are available. Functional attribute analysis of the flaked stone artifacts and a portion of the ground stone artifacts will examine patterns of use-wear variability along the edges and surfaces of selected artifact types (e.g., 8-20 ane) E cS paws) CS

projectile points, cores, flakes, manos, etc.). This will be undertaken for each of the sites investigated, thus yielding both synchronic and diachronic functional data. Both continuous and discrete lithic attributes and attribute sets, which collectively make up the use- wear patterns seen along the edges and on the surfaces of flaked stone and ground stone artifacts, will be scrutinized at both low magnification (up to 45X) and high magnification (up to 400X) and the observations will be recorded. Comparable examination will be conducted on replicated “artifacts” made and used in documented ways. The attributes and attribute states assessed in the functional analysis are those derived from a variety of published sources (Ahler 1971, 1979; Hayden 1979; Keely 1980; Odell 1979; Tringham et al. 1974). Qualitative and quantitative data for each attribute or attribute state will be coded for computer storage, retrieval, and analysis using standard data analysis programs such as Condor. These analyses may allow the functions of individual lithic implements (e.g., the direction, duration, and manner of use) to be inferred and may produce new knowledge on the nature of the raw material. Such analyses also may reflect ways in which actual or intended use affected or conditioned flaked stone tool morphology. Replicative Experimentation Experiments in lithic replication will be conducted to understand better the stylistic, technological, and functional variability in the lithic assemblages from each of the sites. A lithic raw material sample of considerable mass and mineralogical diversity (representing all known chert vareities utilized prehistorically in the study area) will be required to execute the proposed replicative studies (see Geoarchaeological Analysis). It is currently expected, though not rigidly assumed, that two major lithic reduction processes will be represented in the artifact samples: opportunistic (i.e., prepared) core reduction and biface manufacture. Each of these manufacturing pathways will be studied through replication experiments. Replicative cores of the most commonly utilized raw material varieties will be decorticated. These cores will be prepared (i.e., proper core morphology will be established and maintained) and reduced to primary and secondary unmodified flake debitage in the ways suggested by analysis of each component of the archaeological assemblage (e.g., direct freehand percussion, indirect percussion, "hard-hammer" and “soft-hammer"/billet flake removal, etc.). In each instance, the resulting unmodified debitage should produce comparable data on prepared core reduction techniques for each cultural/technological "tradition" represented in the archaeological collections. How these technologies changed or maintained stability over time will also be investigated. Data on “artisan errors” (Muto 1971:59-63), overshot terminations, feather-to-hinge/step fracture termination ratios, and lithic raw material quality will be compared carefully with archaeological samples to understand the maintenance, decline, or improvement in aboriginal flintworking expertise over time and throughout the study area, Idiosyncratic or “signature” pieces from the archaeological collections may or may not point to similarities among the aboriginal human populations who occupied the study area sites. The phenomenon 8-21

of artisan: specialization may or may not be demonstrable from examination of the archaeological collections, but can be further investigated via replicative experimentation. The demonstration of craft specialization has obvious connotations for reconstruction of aboriginal social organization, and the implications of this phase of the lithic analysis will be pursued. Experimental bifaces will be replicated using the techniques suggested for each component by study of the archaeological samples. Biface manufacture will be conducted from quarry blank, primary flake, or secondary flake stages through completed projectile point/knife (or rejuvenated projectile point/knife). The replicated lithic debitage may help to discern biface manufacturing regimes represented in each archaeological component or site. Stages of lithic manufacture (Callahan 1979; Bonnichsen 1983; Storck 1983), the range of manufacturing techniques (Callahan 1979), and patterns of tool discard will received particular attention. Variation in flintworking “expertise” will be guaged by comparing relative frequencies of represented lithic manufacture techniques, perverse and outrepasse (manufacture-related) fractures, and feaiher-to-hinge/step fracture termination ratios within the replicated and archaeological samples. Replicative experiments to determine flake stone tool use will be conducted during all phases of the lithic analysis. Finished and unfinished worked/shaped lithic implements, cores and core fragments, and unmodified pieces of debitage from various raw materials (some heat treated) will be employed experimentally. The interrelationship between tool raw material, shape, the nature of the material worked by the stone tool, work direction, manner and duration of working, etc., will be examined. These factors combine to produce observed macroscopic and microscopic patterns of use-wear on the tools. Tool functions within the archaeological samples therefore can be inductively studied by examining similar patterns of use- wear on replicated specimens. The anticipated result is that at least some specific prehistoric functional activities for stone tools (e.g., cutting wood, bone, or meat; scraping wood or hide; piercing hard or soft materials; etc.) may be identifiable at one or more of the sites as well as within particular areas at each site that may have served job-specific functions. Variability Analysis "An inter-assemblage variability analysis that identifies sets of flaked stone implements with covarying frequencies in different assemblages constitutes an exercise in exploratory statistics. In the proposed lithic analysis, statistical techniques whose strengths lie in searching for artifact patterns rather than in testing hypotheses will be employed. A thorough statistical exploration for the kinds of patterns of variability to be sought will require the application of several techniques and variants of them. K-means clustering is one technique well-suited to this task. In applying K-means clustering, the same entities that form the units of ‘sampling design (i.e., the assemblages, component by component and site by site) will form the basic. assemblage units. The frequencies of the various artifact types in these assemblages will form the basis for measuring differences among the artifact types, which are the entities to be clustered. The measure of these differences used in K-means clustering is Euclidean distance, which can be varied by using different forms of 8-22 LJ

standardizing the raw data before the distances are calculated. The end product of such a K-means clustering is, of course, a series of sets of artifacts whose frequencies in different assemblages covary. A different approach, which is sometimes more successful in delineating the kinds of patterns sought in this analysis, is nonmetric multidimensional scaling. As in K-means clustering, the artifact types form the cases in the analysis, and differences between them are measured on the basis of their frequencies in the different assemblages. A wide variety of similarity or dissimilarity measures can be employed, however, making it possible to avoid undesirable effects sometimes involved in the application of Euclidean distance to certain data sets. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling also makes no assumptions about the nature of the metrics involved in measuring similarities between artifact types. The results are readily displayed graphically in two or more dimensions and often make it possible to screen out variability deriving from sources not relevant to the interassemblage variability analysis. Graphic displays of results can be examined visually, of course, for various kinds of patterning, including a tendency for artifacts to group into sets. Such sets can be defined, and the probabilities of their “reality” as sets also can be evaluated by further analysis of the geometry of the point configurations which are the results of the scaling. Both K-means clustering and nonmetric multidimensional scaling, then, are ideally suited to the Statistical exploration of a data set composed of frequencies of artifacts in different assemblages. Both analytical methods provide systematic ways of isolating sets of artifacts whose frequencies covary; this is, of course, the kind of result that archaeologists ordinarily expect of such analysis, for it provides a systematic view of what ordinarily are presented as individual artifact “types.” Both methods also provide indications of the extent to which such a result (i.e., the identification of artifact sets or clusters) is an accurate and complete reflection of the patterns of variability in the data. These methods also provide the means for the analysis of large numbers of cases, unlike many clustering techniques. Finally, and principally through the graphic and geometric representation of results, both forms of statistical analysis make it easy to examine other aspects of patterning in the data, such as the internal structure of the clusters identified and ambiguous or multiple-cluster membership exhibited by particular artifact types. The flaked stone analysis simultaneously deals with variability among sites as well as variability through time at the level of chronological components. The study of such variability within components at individual sites will be based on the provenience units where material was piece-plotted during the fieldwork. For any site component where there is a sufficient number of such units, the same kind of multivariate analysis discussed in the previous paragraphs will be repeated. This will provide an opportunity to delineate any finer scale variability that may exist between assemblages from different units. At the finest level of resolution, the distribution of artifacts from each of the piece-plotted units will be studied. The first step will be the graphic representation of three-dimensional surfaces whose elevations represent artifact densities. Such graphic representation can begin at the level of major artifact classes and proceed to the level of the artifact sets defined in the interassemblage variability study, and finally, to the level of the individual artifact type whenever sufficient numbers of artifacts exist to make it meaningful to 8-23

study the spatial distribution of them. Any artifact clustering that exists can be identified visually and, if necessary, tested statistically (for example, by the application of nearest neighbor statistics). Correspondence in the clustering of different artifact sets or types can also be evaluated visually and, where necessary, statistically through significance testing of areas with cluster overlap. It is at this stage in the overall lithic analysis that one is genuinely in a position to discuss activities carried out at the level of the individual site architectural unit, the site component, the site, and the chronological phase. This is accomplished by integrating the interassemblage and intra-assemblage variability analysis (whose major product is a delineation of lithic tool kits); the morphological analysis (whose major product for these purposes is a consideration of what functions the different tool types seem well-suited for); and the flaked stone tool wear analysis (whose major product is conclusions about ways in which different tool types were used). It is hoped that information about floral and faunal remains on a given site, component by component and feature by feature, will be available at this juncture. Unfortunately, the proability that such will be the case is exceedingly difficult to assess from the site data records presently available. Suffice it to note that every reasonable attempt will be made to incorporate such data to achieve a holistic understanding of human life and adaptation at each of the prehistoric and historic archaeological sites encountered. Ceramic Analysis Physical Methods These analyses will characterize the paste and temper composition of ceramic specimens in order to aid in the final determination of unique ceramic types. More importantly, the identification of unique ceramic compositions may allow us to determine if manufacturing centers existed within or near the study area and whether trade networks were present. Additionally, we propose to investigate firing and decorative techniques. +.Two major methods of analysis will be employed in this investigation. The first method will utilize petrographic examination of thin sections made from ceramic sherds. This technique will allow the determination of temper composition and the shape and orientation of temper grains and voids. The second method will utilize XRD, SEM, and electron microprobe to determine the bulk mineral, clay mineral, and elemental composition of the paste. This analysis will allow us to firmly determine the number of unique ceramic types present in the study area based on paste and temper composition rather than rare stylistic variables. Examination of the resultant data based on paste and temper composition. Examination of resultant data base should allow us to determine if ceramic manufacturing “centers” were present in or near the study area. It may also allow the identification of trade networks within, and possibly, outside the study area. Analysis of the bulk and clay mineral composition and the color of ceramic artifact paste components will allow us to estimate their firing temperature. Data on the shape and orientation of temper grains within the ceramics will yield further 8-24

information on temper province and preparation, while void shape and orientation will provide information on ceramic manufacture (Beynon et al. 1986). Form and Function It is possible that some of the sites recorded to date may yield ceramic remains. The first goal of the proposed research for any ceramic analysis is to utilize a methodological protocal for interpreting site function from ceramic assemblages. Using ceramic collections obtained from the fieldwork, a formal- functional analysis will provide the basis for an interpretation of site use at the regional level. Two problem areas is particular will be addressed in the proposed work: 1) the recognition of the patterns of production and distribution of any recovered types; 2) the definition of patterns of functional variability in ceramic assemblages from site to site within the universe of sites to be examined. Each of these topics is further discussed and developed in the remainder of this proposal section. Patterns of Production and Distribution of Ceramics Problem-oriented research in the study of contemporary aboriginal ceramics is among the most significant of archaeological endeavors as it combines the results of physical methods of analysis with more traditional typological studies. The ultimate objectives of these holistic inquiries is to leam more about the potter, the user of the potter's wares, the level of aboriginal technical command of the ceramic medium, and the sources of clay and temper. One example of the applicability of such studies can be seen in the American Southwest, where the ceramics of the Salado culture of Arizona are now being examined and the data are being assessed for evidence of patterns of extra regional cultural interaction. For example, painted ceramics of the Salado series have been identified throughout Arizona, as well as western New Mexico and northern Mexico. This widespread distribution often has been interpreted as representing evidence for extensive trade networks with the Salado area. This interpretation contains two critical assumptions: 1) that Salado ceramics occurring outside the Salado “heartland” are nonlocal in origin; 2) that the area of greatest abundance of Salado ceramics (i.e., the Salado “heartland") was the nexus of production, if not distribution. Compositional analyses suggest, however, that both of these assumptions may be wrong. Contrary to the first assumption are several compositional analyses that suggest that local production of Salado ceramics may not be ruled out, even in areas lying outside the Salado "heartland" (e.g., Martin and Rinaldo 1960). Contrary to the second assumption is the finding that even within the Salado “heartland,” the presence of several production areas is indicated, and, further, that abundance may not necessarily be a good indicator of local production. Further research on patterns in the production and distribution of Salado ceramics is therefore needed in order to answer some basic questions about trade and exchange, and to assess the implication of this data in the analysis of regional and inter-regional interaction in the SSC area. As is true of the Salado culture, the proposed project in the SSC area affords an unprecedented opportunity to refine further our interpretations of the production and distribution of various wares 8-25

indigenous to the area. The analysis of samples: obtained from the project area should contribute significantly to the cultural interpretability of the previously analyzed samples from the study area. Several different analytical techniques should be used together in order to identify production and distribution pattems within the project area. These include analyses of local, potential raw material sources, as well as the analysis of finished ceramic artifacts. Analysis of the latter topic alone cannot offer the level of interpretation provided by the two together. For this reason, geological investigations focusing on the collection of clay and temper samples that may have been used for ceramic production have been integrated into the geoarchaeological portion of the fieldwork and analysis stages (see Geoarchaeological Analysis). This analysis will be used in historic archaeological investigations to examine brick and stoneware manufacturing at small and large scales (e.g., peasant industries and commerical enterprises). ‘zIn the analysis of finished ceramic artifacts several different analytical techniques can be used to identify differences ‘in ceramic composition. These include: 1) analysis with binocular microscope; 2) analysis with petrographic microscope; 3) X-ray diffraction; 4) X-ray fluorescence. The first two analytical techniques are best suited for the analysis of aplastic inclusions (i.e., temper). X-ray diffraction generally treats clay and temper together for a single signature but can also help to identify differences in clay content alone. X-ray fluorescence will be used for element composition analysis of the clays to reflect the bulk mineralogy of the clay sources. Together, these four techniques will provide the range of analytical methods needed for processing the sample universe anticipated by this project and for procuring complementary information on variability in both clay and temper. Noted variability will then be studied in terms of production and distribution. Due to the necessity and desirability of integrating the geoarchaeological analyes with the physical methods of ceramic analysis, these sampling and analysis methodologies are further treated in the Geoarchaeological Analysis section of this Chapter. Functional Variability in Ceramic Assemblages =In addition to assessing the range of temper types and decorative styles, compositional analysis sampling will assess the range of vessel forms that is present within the ceramic assemblage. Composition comparisons will be made within each morphological category in order to isolate variability that is attributable to function. Archaeologists now recognize that studies of site function offer great potential for understanding the structure of prehistoric subsistence-settlement systems. They have further recognized that the traditional bipartite site types of "habitation" vs "limited activity" are of little use in understanding the range of activities conducted at ceramic bearing archaeological sites. The analysis of functional variability in ceramic assemblages is an important interpretive method for understanding variability in the use of sites, both within and between regions. In contrast to the study of lithic assemblage variability, the implications of functional variability among ceramic assemblages for understanding regional settlement patterns have been relatively unexplored. 8-26 eS =

r L For example, several measures of ceramic assemblage variability have been used in the Southwest to interpret settlement patterns. The most common approaches have included the use of bowl/ar ratios (e.g., Acklen 1982; Goodyear 1975), the relative frequencies of general form and surface treatment variables (e.g., Doyel 1978a, 1978b, 1980; McAllister and Plog 1978; Mills 1986; Plog 1980; Sebastian 1983), and the variety or diversity of vessel classes present in an assemblage (e.g., Braun 1980; Pilles 1978; Powell 1984; Reid 1982). With few exceptions, these analyses have used a priori settlement types and have then looked at the correlation of ceramic assemblage variables with these types. The independent analysis of ceramic assemblages to help define differences in the use of sites has not been widely employed. Settlement types have been expressed in very general categories, such as habitation site vs. limited activity sites. These types, however, are based on a limited number of site attributes, such as the presence/absence of architecture or overall site size (Whittlesey and Reid 1982). In fact, one of the most interésting results of these previous studies has been the lack of clear correlations between ceramic assemblage variables and such basic settlement types as "habitation" or “limited activity.” These cases of incongruence among the archaeological expectations and the reality of the observations should have pointed out the need for a re-evaluation of methods. Specifically, analyses are needed that attempt to define site typologies on the basis of assemblage variables, and that then test these typologies against independent data. Such studies are notably rare. In any analytical program, the units of analysis should be appropriate to the problem under investigation. Ethnoarchaeological and ethnographic descriptions indicate that vessel morphology is a highly variable, yet universal indicator of ceramic vessel function. In other words, while the specific shapes and sizes of the vessels that are used for particular functions may vary between cultural groups, it can generally be inferred that vessel form is an important and useful means of identifying vessel function. The first research objective for understanding function, then, is to identify morphological classes of ceramics in the project study area. Using the ceramic classification developed in the first proposed step, the content of the project's ceramic assemblages will be characterized. The covariation of assemblage variables will be used to define assemblage groups that hypothetically reflect underlying and corresponding differences in the use of sites. Covariation in ceramic patterns with data on site features and lithic assemblages will then be tested. In order to investigate differences in site use, the independent analysis of ceramic assemblages has been incorporated into the research program proposed in this document. Two analytical steps are required in the implementation of such a program. These include the functional classification of recovered ceramics and, subsequently, the analysis of ceramic assemblage variability. Functional Classification of Ceramic Vessels Best done with whole or nearly whole vessels, the goal of this step is to define the analytical categories to be used in subsequent analyses. Existing collections of whole vessels may be integrated at this stage to 8-27

develop a classification that includes not only those vessel types that occur in the project area, but those outside it as well. Methods for identifying functional types of ceramic vessels can be divided into five approaches: 1) morphology; 2) use-wear; 3) residues; 4) composition; 5) context. Definition of vessel classes based on morphology offers greatest consistency as each vessel has an overall morphology; however, this should be augmented by data available from other modes of analysis. General form, surface treatment, and metric data on size and shape together offer a level of functional specificity that can be justified from the ethnographic descriptions of vessel use at a general level. Also, these attributes are suited to fragmented vessels. In addition, these variables will be used to distinguish general functional categories among sherd collections, especially where the frequency of rim sherds is high. +Paralleling current interest in the study of lithic use-wear, studies of wear marks on ceramics have been conducted to identify patterning that can be attributed to vessel use (e.g., Bray 1982; Fenner 1977; Griffiths 1978). Residue analysis, including the visual evaluation of sooting or fire-blackening as well as chemical and microscopic analyses of deposits, has been the method most commonly used for differentiating cooking vessels from other vessel types (Acklen 1982; Doyel 1980; Nelson 1980; Hally 1983a). Phosphate (Duma 1972) and other chemical analyses (Condamin et al. 1976) also have been used to identify the previous contents of vessels. Both use-wear and residue analyses have advantages over approaches that stress variables of construction because they monitor actual use rather than intended use (Hally 1983b). Wear marks and residues are heterogeneously distributed over a ceramic vessel and often are restricted to certain parts of vessels, such as the bottom. The absence of diagostic sherd wear or residues therefore can be interpreted in two ways: 1) either the vessel was not used for the function producing the distinctive type of alteration, or 2) the sherd was not originally from the part of the vessel where these alterations are visible. - Compositional anlayses traditionally have been used for the interpretation of patterns of trade and exchange, but they can also be used to investigate ceramic function (Bishop et al. 1982). Ethnographic descriptions of ceramic production indicate that patterns in the selection and manipulation of raw materials - especially those of clay and temper - are often correlated with the intended function of the finished vessel (Amold 1971; Balfet 1965; DeGarmo 1975; Ericson et al. 1972; Matson 1951; Plog 1980; Reina and Hill 1978; Rye 1976, 1978; Shepard 1956). Borrowing approaches from the field of material science, many recent archaeological analyses have attempted to identify vessel function through an understanding of the selection and manipulation of raw materials (Braun 1982, 1983; Bronitsky 1984; DeAtley 1973; Mills 1984; Plog 1980; Raab 1973; Steponaitis 1983; Stone 1984). These methods have been used to identify specific physical properties, such as thermal shock resistance, porosity, and durability. There are two major problems with using compositional approaches to identify ceramic vessel function. First, very different patterns of raw material use may be present from one region to another (and possibly on an intraregional level) which may represent solutions to the same problem. Second, because of the hierarchy of technological problems, there may not 8-28

be an equivalence of technological classes with functional classes. If the goal of the ceramic analysis is to look at patterning in the presence of different functional classes of vessels, it must be recognized that patterning in the selection and manipulation of raw materials may not reflect the same functional typologies identified through a reading of the ethnographic literature. The number of technological classes will usually be fewer than the number of functional classes, usually consisting of cookware vs. noncookware - too few classes for the meaningful study of ceramics at the level of the assemblage. The location or context of a ceramic vessel within a site also may offer potentially useful information on vessel function, but as ceramic vessels are less often found where used than where discarded, most inferences rooted in vessel deposition will be fortuitous rather than analytically rigorous, and they will depend upon unusual preservation conditions, such as the rapid burying of remains (cf. Braun 1981b). Returning to the first type of analysis used for the identification of ceramic function, the anlaysis of vessel form is one of the most commonly found in the archaeological literature. Despite long attention, formal-functional approaches have varied in their explicitness. Many studies have tended to assign functional identifications to formal classes based on an implicit, often analogical form of logic. This form of argument reasons that if a specific vessel form is used for a particular function in an ethnographically documented culture, then when that form occurs in an archaeological context, it may be inferred to have been used for the same function. This has been a common approach in the Southwest (e.g., Goodyear 1975) where there are cultural groups who have continuities with the archaeologically documented societies. The inferential basis for using formal-functional approaches has, however, become more explicit in recent years. Using Binford's (1965) distinction between primary and secondary functions, Ericson et al. (1972) noted several formal properties of ceramic vessels that may be related to the primary functions of pottery, viz., their use in the activities of preparing, cooking, storing, acquiring, and transporting various materials. More recent analyses include those that have used ethnographic data to develop expectations for formal-functional classes in subsequent archaeological analyses (Braun 1980; Hendrickson and McDonald 1983; Lischka 1978; Smith 1980, 1983, 1985). In these latter cases, cross-cultural regularities in the form of vessels used for specific functions, such as cooking, storage, or serving, have been sought and then applied to the analysis of archaeological collections. The goal of these analyses has been the identification of a particular morphological signature for each functional class that subsequently can be used to assign members to that class, The results of cross-cultural analyses of vessel form and function are interesting for several reasons. First, they have demonstrated that there are morphological regularities in the way that vessels are constructed for particular functions. They have shown the value of characterizing ceramic vessels in terms of their morphological properties for questions of a functional nature. Quantitative variables such as height, rim diameter, orifice diameter, volume, and ratios of these variables have been identified as useful measures for assigning ceramic vessels to functional classes (Henrickson and McDonald 1983; Smith 1980, 1983). By using ethnographic data to infer the presence of these general functional classes, these studies have 8-29

begun to make more secure arguments for the identification of ceramic vessel function within archaeological assemblages. Because of the relative strength of behavioral inferences from ceramic vessel form, the morphological approach has been chosen for the proposed research. Analysis of Assemblage Variability and Identification of Assemblage Classes This stage of analysis requires the use of the classes identified in the previous step. As rim sherds have the potential for more specific functional assignment, the analysis will proceed in two stages. The first stage will consist of the analysis of all sherds that are recovered using general form (e.g., bowl, jar, etc.) and surface treatment (e.g., slipped, unslipped) variables to distinguish categories. A variety of analytical techniques could be used at this stage, such as K-means cluster anlaysis of proportions of each category, in order to identify different assemblage types. The second stage of the assemblage analysis will involve comparison of the assemblage classes identified in the previous stage using rim sherds. Here, rim diameter, orifice diameter (if present), and angle of rim aversion will be employed to test whether vessel size and rim form differences are present between the different assemblage types. Alternatively, the rim sherd attributes may be included in the differentiation of assemblage types along with general form and surface treatment. The ultimate goal of these analyses is to identify significant differences among site ceramic assemblages that can be compared at a more synthetic level with other independent analyses of functional variability, such as those of lithic or site structures. Using ceramics in this way avoids a major problem present in most identifications of site function, that is, confirmation of predetermined site types. These ceramic assemblages can then be used on a diachronic basis to look at changes in the use of ceramics within the much larger context of subsistence technology. ea Soils Analysis We intend to characterize the types of material, both cultural and natural, that are present within and adjacent to all excavations. This analysis will allow the delineation, description, and differentiation of pre- occupational, in situ occupational, and post-occupational degradational material and/or natural sediments present within all excavations. Representative soil columns will be collected within and adjacent to excavations in non-site settings. Laboratory analyses will determine grain size distribution and mineral and elemental composition. Special attention will be given to any cultural features within the cultural sequences. Techniques to be employed in this analysis will include sieving and Coulter counting for the grain size distribution, and XRD, AA, and CCSEM for the mineral and elemental composition of the contents of cultural features, which will aid in their functional differentiation. All cultural and natural sediments within the sites will be characterized in terms of elemental, mineral, and grain size parameters. This will allow the differentiation of pre- and post-occupational material from in 8-30 |

situ occupational material (Donahue 1980, 1981, 1984, 1986). It should be possible to determine how the degradation of each specific site occurred, i.e., whether and to what extent each site was affected by cultural and natural processes such as sheet wash infill, destruction by fire, or other cultural and natural size altering mechanisms. Determination of the chemical composition of pit fills is essential in establishing the function and history of each type of pit encountered. Flake Stone and Ground Stone Artifact Analysis Various forms of analysis are discussed below for the flaked and ground stone artifacts that may be recovered from any archaeological investigations within the SSC project area. Collectively, these analyses are designed to address morphological (i.e., stylistic), technological, and functional variability, as well as the chronological trends that are expressed at each of the previously recorded sites and associated archaeological remains. Traditionally, comprehensive analysis of many lithic assemblages from the Texas sites have minimized the importance of flaked stone artifacts as documents of human behavior. However, it has been demonstrated recently that answers to many relevant questions about the character of prehistoric communities can be derived from the study of recovered lithic materials (see Irwin-Williams and Shelley 1980; Shelley 1983; Linford 1986). To this end, formal analysis of lithic (flaked stone and ground stone) artifacts will be undertaken to develop and test hypotheses about the behavioral systems of prehistoric communities within the study area. The specific areas of inquiry for this aspect of the overall study, and those capable of reflecting behavioral variability with respect to lithic artifactual remains, include: 1) decisions about the selection of local lithic raw material resources (e.g., Ogallala quartzite), or material (cherts) from extralocal sources; 2) procurement and transportation of unmodified or partially worked materials to the communities; 3) trade or exchange of extralocal raw materials and/or distant raw material resource areas; 4) distribution of raw materials within the sites; 5) stages of production, and techniques involved in tool manufacture; 6) activity area analysis and prepared tool use pattern; 7) maintenance and refurbishing of implements; and ultimately, 8) mechanisms of deposition through breakage, loss, and discard of implements. The most difficult goal of any analysis of lithic artifacts is the identification of possible social inferences from the data. Therefore, a major assumption of this proposed study is that all material culture reflects, to some extent, the past behavior of human populations (Schiffer 1976). It then follows that the lithic assemblages, when properly studied, should reflect patterns of behavior among the aboriginal creators and users of those assemblages, The proposed lithic analyses for this project include three interrelated levels of investigation to address morphological, technological, and functional variability, and trends within the recovered lithic artifact inventories. Each of these main analytic categories is designed to extract relevant data on patterns of raw 8-31

material procurement, manufacture, and use within the systematic contexts of culture(s) in the SSC project area. Vertebrate and Invertebrate Faunal Remains The recovery, identification, and analysis of vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains from the sites in the study area will follow standard procedures with the following exceptions (Dirkmaat 1982, in preparation a). Processing protocol, from the initial processing of remains in the field to the final analysis, is based on widely accepted methods (e.g., Chaplin 1971; Binford 1983; Klien and Cruz-Uribe 1984; Hesse and Wapnish 1985; Burch 1962, 1973; Pilsbury 1948) and is described below. “Preparation for the analysis of archaeologically derived vertebrate and invertebrate faunal material will first include a comprehensive review of archaeological and paleonotological site reports from late Quaternary/Holocene contexts in the project area. The range of vertebrate and invertebrate species commonly encountered in archaeological deposits, taxa unique to the area, and special research problems germane to the project area will be identified at this time. Descriptions of late Pleistocene and Holocene biotic communities (phytogeographic as well as zoogeographic distributions) in the area will also be prepared in order to provide an insight into the entire vertebrate assemblage available to the aboriginal inhabitants of the project area and to document changes in biotic distributions through time (see Dirkmaat 1989). Following the excavation and initial processing of vertebrate osteological and odontological remains and molluscan shell material, clean bone and molluscan shell specimens will be labeled according to site designation and accession number. The vertebrate faunal remains initially will be sorted into potentially identifiable and unidentifiable fragments. Potentially identifiable specimens will be described as completely as possible utilizing an analysis form in order to standardize observations. This analysis form will facilitate the recordation of the following information for every potentially identifiable bone fragment: 1) specific taxon represented; 2) bone; 3) bone portion; 4) side; 5) state of preservation; 6) age; 7) modifications present, and 8) number of spécimens, Separate analysis forms will detail bone modifications, pathologies, and metric data. > Taxon determinations will be made to the lowest taxonomic level possible, preferably to the level of species. Bone portion descriptions will be referenced according to the specimen’s exact anatomical position (e.g., proximal 1/2, anterior 2/3, etc.). Specific taxon and bone identifications will be facilitated by comparison to vertebrate osteological collections and by comparisons to descriptions and line drawings of individual skeletal and odontological elements presented in various osteological handbooks (e.g., Brainerd 1939; Glass 1951; Olsen 1967, 1968, 1973, 1979; Gilbert 1980; and Gilbert, Martin, and Savage 1981). Bone specimens that remain unidentified after these two identification phases will be compared to specimens ‘ curated at ARP. 8-32 Co

Eh Ss The study of the effects of preservation factors on the composition of the vertebrate assemblage will be aided by noting the general state of preservation of each bone specimen. Preservation assessments will include categories that range from “well-preserved” to "highly eroded.” The determination of age at death of individual bone specimens will be based on: 1) the state of epiphyseal union in post-cranial remains (employing categories that range from “unfused” to “fusing” to "fused'); and 2) dental development, including whether the dental fragments are deciduous or permanent teeth, the state of tooth root and crown enamel development, and the degree and pattern of occlusal enamel attrition (Silver 1969; Watson 1978; Wilson, Grigson, and Payne 1982). Data obtained concerning bone surface modifications will include the presence/absence of: 1) thermal alteration; 2) gnathic and gastric-induced modifications; 3) modifications incurred during the butchering process; and 4) pathologically-induced bone alterations. The coloration of bone specimens that have been thermally-altered will be noted, employing terms such as “bummed black” and “calcined white." These data will be utilized in conjunction with data on the state of preservation of the specimen in order to identify the processes by which the bone was thermally modified (e.g., by boiling or direct flame), as well as meat preparation methods. Bone surfaces will be carefully inspected for the presence of dentally-induced modifications including those produced by chewing of the specimen (usually by camivores), by gnawing (by rodents), and by swallowing of the entire fragment. This data will help identify bone reduction and fragmentation factors. A separate analysis form will be used to collect data on butchered and pathological specimens. Parameters used to identify and evaluate butchering evidence will follow procedures described in Guilday, Parmalee, and Tanner (1962); Lyman (1979); and Dirkmaat (in preparation c) and will include information concerning: 1) the implement used, based on the morphology of the cut or cutmarks; 2) exact anatomical position of butchering evidence; and 3) the exact orientation and direction of the cuts (in three planes). The representation of such evidence on schematic line drawings of skeletal elements will facilitate the analysis of the entire butchering process. Pathologically modified specimens will be described according to the exact anatomical location of the pathology and by the morphology of these afflicted areas. These detailed morphological descriptions in conjunction with photographic references available in the literature (Tyson and Dyer Alcauskas 1980; Ortner and Putschar 1981) will be utilized in an attempt to identify the etiology of all pathological conditions noted. Measurements obtained from the skeletal and odontological material will be included in a separate data analysis form and will used to identify sexual dimorphism in the sample. Metric parameters will follow definitions presented in von den Dreisch (1976). Unidentifiable bone specimens will be stored into class level taxonomic groupings and assigned to a size-related subset within this category (e.g., "Small Mammal, species?"). Evidence of modifications will be noted and the number of specimens in each category tabulated. 8-33

The molluscan shell material will be identified to the species level, wherever preservation permits. Small pulmonate specimens (in the approximate range of 0.5-2.0 mm) will be analyzed as work orders require. Standard identification keys and monographs will be utilized for the freshwater mussels (Burch 1973), the terrestrial pulmonates (Burch 1962; Ortmann 1919; MacMillan 1949; Pilsbry 1940, 1946, 1948) and any recovered marine species. All of the data documented on the various data analysis forms will then be entered and stored in a computer database within which further manipulation of the data, such as collation into stratigraphic/analysis units, will be accomplished. ~The first step in the analysis of the vertebrate faunal remains from the project area will be the quantification of these remains. The present research will rely predominantly on the presentation of the "Number of Identified Specimens” (NISP) although other methods (Casteel 1978; Lyman 1979; Binford 1981a) will be considered in the interpretation of the results. “The comparison of faunal element distributions by analytical unit will identify such factors as community and environmental changes through time, intrasite differences, and intrasite differences between house structures (e.g., as they may possibly relate to socioeconomic and status differences), and desired areas. Other factors to be considered in the analysis will include taphonomy (Gifford 1981; Lyman 1982), and paleonutrition (Wing and Brown 1979). Terrestrial gastropods have proven to be very useful for the recognition of microhabitats associated with archaeological sites, and thus will serve as one focus of invertebrate research. Human Remains Analysis The discovery, treatment, and analysis of human remains will be handled with utmost respect to the deceased and any potential descendants. All attempts will be made to discover lineal descendants and solicit their approval/disapproval of treatment options. The level of information potentially available in recovered human osteologic remains is directly proportional to the sophistication of the analytical techniques employed. During the past 25 years, archaeological reports containing descriptions of skeletal populations or individuals have moved from compilations of age, sex, stature, and race (skeletal inventories) to more elaborate attempts at reconstructing demographic pattems. These early studies relied on standards set by Krogman (1962). Presently, we can divide the types of information obtainable from skeletal remains into two major categories: 1) parameters of the individual, and 2) population decriptors. Often, the former, as distributions, are used in estimating the latter. From either complete of fragmentary remains, estimates can be made as to the age, sex, and stature of. an individual, The more material, the better the estimate. Recently, Holland (1986) has demonstrated that, based on remains of the cranial base alone, a correct sex estimate can be obtained with 71-90% accuracy. By examination of the gross morphology of the bones many pathological conditions can be detected, such as 8-34 Sa eisai)

spinal tuberculosis or Pott's Deformity (Krill and Siegel 1978). Specialized activities such as running, digging, or spear throwing can be inferred from muscle markings on bones (Dutour 1986). Similarly, in addition to general morphological description, dental pathology (e.g., Clark et al. 1986) and dental wear can be assessed for the individual. With regard to the population, particularly when large numbers of individuals are involved, many estimates are possible. In the most recent of such studies, Morris (1986) reports data from Arizona which is limited mostly to category one while making an attempt at demographics. More sophisticated studies, though, attempt to correlate individual physical data with cultural inferences. For instance, distributions of age are used to produce estimates of "mean-age-at-death” and fertility levels Johannsson and Horowitz 1986), and sometimes can be related to changing subsistence patterns (e.g., introduction of agriculture at Dixon Mounds; Goodman and Armelagos 1985). From discrete skeletal traits and particularly dental characteristics (e.g., shoveled incisors and cusp pattern), the relatedness of populations or subsets of populations may also be assessed (Sofaer et al. 1986). Metric characteristics of teeth and bones, where bilateral structures are present, are used to determine the overall exposure of a population to stress for various time periods during its life cycle (Benyon and Siegel 1981; Brandt and Siegel 1978; Doyle and Johnston 1977; Doyle et al. 1977; Gest et al. 1983, 1986; Mooney and Siegel n.d., Mooney et al. 1985; Sciulli et al. 1979; Siegel and Doyle 1975a, 1975b, 1975c; Siegel et al. 1977a, 1977b; Siegel and Mooney 1986; Siegel and Smookler 1973; Smookler et al. 1973). Finally, information about diet is obtainable from dental wear patterns and analysis of bone composition with new techniques recently developed in both areas. Irish and Turner (1987) have defined wear of the surface of the front teeth .SAMAT) which can be related to processing of abrasive carbohydrates. Klepinger et al. (1986) have improved the reliability of elemental anlaysis relating bone chemistry to diet, and Price et al. (1986) have found differences in bone strontium between virgin and pregnant rats, which has direct application to demographic studies. Floral Analysis Analysis of any floral remains that may be recovered in the course of fieldwork is expected to provide ancilliary evidence for localized microenvironmental changes and adaptations - specifically, the changes and similarities in the human exploitation of food plants, as well as plants utilized for medicine or the aboriginal production of perishables. Macrobotanical and microbotanical studies are proposed as are pollen studies. The results of all three analytical approaches will be integrated to develop a comprehensive picture of aboriginal man’s exploitation of his floristic environment. Macrobotanical remains will augment paleoecological and paleoenvironmental studies by contributing data derived from the study of nuts, seeds, wood, charcoal, and other plant parts. Macrobotanical data, when interpreted in conjunction with microbotanical (pollen) information, will provide insight into the resource potential of prehistoric plant communities, as well as into prehistoric man's interactions with the overall character of his environment, 8-35

Splits from soil columns taken during excavations, will be processed using hydrogen peroxide (H202) flotation and graded sieves to recover extant macrofloral remains. Pit and other feature fill also will be processed to recover macrobotanical and microbotanical remains. Recovered floral materials will be identified by comparison with type collections. The number and condition of all individual remains will be recorded; the specimens will be identified by element (i.e., seed, nut, nut husk, etc.) weighed, and whereever possible, listed by individual taxa. The floral data will then be computerized for intersite and intrasite comparisons. Analysis of pollen samples obtained from splits of the constant colume samples (CVS) taken throughout the course of this fieldwork will afford the opportunity of studying localized palecenvironments throughout the later Archaic occupations of the study area. Multiple pollen slides will be analyzed as a single slide is statistically insignificant and insufficient to permit meaningful attempts at paléoenvironmental interpretations. * Standard pollen preparation techniques and methods of analysis will be performed, and identification again will be completed using type collections available to the Archaeology Research Program. Additionally, a fraction of the splits examined for macrofloral remains also will be processed for spores, pollen, and phytolith remains. In this way, whatever floral remains exist can be recovered, assessed, and the information included in the overall data synthesis for the project. It is expected that the analysis of macrofloral and microfloral data from collected fill samples, feature and pit fill, and soil columns will contribute substantially to localized paleoenvironmental reconstruction in the project area and to a fuller understanding of human ecology in the environmental setting of the project area. The proposed botanical analyses also may reveal patterns in human exploitation of floral resources throughout the prehistoriy of the project area. Moreover, as emphasized elsewhere in this proposal, these analyses should provide data for comparison to the botanical assemblages from areas adjacent to the SSC project area. At the very least, botanical data may reflect chronologically different aboriginal plant procurement and use strategies practiced in the study area. Pollen analysis - specifically conducted with the goal of demonstrating a pollen sequence - should result in a significant increase to the archaeological and ecological database upon which conclusions about SSC project area culture history ultimately must be established. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER WORK The work conducted to date has consisted of pedestrian reconnaissance, limited test excavations, archival research, and informant interviews. No artifacts have been collected. Therefore, it is imperative that statistically interpretable assemblages be obtained from those high and medium priority sites which potentially contain information relevant to the Research Questions. These assemblages and the results of 8-36 G3 a i = eS | = QB

— 1 . ES i testing, archival research, and surface collections will allow refinement of the recommendations as to which cultural resources are actually eligible for the National Register. The work proposed for sites listed below includes further evaluations and in specific cases systematic surface collections and text excavations to refine the cultural-historical contexts at each site. Since many sites appear to consist of shallow deposits, horizontal separation of components may be possible through surface collections, which are a cost effective means of identifying the structure and integrity of plowed sites. In areas which seem to offer the potential for buried sites or where buried sites are actually known to occur, selective use of backhoe and trackhoe trenches or deep hand excavated 2 m x 2 m units should be initiated to identify, define, and delimit these occupations. Fundamental to any understanding of the distribution of archaeological and historic sites anywhere is the realization that human beings and, per force (by necessity), the loci of their activities are not randomly distributed ‘across the surface of the earth. Rather, the distribution of human beings and "their sites" is non- random in response to certain basic verities about human biological and cultural requirements and the satisfaction of those requirements at any time in any space. There is nothing profound or new about this observation but the design and execution of any archaeological investigation must operationally take this non-random distribution of human activities into account in every phase from reconnaissance survey, to testing and data recovery. No one factor or condition accounts for the non-random distribution of archaeological sites. Rather, it is the complex interaction of a whole series of parameters which must be, often tediously, extracted from the archaeological, geological, and environmental record of a given study area or portions thereof. Certain factors are, of course operative virtually anywhere humans have lived or still live. The presence of potable water, relatively level ground (slopes usually less than 15°), access to food resources, potential for shelter in inclement weather, available technological resources and raw materials are but a handful of the more basic conditions which influence site location in time and space. Of course, dozens of other environmental and cultural factors can be added including, where appropriate: access to arable land, defensibility, access to major and minor "avenues" of human movement, religious and ritual considerations, etc. The delineation of settlement pattems in any part of the SSC Project is therefore a process of determining which factors are operative in particular environments via the systematic scrutiny of representative samples of these environments. Prehistoric Data Collection Strategies The following discussion will present several methods of field investigation that may be appropriate for the SSC archaeological sites. These methods will be prudently employed in consultation with the appropriate review and administrative agencies, on a site-by-site basis. If the local geology and geomorphology permit, the characterization of subsurface cultural phenomena will also be augmented by the use of portable resistivity meters with on-board data loggers. In such cases, a 8-37

grid of 1 m2 units will be superimposed on a suitable site and readings will be taken at 1 m intervals. Currently available 3rd generation Geonics devices can “read” at 50 cm intervals down to a maximum depth of 5 m with very high resolution. Both Dr. Brooks Elwood and Dr. James Adovasio have had considerable success with this technique in a wide variety of contexts and the use of resistivity meters has allowed the accurate delineation of such diverse phenomena as structures, hearths, storage pits, refuse pits, burials, activity areas and even small artifact concentrations. In high probability areas where deeply buried sites are suspected, backhoe trenches or deep piston cores will be employed to detect and delineate subsurface sites at greater depths. The spacing of trenches and/or piston-core probes will be determined as local circumstances dictate. ~Herein it should be forcefully stressed that in any low visibility area with high site potential, it is absolutely critical that subsurface probe intervals be as tightly spaced as possible. As Drennan (1988), Shott (1989), and Kintigh (1988) indicate, vastly differential recovery of sites occurs when probe intervals are substantially expanded. This in turn results in a highly skewed site sample which essentially “loses” small loci of “all functional" types. The so-called Drennan Interval Model has been field tested in thousands of miles of upland surveys and the results are indisputable. If the excavation is a testing operation, a fixed number of randomly selected 1 m2 (10.8 ft2) units will be emplaced in order to characterize the site. In data recovery or full scale excavations, local circumstances will determine whether random squares, continuous trenches or a judicious combination of both are appropriate excavation strategies. In either case, excavation of all sites will proceed by natural stratigraphic or micro-stratigraphic levels. Arbitrary 10 cm (3.9 in) levels will be employed within the excavation of natural strata greater than 10 cm (3.9 in) in thickness. Micro-stratigraphic profiles of at least one wall of each excavation unit or trench will be generated by hand or via a Leitz Set-2 Total Electronic Station. All excavation of culture bearing strata will be by hand. The fill from all culture bearing strata will be dry-screened through 3.2 mm (1/8 in) hardware cloth or, where this is not feasible due to soil properties, through 6.4 mm (1/4 in) hardware cloth. Additionally, in order to recover items smaller than these sizes, constant volume samples (CVS) measuring 3000 cm3 (183 in3) will be collected from every natural and arbitrary level identified on any site. These samples will be processed through graded sieves using an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide (HO) to facilitate recovery of small items. The use of hydrogen peroxide instead of water will minimize damage to charred organics, especially those which may be preserved in open site contexts, and will ensure representative recovery of thermally altered plant materials, etc. The use of hydrogen peroxide as a flotation medium precludes the necessity of agitation and hence damage to any organics as the solution functions as a high-level deflocculant. Artifacts and features identified on any structure or “living floor"/surface will be mapped in situ using the Leitz Set-2 Electronic Total Station and all features will be mapped and photographed in planview and profile. Geological, palynological sediment samples will be taken from each site. A minimum of two 8-38 = __} ( —) rR =] ——

continuous sediment columns should be collected from each site while discontinuous sediment/fill samples will be extracted from all structures and features, Table 8-3 lists all prehistoric sites (N=13) and the two multicomponent prehistoric/historic sites (41EL58, 41EL119). The possible levels of field investigation that could be performed in order to evaluate their National Register eligibility and potential to address the prehistoric Research Design include: (1) detailed point plot mapping and surface collections; (2) systematic testing (see above for potential grid intervals and levels of sampling); (3) deep testing using augering and mechanized equipment such as backhoes and trackhoes; and (4) potential eligibility for intensive data recovery using block or trench excavations.

random sampling and systematic surface collections will be performed on a case-by-case basis. Detailed mapping will include point plotting (see above) of raw materials and culturally modified materials which, based on field observations, do reveal chipping clusters at sites such as 41EL1 16 and 41EL119. In all, surface collections are recommended at 13 properties (41EL58, 41EL96, 41EL97, 41EL98, 41EL99, 41EL106, 41EL108, 41EL113, 41EL114, 41EL116, 41EL118, 41EL119, 41EL127). Two sites, 41EL86, an isolated find and site 41EL110, a possibly deeply (1.5 m) buried site, do not merit controlled surface collections. Also, an additional three sites 41EL108, 41EL113, 41EL118 appear to have low potential for controlled surface collections. -The level of work effort could range from less than one crew day to several crew days at each site, depending on size and depositional complexity. Systematic testing will be phased according to two field approaches and is recommended for the same 13 properties. First, following the surface mapping, 1 x 1 m units will be placed in the centers of high intensity use areas defined for each site. Crew work effort could range from a single day or several days for each site. Second, depending upon the results of the preliminary sounding, smaller (50 x 50 cm shovel tests or auger probes) will be used according to the sampling strategies outlined above. Several days could be expended at each site, so the work effort proposed in this phase will be closely coordinated with EG&G, SSCL, TNRLC, and the SHPO. Deep, or mechanized testing is recommended only at those sites which may have components buried by colluvial or alluvial sedimentation. At present only a single site, 41EL110, is known to have deposits deeper than 30 cm, in this case, 1.5 m below surface. However, land leveling and reclamation activities in this area may have produced the deeply buried prehistoric flake that was noted in a gully-wall profile within this site. The remaining sites for which deep trenching is potentially necessary are 41EL58, 41EL97, 41EL99, 41EL110, 41EL114, and 41EL127. Additionally, other as yet undefined areas may be amenable to such testing. = Intensive data recovery may not be a feasible option, but will be based on the results of the previous three methods of investigation. Also, intensive data recovery will require consultation with the SHPO and an explicit research design outlining the expected data, the potential to address significant research questions and how the data will be recovered. At present intensive data recovery may be an option at only two sites, 41EL98 and 41EL119. Others are undetermined (41EL97, 41EL99, 41EL114, 41EL116, and 41EL127) in terms of potential intensive data recovery. Historic Data Collection Strategies Test excavations at some sites will follow the special methods developed for rural farmstead sites by ARP staff (Moir and Jumey 1987). These methods have been used on historic house and light industrial sites dating from the 1680s up to the 1920s and have proved to be very useful for studying household assemblages, use of space, and socio-economic material correlates (Moir and Jumey 1987, Jumey and Moir 1987). For the SSC project, a strong emphasis will be placed on middle and late nineteenth century 8-40 on an on f en) eS ee HF ma ce)

J ( properties while remaining sensitive to the importance and eligibility of more recent properties. Post 1880 properties will be addressed in coordination with the various review agencies and several historic context needs, Proper recognition of all four National Register criteria concerning Significance and adherence to criteria considering minimum age will require reviewing the eligibility of all properties slated for testing and dating prior to World War II. For most sites, the number of test pits excavated will range between 12 and 25 depending upon their areal extent, complexity, site history, and depth. The placement of test pits will provide a general sample of the numbers and types of artifacts, kinds of cultural strata or features, and integrity of subsurface deposits present at each site. Surface collections will be recovered from sites where this method will provide an efficient sampling approach. Test excavations and surface collecting will be directed toward identifying the occupational periods present, range of activities and site functions, historical and scientific importance, and National Register eligibility of the property. Test pits will be dug by natural or cultural stratigraphic units unless artifacts indicate mixed deposits or lack of component separation. A grid system will be established for those sites which contain potentially significant archaeological deposits or features. Systematic placement of test pits will be preferred unless site size, surface features, or age dictate a more efficient approach. Fieldwork will identify the limits of the site, presence and general frequency of cultural features, and major intrasite components and integrity. Generally, the fieldwork entails three to five crew days depending on the total area of the site. Sites with complicated occupational histories and with numerous buildings may require substantially more time. Other small scatters with few visible features may take less than one day, especially if they yield negative information regarding eligibility. One aspect of SMU's historical archaeological research has been the development of sensitive artifactual indicators of time that help to qualify actual construction/occupation dates for historical properties. Dendrochronology can provide absolute dates for initial construction and remodeling of houses and buildings, as well as the potential dating of artifacts such as gates or portable items made of wood. Tree rings also help provide an indication of how long a floodplain has been at its present level or how fast it may be aggrading by sampling the extant vegetation. Also, culturally induced vegetation (oak, cedar, pecan) and trees can be dated, thereby enlarging the data base for site occupation and use. Table 8-4 lists the recommended data recovery options for the historic archaeological sites recorded in the SSC project area. All properties will receive further historic, archival, and informant studies, to determine if previous occupants, occupation periods, socioeconomic, and ethnic affiliation and significant events can be determined. The level of archaeological effort expended under each option will vary according to the complexity of the site and consultations with appropriate review agencies. For instance, mapping and surface collection could be performed in .25 to 2.0 crew days per site, depending on scientific and historic importance, as well as the size and number of surface features. At present, detailed mapping and surface collections are recommended for 36 properties listed in Table 8-4. No further documentation is recommended for 28 properties. Of the 32 recommended properties, only 8 8-41

i (41EL58, 41EL59, 41EL75, 41EL93, 41EL100, 41EL104, 41EL119, 41EL134) are judged high priority and are potentially eligible for intensive data recovery as well. An additional 22 (ranked as medium priority) of the 36 properties may require further studies to evaluate their National Register eligibility. A final six properties are listed as low priority, but low-level documentation may be necessary. Systematic testing to determine National Register eligibility is potentially necessary at 27 properties. Again, only 8 are listed as high priority, and 19 are currently medium priority. One site (41EL132) has not received sufficient examination (it was recorded from windshield survey) to determine if testing is required. Deep testing, to examine known features or buried deposits is not required of most historic sites since they are situated in shallow upland soils in non-agrading settings. The only deep testing (mechanical) will be to determine if intact deposits and structural remains are buried under the gravel stockpile at the Buena Vista Methodist Church and Tabernacle (41EL100). Also, the Boz cotton gin, (41EL134) located in the floodplain of Cottonwood Branch, has been landscaped over the 100 years of its existence, and may contain buried deposits or structural remains dating to earlier episodes in its history. Potential intensive data recovery, as mentioned above is thought to be necessary on only eight high priority sites. These are the Ellis County Farm (41EL58); the Boz Cotton Gin (41EL134), the Buena Vista Methodist Church and Tabernacle (41EL 100); and farmstead sites 41EL59, 41EL75, 41EL93, 41EL104, and 41EL119. This level of work, of course, is dependent upon the results of the mapping and surface collection, systematic testing, and deep testing phases of mitigative options and consultation with the SHPO. All historic improvements (fences, wells, cisterns, structures, stock tanks, etc.) will be eliminated from the landscape prior to the construction of the SSC. Historic wells and cisterns (some partially filled with rubbish, others still in use) will be filled. This provides a unique opportunity to document and investigate the technologies and strategies involved with water use in the project area. For instance, in the chalk rock, large chambers appear to have been dug for seep wells; while in the Taylor Marl, brick lined wells and cisterns were the only feasible means of obtaining water. All sites with wells should receive basic documentation (size, depth, water draw) prior to their destruction. Other levels of documentation that could be performed on sites include the collection of dendrochronological samples from standing or ruined buildings and archaeological contexts. Dendrochronological samples have been obtained from buildings adjacent to the SSC project area and demonstrate that absolute dating of the construction of buildings is possible. Such samples can also provide proxy climatic information in wet and dry periods, frost rings (false spring events), and the rate of forest migration onto the Blackland Prairies. CONCLUSIONS 8-42

As noted above, work conducted to date in the SSC project area has consisted of limited pedestrian reconnaissance and test excavations, archival research, and informant interviews. No artifacts have as yet been collected, mapped, excavated, and analyzed. To address effectively both the Primary and Secondary Research Questions as well as the overreaching issue of "marginality”, it is imperative that five courses of action be initiated. The first three steps can be conducted concurrently while the last two must in part be initiated at a later date. 1. The pedestrian survey of the remainder of the ring should be initiated and completed as soon as is feasible, 2. The surface mapping and systematic collection of medium and high priority sites should be effected and the results scrutinized to generate a finalized list of medium and high priority localities suitable for phase II testing. 3. Deep testing should be initiated in appropriate geomorphic settings. 4, Systematic randomized test excavation of selected medium and high priority sites should then be pursued via rigorous data recovery procedures. 5. Systematic comparative scrutiny and analysis of excavated materials from test excavations will be effected in order to address all of the Research Questions noted above as well as to determine which, if any sites, are amenable to or suitable for extensive data recovery. 8-43

| APPENDIX A GEOTECHNICAL REPORTS by Gathel M. Weston, Bill R. Chada, and David H. Jurney From November 1989 to July 1990, personnel of the Archaeology Research Program (ARP), Southern Methodist University (SMU), conducted intensive reconnaissances to identify and inventory cultural resources within impact areas of geological bore holes, trench sites, survey monuments and vehicular traffic routes. All work was completed under contract ESC-98201 with Universities Research Association, Inc. (URA) pursuant to contact with the Department of Energy. The scope of work and methods employed follow stipulations agreed upon during consultations between Diana Lowrey of EG&G Idaho Inc. (EG&G), and William Martin, archaeologist for the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the Texas State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). The geotechnical reconnaissances were undertaken to identify all cultural resources, and to design means of avoiding-all archaeological sites or deposits. The survey was conducted in advance of ground disturbance to insure that traffic or excavations could not damage any identified resources which exhibit potential eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Protection of those sites is required by a number of federal laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Antiquities Act of 1906 (34USC225); Historic Sites, Buildings, and Antiquities Act of 1935 (49USC666); Archaeological and Historical Conservation Act of 1974 (88USC174); National Historical Preservation Acts of 1966 and 1980 (80USC915 and 94USC2987); National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (83USC852); Executive Order Number 11593 of 1971 (36CFR9821); and Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, 1980, and 1988 (94USC2987, 102USC2778, and 102USC2983). All of these regulations direct federal land managers to implement cultural resources inventory and assessment programs with the consultation of the SHPO, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and interested parties. Appropriate treatment or protection programs are to be initiated when the integrity of such resources is threatened by ground disturbing projects, such as the geotechnical exploration program of the SSC project. In addition, the reconnaissance survey was designed to comply with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (Federal Register 1983). The Council of Texas Archaeologists Guidelines (CTA 1987) and the regulations of the Texas Antiquities Code (13 TAC 41) were addressed as well. The survey was to identify all visible cultural resources in the project area and to investigate the potential for buried cultural resources. Identified cultural resources were to be described as to setting, nature, and extent and condition of preservation. As far as possible (given limited land access and a no collection policy) the identified cultural resources would be evaluatedn for their potential eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Archaeological Landmark (SHL). If potentially significant resources or resources for which significance could not be determined at this Stage were located, recommendations were made for various cultural resource management options, including preservation, avoidance, testing, surface collection, and further data recovery. The specific guidelines for the survey methodology were also developed in consultation with members of the Texas State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) in Austin, Texas. The guidelines include: (1) in disturbed soils, pedestrian intervals of 20 meters were necessary to examine all access, egress, and turnaround routes; (2) in undisturbed soils, visual transects (20 m) would still be employed, augmented with shovel and trowel testing of at least one cubic foot of soil; (3) no screening was required, but soil profiles were to be closely examined and the soil sifted by hand during and after excavating; (4) if cultural resources were encountered, all ground disturbing activities would immediately halt, and an alternate route investigated and clearly flagged; (5) the SHPO would be notified and the site marked for possible further investigation. All of the above mentioned guidelines were met or exceeded during the Geotechnical Survey. In addition, drill locations were revisited to monitor damage, investigate altemate routes, additional borings, or document the lack of any disturbance. In concert with the ongoing survey of fee-simple areas, State of Texas archaeological site records were examined at the Texas Archaeology Research Lab (TARL), and deed/title and other archival and informant information were collected to use in evaluation of site specific A-l

geotechnical locations. Several historic structures which were adjacent to project boundaries were identified and were formally recorded when these fell in fee-simple purchase areas. All geotechnical areas were located in Ellis County, Texas. Field survey was coordinated with Mike H. Smith, Texas National Research Laboratory Commission (TNRLC); Joe Barrantine, Earth Technologies (ET and TNRLC); Morris Balderman, Earth Technologies; and Diana Lowrey, EG&G Idaho. ARP personnel included David Jurney, the overall project supervisor, and Fergus Flaherty, John Mark Sheppard, Gathel Mark Weston,and Bill R. Chada as field directors at various times. Crew members included Kent Smolik, Robert Merrill, Amy Campbell, Mary Stewart, Curtis McKinney, Eugene Longcrier, Ruth Brockway, and Felicia Tidwell. The geotechnical locations are illustrated in a series of figures which follow (Figures A-1 to A-8). They begin at the southernmost boundary of the West Campus, and proceed in numerical sequence clockwise around the ring. The scale of the figures corresponds to the 7.5 minute quadrangle (1 to 24,000 or 1 inch=600m). BIR 11 This Hall Boring (i.2., tunnel) is located at N239,029 E2,175,454 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle (Figure A-1) at 673 feet above mean sea level (ft amsl). It is 40 m west of Bethel Road and 540 m south of the Old Maypearl Road. The environmental setting is a broad upland, which was a prairie in its native state with medium to tall grasses. The nearest water source is about 180 m to the east, and this consists of an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of Chambers Creek. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slope (Brooks et al. 1961). The area is currently used as pasture, but has been intensively cultivated in the past 150 years. Agricultural terraces were present, bedrock gravels were scattered on the ground surface, and ground exposure was 70-80% in winter. This site is located on the Thomas Shockley Survey (A-1021), which is owned by J. B. and Wilma Underwood. It was purchased in 1967 from W. A. and Lena Mae Bearden (Ellis County Deed Book 520:304). This geotechnical location is situated (along with BIR13, 14) in the George W. Whitefield Survey (S- 1370, A-1131) which was a land script certificate granted to Whitefield from Ellis County compensating him for services. This tract was surveyed in 1869. The site was initially cleared by EG&G, and then recleared by EG&G, along with David Jumey (November 13 & 14, 1989). Fergus Flaherty then resurveyed this site on February 22, 1990. A 3000 m2 area was covered around the drill hole. A corridor 8 m wide and 120 m long (960 m2) was cleared along the fence (Lowrey 1989:10). The boring is in the same upland field as site BIR21, and the soil depth is less than 10 cm. No artifacts were observed around BIR11. BIR 12 This Hall Boring (Figure A-1) is located at N238,991 E2,175,556 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 671 ft amsl. It is located along the Bethel Road right of way, 550 m south of the Old Maypearl Road. The environmental setting is a broad upland, which was a prairie in its native state with medium to tall grasses. The nearest water source is about 220 m to the east, an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of Chambers Creek. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slope (Brooks et al. 1964). The area is currently used as pasture, but has been intensively cultivated in the past 150 years. Agricultural terraces were present and ground exposure was 70-80% in winter.

This geotechnical location is situated (along with BE10.5 in road, BE10.7, BIR21, 22, 23) in the William S. Estes Survey (3-3644, A-337), a Mercer's Colony grant to his heirs, which was sold unlocated to Blumford Shankle in 1855. This tract was surveyed for Shankle in 1857. Since Shankle received other grants in the SSC project area, it is likely that he was a land speculator and did not reside on this grant. This was also part of the B. F. Forester Estate, which was divided among Dollie Underwood, W. T. Bearden and Ella Hollabough in 1936. David Jumey surveyed a 3000 m2 area around the drill hole on November 13, 1989. The soil in the area consisted of exposed fragments of chalk rock. This is a weathered bedrock on a regolithic soil. No artifacts were observed on the site boring location. A barn once was present at this location, but has been bulldozed away. No structural debris remains, but evidence of bulldozing activity was clear, over 50% of the surveyed area. BIR 13 This Hall Borin, (Figure A-1) is located at N238,844 E2,175,494 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 675 ft amsl. The boring is 20 m west of Bethel Road and 480 m south of the Old Maypearl Road. The environmental setting is a broad upland, which was a prairie in its native state with medium fo tall grasses. The nearest water source to this boring is 250 m to the east, which is an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of Chambers Creek. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slope (Brooks et al. 1964). The area is currently used as pasture, but has been intensively cultivated in the past 150 years. Agricultural terraces were present, bedrock fragments were common, and ground exposure was 70-80% in winter. This site is located on the Thomas Shockley Survey (A-1021), which is owned by J.B. and Wilma Underwood. It was purchased in 1967 from W.A. and Lena Mae Bearden (Ellis County Deed Book 520:304). This geotechnical location is situated (along with BIR11, 14) in the George W. Whitefield Survey (S- 1370, A-1131) which was a land script certificate granted to Whitefield from Ellis County compensating him for services. This tract was surveyed in 1869. Fergus Flaherty surveyed a 3000 m2 area around the drill hole on February 22-23, 1990. BIR13 is approximately 45 m north of BIR12. The access route is a 6 to 8 m wide path cleared along the fence bearing at 140 degrees from a gap located about 30 m south of a curve in a paved road. An area of about 1000 m2 was investigated along this route. An area of 3000 m2 was surveyed around the boring. Photographs of BIR 13 were taken prior to and after the drilling. A house site is located east of this curve, consisting of a brick chimney base, a collapsed windmill (or possibly a metal frame constructed over a brick-lined well), and a collapsed cellar covered with sheet metal. All brick appears to be machine-made. A possible well and a small brick scatter was observed just east of the cleared access route, but will not be impacted by the access route. This was an approximately 2000 m2, area, noted for further recordation. Some modern bottles were also observed along the access route, which has exposed chalk bedrock in several areas comprising 20% of the access. The ground visibility is good though there is some medium grass growth in areas. The landowner, J. B. Underwood, reported that a tornado destroyed this house in 1950 (Lowrey 1989:10). This site was verbally reported to the SHPO, but was not impacted by drilling activities. On April 20, 1990, borings BIR13, BIR14, SIR3, SE10.9, and B1540 were revisited, and all of these borings were photographed and resurveyed to check for any artifacts which may have been revealed by drilling activity.

This Hall Boring (Figure A-1) is located at N239,199 E2,175,518 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 670 ft amsl. It is about 30 m east of Bethel Road and 480 m south of the Old Maypearl Road. The soil is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with a 1-3% slope. The nearest water source is 200 m to the east, which is an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of Chambers Creek. This was a freshly plowed field with 100% exposure. This geotechnical location is situated (along with BIR 11, 13) in the George W. Whitefield Survey (S- 1370, A-1131) which was a land script certificate granted to Whitefield from Ellis County compensating him for services. This tract was surveyed in 1869. Fergus Flaherty surveyed a 3000 m2 area around the drill hole on February 22 and 23, 1990. This boring along with BIR13, SIR3, and B1540 showed very little impact from drilling activity when resurveyed by Flaherty on April 20, 1990. Photographs were taken of the site, prior to and after the drilling. No artifacts were observed in the area, following the drilling and traffic which had chumed the shallow soil. BIR 21 This Hall Boring (Figure A-1) is located at N238,620 E2,175,708 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 672 ft amsl. This boring is located 30 m west of Bethel Road and 650 m south of the Old Maypearl Road, in the same field as BIR11. The environmental setting is a broad upland, which was a prairie in its native state with medium to tall grasses. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1- 3% slope (Brooks et al. 1964). The nearest water source, an intermittent drainage to an unnamed branch of Chambers Creek, is 200 m to the east. The area is currently used as pasture, but has been intensively cultivated in the past 150 years. Agricultural terraces were present, bedrock fragments were present, and ground exposure was 70-80% in winter. This site is located on the Thomas Shockley Survey (A-1021), which is owned by J.B. and Wilma Underwood. It was purchased in 1967 from W.A. and Lena Mae Bearden (Ellis County Deed Book 520:304). This geotechnical location is situated (along with BE10.5 in road, BE10.7, BIR12, 22, 23) in the William S. Estes Survey (3-3644, A-337), a Mercer's Colony grant to his heirs, which was sold unlocated to Blumford Shankle in 1855. This tract was surveyed for Shankle in 1857. Since Shankle received other grants in the SSC project area, it is likely that he was a land speculator and did not reside on this grant. This was also part of the B. F. Forester Estate, which was divided among Dollie Underwood, W. T. Bearden and Ella Hollabough in 1936. David Jurney surveyed this boring on November 14, 1989. The boring is adjacent to a house with two stories. The access route crosses 1000 m2 of the front yard, which has been previously disturbed. Tractor traffic and cattle have severely impacted this area. The "grist stone" described by Peter Maxxon was actually a concrete form for a pole barn support. Peter Maxxon viewed the structure, made from recycled rough wood, from the road. The house is sided with asbestos shingles and Palmer pressed brick are present. The structure was a two-story front with three rooms, all with internal electricity. The piers are red cedar, and there is a brick walk to the drive, which showed previous heavy cattle traffic. There were no structural repairs. There is a collapsed building in the rear. The house was given the site number 41EL82 (see site description of 41EL82 for more information on the house and surrounding yard). Turning northwest there is a cistern constructed of chalk and brick. The actual boring BIR21 is marked in a field north of the house. The field has medium grass cover (60% in winter) and has eroded 20 to 30 cm below the original ground surface. No artifacts were observed on the surface, Fergus Flaherty revisited the site on February 23, 1990. The boring area had already been drilled and no artifacts were observed. Vehicular traffic had not altered the landscape. ~ BIR 22 oy — eas 3

This Hall Boring (Figure A-1) is located at N238,495 E2,175,935 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 660 ft amsl. The drill site is located about 40 m east of Bethel Road and 720 m south of the Old Maypearl Road. The environmental setting is a broad upland, which was a prairie in its native state with medium to tall grasses. The nearest water source is 120 m to the northeast, an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of Chambers Creek. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slope (Brooks et al. 1964). The area is currently used as pasture, but has been intensively cultivated in the past 150 years. Agricultural terraces were present and ground exposure was 70-80% in winter. The boring is in the same field as BIR 11, 12, 21, and 23. This site is located on the Thomas Shockley Survey (A-1021), which is owned by J. B. and Wilma Underwood. It was purchased in 1967 from W. A. and Lena Mae Bearden (Ellis County Deed Book 520:304). This geotechnical location is situated (along with BE10.5 in road, BE10.7, BIR12, 21, 23) in the William S.

Forester Estate, which was divided among Dollie Underwood, W. T. Bearden and Ella Hollabough in 1936. David Jumey surveyed the 3000 m2 area on November 14, 1989. Some handmade brick were observed scattered around the entry gate area. Chalk rock and recent snail remains were present on the ground surface. The former barn area has a concrete set pole barn and dates to the 1950s. The 1500 m2 access route will not affect archaeological remains. The barn and fence will be avoided. BIR 23 This Hall Boring (Figure A-1) is located at N238,320 E2,175,840 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 662 ft amsl. This drill site is located 20 m west of Bethel Road and 760 m south of the Old Maypearl Road. The environmental setting is a broad upland, which was a prairie in its native state with medium to tall grasses. The nearest water source is 200 m to the east, which is an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of Chambers Creek. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slope (Brooks et al. 1964). The area is currently used as pasture, but has been intensively cultivated in the past 150 years. Agricultural terraces were present, and the area was freshly plowed (100%) with exposed fragments of bedrock. The tract containing BIR23 is within the J. Wilshire and G.W. Whitefield Survey and is owned by Merline and Aubrey Coker. The Cokers purchased this tract from J. J. and R. C. Bearden in 1926 and 1927 (Ellis County Deed Book 712:700). This geotechnical location is situated (along with BE10.5 in road, BE10.7, BIR12, 21, 22) in the William S. Estes Survey (3-3644, A-337), a Mercer's Colony grant to his heirs, which was sold unlocated to Blumford Shankle in 1855. This tract was surveyed for Shankle in 1857. Since Shankle received other grants in the SSC project area, it is likely that he was a land speculator and did not reside on this grant. This was also part of the B. F. Forester Estate, which was divided among Dollie Underwood, W. T. Bearden and Elfa Hollabough in 1936. David Jurney surveyed a 3000 m2 area around the boring on November 14-15, 1989. A 500 m2 area was surveyed as well. No artifacts were observed in the boring area or along the access route. BIR 31 This Hall Boring (Figure A-1) is located at N232,079 E2,178,422 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 617 ft amsl.

BIR 43 (along with BIR 41, 42, 44, and 45) is located within a tract formed from the J.P. Crawford, Benjamin Barton, Walter M. Tumer, A. Davis, and L.F. Holcomb surveys. Today, the property is owned. by Bobby D. and Dorothy Worsham, who purchased the land from Phillip Brooks in 1980 (Ellis County Deed Book 651:22). The 4000 m2 access route to BIR43, BIR44, and BIR45 was surveyed by David Jumey on November 15, 1989. Fergus Flaherty returned to survey a 3000 m2 area around the boring on February 22, 1990, when the route was very muddy. There was very good visibility, and three holes were observed in a sparse pasture, along with a scatter of chalk pebbles throughout the field, but no artifacts were observed. The access and drill area had already been cleared, and the access was dry. On March 13, 1990, the crew went with Ferman Barrantine to clear an alternate access route to the boring because the previously cleared route had been softened by rain. The new route followed the dirt route, bearing southwest for 550 m beginning at the paved road (Bethel Road). The route then turned northwest into an overgrown pasture and headed directly to the boring, which was about 500 m northwest of a dirt road. The route crossed an overgrown pasture with some chalk on the surface, but with poor (less than 30%) visibility in most places. There was a very thin soil cover (0-15 cm) and no features or artifacts were observed, The access route then proceeded through a barbed wire fence which will be cut and repaired. In all, approximately 8000 m2 of intensively cultivated fields (now pasture with terraces) were inve.rigated. The access route along the fence revealed plowed and windblown soil accumulation along the fence and deflation within the fields. On April 10, 1990, photographs were taken of the drilling in progress. BIR 44 This Hall Boring (Figure A-1) is located at N231,160 E2,178,664 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 620 ft amsl. It is located 320 m south of Boz Road and 640 m west of Bethel Road. The environmental setting is a gradually sloping upland west of the headwaters of a tributary to Chambers Creek, which is locally known as Cottonwood Creek, 210 m to the west. In its native state, this was a prairie with dispersed trees. Two soil types are mapped in this area, Austin silty clay with 1-3% slopes and Stephen silty clay with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). BIR 44 (along with BIR 41, 42, 43, and 45) is located within a tract formed from the J. F. Crawford, Benjamin Barton, Walter M. Turner, A. Davis, and L. F. Holcomb surveys. Today, the property is owned by Bobby D. and Dorothy Worsham, who purchased the land from Phillip Brooks in 1980 (Ellis County Deed Book 651:22). This geotechnical location (along with BIR 31, 32, 33, 41, 42, 43, and 45 and SIR 3A and 3B) is within the Walter M. Turner Survey (3-3520, A-1085). This tract was surveyed in 1855. Fergus Flaherty surveyed a 3000 m2 area around the boring on February 21, 1990. The route to BIR43, BIR44, and BIR45, which had been already partially surveyed by David Jumey (11-15-89), was quite muddy when revisited. All three of the holes were observed in a sparse pasture, and the visibility was very good (80%). No artifacts were observed, and a scatter of chalk pebbles were exposed throughout the field. On April 11, 1990, photographs were taken of the drilling in progress. BIR 45 This Hall Boring (Figure A-1) is located at N231,515 E2,178,508 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 618 ft ams}. It is located 270 m south of Boz Road and 630 m west of Bethel Road.

by Bobby D. and Dorothy Worsham, who purchased the land from Phillip Brooks in 1980 (Ellis County Deed Book 651:22). This geotechnical location (along with BIR 31, 32, 33, 41, 42, 43, and 44 and SIR 3A and 3B) is within the Walter M. Turner Survey (3-3520, A-1085). This tract was surveyed in 1855, Fergus Flaherty surveyed approximately 3000 m2 around the boring on February 22, 1990. On April 10, 1990 Flaherty revisited the site, recording that the access route had been graded, although ruts at least 20 cm deep in some places were still present. The ruts were cut back to reveal clean soil profiles. Geotechnical investigations included measuring the hole widths using calipers all the way down to the bottoms of the holes. Other electronic readings were taken to check rock and soil types in the hole, coordinating this information with the coring results. In addition, photographs were taken of the drilling in progress. No artifacts were noted prior to land disturbance. The disturbances did not reveal any materials either. The soil depth is 20 cm, where bedrock is encountered. BIR 51 This Hall Boring (Figure A-5) is located at N273,838 E2,247,233 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Palmer Quadrangle at 440 ft amsl. It is located 750 m south of FM 878 and 860 m east of Ebenezer Road. The boring is situated on the slope of a broad upland where a tributary stream 10 m to the east, Bone Branch, intersects Cottonwood Creek. The boring is located on a Houston black clay, with 1-5% slopes and severe erosion (Brooks et al. 1964). In its native state, this area was a tall grass prairie. This tract is presently owned by John D. Ackley. It is located 1.5 miles south of FR878, and two miles southwest of Palmer. David Jurney surveyed a 3000 m2 area around the boring on November 16, 1989. A 6400 m2 access route along existing field roads with 100% exposure was investigated at that time. This access is the same for BIR 52, BIR 53, and BIR 54. The boring area consists of a plowed Blackland Prairie area located on the point of the upland. Ground visibility was 100% and no artifacts were observed. BIR 52 BIR 52 (Figure A-5) is located at N273,931 E2,247,444 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Palmer Quadrangle at 449 ft amsl. It is located 820 m south of FM 878 and 940 m east of Ebenezer Road. The boring is situated on the slope of a broad upland where a tributary stream 60 m to the west, intersects Cottonwood Creek 200 , to the south. The boring is on a Houston black clay, with 1-5% slopes and severe erosion (Brooks et al. 1964). In its native state, this area was a tall grass prairie. This tract is presently owned by John D. Ackley. It is located 1.5 miles south of FR878, and two miles southwest of Palmer. David Jurney surveyed 3000 m2 around the boring on November 16, 1989. The construction of a stock tank has altered the landscape considerably. One manganese decolorized glass piece was noted, but no other surface artifacts were noted here or during a transect made by the crew through a previously surveyed area (Lowrey 1989:15). BIR 53 This Hall Boring (Figure A-5) is located at N273,960 E2,247,549 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Palmer Quadrangle at 452 ft amsl. It is located 750 m south of FM 878 and 940 m east of Ebenezer Road. The boring is situated on the slope of a broad upland where a tributary stream 70 m to the west, intersects Cottonwood Creek 200 m to the north. The soil at the boring is a Houston black clay, with 1-5% slopes and severe erosion (Brooks et al. 1964). In its native state, this area was a tall grass prairie. A-9

This tract is presently owned by John D. Ackley. It is located 1.5 miles south of FR878, and two miles southwest of Palmer. "David Jurney surveyed approximately 3000 m2 around the boring on November 16, 1989. The landscape has been totally altered by the construction of a large stock tank, drainage terracing, and erosion. The bedrock (Taylor Marl) is exposed. No artifacts were noted. BIR 81 This Hall Boring (Figure A-5) is located at N266,210 E2,250,398 (Texas Coordinate System), on the Palmer Quadrangle at 450 ft amsl. It is located 380 m south of Tammy Lane and 1,130 m east of Ebenezer Road, The boring is situated on the slope of a broad upland, where a small tributary stream 80 m to the north, Cottonwood Creek, intersects Bone Branch The soil type is a Houston black clay, with 5-8% slopes and severe erosion problems (Brooks et al. 1964). This boring is located on a tract owned by Carl J. and Eulata Schmolder. It is part of the Rafael de la Pena, B.R.R. & C.R.R. Co., John Plunkett, George Smith, and Peter Stout Surveys. The Schmolders purchased this tract from Elmerad Mildred Doherty in 1970 (Ellis County Deed Book 546: 923). The boring is .5 miles south of FR878, and one mile west of Palmer. David Jurney surveyed a 3000 m2 area around the boring on November 14, 1989. In addition a 6400 m2 access route along an existing field road with 100% exposure was investigated. This access was used for BIR 82, 83, and 84 as well. This boring, along with BIR82, BIR83, and BIR84, has been disturbed by the construction of a stock tank. Agricultural terraces were observed in the fields. Vegetation in this field consisted of sorgham with some scatter of sunflowers, at the drill site itself the vegetation consisted of thistle, milkweed, and bois d'arc trees. The ground exposure ranged from 80-100%. The access route to the boring is on an active farm road and no further disturbances were expected. A tenant house dating to circa 1950 was outside the project impact area. A metal corral was also present. These were avoided by drilling crews.

This monument is located on an upland at 780 ft amsl on the Midlothian Quadrangle. The general area is located on a ridge point overlooking South Prong Creek. Two soil types are present along this upland, Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slopes along the flatter portion of the ridge, and eroded Eddy soils with 3-8% slopes present along the flanks of the ridge (Brooks et al. 1964). The depth to bedrock is less than 10 cm, and bedrock is exposed in some areas. The tract containing this survey area is owned by the Meadows Foundation. This area was first surveyed by EG&G and TNRLC personnel for boring SE 1.5a (Lowrey 1989:19). At that time an access route approximately 3000 m2 was investigated. No cultural materials were noted. The vegetation consists of sparse bluebonnets and grasses, with the ground exposure ranging from 20 to 50%. There is a freshly graveled road bed. Cattle trampling has impacted the land surface 2 to 5 cm below surface, with slight to intense agricultural terraces. A pipeline is present along the shoulders of the ridge. A collapsed fence line with a 25 to 50 cm high terrace lined with hackberries indicates substantial erosion. There were no sites observed from the site location to 1000 m east. Cattle bones were located on the surface; the animals died within the last 2 to 3 years. 159 (Monument) -David Jurney surveyed a 100 m2 area around this LANDSAT monument on April 14, 1990. (See SE1.8, Figure A-2.) This monument has an elevation of 750 ft ams! on the Midlothian Quadrangle. The environmental setting, ground cover, and soil composition of this site is identical to site 158. It is located on a ridge point overlooking South Prong Creek. Similar to 158, the vegetation consists of sparse bluebonnets and grasses, with the ground exposure from 10 to 20%. Monument 159 was investigated by David Jurney and B.D. White for SE1.8 and November 13, 1989. The holes of a large burrowing animal were noted between Monuments 158 and 159, but did not appear to be armadillos. The weight (tension) bearing post of an adjacent fence line were set in holes which had been drilled into chalk rock with 16 inch rotary drills. A circa 1950s hay baler was abandoned near the fence. No evidence for historic or prehistoric occupation of this area was observed. BCI This boring (Figure A-2) is on the Strauss property, adjacent to BC1 (see Figure A-2) in Boz Quadrangle (USGS 7.5' map) at 743 ft ams], 340 m south of FM 1446 and 340 m west of Arrowhead Road. It is located on the sloping upland at the extreme headwaters of Greathouse (sic) Branch, 160 m to the northwest. The soil type is and Eddy gravelly loam with 3-8% slopes, which is extremely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). This area has been surveyed as part of the general west campus survey. In all, approximately 5500 acres have been surveyed for the West Campus (8-1-1990). This area was visited and discussed by Gathel Weston and Bill Chada (ARP) with Mike Smith, Joe Barrantine, and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC) on June 15, 1990. Clearance was given but no access route was flagged since no archaeological site was to be crossed in order to reach this drill site. The proposed drill site was not within 500 m of any known archaeological site. BCIA This boring (Figure A-2) is also on the Strauss property in Boz Quadrangle (USGS 7.5' map) at 741 ft ams!, 320 m south of FM 1446 and 380 m west of Arrowhead Road.

Cc L* This area has been surveyed as part of the general west campus survey. The proposed drill site was not within 500 m of any known archaeological site. This area was discussed in the field by Gathel Weston and Bill Chada (ARP) with Mike Smith, Joe Barrantine, and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC) on June 15, 1990. Clearance was given but no access route flagged since no archaeological site was to be crossed in order to reach this drill site. BE1.7 This boring (Figure A-2, see also SE1.5A, SE1.5B) is located at N253,843 E2,171,122 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 762 ft amsl. It is located 380 m north of FM 1446 and 400 m west of Hoyt Road, on the Quarter Horse Estates. This is a broad upland which was a prairie in its native state. The nearest water source is 400 m to the southeast to an intermittent drainage of Greathouse (sic) Branch. The soil type is Stephen silty clay with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). Depth to bedrock is less than 10 cm. This boring was initially surveyed and subsurface tests were made by EG&G (Lowrey 1989:9). David Jurney, Jeff Putzi, and Robert Feldacker surveyed approximately 6000 acres on J anuary 9, 1990. It was necessary to investigate a broader area than normal, since the boring had not been surveyed. This was an intensively cultivated field, recently plowed. No artifacts were noted. This tract is currently owned by Mrs. F, Dillard. A 1000 m long access route along an existing road was also cleared. In all over 16,000 m2 were surveyed intensively. No cultural materials were noted. BEI This boring (Figure A-2, see also BE1a, SE1) is located on the Boz Quadrangle at 762 ft amsl, on the southern portion of Quarterhorse Estates, 440 m west of Hoyt Road and 360 m north of FM 1446. The soil type is a Stephen silty clay with 1-3% slopes. The nearest water source is 400 m to the southeast to an intermittent drainage of Greathouse (sic) Branch. This area was initially surveyed by David Jurney, Jeff Putzi, and Robert Feldacker on J anuary 8, 1990 and for the general west campus archaeological survey. This area was revisited and photographed in the field by Gathel Weston and Bill Chada (ARP) with Mike Smith, Joe Barrantine, and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC) on June 15, 1990. No cultural remains were found during both investigations. Clearance was given but no access route flagged since no archaeological site was to be crossed in order to reach this drill site. BEIA (boot) BE1A (boot) is located on the Boz Quadrangle (Figure A-2) at an elevation of 761 ft ams]. It is located 320 m north of FM 1446 and 420 m west of Hoyt Road, on the Quarter Horse Estates. The soil is a Stephen silty clay with 1-3% slopes. The nearest water source is 360 m to the southeast, which is an intermittent drainage of Greathouse (sic) Branch. The area for this was first cleared on J anuary 8, 1990. It was resurveyed by Weston and Chada on June 14, 1990. BE2 This boring (Figure A-2) is located on an upland promontory west of South Prong Creek. It is located on the Midlothian Quadrangle at 680 ft amsl. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam. In the native State, this area was a prairie. The crew directed by John Mark Sheppard surveyed this area on November 20, 1989. In all, approximately 6000 m2 was surveyed. This geotechnical location is (along with BF2) within three surveys. The Andrew Rainer Survey (3- 5339, A-930) was a pre-exemption certificate granted in 1870. Rainer had homesteaded this tract in 1867, when it was surveyed. A-13

The field crew met with the owner of this property, who showed them where he wanted the trucks to enter. The crew then followed the fence lines to the drill site. Three cisterns were found adjacent to the access routes, two with brick necks. No artifacts were found around the cisterns except for Ferris bricks at the first and second cisterns. The third cistern had some modern bricks and tin, as well as a few fragments of the old handmade bricks. Nothing was found in the drilling area. The pastures were open (50% exposure) and there were two established track roads. These types of wells are used by ranchers to provide water for livestock. They have been noted as isolated structures throughout the western project area. BE3 This boring (Figure A-3) is located at N298,700 E2,197,111 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Waxahachie Quadrangle at 680 ft amsl. It is located 300 m east of Patrick Road and 1380 m north of the Gun. Club Road, or 200 m south of the north end of Patrick Road. It is on the future site of access point E3. This is a broad upland area at the headwaters of North Grove Creek which is 375 m to the northeast. The boring is situated at the junction of Eddy clay loam, with 3-8% slopes, which is severely eroded, and Austin silty clay 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). These soils have been heavily cultivated over the past 150 years. In its native state, this area was a tall grass prairie. David Jumey, Robert Feldacker, and Jeff Putzi surveyed approximately 6000 m2 for this boring and an alternate on January 9, 1990. Chalk rock is in the slope wash. The field is planted in corn in the summer and wheat in the winter. The visibility was 100% and there were no artifacts observed. The existing road will be used for access, and deep ditches parallel it. BE4 This boring (Figure A-4) is located at N297,830 E2,224,784 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Waxahachie Quadrangle at an elevation of approximately 494 ft amsl. It is located 320 m east of Pritchett Road and 800 m north of the east end of Bell’s Chapel Road. It is in the middle of the future access point E4. The soil type is a Houston black clay with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). The soil has been intensively cultivated for 150 years. The site is located in a very large open pasture near Rockett, on the east southeast side of the road. Bermuda grass pasture has been heavily grazed and plowed. The nearest water source is 640 m to the southwest, which is an intermittent drainage of Red Oak Creek. “Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi surveyed an area of 3000 m2 around the boring on January 12, 1990. In addition, a 1000 m2 access route was investigated. Ground exposure was 20-50%. The drill area is clear of cultural material. There is a scattering of Ogallala quartzite gravels in the access area and pasture but there is no evidence of modification of these cobbles. These veneer gravels are common in the eastern project area, and occasionally were used by prehistoric peoples. However, intensive plowing also fractures these cobbles. BES The boring (Figure A-S) is located at N278,967 E2,245,051 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Palmer Quadrangle at 468 ft amsl. It is 905 m north of FM 878 and 1,400 m east of Rutherford Road. It is located in the middle of the future access point ES. The boring location is at the base of a steep slope of a tributary drainage to Red Oak Creek 60 m to the northwest. Red Oak Creek itself is 800 m to the north. The soil type is a Sumter clay with 5-12% slopes, and is severely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). The 1961 aerials reveal intense gullying of this landscape along both sides of the Red Oak Creek valley. David Jurney, Robert Feldacker, and Jeff Putzi surveyed a 3000 m2 area around the boring on January 8, 1990. The site is on pasture land with Mesquite trees, with 50% erosion in the ravine.

mn Hee wee Hee He HHH meee HE & co established road, and this access was also surveyed, covering approximately 4800 m2: No artifacts were observed in the boring location or the access road. BE6 This boring (Figure A-6) is located east of Wolf Branch, a tributary to Mustang Creek. This area is .5 mile southwest of Garrett on the Ennis West Quadrangle at 480 ft amsl. The soil type is Houston clay with 3-5% slopes and is extremely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). The soil has been intensively cultivated for 150 years and has a been extensively terraced to prevent erosion. This geotechnical location is within the Claiborne Garrett Survey (1-7890, A-383) which was granted to his heirs by the San Augustine Land District in 1838. It was surveyed in 1854. David Jurney surveyed this boring in November 1989 with Diana Lowrey and Clayton Marler (EG&G). This drill site is in a recently plowed field with 100% visibility. A 3000 m2 area was Surveyed around the boring, along with a 500 m2 access route. No artifacts or gravels were observed. An additional area was resurveyed by Fergus Flaherty and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC) on March 21, 1990. The site was revisited on June 10, 1989. The access to the observation well surveyed by Jurney (already drilled) was southeast along the perimeter of plowed fields (BE6). The previous access route used by the rig approached from the south, but a lady whose house was along this route complained of dust in her yard. This new route was Surveyed so it could be used by the observation crews to monitor the well. The route progressed southeast, zigzagged east, then west to avoid a gully. An additional 1500 m2 area was surveyed for this access. No artifacts were observed along the new access route. BETA This boring (Figure A-7) is located at N222,080 E2,249,320 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Ennis West Quadrangle at 455 ft amsl. The boring is 680 m east of FM 984 and 780 m north of FM 34, .25 mile east of the town of Bardwell. This location is at the base of a slope of a tributary to Waxahachie Creek. The soil type is a Houston clay with 3 to 5% slopes, and is heavily eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). The field had been recently plowed. David Jurney surveyed the access route and the bore location covering approximately 4000 m2 on January 3, 1990. The boring is located in a heavily plowed area with milo stubble. Diffuse Uvalde gravel (Ogallala quartzite) was observed, and bottle glass, ceramics, and metal were also noted at the top of the slope. Some 1950s material was observed along the fence and road. There were also some 1880-1900 items seen at the previous location of a house. All of these cultural materials were adjacent to, but not impacted by the drilling. The upland veneer gravels of the eastern project area comprise a valuable resource that was sought by prehistoric peoples. When the E7 fee simple area is purchased, the gravel veneer could produce prehistoric artifacts indicating former tool manufacturing. Paleo Indian (Clovis) projectile points have been collected from Site 41ELS, within 1 kilometer of this area (C. K. Chandler, personal communication 1990). BE8 This boring is located in the Onion Creek floodplain. It is situated approximately 1.5 miles northeast of Avalon (Avalon Quadrangle) at 430 ft amsl. This is the only drill location falling within a well- developed floodplain. Two soil types are present within the survey area, Trinity clay frequently flooded, and Trinity clay occasionally flooded (Brooks et al. 1964). John Mark Sheppard surveyed the access to this boring (see BE8A, Figure A-7) on November 21, 1989. Approximately 2400 m2 of a road access was investigated. This was along a preexisting roadbed.

area has been intensively cultivated and many terraces have been constructed on adjacent slopes. Present access to the drill site was across a recently plowed field with 100% exposure. However, the boring itself was in a second growth field with honey locust, Johnson grass, sunflowers, and ragweed. The land surveyors and drill crew in November and December 1989 both needed mechanical clearance of the vegetation to reach the drill location. Shovel testing of this route was conducted on December 11, and 12, 1989. No artifacts were noted. The entire E8 area was surveyed June 12-13 by Mark Weston, Bill Chada, and David Jurney. In June, over 1 kilometer of the Onion Creek cut channel was investigated as well. BE8A This is the selected location for the BE8 boring (Figure A-7). Prior to any vegetative clearance, it was necessary to conduct close interval shovel tests to determine if cultural resources were present in what appeared to be a relatively undisturbed landscape. John Mark Sheppard conducted these investigations on December 11-12, 1989. Fourteen shovel tests (35 x 35 x 35 cm) were excavated, at 20 m intervals along the proposed access route after it leaves the existing (graded) roadbed. The dirt was trowelled through instead of being screened. Soil cores were requested from the drill crews to examine soil formation. Samples from 3 to 4 ft below ground surface were provided. The lower sample was submitted for humate dating. This sample reveals a distinct contact between a lighter upper soil and a dark buried soil at 4.5 ft below surface. Results from humate dating indicate that the dark soil horizon which is buried 4.5 ft. below the current ground surface is modem in origin, overlaid by older soils recently eroded off of surrounding upland areas. BEDA This boring (Figure A-8) is located at N207,540 E2,200,560 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Avalon Quadrangle at 515 ft ams. It is 920 m northeast of Lumkins Road and 1,400 m south of Holder Road, 100 m west of the future access point E9. This boring is located on the Quaternary terrace south and east of Lumkins, adjacent to Chambers Creek, which is one mile south. Mill Branch is located 610 m west. The soil type is a Houston black clay, terraced, with 0 to 3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). The soil has been intensively cultivated for 150 years, and many agricultural terraces are present within and adjacent to this boring. David Jumey, Diana Lowrey, and Clayton Marler surveyed a 6000 m2 access route to this boring on November 10, 1989. Additional access routes (3000 m2) were surveyed by David J umey, Jeff Putzi, and Robert Feldacker on January 9, 1990. In addition, a 3000 m2 area around the drill location was investigated. The site has a Uvalde gravel veneer. The farmland was remote and the field has been extensively and heavily plowed. The visibility was 100% and there were no artifacts observed. There was an old hog wire fence noted on the property. Fergus Flaherty hau to resurvey this area on March 12, 1990 due to the fact that the rig crew had come in by the wrong route, crossing land which had not been cleared. The land owner had not given permission on this land. The route taken by the drilling crew was closely surveyed, covering approximately 6000 m2, but no damage to the field was seen. The land had flooded recently, washing away any traces of tire tracks. The site was in a plowed field beside the tree line. No cultural remains were noted. On March 20, 1990, the archaeologist again visited this boring with Earth Tech Seismologists Dale and Kerry Hennon and with Ferman Barrantine. Kerry and his assistant headed at 73 degrees from BE9A drill hole 1000 ft into the woods. This point would be the center point of a 480 ft line of seismic tests oriented north-south-west. D. Hennon drove on a very muddy road while the others walked the previously cleared road into site. The road along the edge of the plowed field was fairly solid but has some flood deposits over it. No artifacts were observed. The crew eventually located and flagged the center point of the seismic transect (see GTE9A), On April 10, 1990, these sites were photographed by Fergus Flaherty and no artifacts were observed on the drill site locations. Also, all access routes were reexamined and no cultural remains were noted. A-16

| } BE10 This boring is located at N225,960 E2,181,360 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 562 ft amsl. It is 520 m west of Bethel Road and 130 m south of Higgins Road. BE10 is located in the area selected to be the future site of access point E10. This boring is located in the floodplain of Baker Branch, which is 40 m to the north, .5 mile south of Bethel Church. Two soil types are present within the surveyed area: Austin silty clay, with 3-5% slopes and severely eroded; and Frio silty clay, and severely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). This geotechnical location (BE10.5 in road and BE10.7) is situated (along with BIR12, 21, 22, 23) in the William S. Estes Survey (3-3644, A-337), a Mercer's Colony grant to his heirs, which was sold unlocated to Blumford Shankle in 1855. This tract was surveyed for Shankle in 1857. Since Shankle received other grants in the SSC project area, it is likely that he was a land speculator and did not reside on this grant. This was also part of the B. F. Forester Estate, which was divided among Dollie Underwood, W. T. Bearden and Ella Hollabough in 1936. David Jurney surveyed the access route along a field road and a 3000 m2 area around the boring on January 9, 1990. The road access comprised 5600 m2, and an additional 600 m2 was surveyed along the field entrance to the boring. Also a 3000 m2 area was surveyed north of Baker Branch during first attempts at locating the boring. All fields had been recently plowed and ground exposure was 100%. The access route was also 100% exposed. During the survey of fee simple purchase areas, this site was fully recorded (see Chapter 7, 41EL123). South of Baker Branch, at the road intersection, a recently burned house (41ELi23) was noted. It seemed to be constructed of Palmer bricks, as indicated by the Palmer brick piers noted at the house site. Though no artifacts were observed, some fossil shellfish and calcite were noted at the site. BI1 This boring (Figure A-2, see also BC1, BCla) was surveyed by John Mark Sheppard and the full ARP crew on November 17, 1989. The boring was located in a plowed field where winter wheat was just sprouting. A 1000 m2 access route was investigated, and a 3000 m2 area around the boring. Agricultural terraces were present in the field, and chalk rock fragments were common. An adjacent roadbed contained chert cobbles, possibly derived from the Brazos River. Bedrock (Austin chalk) areas were also exposed in this roadbed. No cultural materials were noted. B12 This boring (Figure A-2) was surveyed by John Mark Sheppard and the full ARP crew on November 17, 1989. The access route was an existing roadbed and a 2500 m2 area was investigated. A single house (occupied), two bams, and one shed were noted, but were outside the access route. The boring location was in a formerly plowed field which had been fallow since the summer. Waist- high Johnson grass and thistles were present, and ground visibility was 20-30%. An area of 3000 m2 was investigated around the boring. No cultural materials were noted. BI3 This boring (Figure A-2) was surveyed by John Mark Sheppard and the full ARP crew on November 16, 1989. An access route followed an existing road which was investigated (approximately 2500 m2). Two historic sites were noted adjacent to the road. One was an occupied house and a barn. The other was a former house site with a cistern, which was built of commercial brick. Ceramics, bottle glass, bricks, a roller skate, and a toy gun were noted, dating from ca. 1890 to the 1950s. The access route and the boring location (3000 m2) were flagged to avoid all cultural remains. A-17

BI4 This boring (Figure A-2) is located at N255,931 E2,174,205 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 720 ft amsl. This boring is located on the side of a heavily eroded slope on a tributary drainage to South Prong Creek. There are two soil types in the area surveyed, Eddy clay loam with 3-8% slopes, eroded; and Eddy clay loam with 8-20% slopes, severely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). At the time of the survey (November 17, 1989), the access route had not been determined, so two routes were investigated from FM 1446 to a secondary road .5 mile to the north. This was an existing field road cut into bedrock (Austin chalk). In all 7200 m2 of access was surveyed. The boring was situated on a ridge point in a thin (50% exposure) Bermuda grass pasture. An area of 3000 m2 was investigated. No cultural remains were noted along the access routes or the boring locations. BI5 This boring (Figure A-2) is located at N251,800 E2,182,380 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle with an elevation of approximately 670 ft amsl. This area is an upland promontory adjacent to a drainage of South Prong Creek. The soil is a Stephen- Eddy complex with 3-5% slopes and is severely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). In its native state this was a prairie. Today it is part of a terraced barn and corral complex with coastal Bermuda. This boring was surveyed by David Jumey, Robert Feldacker, and Jeff Putzi (ARP) and Joe Barrantine and Mike Smith (TNRLC) on January 10, 1990. The access was through a gravelled lot and along a field road with exposed bedrock (Austin Chalk). A 500 m2 access and a 3000 m2 area (20% exposure) around the boring was investigated. No artifacts were noted. B16 This boring (Figure A-2) is located at N245,951 E2,174,687 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 730 ft amsl. This area is situated on a broad upland along FM 66, and is within the area surveyed for the West Campus. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). The boring was surveyed by David Jurney, Robert Feldacker, and Jeff Putzi (ARP) and Joe Barrantine and Mike Smith (TNRLC) on January 10, 1990. A 500 m2 access route and a 3000 m2 area was investigated around the boring. Ground visibility varied from 10-30%, and a freshly plowed field was adjacent to the south. No cultural remains were noted. . A power-line passes through the boring. There were miscellaneous grasses and chalk rock. A telephone cable was also noted, and a cultivated field (100%) was present to the south which had been previously surveyed by the west campus crew. B802 This boring (Figure A-8) is located at N204,473 E2,220,525 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Avalon Quadrangle at an elevation of 495 ft, on the Southard Property. This area is located on an upland promontory overlooking Big Onion Creek. The soil type is a Sumter clay, with 5-12% slopes and is severely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). In its native state this was a prairie, but the area has been intensively farmed for 150 years, terraced in recent years, and a large tank has been constructed. This area has been approved as a waste dump facility, which is adjacent to the boring. The boring was surveyed by Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi (ARP) and Joe Barrantine (TNRLC) on February 19,1990. A historic house site is located about 60 m north northeast of this corner and about 40 m west of the cleared road. Wood posts, brick, and a glass scatter were observed. The previously cleared route and roadway are also scattered with glass and some brick fragments. The area has been plowed and A-18 aS fe tr 3 SS &

HR HE Es ip cma mimi & ES pm Hm a driven over extensively. The artifacts along the cleared path have been moved from near the historic site by plowing and vehicular and bovine traffic. The cleared access route will not impact the site itself. The route proceeds in a north northeast direction along a fence-line crossing several terraces for about 800 m. The site is about 100 m west of the edge of the field, in a plowed field. A PVC pipe and possible monitoring well was observed about 150 m north of the drill stake. A large lake was observed about 1 km east of the site. No cultural remains were present in the boring area. An existing road was investigated for access (6400 m2) and a 3000 m2 area was investigated (see 802a). B802A This boring (Figure A-8) has the same access, soil, and location as B802. This boring is located about 200 m east of a large stock pond and east northeast of B802. It is located about 50 m west of a north-south gravel road, which will be used as an access road. The road passes by an abandoned farmstead that was occupied until fairly recently. The road continues down to a tip of a peninsula protruding north into the pond. The roadway was cleared to the tip of the peninsula (2000 m2), where the drill crew will obtain water. The boring was sureyed by Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi (ARP) and Joe Barrantine (TNRLC) on February 19, 1990. A possible house site, consisting of scattered planks, cinder block fragments, modern trash, electricity poles, and a piece of gas or water pipe (1/2 inch in diameter) protruding from the ground was noted near the peninsula tip. Access will not impact the site, however. Vegetation around the site is grass (50% visibility) with some eroded spots. No artifacts were observed around the site. B1296 This boring (Figure A-1) is located at N227,477 E2,180,383 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 650 ft ams!. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam, with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years, and agricultural terraces are present. This boring was surveyed by Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi (ARP), Morris Balderman (Earth Technologies), and Joe Barrantine, Ferman Barrantine, and Mike Smith (TNRLC) on February 12, 1990. A 500 m2 access route and approximately 3000 m2 area around the boring were investigated. No artifacts were noted, B1316 This boring (Figure A-1) is located at N229,310 E2,179,576 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 650 ft amsl. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam, with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years, and agricultural terraces are present. This boring was surveyed by Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi (ARP), Morris Balderman (Earth Technologies), and Joe Barrantine, Ferman Barrantine, and Mike Smith (TNRLC) on February 12, 1990. A 500 m2 access route and approximately 3000 m2 area around the boring were investigated. No artifacts were noted. B1360 This boring is located on an area which as received heavy vehicular traffic from the present landowners, with ruts 10-15 cm deep to bedrock. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years and agricultural terraces are present. This area was surveyed by Fergus Flaherty (ARP) and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC) on April 11, 1990. The boring had been completed, but an intensive survey of 3000 m2 and the approximately 500 m2 access route did not encounter any cultural remains. A-19

B1527 This boring (Figure A-2) is located at N248,994 E2,172,201 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at 750 ft amsl. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. Fergus Flaherty surveyed this area on February 23, 1990. Access to this site (4000 m2) is along a northwest trending farm road running along the north side of a fence-line. After 400 m, the access route bears north northwest to the drill hole, where it crosses a pasture with medium grass growth. The visibility in the area was good (80%) to very good (100%). The drill hole is located 5 m from the south side of an 2 m deep intermittent drainage channel. The visibility in this area is good. An area of about 70 m in diameter around the hole was cleared (8000 m2). There were no artifacts observed around the site or on the access route. The soil cover at the site and and on the access route is very thin (0 to 5 cm in depth). On April 10, 1990, Gathel M. Weston and Fergus Flaherty returned to Hidden Valley Ranch to photograph the sites B1533, B1527, and SF10.1 A&C. All of the sites had been drilled and no artifacts were observed. B1533 This boring (Figure A-2) is located at N249,576 E2,172,058 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at approximately 750 ft amsl. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. Fergus Flaherty surveyed a 3000 m2 area on February 23, 1990. The boring is about 200 to 300 m southeast from B1540. The area has medium grass cover and the surface visibility was good. Snail shells and chalk rock were observed around the drill site but no artifacts were found. The area was revisited by Gathel M. Weston and Fergus Flaherty on April 10, 1990, when all of the areas had been drilled. Again, no artifacts were observed. The areas B1533, B1527, and SF10.1 were photographed. B1540 This seismic location (Figure A-2) is situated at N250,250 E2,171,882 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at approximately 750 ft amsl. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. Fergus Flaherty surveyed a 3000 m2 area on February 26, 1990. A gravel road was access to the boring, which was situated on the top of a rise just north of a northeast trending gravel road. The visibility in the area was very good. The vegetation was sparse, and the area cleared was about 70 m in diameter (8000 m2). A path about 10 m wide bearing southeast to B1533 was cleared (2000 m2). Snail shells and chalk rock were observed around the drill site, but no artifacts were noted. The area was revisited by Weston and Chada on April 12, 1990, when an "X" made of plaster board was observed in the area about 10 to 15 m south of the site. It is one of the monument locations on the Farrar properties to be used for observations from satellites. B1587 A-20 = i = f ise) al = “I | sett ] = =~ — a ——— CxS) C3 5

C= mihmeHhHeHmhH#H = SS a 3 mh & GE EH This seismic location and B1597 are situated on Quarterhorse Estates in Boz Quadrangle (USGS 7.5' map) at approximately 768 ft amsl, 660 m north of FM 1446 and 340 m west of Hoyt Road, on the Quarter Horse Estates. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The nearest water source is 340 m north to an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of South Prong Creek. The soil type is a Stephen silty clay with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. This area had been previously surveyed by Flaherty on February 26, 1990 and no artifacts were observed at that time. Bill Chada and Gathel M. Weston discussed this area on June 14, 1990 with Mike Smith, Joe Barrantine, and Ferman Barrantine, clearing the entire area. Since no archaeological site was located within the entire area, no access route was flagged. B1597, B1597a, B1597b These seismic locations (Figure A-2) are situated on Quarterhorse Estates in Boz Quadrangle (USGS 7,.5' map) at approximately 745 ft amsl, 940 m north of FM 1446 and 220 m west of Hoyt Road. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The nearest water source is 60 m to the west, an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of South Prong Creek. The soil type is an Stephen silty clay with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. This geotechnical location is (along with BE1-90) within the John Estes Survey (3-2478, A-335). This 295 acre tract was granted to the heirs of John and Sara Estes on May 2, 1850 by the Mercer's Colony from Kaufman County. The Estes heirs sold this tract unlocated to Blumford Shankle, who had the property surveyed on October 19, 1855. In 1936, this tract belonged to J. C. Turner who resided on the farm. This area was initially surveyed by Fergus Flaherty on February 26, 1990 and no artifacts were observed at that time. Bill Chada and Gathel M. Weston discussed this area on June 14, 1990 with Mike Smith, Joe Barrantine, and Ferman Barrantine, to investigate borings B1597a, B1597b. Since no archaeological site was located within the entire area, no access route was flagged. B1604 This seismic location is situated on the Fri-Tex Dairy owned by Kars Tamminga in Boz Quadrangle (USGS 7.5' map) at approximately 750 ft ams]. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. It is in a heavily utilized and modified pasture with fair visibility, although much of what can be seen is manure that covers the entire dairy. Gathel Weston, Mike Smith, and Joe Barrantine surveyed this area on June 13, 1990. A diffuse scatter of bricks, concrete, and glass was observed in this area, but due to the heavy ground disturbance and dispersed nature of the artifacts, it could not be classified as an archaeological site. These items were most likely used to stabilize gully erosion. An access route was flagged from Lone Elm Road to the site; in all approximately 3000 m2 were surveyed. B1607 This seismic location is also situated on the Fri-Tex Dairy owned by Kars Tamminga in Boz Quadrangle (USGS 7.5" map) at 745 ft amsl, 110 m north of Lone Elm Road and 100 m west of Hoyt Road. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The nearest water source is 20 m to the west of an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of South Prong Creek. The soil type is an eroded Eddy gravelly loam with 3-8% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. The area that was investigated is in a heavily utilized and modified pasture with fair visibility. Gathel Weston, Mike Smith, and Joe Barrantine surveyed this area on June 13, 1990.

In all, approximately 3000 m2 were investigated. B1617 B1617 is located (Figure A-2) on the Boz Quadrangle at an elevation of 720 ft amsl. The seismic test is located 390 m north of Lone Elm Road and 20 m east of Hoyt Road. The soil is an eroded Eddy soil with 3- 8% slopes. Tne nearest water source is 20 m to the east of an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of South Prong Creek. Gathel Weston (ARP), and Mike Smith and Joe Barrantine (TNRLC) surveyed this area on June 15, 1990. It is next to a stock pond located 2 m north, which was constructed on a spring fed drainage to an unnamed branch of South Prong Creek, in a heavily utilized and modified pasture with fair visibility (30%). B1619 This seismic location (Figure A-2) is also situated on the Fri-Tex Dairy owned by Kars Tamminga on the Boz Quadrangle at approximately 710 ft amsl, 460 m north of Lone Elm Road and straight north of the north end of Hoyt Road. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. Gathel Weston (ARP), and Mike Smith and Joe Barrantine (TNRLC) surveyed this area on June 15, 1990. It is next to a stock pond which is 2 m north, which was constructed on a spring fed drainage to an unnamed branch of South Prong Creek, in a heavily utilized and modified pasture with fair visibility. A diffuse scatter of bricks, concrete, and glass was observed in this pasture, but due to the heavy ground disturbance and dispersed nature of the artifacts, it could not be classified as a site. A seep well is located approximately 50 m west of the seismic location but no artifacts were observed in the immediate vicinity. An access route was flagged from Lone Elm Road, across a small creek, and to the site. In all, 3000 m2 were investigated, On July 6, 1990 Bill Chada and Gathel Weston (ARP) and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC) monitored the construction of a trench and berm to contain the overflow from the drill rig (Plates A-1, A-2). The 10 m long trench was between 50 cm and 80 cm deep with a soil depth of 4 cm at the east end of the trench. At the western end of the trench a soil filled gully was revealed. No artifacts were observed during construction of this trench. Photographs and field notes were taken of the complete process (Plates A-1, A-2). B1627 This seismic location is also located on the Fri-Tex Dairy owned by Kars Tamminga in Midlothian Quadrangle at approximately 741 ft amsl, 680 m north of Lone Elm Road, near the north end of Hoyt Road. It is 300 m west of an abandoned road which is the Fri-Tex eastern boundary. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The nearest water source is 140 m to the east, a stock pond on an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of South Prong Creek. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam with 3-8% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. The site is north of the dairy headquarters and was investigated on June 15, 1990 by Bill Chada and Gene Longcrier (ARP) and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC). It is located about 60 m east southeast of the main shed housing the dairy cows, and inside another corral on the main dairy lot. The entire area is in Coastal Bermuda grass and has poor ground visibility (20%). No artifacts or features were observed in this area. An access route was Cleared from the dairy yard to the site. In all, approximately 3000 m2 were investigated.

which is the eastern boundary of the Fri-Tex Dairy, and 950 m north of Lone Elm Road. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The nearest water source is 340 m to the east to an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of South Prong Creek. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. The site is north of the dairy headquarters and was investigated on June 15, 1990 by Bill Chada and Gene Longcrier (ARP), and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC). This is a steep area adjacent to a tributary to South Prong Creek. No artifacts were observed in this area. An access route was cleared from the dairy yard, around an area of irrigation piping, and to the site. In all, approximately 3000 m2 were surveyed. B1647 This site is also located on the Fri-Tex Dairy owned by Kars Tamminga on the Midlothian Quadrangle at approximately 725 ft amsl. It is at the north end of the Fri-Tex Dairy, about 20 m southwest of an abandoned road which is the east boundary of the dairy land. The site is located 1220 m north of Lone Elm Road to the north of the north end of Hoyt Road. The site was investigated on June 15, 1990 by Bill Chada, Ferman Barrantine, and Gene Longcrier. This is a steep area adjacent to a tributary to South Prong Creek, 100 m to the north. The soil is an Eddy gravelly loam with 8-20% slopes. No artifacts were observed in this area. An access route was Vleared from the dairy yard, across the pasture, around irrigation piping, and to the site. In all, approximately 3000 m2 were surveyed. B1657 This seismic location (Figure A-2) is on the Dillard property north of Fri-Tex dairy in Midlothian Quadrangle at 710 ft ams. It is located 180 m to the northeast of an abandoned farm road and 1500 m to the north of Lone Elm Road at the north end of Hoyt Road. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The soil type is an eroded Stephen-Eddy complex with 3-5% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). The nearest water source is 180 m to the south, which is an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of South Prong Creek. It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. An attempt to locate this site and B1667 was first initiated on June 16, 1990. An hour was spent by Bill Chada, Gathel Weston, Gene Longcrier, and Ferman Barrantine searching for the stakes. The survey crew arrived and informed us that they had not yet surveyed the area due to the dense woods and undergrowth. Bill Chada was left with the survey crew in order to clear the line as they progressed. Three hours later the survey crew had not reached the first site so Chada rejoined the archaeological crew at this point. On June 19, 1990 the same crew returned after the locality had been surveyed and marked. The locality itself is located at the edge of the riverine forest along a creek. Access to the locality was over a well traveled farm road that heads north from Lone Elm Road. A route was surveyed and flagged from this road across a heavily vegetated area to the site. No artifacts or cultural features were observed in this area. In all, approximately 3000 m2 were surveyed. B1667 This seismic location is on the Dillard property north of Fri-Tex dairy in Midlothian Quadrangle at 741 ft amsl. It is located 500 m east of an abandoned farm road and 1800 m north of Lone Elm Road at the north end of Hoyt Road. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The nearest water source is 275 m to the northwest, which is an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of South Prong Creek. The soil type is an eroded Eddy gravelly loam with 3-8% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. An attempt to locate this site and B1657 was made on June 16, 1990, but at that time it had not been surveyed, On June 19, 1990 the same crew (Bill Chada, Gathel Weston, and Gene Longcrier of ARP, and Ferman Barrantine of TNRLC) returned and was able to find the appropriate location.

Portions of this site were previously surveyed by EG&G (Lowrey 1989:14). This seismic location was surveyed on June 20, 1990 by Bill Chada, Gathel Weston, Gene Longcrier (ARP), and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC). The vegetation in the area is grasses with many wildflowers and sage. Sumac and mesquite are in profusion. Access was over previously surveyed routes and existing farm roads. These routes were re-flagged on June 20 to mark access for the seismic crews. No artifacts were observed when surveying the seismic site. In all, approximately 3000 m2 were investigated. B1722 This seismic location is just north of the Meadows Foundation property line on the Midlothian Quadrangle at approximately 700 ft ams]. This location is situated at the base of a slope on a tributary drainage to South Prong Creek. The soil type is an Austin clay with 3-5% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). In its native state, this was a riparian forest. The seismic location was surveyed on June 20, 1990 by Bill Chada, Gathel Weston, Gene Longcrier (ARP), and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC). The site is heavily grazed pasture with good (80%) visibility. The access route had been previously cleared to B1727, the additional route between B1727 and B1722 was surveyed and flagged. Most of this area was previously surveyed as part of penetration shaft site Fl. No artifacts were observed uuring either survey. In all, approximately 3000 m2 were investigated at close (5 m) intervals around the seismic location. B1727 This seismic location is north of the Meadows Foundation property line and south of FM 875 on the Midlothian Quadrangle at approximately 740 ft ams]. It is 950 m northwest of Lone Elm Road and 780 m south of FM 875. This location is situated at the base of a slope on a tributary drainage to South Prong Creek, 150 m to the southeast. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). In its native state, this was a riparian forest. The seismic location was surveyed on June 20, 1990. The site is heavily grazed pasture with good (80%) visibility. The access route had been previously cleared for both previous drill sites and as access road to penetration shaft site Fl. The access route was flagged in order to avoid the previously recorded site 41EL104. No additional artifacts were observed during survey. B1737 This seismic location (Figure A-2) is on the Midlothian Quadrangle at N269,743 E2,171,208 (Texas Coordinate System) at 753 ft ams! elevation, in a pasture. It is 1100 m northwest of Lone Elm Road and 520 m south of FM 875. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The nearest water source is 300 m to the southeast, which is an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of South Prong Creek. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam with 1-3% slopes, severely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. This geotechnocal location is (along with BF1) within the James Agee Survey, a pre-exemption certificate (P-875; A-31) from Ellis County, which was surveyed in 1874. Agee sold this grant to Isaac and Ann Newton (African-American) on November 1, 1875. They assigned the land to William Smith on April 1, 1876. An affadavit signed by R. M. Wyatt on January 3, 1878 that Isaac and Ann Newton were tenants for Smith, but were trying to claim the land for a homestead. Fergus Flaherty investigated the site on March 8, 1990, observing that there was good surface visibility all along the access route (200 m2), which follows a previously used track south southeast along the fence-line, then continues southwest about 100 m to the site. Some chalk rock was exposed, but no artifacts were observed on the site or along the route. There were two commercial bricks observed along the track just north of the cattle guard. Approximately 3000 m2 were investigated around this seismic location. A-25 C9 antes | Cs os & = fs — Cc) cS r ) | ene

a) = Gi mee Hm Hm HE & EE aes me He H&E me The site was revisited by Flaherty on April 10, 1990 with Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC). The water truck had taken an alternate route which had not yet been cleared. The route bears southwest off the cleared route about 100 m north of the drill site. The route then continues southwest to a pond about 200 to 250 m from the drill site, where the truck then picked up a load of water. This route and the previously cleared route were cleared. No artifacts were observed. An additional 2400 m2 was investigated. B1767 This seismic location is located north of FM 875 in the Midlothian USGS 7.5' Quadrangle at approximately 750 ft amsl. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam with 3-8% slopes, severely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. This site was surveyed by Fergus Flaherty (ARP) and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC) on March 5, 1990. A second alternate route was Cleared, as the original one along the pasture road was flooded and very muddy. A drainage ditch that the original access route crossed contained some brick, probably dumped with the purpose of filling t!.2 ditch. In all, approximately 5000 m2 of access and 3000 m2 around the seismic location were investigated. The alternate route goes northwest along a fence line, requiring that one of the fences be cut. The visibility was good, the pasture having a medium amount of coverage (50%). There were no artifacts other than the dumped brick and concrete that was already noted. B1807 This seismic location (Figure A-2) is situated at N276,429 E2,173,257 (Texas Coordinate System). It was Cleared by Fergus Flaherty (ARP) on February 20, 1990. This is a broad upland area which was a native prairie in its natural state. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly loam with 3-8% slopes, severely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). It has been heavily cultivated for 150 years. This is in a fairly level pasture with fair to good visibility.Grass and weeds cover most of the pasture, with 50% ground exposure. Chalk rock fragments are exposed through the ground cover. Some snails and chalk rock were observed here; however, no artifacts were observed. In all, approximately 3000 m2 of access and the seismic location were surveyed. B2075 This seismic location is situated at N296,023 E2,190,842 (Texas Coordinate System). It was cleared by Fergus Flaherty (ARP) on February 20, 1990. At this site the hole was relocated north 60 degrees east from B2055. It is in a plowed field with 100% ground exposure near the corner, just south of the bend in FM 664. An area of approximately 3000 m2, south of the fence-line was cleared. No artifacts were observed, B2190 This site is located on the Mays property, and was surveyed by Fergus Flaherty (ARP) on March 8, 1990. It had not been staked by the survey team at the time of the archaeological visit, so Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC) placed a stake on the approximate drill site. An area approximately 50 m in diameter was cleared around the stake. No artifacts were observed in the pasture. The site access route (2500 m2) crosses a gully which has partially flooded the road. Access would not be allowed until this dried, as equipment would destroy the roadway. : The alternate route (2500 m2) was walked over with Mr. Mays on March 9, 1990. No artifacts were observed along the route, which curves around stock ponds and joins up with the previously cleared route. A-26

B2197 This site is also located on the Mays property and was surveyed by Fergus Flaherty on March 8 and 9, 1990, The site is in a pasture with fair to good visibility. When visited, a route had previously been cleared across the field to the gravel pasture road. This gravel road, in turn, allows access to site B2190. Approximately 5000 m2 was investigated. B2290 This seismic location was cleared on March 28, 1990, by Fergus Flaherty. The location is approximately 250 m northwest of FM 875 and 20 m from a northwest trending pasture road. B2290 is near B1767, which lies to the northeast. The pasture road which was to be used as an access is gravel and bedrock. Only a few brick fragments were observed and some asphalt tile. These had been dumped to stabilize the road bed. The site is in a pasture which slopes gently to the north, with medium grass cover (20-30%). The soil cover in the area is very thin (about 5 cm), and the surface is covered with chalk fragments and some snail shells. No artifacts were observed on the drill site. The pasture road is well defined and consists of rock and gravel. Because it is on bedrock, it is unlikely that the roadbed will be significantly impacted by the seismic rig. B2758 This seismic location (Figure A-5) is situated at N274,616 E2,247,049 (Texas Coordinate System), and has been discussed under BIR 81, 82, 83, and 84. It is located on the Schmolder property. This location was surveyed by Fergus Flaherty (ARP) on February 20, 1990. The location was to be moved higher up, away from the wet lands. B2758 was relocated about 5 m east of a north-south fence-line. A route was cleared south from the site to an access route for BIR81 which had been initially surveyed November 11, 1989. This route curves away from the fence-line to avoid a brick and artifact scatter in a plowed field. A depression, possibly a collapsed storm cellar, was noted west of the access route. Artifacts, including whiteware, manganese decolorized glass, and numerous brick fragments, were noted. This area was highly disturbed by plowing. The area surrounding the collapsed structure and depression does not appear to have been plowed. The route was clearly marked with flagging so that drill crews could avoid this twentieth century archaeological site. In all, approximately 3000 m2 were investigated in addition to the previous studies. B2758A On April 9, 1990 Fergus Flaherty (ARP) and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC) visited this seismic location to examine an additional area. The site had been previously surveyed on November 11, 1989 (see BIR 81, 82, 83, and 84) and had already been drilled and graded. No artifacts were observed in the area during either visit. This confirms that the area had no cultural deposits. SE1.8 This boring (Figure A-2) is located at N264,930 E2,169,240 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Meadows Foundation property. Two soil types are present along this upland, Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slopes along the flatter portion of the ridge, and eroded Eddy soils with 3-8% slopes present along the flanks ‘of the ridge (Brooks et al. 1964). The depth to bedrock is less than 10 cm, and bedrock is exposed in some areas. A-27 | 1 i _] J a ap om se co co Co | = Ye |

1 = This area was first surveyed by EG&G for the survey of SE 1.2 and SE 1.2B (Lowrey 1989:14). David Jurmey (ARP) visited the property with B.D. White (Earth Technologies) on November 13, 1989. The vegetation consists of sparse bluebonnets and grasses, with the ground exposure from 10 to 20%. No artifacts were noted. In all approximately 2500 m2 of access along an existing road, and 3000 m2 around the drill site were surveyed. SE4.6 This boring (Figure A-4) is located at N296,650 E2,231,090 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Waxahachie Quadrangle at 535 ft amsl. This area is a broad upland which has been intensively cultivated for 150 years. The soil type is a Burleson clay terrace with 0-1% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). In its native State, this was a prairie. This boring is located on a tract which is the estate of Marvin Singleton, and consists of parts of the John Bell, Joe Bell, and W.H. Morris Surveys. Singleton purchased the property from James F. and Esther Smith in 1970 (Ellis County Deed Records 541:541). David Jumey (ARP) and B.D. White (Earth Technologies) surveyed this area on November 13, 1989. A 800 m2 road access and a 3000 m2 area around the boring were surveyed. Visibility is 100%. The field road is plowed; the drill hole is to be set in this road or in the intensely plowed field next to the road. Along the road, manganese decolorized glass, milk glass, stoneware, commercial brick, and twentieth century majolica were observed. The artifacts were from 1900 to 1960, and probably are associated with a former house site southeast of the boring. SE4.7 This boring (Figure A-4) is located at N297,270 E2,232,480 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Palmer Quadrangle at 535 ft amsl. This area is a broad upland which has been intensively cultivated for 150 years. The soil type is a Burleson clay terrace with 0-1% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). In its native state, this was a prairie. This boring is located on a tract which is the estate of Marvin Singleton, and consists of parts of the John Bell, Joe Bell, and W.H. Morris Surveys. Singleton purchased the property from James F. and Esther Smith in 1970 (Ellis County Deed Records 541:541). David Jurney (ARP) and B.D. White (Earth Technologies) surveyed this area on November 13, 1989. The area has been intensively cultivated: the southeast was plowed in corn, the southwest was plowed in cotton, and a pasture lies to the northwest. The visibility at the site is 100%. No surface debris or any artifacts were observed, In all 1600 m2 of road access and 3000 m2 around the boring were surveyed. SE5.2 A, B, C, D, E These seismic locations are situated in the Palmer Quadrangle at 460 ft amsl. The first proposed boring locations (SES.2C, D, E) are at the base of a steep slope of a tributary drainage to Red Oak Creek. The soil type is a Sumter clay with 5-12% slopes, and is severely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). The 1961 aerials reveal intense gullying of the landscape along both sides of the Red Oak Creek valley. Also, refer to BIR 81, 82, 83, and 84, and B2758 for additional discussions of this area. This geotechnical location (SE5.2A, B) is within the Eady Jordon Survey (3-3805, A-570), a 640 acre tract which was granted from the Nacogdoches Land District in 1855. The tract was surveyed in 1855. Other locations for SE5.2 (SE5.2A, B) were surveyed again (Figure A-5) by Fergus Flaherty on March 8, 1990 in the uplands northwest of Garret. The specific location still had not been surveyed, so pink flags A-28

and stakes were placed at the approximate locations. There will be three or four drill holes approximately on a line between B2758 to the southeast and BES (previously drilled) to the northwest, orientation about 330 degrees. A large area about 55,000 m2 was visually surveyed and flagged to make sure a sufficient area was cleared. A good gravel road provides access to CP1 which is near the northeast corner of a large pasture. No artifacts apart from the recent cow skeleton and some modem glass fragments were noted near the road. SF8.1 This boring (Figure A-8) is located at N206,750 E2,216,280 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Avalon Quadrangle at 510 ft amsl. The boring is situated on the point of an upland which overlooks Big Onion Creek. The soil type is a Houston clay with 5-8% slopes, and is severely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). In its native state this was a prairie. The tract containing SF8.1 belongs to Wallace B. and Beth A. Thompson. This is part of the B. F. Humphries, J. B. Sanders, and Stephen Richardson Surveys. The Thompsons purchased this tract from J. C. and Virginia D. Tate in 1980 (Ellis County Deed Book 647:849). The boring was surveyed by David Jurney (ARP) and B.D. White (Earth Technologies) on November 13, 1989. The site is on a ridge top with heavy grass cover and mesquite trees. There are mesquite trees to the east and pasture to ue west, which appears to have been bulldozed and intensively cultivated. There is marl bedrock exposed west of the stock tank. The road was good, but eroded. No artifacts were observed. A 4000 m2 access route and 3000 m2 around the boring were surveyed. SF8.3A, B, C, E, F These borings (Figure A-8) are located at N205,392 E2,206,966 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Avalon Quadrangle, at an elevation of approximately 505 ft. It is on the Fort property. The area is situated on the point of an upland which overlooks Big Onion Creek. The soil type is a Houston clay with 5-8% slopes, and is severely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). In its native state this was a prairie. This boring is located on a tract administered by James Fort, Attorney for Louis F. Cowen. This tract is within parts of the T.I. Smith, and Benjamin Smith Surveys. The Smith Survey was given as an easement to the Ellis Prairie Soil Conservation District in 1959 (Ellis County Deed. Book 471:85). Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi (ARP) surveyed this area along with Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC) on February 14, 1990. The access route was already partially investigated; an additional path was cleared across the plowed field to the first stake and then a strip 40 m wide bearing approximately east along the stake line. The stakes were placed 70 m apart, with a total of seven stakes (not all were drill holes). Ground exposure was 100%. An additional 3000 m2 area was surveyed. Two pieces of vessel glass and one brick fragment were noted about 80 m west of the westernmost stake (for SF8-3a), but no other artifacts were observed in the cleared area. On March 14, 1990 Fergus Flaherty and Ferman Barrantine resurveyed this area. The route was now very muddy, so the crew had to walk about 1 km along a pasture road through a wheat field (8000 m2). No artifacts were noted. The drill rig was on SF8.3(CP2) with another hole planned 400 ft west southwest of this rig. Ferman and Flaherty cleared an area about 40 m wide by 150 m long, extending west southwest of SF8.3(CP2) to the new drill site (6000 m2). A truck testing crew which performed some tests on the drill holes had to be towed by bulldozer. No artifacts were noted in any of the construction areas. In all, over 14,000 m2 were investigated. SF8.6 This boring (Figure A-8) is located at N207,080 E2,206,500 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Avalon Quadrangle at 510 ft amsl. This boring is located on the Quaternary terrace south and east of Lumkins, adjacent to Chambers Creek, which is one mile south. Mill Branch is located .5 mile west. The soil type is A-29 cS Co 71 ———, aes if a al c s , = C

a Houston black clay, terraced, with 1 to 3% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). This soil has been intensively cultivated for 150 years and many agricultural terraces are present within and adjacent to this boring. David Jumey (ARP), Diana Lowrey and Clayton Marler (EG&G) and B.D. White (Earth Technologies) surveyed access routes to this boring on January 8, 1990. This work was discussed under BE 9a. In all 9000 m2 were surveyed. There was 100% ground exposure. No artifacts were within the boring or access. Along the fence-line adjacent to the boring, cultural debris was observed, consisting of manganese decolorized glass (circa 1890s), a hand-fashioned spade scraper, ironstone whiteware (circa late nineteenth century), a lightning ball fruit jar (manganese decolorized), and a green fruit jar. There were reported to be over 23 houses in a 900 acre area, with the old school situated uphill. Historic debris was noted 200 m down from the boring. The gravel consisted of Uvalde, with some possible quartzite flakes. There was a dispersal of Ogallala veneer gravels over this area. Due to the intense cultivation, these flakes may not be cultural. SE10.1(CP2) This lacation is at N247,251 E2,173,078 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle, at an elevation of approximately 720 ft. on the Hidden Valley Ranch. The environmental setting is a broad upland, which was a prairie in its native state with medium to tall grasses. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slope (Brooks et al. 1964). The area is currently used as pasture, but has been intensively cultivated in the past 150 years. Agricultural terraces were present and ground exposure was 70- 80%. Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi (ARP) surveyed this area on February 7, 1990. A stake was set ina sparsely grassed field some 300 to 400 m east of the ranch road. The field had high visibility (100%) with little grass due to grazing by horses. The site area was on a east-west trending ridge. The immediate area of the stake had been burned over. No artifacts were noted. A 2500 m2 access route and a 3000 m2 area around the boring were investigated. SF10.1(CP1) This boring (Figure A-2) is located at N247,412 E2,172,960 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle, at an elevation of approximately 720 ft. on the Hidden Valley Ranch. The environmental setting is a broad upland, which was a prairie in its native state with medium to tall grasses. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slope (Brooks et al. 1964). The area is currently used as pasture, but has been intensively cultivated in the past 150 years. Agricultural terraces were present and ground exposure was 70-80%. Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi surveyed the area on February 7, 1990. On April 10, 1990, sites B1533, B1527, and SF10.1 were photographed by Fergus Flaherty. All sites had been drilled, and no artifacts were observed. A 2500 m2 access route was investigated. SE10.9(A) This boring (Figure A-1) is located at N241,000 E2,174,728 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle, at an elevation of approximately 690 ft amsl. It is on the Underwood property. This area was initially surveyed by EG&G (BR1), when J.B. Underwood provided information about this tract (Lowrey 1989:10). This geotechnical locality is situated (along with SE10.8, SE10.9C, D and BE10.9, BK1) in one of two Lewis Goddard Surveys (3-2281, A-398). This specific 320 acre parcel was surveyed in 1855. Since there were two tracts for Goddard, it is not likely that he resided on this tract. This was part of the B. F. Forrester Estate, divided among J. W. and Lula Whitefield, and Edna Orr. In 1936, tenants were operating the farms in these tracts. A-30

Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi resurveyed this area on February 7, 1990. Fergus Flaherty revisited it on April 2, 1990. The ground at the site was very soft during drilling. Three weeks prior to this visit, several deep ruts had been observed. On this later visit, however, the entire site had been graded, and most of the deep ruts graded also. A few whiteware and glass sherds were noted in the previously untilled pasture road leading to the site. These were near the gate, and since there is a corral nearby and no other artifacts or other features were present, it was concluded that these items were only trash. This location was referred to as SE10.9, as well as SE10.9 (CP1). In all, approximately 5000 m2 were surveyed within the access and boring. SE10.9(C, D, E) These borings (Figure A-1) are located at N240,814 E2,174,802 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle, at an elevation of approximately 690 ft amsl. This area was initially surveyed by EG&G (BR1), when J.B. Underwood provided information about this tract (Lowrey 1989:10). This geotechnical locality (SE10.9C, D) is situated (along with SE10.8, SE10.9A, BE10.9, BK1) in one of two Lewis Goddard Surveys (3-2281, A-398). This specific 320 acre parcel was surveyed in 1855. Since there were two tracts for Goddard, it is not likely that he resided on this tract. This was part of the B. F, Forrester-Estate, divided among J. W. and Lula Whitefield, and Edna Orr. In 1936, tenants were operating the farms in these tracts. Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi surveyed this area on February 7, 1990. The boring is in a field, open pasture with fairly sparse (30%) grass. This field has been plowed in the past. Along the fence a light scatter of artifacts was noted, such as purple and brown glass, ceramics, and metal fragments. Some glass fragments were also noted in the field near the drill sites. The scatter appeared not significant enough to divert around as it had been previously, and repeatedly, plowed over. These are diffuse remains, probably from generalized dumping, and no discrete archaeological deposit was noted. In all, approximately 5000 m2 were investigated. SI5.2C Fergus Flaherty (ARP) and Ferman Barrantine (TNRLC) surveyed this location on March 22, 1990, A new hole had been staked east of site SI5.2C. An area about 40 m wide by 150 m long trending north northwest from SI5.2C was cleared to allow for more holes in this area if needed. The area is pasture with very good visibility (80%). There were no artifacts observed. In all, over 6000 mZ2 of access and boring areas were surveyed. SI2ZA .This location (Figure A-2) is at N256,417 E2,178,816 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Boz Quadrangle at an elevation of approximately 670 ft, on the Poff property. The site is along FR 1446. Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi (ARP) surveyed this area on February 7, 1990, along with Joe Barrantine (TNRLC) and the Geotech people. The field has been heavily terraced and is covered by a mixture of coastal Bermuda, wild plants, and small trees. Approximately 2500 m2 of access and 3000 m2 around the boring were investigated. No artifacts were noted. On February 12, 1990, the boring was revisited by Feldacker and Putzi. Another section of the field was surveyed because the position of the stakes had been shifted toward the northwest. The new site is much closer to the access point for the field. An additional 3000 m2 was surveyed around this boring. No cultural remains were noted.

= Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi (ARP) surveyed this area on February 7, 1990, along with Joe Barrantine (TNRLC) and the Geotech people. The field has been heavily terraced and is covered by a mixture of coastal Bermuda, wild plants, and small trees. Approximately 2500 m2 of access and 3000 m2 around the boring were investigated. No artifacts were noted. On February 12, 1990, the boring was revisited by Feldacker and Putzi. Another section of the field was surveyed because the position of the stakes had been shifted toward the northwest. The new site is much closer to the access point for the field. An additional 3000 m2 was surveyed around this boring. No cultural remains were noted. SI2C This boring (Figure A-2) is located on the Hale property and is in the same setting as SI2B. The environmental setting is a broad upland, which was a prairie in its native state with medium to tall grasses. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slope (Brooks et al. 1964). The area is currently used as pasture, but has been intensively cultivated in the past 150 years. Agricultural terraces were present and ground exposure was 70-80%. Fergus Flaherty surveyed this boring on March 8, 1990 along with Ferman Barrantine. The site is on the south ‘sloping ground about 25 m north of a drainage ditch. The ground visibility is good (50-60%), with grass and weed cover in some areas. Mike Smith (TNRLC) recommended that a retention device be used due to the proximity to the house and drainage. The area cleared is a track going west 20 m then south through a fence (which would have to be cut). The soil is sandy with some snails and some chalk. No artifacts were observed. Approximately 2500 m2 were investigated. Flaherty returned to this boring on March 12, 1990. It was decided to enter the field from a gate to the north (along FM 1446) and to proceed south along a previously cleared access route to a previously drilled hole, then east along an established track. The crew then passed north of a metal shed and turned south along the route. In order to drill the hole, a berm would be needed to divert water away from the house. An additional 6000 m2 (approximately) was investigated. On March 16,1990, some bulldozer work was planned on the SI2C angle hole before drilling could proceed. This hole is near an occupied house and just north of a stream, so a berm would be required to divert drilling water away from both. Also, the terrain slopes necessitated a platform in order for a drilling tig to be put in place. Due to equipment problems, this excavation was not conducted until March 17, 1990. A trench was dug to about 1 m below ground surface into bedrock and no artifacts were observed. SI5.2 Fergus Flaherty surveyed this boring on March 22, 1990. It was revisited on April 9, 1990 to observe where grading had taken place. Impact on the ground here was minimal. No artifacts were noted in an approximately 3000 m2 area. SIR3A, SIR3B This geotechnical location (along with BIR 31, 32, 33, 41, 42, 44, and 45) is within the Walter M. Turer Survey (3-3520, A-1085). This tract was surveyed in 1855, Fergus Flaherty surveyed and photographed this location on April 2, 1990. The boring had already been drilled at that time, very little impact was observed, and no artifacts were noted. An area of approximately 3000 m2 was investigated. HV1603-1 This is a LANDSAT monument with no surface impacts. This monument area was surveyed by Fergus Flaherty on April 10, 1990, and is near B1540.

grass is stripped away and the cross set in place. Although it weathers in several weeks, the plaster leaves a white residue visible from satellite. No cultural resources were noted. MM006 This LANDSAT monument area was surveyed by Fergus Flaherty on April 12, 1990. No archaeological remains were observed in the area. GTE9SA This seismic location was surveyed by Fergus Flaherty on April 12, 1990. It is the center point of the seismic transect, due to the drill site being plotted about 150 m northwest of the point where it is shown on the map. The seismic tests will be along a northeast/southwest axis. The northwest half is in a plowed field and the southeast half is in a woods with a dense understory of briar and weeds. The woodland is also flooded to depths of up to 40 cm in several places along the seismic test line. An area of about 30 m wide by 200 m long was cleared around the proposed test line, as Kerry was not certain of the exact angle of the test line, so this area will leave plenty of leeway. The crew was able to drive along a previously cleared route for BE9A, and then cleared a path north through the woods to the test site: This site was revisited and photographed on April 11, 1990. No artifacts were observed. In all, approximately 8000 m2 were investigated. BF1, BFIA These borings (Figure A-2) are located at N267,430 E2,171,093 on the Midlothian Quadrangle at 720 ft amsl (Texas Coordinate System), on an upland prairie with chalk rock. The environmental setting is a broad upland, which was a prairie in its native state with medium to tall grasses. The soil type is an Eddy gravelly clay loam with 1-3% slope (Brooks et al. 1964). The area is currently used as pasture, but has been intensively cultivated in the past 150 years. Agricultural terraces were present. - This geotechnocal location (BF1) is (along with B1737) within the James Agee Survey, a pre- exemption certificate (P-875; A-31) from Ellis County, which was surveyed in 1874. Agee sold this grant to Isaac and Ann Newton (African-American) on November 1, 1875. They assigned the land to William Smith on April 1, 1876. An affadavit signed by R. M. Wyatt on January 3, 1878 that Isaac and Ann Newton were tenants for Smith, but were trying to claim the land for a homestead. This location was surveyed by David Jurney on November 12, 1989. The area is within remote pasture land, and some sumac and red cedar trees were noted in the area as well. The visibility was 70-80% and no artifacts were observed. In all, approximately 3000 m2 were investigated. BFL1A(boot) BF1A(boot) is located on the Midlothian Quadrangle at an elevation of 725 ft amsl. The site is located 670 m northwest of Lone Elm Road and 1250 m-south of FM 875. The soil is an eroded Eddy soils with 3- 8% slopes. The nearest water source is 80 m to the west, which is an intermittent drainage of an unnamed branch of South Prong Creek. This additional project required further survey. Mark Weston and Bill Chada surveyed a 3000 m2 area on June, 13 1990, and revisited it on June 14, 1990. BFIA (tail) BFI1A(tail) is located on the Midlothian Quadrangle at an elevation of 722 ft ams]. The site is located 700 m northwest of Lone Elm Road and 1210 m south of FM 875. The soil is an eroded Eddy soils with 3- 8% slopes.

Ss is 5] Lg = == This additional project required further survey. Mark Weston and Bill Chada surveyed a 3000 m2 area on June 13, 1990, BF2 John Mark Sheppard surveyed this area (Figure A-3) on November 20, 1989. An access was north along the blacktop road, then east until they reached the stake. An area 50 m around the stake was investigated. An open pasture with grasses and weeds was observed, with some clumps of prickly pear and secondary tree growth observed along the fence lines. In all, about 4000 m2 were investigated. This geotechnical location is (along with BE2) within three surveys. The Andrew Rainer Survey (3- 5339, A-930) was a pre-exemption certificate granted in 1870. Raimer had homesteaded this tract in 1867, when it was surveyed. BF3 This boring (Ligure A-3) is located at N300,776 E2,211,027 (Texas Coordinate System) at approximately 580 ft amsl. This boring is located on a hillside overlooking Red Oak Creek. The soil type is an Austin silty clay with 3-5% slopes and is extremely eroded. In its native state this area was probably a boundary zone between riparian forest and upland prairie. This area was surveyed by David Jumey, Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi (ARP), and Morris Balderman (Earth Technologies) on January 10, 1990 and is adjacent to an existing road. The area has agricultural terraces and has been planted in coastal Bermuda grass (30% exposure). The area has had heavy traffic, with several eroded areas on the hill side (100% exposure). Some recently dumped material was present, but no significant artifacts were observed. In all, an area of 3000 m2 was surveyed around this boring. BF4 This boring (Figure A-5) is located on the Farrar property at N290,237 E2,236,629 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Palmer Quadrangle at approximately 498 ft ams]. This area is a broad upland. The soil type is a Houston black clay, terraced with 0-1% slopes (Brooks et al. 1964). This was a native tall grass prairie in its natural state. This area was initially surveyed by David Jumey, Robert Feldacker, and Jeff Putzi (ARP), Morris Balderman (Earth Technologies), and Joe Barrantine (TNRLC) on J anuary 10, 1990. At that time, the access route was not determined, but cultural remains were noted adjacent to a house along the road. The access was flagged to avoid these remains as much as possible. Since the area was within an intensively plowed field, materials had dispersed 50 m away from the edge of the yard, The boring stake was placed within a second, although lighter, scatter of cultural materials. These were all twentieth century remains on the location, suggesting that this was a dumping area, not a house site. Despite this, the area has been intensively plowed and the ground exposure was 100%. In all, an access of 2500 m2 and an area of 3000 m2 around the boring were surveyed. Fergus Flaherty resurveyed this area on March 19, 1990. An alternate route needed to be cleared since the original cleared route had flooded. The cleared route goes along a gravel road past Mr. Farrar's house (Farrar Road), then turns north through a field of wheat. Approximately 50 m from the site the field was very wet, and there was no way around this area. After attempting to drag a pickup and trailer along the route with a bulldozer (which almost bogged down), it was decided that the drilling crew would proceed to another site and return to BF4 after 48 hours. This route was cleared, in any case, and no artifacts were observed, BF6A A-34

This boring (Figure A-6) is located on the Ennis West Quadrangle at 470 ft amsl. This is an upland projection adjacent to Bardwell Lake. The soil type is a Houston-Sumter Complex with 5-8% slopes and is severely eroded. The access to this site is through a highway borrow pit. John Mark Sheppard surveyed this area on November 21, 1989. Tall weeds and secondary mesquite trees were present, with 20-30% ground visibility. Several pieces of discarded metal and beer bottles were noted in this area. These were recently discarded items and do not relate to any archaeological site. In all, a 2500 m2 access route and an area of 3000 m2 around the boring were surveyed. BF7 This boring (Figure A-7) is located at N213,255 E2,241,332 (Texas Coordinate System) on the Ennis West Quadrangle at approximately 590 ft elevation. The soil type is a Houston clay with 3-5% slopes and is extremely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). Robert Feldacker and Jeff Putzi surveyed this area on January 12, 1990. The boring was in a recently plowed field. The access followed the fence-line north, then crossed a grassy area west of the drill site. The access area was marked both along the fence and the grassy area. The access was investigated t- the width of any vehicle coming out. No materials or artifacts were found, but there was a large amount of stone, much of it plow-scarred. The drill site is atop a north-south running ridge. The land slopes both east and west. The grassy area slopes down from north, south, and west to form a bowl with an opening (valley/draw) running est. The drill site is one-half mile south of the road and one-half mile north of the gate. An area of 6400 m2 was surveyed for access, and 3000 m2 for the boring itself. BF8 This boring (Figure A-8) is located on the Avalon Quadrangle at 525 ft amsl. This is an eroded upland area overlooking Big Onion Creek. The soil type is a Houston clay with 5-8% slopes and is severely eroded (Brooks et al. 1964). In its native state this was a prairie. This geotechnical location is within the James Spillman Survey (D-419, A-103), a certificate for service at the Battle of San Jacinto. This tract was surveyed in 1846. Spillman also received land in Travis County, which he sold unlocated. John Mark Sheppard, surveyed this boring on November 20, 1989. It was located in a field covered with sparse, waist-high weeds. However, the ground could be seen through the weeds, and visibility was fairly good (50%). The crew surveyed a 30 m access route and a 50 m diameter area around the stake. There were no artifacts observed in the area. In all, a 1500 m2 area was investigated. BF9 This boring (Figure A-1) is located at N214,885 E2,189,515 (Texas Coordinate System). This is a broad upland area. The soil type is a Houston black clay terrace with 1 to 3% slopes. In its native state this was a prairie. Today this upland is intensively cultivated. David Jumey, Robert Feldacker, and Jeff Putzi (ARP), Morris Balderman (Earth Technologies) and Mike Smith and Joe Barrantine (TNRLC) surveyed this boring on January 11, 1990. This area slopes to the northeast in an oat field. The access to this site is down a grass strip and existing field road. The field has been heavily utilized and plowed; the terraces are deeply plowed and planted with winter wheat. There were no artifacts observed, but the area had some gravels and quartzite. In all, a 800 m2 access route and a 3000 m2 area around the boring were investigated. A-35 — =) } — oa — f

APPENDIX B GENERAL LAND OFFICE AND WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION/U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE SURVEYS GLO The original field notes for the initial land grants of Ellis County are kept on file with the Archives Division of the Texas General Land Office (GLO) in Austin. These documents record a number of facts concerning the distribution of the Public Domain. Each certificate file contains affidavits that provide the paper trail for the individual to whom the land was granted, including early sales. For instance some individuals sold their certificates prior to any survey. Also, when the individual was granted, land circumstarices may have prevented the location of all land where desired, necessitating the survey of more tracts, sometimes far removed from the home, to secure the full acreage that was granted. As noted in the Historic Background chapter, there are multiple origins for the land grants which were located in Ellis County. Methodology The contiguous land tracts for all fee simple purchase areas and the ring itself comprise the majority of land tracts that were inventoried. Also, some tracts were selected within the ring to fill out the area of Ellis County which has been samples for this study. In all, 18 land tracts (Table B-1) were recorded. The dates of the original grant and the source of the grant were noted, as well as the actual date of the survey, the surveyor, and the surveying land district. Not all information was recorded within each GLO file, but a representative matrix has been collected. The dates which each land tract was granted range from 1830-1874 (Table B-2). From 1830-1847, these grants were primarily Republic of Texas; from 1847-1856 Peters' and Mercer's Colony grants dominated; landscript and miscellaneous land grants were present from 1856-1861. There was a gap in grants from 1861-1870. At this point (1870) until 1874 only pre-exemption certificates, all from Ellis County were granted (n=11). There is a significant lag effect from the date of the grant to the actual date of the field survey, extending back to the earliest survey (Rafael de la Pena) which was granted in 1830 and surveyed in 1835. A lag of as much as a decade or more was noted for many surveys of the Republic of Texas, many of which were still being located after Texas became a state. Also, the Mercer's and Peters’ Colony grants frequently took several years. It should be pointed out that many of the tracts surveyed were actually the remaining land granted under the terms of the certificate, a portion of which had already been located elsewhere. Of the 185 land tracts, the majority were administered through the Robertson Land District, who also surveyed for the Peters (n=18) and Mercers (n=30) colonialists, and granted 18 tracts directly. In all 57 tracts

originated from other land districts, but were surveyed by the Robertson Land District. Ellis County administered 62 land grants. The actual field location of surveys began in Ellis County in 1834 (Table B-2). There was a hiatus until 1837, when the Republic of Texas began the operation of disseminating the Public Domain. The Robertson Land District was strictly in charge of surveys until 1848, when Ellis County began a limited number. The Robertson Land District continued to administer most surveys until 1857. The Peters’ and Mercer's certificates or remaining portions of certificates were surveyed by the Robertson Land District from 1850 to 1857 (a single Mercer's certificate was located in 1860). In 1858, Ellis County became the principal administrator of the Public Domain. Even after the Civil War, the remainder of some early land grants from other land districts were still being surveyed in Ellis County. - In all, twenty-two surveyors are represented in the sample of the GLO tracts. Table B-3 lists these surveyors ‘in chronolcgical order. J. G. W. Pearson was the single Mexican Colonial surveyor. Six principal surveyors (B. J. Chambers, D. K. Webb, C. C. Taylor, Dr. Mitchell, J. E. Patton, and G. W. Cunningham) worked for the Robertson Land District. Patton and the Peters' and Mercer's certificates respectfully. Four addition Robertson Land District surveyors, B. P. Hollingsworth, W. W. Partis, Milton Wright, and Posey Gordon performed surveys only in the middle or late 1850's. Ellis County surveyors began with R. A. Davis and were followed by J. Richardson, Milton Knight, J. Hogue and R. Wyatt, R. M. Wyatt, W. W. Knight, C. K. Goodwyn, George Partis, J. G. Gibbons, and J. P. H. Nelson. In summary, the General Land Office surveys provide a detailed history of the dissemination of the Public Domain within the SSC Project area. In all, 48 of the 185 land grants were sold to other individuals and 18 were transferred to heirs. In all likelihood all 66 were never occupied by these individuals. Script surveys were given to individuals for compensation due from the Republic or State, and also were probably never occupied; (an additional 30 tracts). This leaves only 89 tracts which potentially were occupied by those individuals to which the land was granted. Only four certificates mentioned that these were actually homesteads. An additional 11 were specifically pre-exemption certificates which required 3 years of on-site residence. Although some of the Peters’ or Mercer's Colony could have been occupied, this is not necessarily so, since there were complicated residence patterns and legal problems that these people had to surmount. In the final analysis only 15 tracts were definitely occupied by the person to whom the land was granted. The principal point of this exercise is that the division of the Public Domain in Texas is complicated, and interpretations can be biased by certain assumptions. It is not certain that an original grant was occupied by the same person (50% of the SSC tracts were definitely not). Pre-exemption certificates required residence, but even these were sold to other individuals soon after initial filing. The Peters’ and Mercer's grants suffered several problems. First, not all the acreage that a person was entitled to could be placed near to their residence, and second, the legal and social opposition to this impresario system prevented many quan | ——w j = (ila = “7 f i]

7 from obtaining land when they were first entitled. Although Peters’ was granted contracts in August and November 1841, and July 26, 1844 (and revised 1843) and Mercer's was granted January 19, 1844, both empresarios had trouble bringing in sufficient numbers of settlers to avoid forfeiture (Connor 1959:36-67). The Ellis County area was the southernmost extent of Peters’ Colony settlers prior to the 1850s; with 57% of the Ellis County population in 1850 (Connor 1959:119). The region's population was opposed to the impresario system, which spawned to Hedge core ware (7-15-1852) during which all Peters' Colony certificates were destroyed. These had to be resurveyed (along with contraction) in the 1850's. WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION In various arez. of the south and in several Texas counties, the Works Progress Administration and US. Department of Agriculture conducted land tract-by-land tract inventories. These consisted of a preprinted series of questionnaires listing deed/title information, acreages divided to various components of farms, descriptions of selected buildings, landowner/tenant identifications, and dates of land acquisition, and in some cases, building construction or remodeling dates. There is variable quality of recording, but these files are systematized. Unfortunately, curation under County jurisdiction was unsystematic and hazardous. Ellis County is missing 600 files due to water damage. Circumstances could be worse, Navarro County destroyed all of its files in the early 1980s. The data were derived from the WPA surveys for tracts within the East and West Campus areas, Data files have been compiled for the footprint as well, and will be used as needed. Land acquisition (Table B-4) for the farms surveyed in 1936 indicates the approximate initial date of occupation, provided the land was purchased and then occupied by the same family.

Generally, it appears that several farms which were purchased during the mid to late nineteenth century remained until the 1930s. There was a peak of land purchases in 1900 with a maximum in 1930. However, in the East Campus area it appears that land changed hands frequently, with current (1936) farms initially purchased at low rates in the nineteenth century, and a major wave of purchases between 1920- 1930. The recording of initial house construction dates (Table B-4) was not consistent in the WPA files, with many of the West Campus buildings noted, but with little associated information or dates of construction. In all 146 building dates are available for the East Campus and only 27 for the West Campus. A trend similar to the land purchase dates is noted with early 1850 and 1870 dates. In the East Campus area more 1890 dates were noted. Construction with East Campus peaked in the 1910 decade (41 structures from 1905 to 1908 and 14 in 1910), with half as many in the 1900 decade and the 1920 decade. This same trend for the early twentieth century is also present in the construction of West Campus buildings. The first page of the WPA files was reserved for land and farm data. The land and farm page contained systematically and consistently recorded data. The area reserved for a house was recorded for 175 tracts in the East Campus area and 63 tracts in the West Campus (Table B-5). In the East Campus the majority of house reservation sizes were within the .5 to 1.0 acre range, with some relatively large house complexes. In the West Campus, house reservations were larger, 1.0 to 2.0 acres, with some large house complexes. The area acreage in cultivation (Table B-6) was recorded for 170 tracts in the East Campus and 89 tracts in the West Campus. The distribution among 17 acreage classifications (1 to 200+ acres) is relatively even. B-4 > op! ft Le — oe a CS

] Small farms are present and may indicate lower socioeconomic households practicing subsistence yeomen agriculture. Generally speaking many farms were limited in size to what one man could plow with a mule or small team (40 to 50 acres). Larger acreages required more intensive labor input, and those above 120 acres may be corporate or multiple family enterprises.

APPENDIX C BRACING FOR THE SUPER COLLISION: THE PEOPLE AND HISTORY OF BOZ, TEXAS by Michael S. Harris The community of Boz, Texas, is about to be erased from the landscape of western Ellis County, Texas. The Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) campus will cover 7800 acres of the immediate vicinity of this area. Hundreds of people will be forced to sell their property and move to different circumstances. This paper is a record of some of the community's history, translated through the words of some of Boz's inhabitants. METHODOLOGY The initial research plan called for a broad-brush sampling of communities and individuals along the circumference of the SSC ring. However, it quickly became apparent that the small community of Boz, Texas, was the area to be most affected by the SSC project and thus it was decided to give special attention to this area. The research perspective employed in this study focuses on an "emic” (Spradley 1980) methodology. The attempt is made to present much of the material from informant’s own point of view (Malinowski 1922). Such approaches have benefited cultural resource management studies in Texas (Nunley 1987; Saunders 1988). Much of the material presented is in dialogue form with speech patterns left intact. In all, ten interviews were conducted with individuals from the Boz area. The responses of several individuals were exerpted to provide a synthetic overview of the mental templates within a small rural community. The information provided in this report was solely based on interviews with current, and former residents of the community. A total of ten people were interviewed in periods lasting from two to six hours each. Some informants were interviewed more than once. These interviews have been synthesized. Oral history is dependent on a person's remembrance of past facts. This, however, is the most pristine method of reconstructing the 1940-1990 settlement. Thus, it should be borne in mind while reading that some of the dates and time periods cited by informants are of only general validity, rather than necessarily calendrically correct. The important aspect of the research, however, is not historical validity, but a reflection of the perceptions and lives of the people of Boz (cf. Langness and Frank 1981). Boz, Texas Today, the community of Boz consists of approximately 60 residences scattered within a 3 mile area southwest of Waxahachie, Texas. Boz is part of a local area consisting of Five Points, Greathouse, and Bethel, which together have historically been connected through the Bethel Church. Approximately one-

third of the residences are trailer homes, there are four or five government built houses and a number of old farming homesteads. Boz is interesting from a number of perspectives. Upon seeing the small community, immediately apparent is that this is a residential, farming, and ranching area with no majcr facilities such as, stores, gas stations, etc. Boz is simply a geographic area with numerous settlements in it. To the outsider, then, Boz is just an agglomeration of homes for people that must work and do their shopping in the nearby town of Waxahachie. To the descendents of some of the original inhabitants, however, the memory of Boz is of a different order. As(_) says, “Boz is like a clan. We tend to our own business and everybody tends to theirs. It's not that we're just neighbors, we're friends. We all know each other's business. Half of us have been there when the children were born and when the mother and daddy died. Just one big family." ( ) contends that Boz is different from nearby communities even in terms of "philosophy." He says, "Most of the people heré in Boz live within their means. They don't try to impress people with cars and expensive houses. If they can't afford it they don't buy it." From the mid-1800s until World War II Ellis County was one of the most productive agricultural areas in the country (Bizzel 1924). Boz, located southwest of Waxahachie, the county seat, was part of the great cotton boom in the U.S. All that the cotton boom entailed is part of the small community's history. The original settlers had black slaves and much land was let out on sharecrop. The names of some of the founding families of Boz are: Brack (actually from Greathouse), Dunaway, Whitefield, Forrester. As was common in new settlements the first generation of children from the community often married each other. Thus, from among the families listed above, Brack married Whitefield, Dunaway married Brack, and Forrester married Dunaway. Slightly later settlers were: Bearden, Jenkins, Sims, and Macready. The pattern was similar. Bearden married Jenkins, and Sims married Whitefield. The second generation from these unions, however, were much more likely to marry outside of the community. The reasons for this are obvious. First, the great amount of first generation intermarriage largely precluded further intermarriage. Second, by the early-to-mid-1900s communication and transportation in the U.S. had improved to the extent that people were much more aware of other places and people. Thus, increasing interaction of people over a wider area led to marriages from further away. Nonetheless, some of the descendents of the original settlers and farmers of Boz are still in the area, living on farms that have been handed down at least three generations. For these people the loss of their land is much more than just a physical loss, much more than simply an exercise in which just compensation will be given for their homes and land. For the descendents, the erasure of Boz is the obliteration of history, a history of people, places, and their relationships. As(_) says, “The mighty oak - you can cut its branches, carve your name, hack at it - but when you cut the tap root it dies. That's us." In this report some of the people of present-day Boz will be presented. Two are old settlers whose families go back almost to the beginning of the area. Another is an old African American man who worked a) a) ‘aa =)

in Boz as a sharecropper during the 1930s and 1940s. The last is a couple who have lived there since 1980 in an old trailer home. In this report, the people speak for themselves with some editing and organization. These people are eloquent and their words ring with such sincerity that to present a distilled version of their words would have been a disservice not only to them, but also to the memory of the community. (_ ), 82 years old, is in good health and retains an active and lively demeanor. Her story is an illustration of some of the history of Boz, particularly of the succession of families living in her and her father's house. She has had a hard life, surviving a couple of marriages and numerous deaths in her family. Yet, she has been able to live as a woman rancher in this overwhelmingly male activity. "I was bom August 7, 1908. I was born just across the branch on the same farm where I live now. I married when I was 18 years old. Maiden name (_—+). After two years of marriage, we moved over to near Greathouse, and then after a year we moved over near Maypearl. Outside of that I've lived in this house 55 years. My mother lived in Alabama and Tennessee. My mother's family began to drift in here during the 1880s. And she come to Texas in 1887 (her mother and father sent for her after they were settled). Daddy was already here. Daddy was from Alabama too. They didn’t know each other there. His mother died when he was 13 years old and his daddy remarried about a year later, and daddy began to drift and he wound up here working. He happened to be working and living with her sister's husband. It was over by the field off of Ganaway Road, on what used to be the Nelson Farm. That's where they met. They married in Boz in 1899 in the middle of August. In the meantime he enlisted and spent three years in the Spanish-American War. Before they lived at their house, they worked land for the Dunaways and Cunninghams. They worked sharecrop. In 1904 my daddy bought the farm right across the branch from where I am now. Daddy bought the Whitefield place, that's where we got the history because the old Whitefield lady was still living. They bought this place (the house that( _) now lives in) in 1932 from the Maxwell's. In 1913 it belonged to the Jennings, then the Lyons (had an old maid daughter), and then Mr. Maxwell (bought 1917-18) and then in 1932 Daddy bought it. This front part of my house is 150 to 170 years old. This was used for slaves. They came twice a year and gave food to the slaves. This was called the commissary. During the depression they'd let you go over there and pick that cotton but you couldn't sell it. But you could make a mattress out of it. I did that. When I married in 1926 I made a mattress. I still have it. In 1936 they killed the cattle. I seen them drive the cows down here and shoot them and cover them up. Because of the government. That's when things went bad. And they didn't give hungry starving people a piece of that meat. They gave the farmers $6 a head. Over there where my Daddy lived, used to be Judge Brack's. They had a two room house. They tore away the slave quarters. Course that's where I was born. A big screened in porch we called the sleeping porch. Course my brother's daughter and her husband moved in there and they finally tore the house away. That was a landmark all those many years. That's the way this young generation will do you. Don't think about the settlement and the history. Every one of those children were born there. But they tore it away (within the last 25 years). That's my niece and her husband. Nameis( ). They moved there and have lived there a good many years. I give them a hard time over it. : When we moved in here 55 years ago Daddy said do anything you want to cause someday this will be yours. Then when he passed away in '52, I bought it for $1000 (from her co-heirs, it was in the will). I had cattle. I didn't farm. With the children we just picked cotton. When my son was C-3

16 he went off to the service. When my daughter was 16 she married. Then I went into the cows. Those few years in there I just picked and chopped cotton off my brother's farm. I started to work on public work in ‘41 at Haggards. But then when this baby came she was sick, I did the night work. I went to North American. Since '51 I've had cattle. Grasses, pasture. My son lived in and out with me. He was a truck driver. He and his wife was separated. He'd come and stay four, five months, - we'd get all our fences mended. But then 14 years ago I lost him. Nine years ago my da died; six months after that I needed a mastectomy. I just carry on. I just went on. Just got to live with it. This is the kind of thing - when they take my home I'll have nowhere to go." History In the old days the community of Boz was the midway stage coach point between Dallas and Waco and was a bustling village located not far from Waxahachie (for Ellis County history see: Euis County. Historical Workshop 1972; Ellis County Historical Society 1972). The center had three small general stores (one with the post office), a blacksmith's, barber, and a doctor (Dr. Sims). Just across the creek was the cotton gin. The stores were owned by: Graves, Clayton, and Rumsey. One of the stores was later owned by Mr. Self. There were two lodges in the village, Rebeccas and Oddfellows. Oddfellows Lodge was held above Mr. Graves store once a month. As(_+) says: "we did all our shopping there. Momma sold her butter and eggs there. Bought our ice there. Bout twice a year we went to town, The mail was brought once a week by Tom Allen on a mule. We voted in the store where the post office was. We voted there until 20 years ago and then it moved over to Five Points." Similarly, Clayton's store and the blacksmith shop also moved to Five Points during the 1950s. The cotton gin was originally run with a steam generator. In 1915 a power plant was built next door and it switched to electricity. The new electricity also was wired up to the stores across the creek. In 1934 the stockholders of the gin had a falling out and a new owner took over and it operated until 1947. The owner, Mr. Mosely, sold out the gin and its property in the early sixties. Boz experienced floods and drought in the early 1900s and again for seven years in the 1950s. (_) tells how (_ ) father,( +), “witched" for people, a gift which ( ) also has.( _) father found the first community well using the forks of a peach tree (the best for water witching). The fork is held straight up and when water is sensed the fork bends down to the ground. (_) told of the seven year drought in which the only well that didn't go dry in the community was the one owned by J. H. Sims. "He let everyone get drinking water." Still, many people had to haul water for cattle from Forreston, and one man, Pud Maxwell, "would sell water." The Maxwell name is one commonly mentioned by the residents of Boz as one of the former larger landowners of the community. Pud Maxwell is remembered most frequently and less kindly, however: as the one who sold off his land to a developer. The lots are the sites of most of the trailer homes and government houses in Boz. r— f } med C23

EE | | The Boz school had four rooms with a hall down the center and was located near (_+) place, near the Baker Branch. In the early 1900s the school had close to one hundred students and had two or three teachers at different times who taught from elementary through high school. During the 1930s the number of children had dwindled to between fifty and sixty. The school disbanded right after World War II and the building was sold in 1952. Students from Boz were shifted to Forreston. One-half of the school was moved behind the Bethel Church and is today used for a recreation center. A school, (apparently defunct by World War II) for blacks was located across the road from the old Cunningham place which also briefly served as a Black church. The Bethel Church is still located to the south of Boz and today consists of the church, a fellowship or recreation hall, a parsonage and a tabernacle. The present site of the church is the third in its history. The Bethel Cemetery is located just to the south of the church. The church, cemetery, and tabernacle were used in the filming of "Places in the Heart." The Bethel Church, while outside of the area to be affected by the collider has played an important part in the community. It was the first church in the area to start an annual Lord's Acre Sale (in 1952). The Lord's Acre Sale was a method for increasing church revenues. In the beginning, farmers and ranchers put a wooden cross in one of their fields thus denoting that an acre of the harvest would be sold at the church auction. Women offered quilts and canned goods. Near the tabernacle there used to be a corral in which cattle were auctioned during the sale. The tradition continues today. However, the farmers now bring a pledge rather than the actual crop. The sale is accompanied by a free barbecue lunch and entertainment. Economy: Past and Present The economic fortunes of the community and its people mirror nationwide and local trends both historically and in the present. Today, since Boz is little more than a settlement we can speak of its economy as composed of individuals that either work outside of the area (such as in the city of Waxahachie) and those households still involved in ranching. Some of those currently ranching in Boz are the following households: Coker, Muirhead, Bratcher, Murdoch, Allen, Sherman, and Williams. Among those ranching households, the Cokers, Bratcher, and Murdoch are descendents of early inhabitants. The great majority of the other households not involved in ranching are those that work in Waxahachie and the surrounding areas. ( _), for example, are paper deliverers. The people not involved in ranching are generally "newcomers," people that have moved to Boz and built homes. This group is composed of most of the people living in trailer homes. The history of Boz's economy follows that of Ellis County with great productivity of cotton from the late 1800s through its decline in the 1920s through. 1950. In comparison to Dallas, Tarrant, and Johnson Counties, Ellis County had a higher ratio of tenant to owner farms from 1890 to 1940. This was largely due to the preeminence of Ellis County in cotton production.

Some of the original inhabitants began as sharecroppers. For example, ( _) father began as a sharecropper for the Cunninghams and the Dunaways in the late 1800s. By early 1900, however, he was able to acquire some land from the Maxwell family. Similarly, J. M. Dunaway (Francis MacGregor Dunaways grandfather) was hired to be the overseer of E. M. Brack's slaves (c. 1853). J. M. later married Judge Brack's daughter and purchased his own farm. In the mid-1800s, then, slaves were the major form of labor on the cotton farms and a typical farmhouse had small wooden slave quarters near. When slavery ended some of the slaves did remain in the community and worked for their former masters. A number of black families continued to live and work in Boz up into the 1950s. For example, Aunt and Uncle Hayes continued to do the washing for many people in the community. Tootsie became a maid for the Bearden's (Merline Coker's parents). Today there are no black families in the community (see Green 1970 for insight into the black perspective). There are two reasons that most of the blc-k families left Boz. First, the mechanization of cotton production from the late 1930s reduced the physical labor required on the farm. This work, the cotton picking, pulling and chopping, had largely been done by blacks, poor whites, and Mexicans. The cotton economy largely lost its impetus following World War II because of a combination of factors: cheaper foreign cotton became more readily available on the market, yields declined due to overproduction of the cotton monocrop, and the invention of synthetics reduced demand for natural fibers. One black man, (_+), continues to work in Boz, although he lives in Waxahachie. (__) is today a preacher for the Church of Christ and has a Sunday moming radio show. He currently tends the cemetery grounds, work which is provided by the descendents of the Sims family.( ) had been one of their favorite workers until the end of the 1950s. In the years prior to World War II, he worked as a sharecropper and hand for J. H. Sims, one of the largest landowners and the overseer of much of the land held by the landowning families not residing in Boz. J. H. Sims moved (_) and his family out to Boz in the back of his pickup truck. ( ) worked as a sharecropper on some of Sims land and also served as a farmhand wage laborer. When work for Sims was slow, (_) and his family would pick cotton in the area. The pattern is quite common for much of the area in the years prior to World War II. The sharecropping household utilized family labor for crop production and hired themselves out during the chopping, and harvest seasons. The following is an excerptof( ) words concerning living and working in Boz. It is presented verbatim, edited as necessary, and reorganized around the topics of (_ ) boss and friend, J. H. Sims, and farming. “I moved out there with Jake Sims, he was a big farmer. I don't know the year. I knew him from stayin with a guy named Jimmy Hitt and balin hay for a dollar and a quarter a day. He run a group of hands. Then finally he came and got me and I moved to stay with him. And I stayed with him 14 years. We moved with 2 or 3 kids. I lived first in Oak Branch and then lived on his property on top of that hill. First one was an old shack with no glass windows. Then after he moved into the new place I moved into his home (the old one - big old white place). C-6 v = 5 SS =

= That was their old house. He became the overseer for a bunch of land and those people put up a house for him. And I moved in the old home place. With my wife and how many kids, I have five boys and one girl. Had 2 or 3 cows out there, Also had a grass patch out there about 1/2 an acre and keep 8 or 10 hogs. Sell one once in a while. Kill it and salt it down. We had chickens and ducks, Had four turkeys, they were so crazy. J. H. was very nice to me. He was the cleanest farmer out there. And the biggest. I mean you don't see that Johnson grass and all that stuff. Everybody understands that - cleanest. Everybody thought of him that way. When they had his funeral (about 1986-7). I don’t think I ever seen a black person in there (the Bethel Church). But the preacher called me and asked if I would say something and I was the last to spoke at the funeral. I know the white folks still tell me that was the best words they heard at the funeral. I said, the Bible said that he that hath a friend must first show himself friendly. Mr. Sims has showed himself friendly to black and white, everybody in the community. At that time (pre-WWII) we couldn't eat in the front of any cafe. But when we'd be haulin' cows or anything he'd go in the front to eat. He'd ask them to fix me and Joe Mac, his other hand, a plate. If they didn't fix "1s a plate he didn't eat there. Come in the back, the kitchen there and eat. But J. H. Sims and he'd take care of us. Of course he paid for it But, after I moved with J. H. Sims he treated me good. The last two years I made 50 bales of cotton each year and I didn’t owe him nothin’ out of it. I paid for my own pickup bed when I moved to town. And I had a few thousand dollars in the bank. And he told me that when I decided to come back home I could call. I'm still workin’ the cemetery out there. Now I do it for his son, J. B. Sims, Seems like I was one in the family. After he passed. He gave me 100 dollars a month for mowing the cemetery. He would come through there about noon, 11:30 and say, "(_), you had your lunch?" And I'd say, well I'm gonna get through. He say “aw, c'mon down off a there." I got off the mower and went down to have lunch with him. But since that time that he's been gone, I miss all of that. His son taken over. And so his daughter say "(___) you have to do all the work since Daddy's been gone, so I'm gonna give you a fifty dollar raise." Sharecropping, Cotton, and Hay Wage Labor "I picked cotton, my wife picked cotton. She could beat me! I wouldn't give her to beat me for a long, long time. But, after a while I couldn't help myself and I would start movin’ the trailers around. My wife and kid would make 200 or some dollar. And that seemed like a lot back then. I saved some of that money. I don’t throw away money. I don't say I'm the best. I just watched Mr. Sims, how he handled it. And I was halfway honest. And I started preachin. I've been preaching for this congregation now for 27 years. I preach for the Church of Christ over on Graham Street. I started preachin in Kaufman - had to drive there from the farm. Preachin the only regular job I got. I preach and I take care of the cemetery. There aren't any blacks on the farm now. Cause they have the big equipment now. But way back there were a lot of black families. Used to use them hoes and that cotton sack. But we don't use that hoe and cotton sack anymore. We use that stripper and com puller, Can pull corn with a wagon and mules. I worked as a wage laborer for a dollar a quarter a day. And a dollar and a half for hay bailing. Hay baler was harder. Don't use those balers anymore - you punch the wire and tie the wire. Punch the one on one side of that thing and one settin still with a mule goin round it... The next thing we got was one that picked up the hay. One man sit on one side of it and another on the other.

When we got in thin hay, I kept my little Old Testament in my pocket and I reach in there and get it out and read as the trailer bumped. I got my preachin the hard way. When I worked on halves, I didn't have no equipment myself. Just like I made 60 bales, 30 were mine. I cleared my 30 bales because I made enough money to feed myself during the year. If T asked Mr. Sims for any kind of money I got it. He'd ask if I need any money. The bank'll let me have any kind of money I want. When I was farmin on the halves I had 60 acres. Did cotton. Wasn't much in corn. Most landlords didn't let any corn patches out there. If he would rip his aunties land with com, I would get a load, the landlord and he would get a load. You see that wasn't worth having. Cotton pickin go up and come down, o.k. My wife could pull 8-900 a day. I could pull 8-900 a day til I couldn't. My son could pull 1000. One of em I had to whoop to pick cotton. He's the best I got now. He's a deacon in a Dallas church now. But I made him pick it. Make a dollar and a half a hundred, or whatever. First pickin wasn't as high as the -zcond. Depends on how good your cotton is. J. H. paid regular price. It was good money for my family pickin cotton. Pickin and the pullin. When you pickin you pick the cotton out of the boll. But then they quit pickin and went to pullin. Pull off the boll. I just couldn't beat her and I didn't want that gettin’ around so I would go off and move the wagons. Chop cotton at that time you had a hoe bout eight inches wide and you had to hit every one (in between the plants) and get out any of the weed or whatever. If it was too thick you cut the plant and it wouldn't make. See now they don't chop cotton anymore. Use a radial or something. Just plant it and let it grow. When you had all those hands you could just chop it out. Cotton back then used to be tall, now its short. Mexicans would come through here and chop cotton til it was over with. But now, just plant it and put those strippers through it. Don't want it to get tall. When I started workin we plowed mould and mules, I plowed 4 mules and a walkin’ millbuster. Get the mules straightened up there, had two handles on it. Get right up there on top of the row and cut the field. One day I hooked them four mules up right after dinner time and I got out there and one of them mules got ready to turn around and one of them mules jumped up and fell dead. I didn't hardly know what to do. I was waitin for the man to say something when he got in, but he didn't say nothin. You had your cotton stalk right in the middle you go down there and take that much off on that side and them come back on that side and got a little bed and your leaving the stalks. Then you come back with the millbuster and throw all of them stalks out of there. The tuming plow is next to the millbuster. We had walkin’ stuff when I got out there. We had one ridin’ cultivator but we didn't use that much. Had to twist in your seat to keep it. Got tractor after 2-3 year after I was out there. She was stouter than a mule. She got that 137 pounds of cotton in that cotton sack. I'd get my sack and here she'd come with hers and I had to lift them sacks and I'd get angry. But she could handle them sacks like a mule. She used to be stout. She wouldn't take off a minute. Nobody wasn't makin’ her pull it. She'd go back and start workin' That was a workin’ family I married into. Her brother would do the same thing. Her brother would call 140 pounds of cotton and she'd try to keep up with him c-8 a cg oe — J ow 5) — {

I had five boys and one girl. My daughter wouldn't work in the field. If she did she'd go to the house about 10:30 or 11:00 and have dinner ready for us. You know that was choppin and pullin cotton. First car was a '52 Chevy. Went all the way to the other side of Ennis pullin’ cotton. Don't see no cotton sack up here anymore. Used to make a pretty good livin. Get out to Maypearl or Oklahoma. If J. H. didn't have anything for me to do, then we'd go somewhere else and pull cotton. When he got ready to put up his land then I had to quit. Farmed one crop of cotton on the 60 acres. The last two years I didn't owe nothin’ out of it cause my wife and kids went out and pulled cotton. She'd use that money for groceries and things. Finally, when J. H. got to overseer of a whole lot of land - Boz, Five Points, Blooming Grove. He tumed it over to his son. I said I'll tell you what - Johnny Boy gonna be my boss man (J. H.'s son) and Jo Mac gonna be yours. If there gonna be any eatin’ out you eat Johnny boy cause I work for him now. He says “ain't gonna be no eatin’ out." Never was no eatin’ out with that boy. Like if you missed doing something and here come the boss man chewin' you out. That Johnny boy if he see me now, put his head on my shoulder. He's a good boy. Never heard him say a bad work in his life. You push me and his father and we likely to say somethin bad." (_ ) currently live on the property where the old cotton gin office used to be. Part of that building is still standing. They arrived in Boz in 1980, bringing with them an old trailer home, a number of dilapidated Volkswagon Beetles which they use for parts to repair their cars, and a water truck used for firefighting. Since it takes a firetruck running time of 18 minutes from Waxahachie, the ( ) water truck has been useful in the community. The (+) are an example of recent arrivals to the community in that they bought enough land for a house and do not really have deep roots in Boz itself. They arrived from Midlothian, Texas, having saved enough money to purchase the lot in Boz. The following verbatim report of the way they make their living is instructive for giving insight into lifestyle choices and the economics involved in living out in the country. He: I was bom in Waxahachie Hospital. In 1942. My folks lived on somewhere close to Hampton Road until I was five. And they moved back to the place that had been in the family for 100 years in Midlothian. I lived there until bout 1980. He: We (he and his wife) met at the Christian Singles Association when it was a very small club. It was a non-drinking association. And we're both teetotallers. I come from a family that's that way. She: I knew him five months. He'd been married once before. Nice little club. Played bingo, had suppers. Just a place to socialize. He asked me out and we had a cheese sandwich. I ate what he ate. He: We had an auto repair job and worked at a couple of contract jobs and we were dealers for the Waxahachie Daily Light and the Dallas Times Herald. C-9

She: And we threw the Dallas Morning News. We were throwin the Daily Light and the Times Herald at the same time. He: One was a day time paper and the other was night. On Sundays we did ‘em together. They had the same route. He: 1,050 papers on Sunday. She: We just got tired. Spent all your time makin’ up forms and counting papers. And they didn't do anything. She: We thought last year we were going to have to move (because of the SSC). Now it's this year. It'll probably be next year. What can you get done" He's got a little Italy route and I throw for (__) there in Waxahachie. I started throwing the Moming News. Took two hours - from the time you picked them up tot he time you got done. Two hours is a cakewalk for me. We called ita kidc, route. 145 papers was nothing and we weren't makin but 600 dollars. Just something to pay grocery bills. We been puttin money in the bank. We were going to build a house up here. And that's the only money we're bringin in right now. We got out of most the newspaper business in January 1988. We quit the Herald. Drivin over 200 miles a day. She: we were working two jobs. He: It's not what you're making it's what your'e spending. She: Only bills we got: propane, telephone bill and electricity. We don't owe on the trailer. She: The only way we could stay in the paper business is to buy old cars and fix them. He drives over 3000 miles a month. That wears a car out. You ask how we make it in the paper business. Well we have those cars, all the parts are interchangeable. We drive them till the frame breaks. We got about a dozen. That's how we been making it in the paper business. He: More or less. She: You get x amount from you customers. Pay x amount to the papers. Then you have your expenses, We live cheaply, he and I. No children. He: You see that's how we make it here. The drop is twelve miles away and ends right here. She: And that's money. Cause in the paper business every paper counts. You count pennies. Werre upset cause we paid for this place. Got it set up. She: We worked two jobs and then some to pay for what we have here. We bought it on time from the people who owned it. From (_). We searched for this place for three years. We wanted a place with lots of well water. It never goes dry. He: (_) had a house on his property, the old seedhouse. Burnt down a number of years ago. Joe Buck made it into a residence and sold it to(__). The house burned in ‘76 and (_) and his wife had a house trailer on here. He: We bought this place and had it all paid for and had our own well. Bought it in 78 on a seven year note and paid it in 18 months. C-10 So q =) == a

eS She: We was working two jobs. Bought the trailer in bout ‘80. He: Then we bought the piece across the road on a 75 month note and paid it off in about 25 months. He: We have bout 2.5 acres. That's all off of the Maxwell property which had about 650 acres. L. O. Pud Maxwell. He played a little professional baseball I think. The position of the people living in the uailer homes of Boz is perhaps the more dire. Many of these people are low income earners. They have managed to save and buy their trailers and plots of land. These families will experience the greatest economic hardship when the SSC relocation takes place. There have been public hearings in which the rezoning of Ellis County has been the issue; the county may try to minimize the number of trailer homes allowed in the county. This means that a significant number of Boz residents could have to move to another county, a move which would cause significant disruptions among already impoverished people. All of the people of Boz, not just those in the trailer homes, are waiting for the SSC project to make the final move. The people's situations, whether rancher or town laborer, rich or poor, are presently being controlled by outside forces whose effects are bound to not be benign. BOZ AND THE SUPERCOLLIDER The SSC project will eventually destroy the community of Boz (Figure C-1). For those households which are living on land hel for many years in their family, this is a serious loss. Besides the stress of new and strange people (Supercollider authorities, appraisers, relocation assistants, archaeologists, geologists, etc.) on their land every day, the people have to live with the fact that they will be forced to move. The most unsettling aspect of this, however, is the uncertainty involved. Thus, many of the people in Boz have known since at least 1988 that the SSC would come through their community and have been waiting “for the axe to fall." The tentativeness of their future is quite significant for most of the residents and fosters feelings of powerlessness and anxiety. (__) says: "I feel like I'm just waiting here for my funeral and they're (the SSC administration) going to decide what to do with my body. That's the way it feels. And this is the worst thing that I've had to face (the supercollider). To move away from my home and wondering where and what is going to happen. That's honest, from the heart out. Not even my kids dying. That was God's work. I didn't question. But there's no question to ask. But I do ask a question why are they (SSC) coming? This don't have to be. Now people say. "Why don't you just pray?” I say this is nothing to pray for, the Lord hasn't got a thing in the world to do with this mess. This is just from some men in this world that want power, they want things their way. That's what this is.”

Adaptation — The process of change to better conform with environmental conditions or other extemal stimuli. Anthropology — The scientific and humanistic study of man's present and past biological, linguistic, social, and cultural variations. Its major subfields are archaeology, physical anthropology, cultural anthropology, and anthropological linguistics. Archaeological Context — The physical setting, location, and cultural association of artifacts and features within an archaeological site. Archaeology (also spelled Archeology) — The scientific study of the physical evidence of past human - societies recovered through the excavation. Archaeologists not only attempt to discover and describe _ past cultures, but also to formulate explanations for the development of cultures. Archaeologist — Anyone with an interest in the aims and methods of archaeology A professional _ archaeologist usually holds a degree in anthropology with a specialization in archaeology and is trained * to collect archaeological information in a proper scientific way. Artifact —- Any object manufactured, used or modified by humans. Common examples include tools, ~ utensils, art, food remains, and other products of human activity. Assemblage — A group of artifacts related to each other based upon some recovery from a common archaeological context. Assemblage examples are artifacts from a site or feature. Atlat!t — A wood or bone shaft implement, held in one hand, and used to propel a spear. The tool functions as a lever, giving greater thrust and distance. Botanist — A person who pursues the scientific study of the structure, growth, and identification of plants, Caddoan Culture Area — The geographical region that encompasses eastern Oklahoma, southwestern Arkansas, western Louisiana, and eastern Texas which was the homeland of the Native American Caddo people. Central Hall — A frame house consisting of two rooms and an enclosed central hall. When this house type is two story it is called an "I" house. Chert — A very fine grained rock formed in ancient ocean sediments. It often has a semi-glassy finish and is usually white, pinkish, brown, gray, or bluegray in color. It can be shaped into arrowheads by chipping. It has often been called flint, but true flint is found in chalk deposits and is a distinctive ~ blackish color. Conservation Archaeology — A subfield of archaeology which focuses on the preservation of archaeological resources. This position encourages the stabilization and preservation of archaeological sites as opposed to their immediate excavation. Cultural Resource Management -— A branch of archaeology that is concerned with developing policies and action in regard to the preservation and use of cultural resources. Cultural Resources — Sites, structures, landscapes, and objects of some importance to a culture or community for scientific, traditional, religious, or other reasons. Daub — Clay used to fill in the holes and gaps between the wood or thatching of a wall. It was used by both Indians and European settlers in North America to construct houses.

x = mea ER He He He HE EE iE Dendrochronology — The scientific study of the annular growth of trees. Trees produce rings of various thickness annually in response to rainfall. Tree-rings therefore, can be used to reconstruct fluctuations in rainfall in the past, reflecting past climatic conditions. Demography — The study of the distribution, density, and vital statistics of populations. Double Crib — Two rooms or chambers connected by a single roof to form a barn used for storage of grains or stabling of animals. Eastern Cross Timbers — A relatively narrow, north-south strip of forested land that divides the Grand Prairie to the west from the Blackland Prairie to the east in North Central Texas. The Eastern Cross Timbers are associated with the sandier soils of the Woodbine geologic formation. Ecology — The study of interrelationships of organisms and their environment. End Scraper — A stone tool formed by chipping the end of a flake of stone which can then be used to scrape animal hides and wood. Fauna — A Latin term which refers to animals remains, as opposed to flora which refers to plant remains. Features — Evidence of human activities visible as disturbances in the soil. Such disturbances are produced by digging pits for storage, setting posts for houses, or by constructing a hearth for cooking. These disturbances are often distinguished by soil discolorations. Flotation — A method of obtaining seeds and other organic materials from soil by using liquids. Flute — A long, narrow flake removed from a spear point to aid in the binding of the point to the spear shaft. Geologist — A person who studies the history of the earth and its life, especialy as recorded in rocks. Gorget — An ornament usually worn over the chest which may be either suspended on a cord or attached directly to clothing. Grit and Grog Tempered Pottery — Sand (grit) and crushed pottery sherds (grog) mixed in the unfired clay to make ceramic vessels stronger. These inclusions prevented the rapid expansion of the paste as the clay's water content was boiled away when the pottery was fired. Hewn — Wood shaped by heavy cutting or chopping blows struck by hand tools such as axes or adzes. Historic Sites Act of 1935 — Public Law 74-292; 49 Statute 666 enabling the authorized expenditure of funds for archaeological studies on major land modification projects. Horticulture — The science and art of growing fruit, flowers, ornamental plants, and vegetables in smali gardens. Incised —- A decoration found on pottery consisting of lines drawn into wet clay. When fired, the arrangement of lines leaves a permanent design on the vessel surface. Interaction Sphere — This term refers to prehistoric groups who shared social interaction and exchanged material goods, through a network made up of long distance trade contacts. Midden — The layer of soil which contains the by-products of human activity as the result of the accumulation of these materials on their living surface. For prehistoric sites, a layer of soil that was stained to a dark color by the decomposition of organic refuse which also contained food bones, fragments of stone tools, charcoal, pieces of pottery, or other discarded materials. For historic sites, a similar layer of soil but with appropriate historic material remains often in a much thinner deposit.

Prehistoric Hunter-Gatherers — Humans who lived prior to written history and depended upon the hunting of wild animals and the gathering of natural plant foods for their livelihood Prehistoric Sites — Locations where people who were alive before modern written records existed once lived, hunted, camped, or were buried. Painted or carved rock outcrops are considered sites as well. Provenience — The three-dimensional location of an artifact or feature within an archaeological site, measured by two horizontal dimensions, and a vertical elevation. Psoralea ssp. — The prairie turnip, as it is commonly referred to, is actually several species of plants which grow underground tubers.
