ABSTRACT This report presents the results of an intensive cultural resources survey conducted by Versar, Inc., under subcontract to BRW Architects, Inc., for the Texas Horse Park in Dallas County, Texas. Since the proposed project will be developed on city-owned property, these investigations were conducted in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4481. One new archeological site, 41DL508, was recorded and five previously recorded archeological sites (41DL72, 41DL73, 41DL205, 41DL206, and 41DL207) were revisited. A portion of site 41DL72 may preserve intact prehistoric cultural deposits, and the site is recommended eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). The potentially intact portion of the site has been placed in a conservation easement and has been fenced for avoidance by ground-disturbing activities related to the proposed development. Sites 41DL73, 41DL205, 41DL206, 41DL207, 41DL508, and the architectural resources documented within the proposed project area are recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). No additional work is recommended for these sites or structures. Artifacts collected during the course of this cultural resources survey and records generated by this investigation will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin. iii

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY This report presents the results of an intensive cultural resources survey conducted by Versar, Inc., (formerly Geo-Marine, Inc.) under subcontract to BRW Architects, Inc., for the Texas Horse Park. The project consists of the development of an equestrian facility, designed for equine education, recreation, competition, and conservation, to be constructed on property owned by the city of Dallas in southeastern Dallas County, Texas. Since the project will be developed on city-owned property, these investigations were conducted in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4481. The purpose of these investigations was to identify cultural resources (as defined by 36 CFR 800.4) within a 266-acre tract proposed for the development of the Texas Horse Park facility and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, as per Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks under the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26). Fieldwork was initially conducted from 1–8 May 2007 by Project Archeologist Kristen J. Bastis, assisted by Project Archeologist Aaron Naumann, Architectural Historian Mikel Travisano, and Field Technicians Bethany Oliver, Jim Gillentine, and Shaun Phillips, with Duane Peter as the Principal Investigator. A total of 379 auger and shovel tests was excavated during the 2007 field season, four previously recorded archeological sites (41DL73, 41DL205, 41DL206, and 41DL207) were revisited, one new archeological site (41DL508) was documented, and the architectural resources within the project area were documented and evaluated. Due to planning issues and administrative changes, the 2007 fieldwork ceased and the project was postponed. The project was reauthorized to proceed in 2012, and additional fieldwork was conducted from 4– 7 September 2012 by Project Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster and Field Technician Brett Lang, with Melissa Green as Principal Investigator. Architectural Historian Bill Hersch reviewed the architectural resources, updated building descriptions as necessary, and conducted deed/title research for the property. During the 2012 fieldwork, an additional 128 shovel tests were excavated to more completely delimit the boundaries of archeological sites 41DL72, 41DL206, 41DL207, v

and 41DL508. Since previously recorded site 41DL205 had been completely delimited during the 2007 fieldwork, no further work was conducted at the site during the 2012 field visit. Previously recorded site 41DL73 could not be definitively relocated during either fieldwork effort. Based on the potentially significant archeological deposits preserved within a portion of previously recorded site 41DL72, additional evaluation of the site took place in January 2013. Much of the project area has been subjected to ground-disturbing activities associated with gravel quarrying in the mid-twentieth century and agricultural practices in the late twentieth century. Archeological sites 41DL73, 41DL205, 41DL206, 41DL207, 41DL508, and the architectural resources documented within the proposed project area are recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). No additional work is recommended to document or evaluate these resources. Despite prior ground disturbances, a portion of site 41DL72 may preserve prehistoric cultural deposits. The site is recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. The potentially intact portion of the site has been placed in a city-designated conservation easement in tandem with Big Spring, the natural spring feature in the northern portion of the site on the adjacent property parcel, and has been fenced for avoidance by ground-disturbing activities related to the proposed development. Provided the portion of site 41DL72 with potential for intact prehistoric cultural deposits is avoided by ground-disturbing activities, it is recommended that the proposed project be allowed to proceed. Artifacts collected during this cultural resources survey and records generated by these investigations will be permanently curated with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas in Austin. vi

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION This report presents results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Versar, Inc. (formerly Geo- Marine, Inc.; project nos. 30428.00.04–.06), under subcontract to BRW Architects, Inc., for the proposed Texas Horse Park. The purpose of this study was to identify and provide data for the management of cultural resources that may be adversely affected by the development of the proposed equestrian facility to be constructed on property owned by the city of Dallas, a political subdivision of the state of Texas. These investigations were conducted in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4481. The project area is located approximately 5.7 miles (mi; 9.2 kilometers [km]) southeast of Dallas between State Highway (SH) 175 and SH 12 in southeastern Dallas County, Texas (Figure 1). The initial phase of the proposed project site encompasses approximately 266 acres for the development of the proposed equestrian facility, which will include a visitor’s center and administrative space, a covered arena, stables, parking areas, and riding trails adjacent to the Great Trinity Forest and White Rock Creek. The project area is bounded by Oncor Electric Delivery overhead electric transmission line corridors on the north and west and by Pemberton Hill Road on the east. The project master plan proposes expansion south to SH 12 during a later stage of development. Due to the lack of rights-of-entry (ROE), two tracts totaling approximately 23 acres were not accessible for survey (see Figure1). The proposed action is subject to project review under the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and accompanying Rules of Practice and Procedure (Texas Administrative Code [TAC], Title 13, Chapter 26 [13 TAC 26]). The purpose of these investigations was to conduct an inventory of cultural resources (as defined by Code of Federal Regulations, Title 36, Section 800.4 [36 CFR 800.4]) present within the proposed project area and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) under the Antiquities Code 1

of Texas (13 TAC 26.12). Archeological fieldwork for this project conforms to the guidelines proposed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and adopted by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). This cultural resources investigation consisted of a background literature and site records review, an assessment of archival sources, a systematic pedestrian reconnaissance and excavation of auger tests and shovel tests across the project area, and limited hand-excavated test units for the evaluation of the portion of site 41DL72. Fieldwork was initially conducted from 1–8 May 2007 by Project Archeologist Kristen J. Bastis, assisted by Project Archeologist Aaron Naumann, Architectural Historian Mikel Travisano, and Field Technicians Bethany Oliver, Jim Gillentine, and Shaun Phillips, with Duane Peter as the Principal Investigator. Due to planning issues and administrative changes, the 2007 fieldwork was interrupted and postponed indefinitely. The project was authorized to proceed in 2012, with additional fieldwork conducted from 4–7 September 2012 by Project Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster and Field Technician Brett Lang, with Melissa Green as Principal Investigator. Architectural Historian Bill Hersch conducted deed/title research for the property. Additional test excavations at site 41DL72 were conducted by Christopher Goodmaster and Lindsey Skelton in January 2013. All artifacts collected and records generated by this project will be permanently curated with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas in Austin. 3

CHAPTER 2 NATURAL ENVIRONMENT The proposed project area is located within the gently rolling uplands of the Blackland Prairie in southeastern Dallas County, Texas. The soils in this region are predominantly silty clays and clay loams derived from the in situ weathering of the underlying Cretaceous-age geology with localized sandy ridges along upland escarpments of the major drainage valleys. This region is located within the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950), which supports a variety of flora and fauna. The humid subtropical climate of the area is characterized by hot summers and mild winters. PHYSIOGRAPHIC SETTING The upper Trinity River basin includes three physiographic zones extending generally from east to west: the Blackland Prairie, the Eastern Cross Timbers, and the Grand Prairie (Kier et al. 1977; also see Yates and Ferring 1986:12–31). The project area is located within the Blackland Prairie physiographic region, a generally level upland mantled by black, calcareous clay soils that supports a variety of grasses (Griffith et al. 2004; Hill 1901). The underlying geology of the project area consists of the Austin Chalk formation (Allen and Flanigan 1986; Bureau of Economic Geology 1987), composed of interbedded layers of Upper Cretaceous-aged chalky limestones and calcareous micaceous clays (marls). The presence of these carbonate formations and marls has influenced the subsequent development of the soils and topography of the region. The relatively erosion-resistant Austin Chalk has resulted in the formation of the White Rock Escarpment, a prominent cuesta extending generally north-to-south between the East Fork Trinity River and the Elm Fork Trinity River. A series of Quaternary-aged alluvial terrace deposits have developed along the upland escarpments within the drainage basin of the Trinity River and its major tributaries. R. T. Hill (1901) initially described the dichotomy between clayey and sandy terrace deposits in the region and provided a preliminary assessment of their development. This prompted Ellis W. Shuler (1918; 1935) to investigate the morphostratigraphy of the upper Trinity River and define a series of three terraces. As a result of Shuler’s interest in the Trinity River terraces, a series of Southern Methodist University graduate students produced theses mapping the region in the mid- 5

to-late 1940s, which were later synthesized by James N. Taggart (1953). Subsequent work by local avocational archeologists W. W. Crook, Jr., and R. King Harris (1957; 1958) proposed new nomenclature for the terrace formations and made a preliminary attempt to outline their alluvial stratigraphy. The system proposed by Crook and Harris was adopted by archeologists and paleontologists working in the region until the mid-1980s, when C. Reid Ferring (1986; 1990) refined the previous system using sedimentary and lithostratigraphic analysis of exposures and borehole data to better determine the character, thickness, and geometry of the alluvial deposits. A detailed discussion of the upper Trinity River terrace system and their associated nomenclature has been provided by Ferring (1986; 1990; see also Ferring and Yates [1997:31–35]). The project area is situated on a dissected remnant of the Travis School Terrace under Taggart’s system or the Denton Creek Terrace under Ferring’s system. Denton Creek terraces are typically characterized as discontinuous unmatched sloping surfaces mantled by a fining upward Late Pleistocene sandy alluvium that often contains vertebrate fossils (Ferring and Yates 1997:34–35). The project area is situated on the western margin of the White Rock Escarpment and occupies an elevation range of 116–136 meters (m; 380–446 feet [ft]) above mean sea level (amsl) with slopes of 0–2 percent (Figure 2). HYDROLOGY The proposed project area is located near the confluence of White Rock Creek and the Trinity River. Several lower-order and intermittent tributaries extend from the project area to White Rock Creek (see Figure 2). Several broad depressions, resulting in poorly-drained, seasonally inundated areas, are present across portions of the project area. It is evident that gravel quarrying and agricultural development has altered the natural drainage patterns, resulting in several artificial ponds and channelized drainages within and adjacent to the project area. Big Spring, a large natural spring, is located immediately north of the project area. Prior to modern development of the area, several additional springs are likely to have existed along the upland escarpment in the vicinity. 6

SOILS The proposed project area is situated across seven soil series and one soil complex (Table 1; see Figure 2). All information regarding the soils of the project area has been synthesized and summarized from information supplied by the Soil Conservation Service (Coffee et al. 1980) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (2012). The distribution of these soils across the landscape is dependent upon the parent material and microtopography. The frequently flooded clay soils of the Trinity series dominate the floodplains of nearby White Rock Creek and the Trinity River. These floodplain deposits are limited to the northwestern corner of the project area. The remainder of the project area is composed of Axtell, Mabank, and Silawa series soils that formed in sandy Pleistocene-age strath terrace deposits along the Trinity River and its major tributaries. Clay-rich soils of the Burleson, Lewisville, and Wilson series mantle the Blackland Prairie upland portions of the project area. Portions of the upper terraces and upland escarpment were quarried for gravel during the mid-twentieth century, resulting in spoil piles of discarded fill and overburden generally classified as Arents. Typical soil profiles associated with each of these soil units are summarized in Table 1. FLORA AND FAUNA The Blackland Prairie is the southernmost extension of the North American tallgrass prairie and is within the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950). This ecoregion has undergone profound alterations from its native state by historic period farming and ranching and by modern urban, suburban, and exurban development (cf. Bezanson 2001). After centuries of disturbance and decades of deliberate replacement of tree and grass species, only isolated examples of prehistoric and early historic vegetation communities remain today (Telfair 1999). Present-day mammal species consist primarily of cougar (Puma concolor), coyote (Canis latrans), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), American badger (Taxidea taxus), American beaver (Castor canadensis), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), and fox squirrel (Sciurus niger). Mammals that once occupied the region include plains bison (Bison bison), gray (Canis lupus) and red wolf (Canis lupus rufus), black (Ursus americanus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana). Avian species include bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), and a variety of songbirds. Various reptiles and amphibians are also found throughout the area. 8

Dominant vegetation across the Blackland Prairie includes big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii gerardii), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), and gramagrass (Bouteloua gracilis) in the uplands, and eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), Shumard oak (Q. shumardii), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), black willow (Salix nigra), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), elm (Ulmus sp.), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) in bottomland forests and riparian forest corridors (McMahan et al. 1984). Common forbs include aster (Aster sp.), prairie bluet (Coenagrion angulatum), prairie clover (Petalostemum purpureum), and black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta). CLIMATE The climate of the project area is humid subtropical, with mild winters and hot summers. Daytime temperatures of greater than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (ºF; 37.8º Celsius [C]) are typical during the summer months. In contrast, temperatures rarely fall below freezing during the winter. Average annual precipitation is 102 centimeters (cm; 40 inches [in]), primarily as rainfall and typically in short periods of intense thunderstorms with peak precipitation in May and a nadir in August. 11

CHAPTER 3 CULTURAL CONTEXT The proposed project area is located in what is generally referred to as the Northcentral Texas cultural area (Perttula 2004). This area encompasses northern portions of the Blackland Prairie and the adjacent Cross Timbers physiographic regions. The following chapter presents a brief synopsis, based on regional archeology, of the Native American cultural chronology and European-American history of the Northcentral Texas cultural area. Given the size of the region and the depth and breadth of cultural complexity that has developed in the area, this chapter must necessarily be limited in scope. Current conceptions of the prehistoric cultural chronology of Northcentral Texas, particularly within the upper Trinity River basin (Table 2), are largely based on four major reports by Peter and McGregor (1988), Prikryl (1987, 1990), and Yates and Ferring (1986). References are provided to supplement the information summarized here. Table 2 Generalized Prehistoric Cultural Sequence for Northcentral Texas* Period Date Ranges (B.C. /A.D.)

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY The following brief discussion of the prehistoric archeological record in Northcentral Texas and the upper Trinity River basin is based largely on previous works by Peter and McGregor (1988), Prikryl (1987, 1990), and Yates and Ferring (1986). As noted by Peter and McGregor (1988:27– 29), many of the excavation efforts within the upper Trinity River basin have focused on reservoir development, especially along the Elm Fork (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Skinner and Baird 1985; Skinner et al. 1982a, 1982b) and the East Fork (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Although the chronological framework for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed, the available data allow a generalized prehistoric cultural chronology (see Table 2). Paleoindian Period The Paleoindian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or stratigraphically mixed contexts (Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995). Projectile point types found in Northcentral Texas that can be associated with the early to late parts of the Paleoindian period include Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Plainview, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff. Clovis and Plainview style projectile points, temporally and culturally diagnostic artifacts of the Paleoindian period, have been recovered along both Denton and Clear creeks in the Cross Timbers. Based on a sample of projectile points from surface sites, Prikryl (1990) has concluded that among the most common Paleoindian point types in Northcentral Texas are Plainview and Dalton. Ferring and Yates (1997) suggest that these types date to approximately 10,000–12,000 years before present (B.P.), based on cross dating with other regions. The suggested age for these types may correspond with the onset of early Holocene alluviation in the local river valleys, including the Trinity and Sabine River basins. The majority of the recorded Paleoindian sites cluster in the upper Trinity River drainage, where the most intensive archeological investigations have taken place, although these sites often consist of no more than one or two projectile points. The generally low density of Paleoindian artifacts and sites and the tendency for projectile points to be made from nonlocal lithics have led investigators to characterize these populations as highly mobile, with low regional densities (Lynott 1981:100–101). The Field Ranch site (41CO10), along the upper Elm Fork Trinity River, is a prime example of typical site contexts (Jensen 1968). Interestingly, the only two investigated sites in Northcentral Texas with apparently discrete Paleoindian components, the Lewisville Lake (41DN72) and Aubrey (41DN479) sites, indicate occupation early in the Paleoindian period, both producing Clovis projectile points. The Lewisville Lake site contained 27 hearth features with an associated Clovis point and other sparse lithics (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958; Story 1990:182–184). Although the original radiocarbon dates on the hearths suggested an anomalously early age for Clovis points (ca. 37,000 years B.P.; Crook and Harris 1956), later work by the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford 1981) appears to have resolved the controversy concerning the date of the occupation there. Apparently, the presence of naturally occurring lignite in these hearths, either as 14

a fuel or as an inadvertent inclusion, contaminated the radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually accepted age of 10,000–12,000 years B.P. (ca. 8000 B.C. to 10,000 B.C.) for Clovis period occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human inhabitants of Northcentral Texas. The deeply buried Aubrey site, located on the Elm Fork Trinity River north of Dallas, yielded lithic debitage and Clovis points buried beneath 8 m (26 ft) of Holocene alluvium on the Elm Fork Trinity River floodplain (Ferring 1989, 2001). The discovery of this site suggests that well-preserved Paleoindian sites in Northcentral Texas will only be found by examining deeply stratified Holocene alluvium in modern floodplain situations. Knowledge about the settlement-subsistence strategies used by the early occupants of the Northcentral Texas region is extremely limited. However, recent excavation at the Aubrey site has indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on big game animals alone; rather, the entire range of prairie and forest species was used (Ferring 2001). The preponderance of small game at the Aubrey site could be interpreted as representing a more generalized pattern of foraging than the reliance on mammoth and bison apparently demonstrated at other Clovis sites on the Southern Plains (Hofman 1989a:31–32). Such a divergence in subsistence patterns may reflect an inherent adaptability of Paleoindian technology to changing environmental conditions encountered as early populations spread southeastward into Texas (Ferring and Yates 1997). Whether this pattern of a more generalized foraging subsistence system is characteristic of Paleoindian adaptations in the Eastern Woodlands and the focus on now extinct, big game species is more characteristic of a Plains adaptation remains to be documented. There are no excavated and reported Paleoindian stratified components on the central Blackland Prairie itself. Nonetheless, a variety of early points has been found, largely in surface contexts, and it is clear that this part of Texas was used throughout the period from ca. 9,500 to 7,000 B.C. Presumably, this use was by hunter-gatherer groups with low population densities and high residential mobility. Archaic Period For Northcentral Texas, the Archaic period is tentatively dated between ca. 7000 B.C. and A.D. 700, with segments of approximately 2,500 years often considered as early, middle, and late divisions of the period (Prikryl 1993:199). Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from 7000 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to 2000 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 2000 B.C. to A.D. 700. Relatively recent overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of Texas include Hofman (1989a), Prikryl (1990), and Story (1985, 1990). Knowledge concerning the Archaic period in the upper Trinity River drainage is limited by the lack of data from major excavations. This is particularly true for the Early and Middle Archaic periods. Mixing of components also has hampered interpretations regarding downstream Trinity River use by prehistoric peoples during the lengthy Archaic period. Because few isolable Archaic components have been excavated, a comprehensive understanding of artifact chronologies, subsistence practices, or settlement strategies is lacking. 15

Previous investigations along the West Fork Trinity River (Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986) indicate that primary contexts for Early and Middle Archaic sites will be found deeply buried within floodplain alluvium. Diagnostic artifacts for the period are similar to those of adjacent regions, although developing a sound chronological sequence of diagnostic tool types has proven difficult because many of the investigations have focused on terrace surface manifestations where early artifacts are frequently mixed with later materials. Prikryl (1990) suggests that Early Archaic projectile points include early split-stemmed varieties and possibly Angostura, and Middle Archaic points include basal-notched forms such as Andice, Bell, and Calf Creek along with Bulverde, Carrollton, Dawson, and Wells. Some of this mixing and the generally low numbers of Early and Middle Archaic sites may be due to extensive erosion of mid-Holocene deposits, as has been documented for the Brazos River drainage west of the Dallas area in Young, Stephens, and Throckmorton counties (Ensor et al. 1992). The relatively intensive work at Richland-Chambers Reservoir suggests a similar conclusion for the western edge of the Oak Woodlands at the eastern margin of the Blackland Prairie, although it has been noted that data pertaining to the Early to Middle Archaic may be scarce in part because sites dating to this interval lie deeply buried or were removed by extensive erosion during the mid-Holocene (Fields 1995; McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Late Archaic point types reportedly include Castroville, Dallas, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, Gary, Godley, Marshall, Palmillas, Trinity, and Yarbrough (Prikryl 1990). At one time, the Carrollton and Elam foci were used to define the Middle and Late Archaic, respectively (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954). The initial treatment of the Archaic period (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the Carrollton and Elam foci, was based upon materials from such terrace contexts. Reevaluation of the type-site artifacts, however, showed that the materials were so mixed that perpetuation of these foci provides little interpretive value (Hofman 1989a; Prikryl 1990). Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer recognized acceptable to describe Northcentral Texas prehistoric chronology (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987; Yates and Ferring 1986). Though few isolable components have been analyzed for the various divisions of the Archaic period in Northcentral Texas, slowly increasing populations responding to warmer and drier environmental conditions have been postulated to explain the overall archeological record of the period (Lynott 1981; Story 1990). It is thought that these factors may have led Archaic populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of Northcentral Texas to develop a diversified hunting and gathering pattern based on bottomland resources of the rivers and major creeks, whereas populations on the Rolling Plains maintained a focus on bison hunting (Hofman 1989a). Projectile points of the period were fashioned from local lithic materials (typically quartzite), suggesting that populations were less mobile than were their Paleoindian predecessors. Less mobility also may suggest refinement of the diversified subsistence pattern to include scheduling of resource use within more restricted areas and repeated seasonal site occupation. Conversely, archeological sites dating to the Late Archaic period are relatively common across the Blackland Prairie. The Late Archaic represents the earliest time for which much is known about indigenous prehistoric lifeways. Both the Pecan Springs (41EL11) at Bardwell Reservoir and the Strawn Creek site (41NV6) at Navarro Mills Reservoir yielded Late Archaic point types such as 16

Gary, Dawson, and Yarbrough, although they tended to be mixed with materials from later occupations (Duffield 1963; Sorrow et al. 1966). The surface collections analyzed during the Superconducting Super Collider project also contained these types, as well as a number of Late Archaic types common in Central Texas—such as Bulverde, Darl, Ensor, Marcos, Marshall, Montell, and Pedernales—and a variety of probable Late Archaic forms more characteristic of the northern and eastern parts of the state such as Carrollton, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, and Kent (Yedlowski et al. 1998). Noting the relatively high frequency of Late Archaic projectile points, Yedlowski et al. (1998) suggest an increased regional use by hunter-gatherers as a result of increasingly moist climatic conditions, presumably associated with greater productivity in subsistence resources. They also note that, although the projectile point evidence indicates interaction with groups living in Central Texas proper, larger proportions of points indicate affinities with eastern Texas than during the Early and Middle Archaic periods. Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and at Ray Roberts Lake (Ferring and Yates 1997) indicate that the Late Archaic period is characterized by assemblages left by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a locality for a limited time and then moved to another locality, supporting a resource-scheduling hypothesis. Deer and numerous small mammals were the primary food resources. Despite refinement of resource utilization, evidence of dietary stress has been found on Late Archaic human skeletal materials (Ferring and Yates 1997; Gill-King 1987). Brown and his colleagues (1987:44-22–44-26) present similar conclusions concerning an increase in occupational intensity and increased interaction for those project areas at the eastern edge of the region (i.e., Cedar Creek Reservoir in southeastern Kaufman County and Richland-Chambers Reservoir in southeastern Navarro County). Two of the three excavated sites at Cedar Creek Reservoir have strong Late Archaic components represented by numerous Gary points and a variety of other lithic tools (Story 1965), and at least 15 sites at Richland-Chambers Reservoir have identifiable components of this age. In addition to assemblages of projectile point styles (e.g., Dawson, Gary, Godley, Kent, and Yarbrough) that indicate ties more to the north and east than to the south and west, each of these areas has yielded information suggesting that ceramics may have been introduced into the material culture of local groups during the latest part of the Late Archaic, as they were across most of Texas to the east (where this interval usually is termed the Early Ceramic or Woodland period). At Cedar Creek Reservoir, distributional data from the Lacy (41HE70) and Gossett Bottom (41KF7) sites suggest that the initial use of ceramic containers preceded introduction of the bow and arrow, although it is difficult to be certain because the sites were not well stratified and the ceramics could not be related to known early types such as Williams Plain (Story 1965). The most complete picture of the archeology of the Late Archaic for this region comes from the Oak Woodlands at the eastern margin of the Blackland Prairie. Along Richland and Chambers creeks, Late Archaic groups appear to have been hunter-gatherers whose subsistence pursuits focused on wild plant foods such as hickory nuts and prairie turnips, and faunal taxa such as deer, turtles, small mammals, birds, and fish (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Although presumably not sedentary, these groups clearly used 17

the area in an intensive fashion for residential purposes, and it appears that populations increased while territory sizes decreased. At Richland-Chambers Reservoir, distinctive shell-tempered sherds were recovered from contexts dated between A.D. 200 and 700 at the Adams Ranch site (41NV177; Bruseth and Martin 1987), apparently representing the earliest ceramic industry in the upper Trinity River basin. The presence of large anthropogenic basins or depressions, often measuring approximately 16 m (52.5 ft) in diameter and 0.6 m (0.2 ft) in depth, associated with Late Archaic period sites suggests that important sociopolitical changes may have been occurring during this time period. These features were first identified at a series of sites along the East Fork of the Trinity River and were considered an important trait of the Wylie focus (Harris and Suhm 1963; Stephenson 1952; Wilson 1946). These were large, circular features that appear to have been used for communal processing of vegetal resources (and later as cemeteries), perhaps in the context of band aggregation in “tension zones” as territories decreased in size (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Radiocarbon assays from pits at the Upper Rockwall (41RW2) and Sister Grove Creek (41COL36) sites in the Lavon Lake area suggest that the pits and the Wylie focus were associated with the Late Prehistoric period (Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Lynott (1977) widened the temporal span by incorporating a Late Archaic phase into the focus definition. Subsequent work on “Wylie pit” features at Richland- Chambers Reservoir to the south confirmed their Late Archaic age (Bruseth and Martin 1987). Nonetheless, the wide range of associated artifact types and the long temporal span represented by the pits made it clear that the Wylie focus was not a useful construct. Bruseth and Martin (1987), while discarding the focus as unusable, further supported Lynott’s (1975) original interpretation of the pits as being associated with large-scale food processing. Their interpretation equates the pits to the burned rock middens of Central Texas, with both representing group aggregations. Late Prehistoric Period The Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 700–1600) is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points in the archeological record of Northcentral Texas. The A.D. 700 date for the beginning of this period is based upon dated contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage to the west. Group aggregation and large-scale manipulation of subsistence resources, as represented by the Wylie pit features and the human burials they contain, may be indicative of societal changes that continued through the Late Prehistoric period. Habitation structures indicating increased sedentism, at least in certain places and at certain times, have been found in some Late Prehistoric sites, along with cultigens such as corn, and arrow points and ceramics indicating important technological changes. Also, there may be evidence (e.g., the distinction between burials placed inside and outside Wylie pits) of differential mortuary practices that could reflect a shift toward a hierarchical social structure, although this evidence is not nearly as strong as that for the Caddo area of northeast Texas. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period be divided into an early and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of the foraging subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting Southern 18

Plains influences. Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). Prikryl’s (1990, 1993) Late Prehistoric I period (A.D. 700–1200) is marked by the Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Scallorn, and Steiner arrow point types. Ceramic vessels are mostly grog-tempered and undecorated, but some evidence indicates influences from other regions in some locally manufactured wares displaying designs similar to those associated with East Texas Caddo ceramic types. Evidence for corn and structures has been found at sites at Joe Pool Lake in western Dallas County as well as to the north at Hubert Moss Lake near the Red River (Lorrain 1969; Martin 1994; Peter and McGregor 1988). Farther west, cultural changes also were taking place on the Rolling Plains, though this area adhered to its Archaic lifestyle even after technological innovations such as the bow and arrow were accepted (Lynott 1981). As a result of intensive excavations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake, Peter and McGregor (1988) proposed a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba arrow points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late twelfth or early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive Caddo occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred, in at least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time. Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive change separate from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; however, analysis of a Native American burial salvaged along Spring Creek (site 41DL373) in northeastern Dallas County also suggests maize consumption. Radiocarbon dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155 and 1275, while a carbon isotope ratio of -17.7 ‰ suggests that, although maize was consumed, it did not form a major part of the diet (Peter and Clow 2000). These indications of maize consumption contrast with a small grouping of disturbed human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369), also in Dallas County. This site, located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork Trinity River), yielded remains of at least four individuals dated by radiocarbon dating of bone collagen to approximately A.D. 1035. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although shell beads and a shell gorget were present, and a carbon isotope ratio of -21.6 ‰ suggests that the group’s diet was not high in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Given the slightly earlier date of the Harbor Pointe burials compared to Cobb-Pool and 41DL373, it is possible that maize agriculture was introduced to the region ca. A.D. 1200; conversely, this same evidence may indicate that Late Prehistoric groups in Northcentral Texas practiced divergent subsistence patterns. Concerning the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates (1997:305) summarize the results of that research as follows: Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic sites which lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only ones in the project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500–650 yr. B.P. No evidence of horticulture was recovered, and the [Late Prehistoric II] fauna indicate a foraging strategy that 19

emphasized deer procurement and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation of chert raw materials was about as frequent as in the [Late Archaic], and long-distance raw material acquisition (e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated by locally produced shell-tempered wares, which by this time were being produced in the Southern Plains region generally. As recorded by previous synthesis (Story 1990) little if any interaction with the Caddoan area is indicated. Thus, the Ray Roberts prehistoric data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of the [Late Prehistoric] period largely independent of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands. More recently, McGregor (personal communication 1999) has argued strongly for a “middle subperiod” of the Late Prehistoric that he dates between A.D. 1000 and 1350. He believes that arrow points with straight or rectangular stems are most diagnostic of this period and identifies three sites or site areas with relatively isolable (or minimally mixed) components of this middle subperiod— the Cobb-Pool site, Area B at the McDonald site (41HI105) on Hackberry Creek within the middle Brazos River drainage, and Area F at the Haley’s Point site (34MA15) on the Red River in Oklahoma (Brown et al. 1987; Peter and McGregor 1988; Rohn 1998). McGregor also notes that maize is common at Haley’s Point, as it is at Cobb-Pool, and suggests that these sites are representative of a relatively short-lived, region-wide subsistence pattern involving a partial dependence on agriculture during this middle subperiod (McGregor, personal communication 1999). Sites dating to the Late Prehistoric period broadly defined, in other words after ca. A.D. 700, are also common downstream on the Trinity area of the Blackland Prairie. The collections studied during the Superconducting Super Collider project contain substantial numbers of both early (e.g., Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Colbert, Scallorn, and Steiner) and late (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz) arrow points, but Yedlowski et al. (1998) note that early arrow points are more frequent, perhaps reflecting high population densities continuing from the Late Archaic period. Other than the Perdiz and Scallorn types, which have such widespread distributions, the arrow styles point to the east and north. The limited ceramic samples, containing sherds reminiscent of types such as Weches Fingernail Impressed, Killough Pinched, Maydelle Incised, and Poynor Engraved, also support interaction with Caddo groups to the east (Yedlowski et al. 1998). The Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills Reservoir presents a similar scenario, with most of the typed arrow points dating to the first half of the Late Prehistoric period and the more distinctive ceramics in the small collection relating to the early Caddo types, Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Weches Fingernail Impressed (Duffield 1963). The Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir also yielded numerous early arrow points, as well as a respectable number of Perdiz points, along with a small collection of highly fragmented ceramics (Sorrow et al. 1966). Three sites excavated at Cedar Creek Reservoir contained Late Prehistoric components, although materials of this age were common only at the Gossett Bottom and Lacy sites (Story 1965). Early arrow point forms (e.g., Alba, Catahoula, Friley, Granbury, Scallorn, and Steiner) are better represented than late ones (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz), but not in significant amounts. Not surprisingly, ceramics are more frequent in this area than to the west and clearly are related to the Caddo tradition to the east and northeast; some of the more distinctive decorated sherds were 20

considered reminiscent of types such as Canton Incised, Killough Pinched, and Ripley or Wilder Engraved (Story 1965). The faunal remains, many of which probably relate to Late Prehistoric occupations, from the Gossett Bottom and Lacy sites consist predominantly of deer, turtle, and small mammals, with bison occurring only in small numbers. Based on the feature evidence (or lack thereof), it appears that this part of the Trinity River basin was occupied by mobile hunter- gatherers rather than sedentary groups during the Late Prehistoric period. Some of the best data concerning Native American use of the region during the Late Prehistoric period is from Richland-Chambers Reservoir. Sites dating to this interval are common at the reservoir, especially for the early half of the period, and it appears that there was a significant decline in population densities after about A.D. 1300 (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). The data suggest that most of the excavated sites with Late Prehistoric components were used for residential purposes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987), although there are some sites, for example the stream-side concentrations of mussel shells and artifacts at 41FT193 and 41NV139, that probably were used in a more limited fashion as resource extraction camps. The structural patterns at the Bird Point Island site indicate intensive use by sedentary hunter-gatherers during the early Late Prehistoric period. Conversely, investigations of other generally contemporaneous components at nearby sites (e.g., Bird Point Island, Adams Ranch, Irvine [41NV182], and Little Cedar Creek [41NV173]) have yielded middens and numerous features suggesting intensive use but lack house structures, possibly indicating seasonal occupation of these sites. Macrobotanical remains primarily point to the use of wild plant foods such as hardwood nuts, a variety of seeds, and tubers/rhizomes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). The only tropical cultigen is maize, and it occurs in very small quantities and only in contexts dating to the last half of the period. Hence, groups who lived in this area were predominantly hunters and gatherers. The arrow points that characterize the early (Alba, Scallorn, and Steiner) and late (Perdiz and Cliffton) parts of the period are the same styles found elsewhere across the area, and it appears that Gary dart points may have continued to be used through the early Late Prehistoric (McGregor and Bruseth 1987:183). Ceramics are moderately common and clearly relate to Caddo wares, with most of the identified types (e.g., Maydelle Incised, Poynor Engraved, and Weches Fingernail Impressed) indicating contact with groups in the Neches River drainage, east of the Trinity River. During the Late Prehistoric II period (A.D. 1200–1600), influences from the Southern Plains became pronounced in the Cross Timbers and prairie areas. These influences coincided with an increase in bison herd size in Northcentral Texas (Lynott 1981; Prikryl 1990). Bison were important to subsistence, but shrinking procurement territory sizes due to population increases continued the trend toward horticulture and settled village life (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). In terms of technology, a Plains Indian tool assemblage was common (Prikryl 1990). Items associated with this assemblage include calcareous-tempered ceramic vessels, some of which fit the description for the type Nocona Plain (shell-tempered), and triangular arrow points such as Fresno, Harrell, Maud, Perdiz, and Washita points. Tools specific to bison processing include snub- nosed or thumbnail scrapers and edge-beveled Harahey knives. Bison scapula hoes, which also are 21

common in Plains Indian sites, have been recovered from sites in the Lewisville Lake and Lavon Lake areas of Denton and Collin counties (Barber 1969; Harris 1945). The Plains Indian influences associated with settled village life were used to define the now outmoded Henrietta complex of Northcentral Texas. This complex, based on Krieger’s (1946) more expansive Henrietta focus, extends from the Red River south along the headwaters of the Trinity and Brazos rivers. The type-site, M. D. Harrell (41YN1), is located along the Brazos River in Young County just northwest of Palo Pinto County in the drainage basin now inundated by Possum Kingdom Reservoir (Krieger 1946). The Harrell site and other associated sites contain middens, house structures, rock hearths, storage pits, and burials, and they most often are located on sandy knolls or terraces overlooking river valleys (Brooks 1989; Forrester 1994). Excavated sites attributed to the Henrietta complex include the Glass (41MU24) and Coyote (41MU28) sites located on the Red River in Montague County (Lorrain 1967; Woodall 1967), and it is clear that sites such as Dillard (41CO174) in Cooke County are related as well (Martin 1994). The Henrietta complex as an investigative tool can be limiting since its loose definition tends to obscure local differences. More recent investigations in the upper Trinity River drainage have tended to highlight the local differences. At Ray Roberts Lake, for instance, Ferring and Yates (1997) see local trends emerging independent of extraregional influences. They cite the lack of evidence for extensive maize horticulture and the preponderance of short-term logistical camps as the basis of their hypothesis. Similarly, Peter and McGregor (1988) demonstrated that occupation of the Mountain Creek drainage was less intensive in the Late Prehistoric II period than before and evidence of the practice of maize horticulture is limited. The adaptation developing in Northcentral Texas after A.D. 1200 was truly distinctive from the Plains adaptations revealed to the northwest in Foard County (Peter et al. 1997). Protohistoric/Historic Native American Period The cultural divergences between Northcentral and Northeast Texas that began in the Archaic period continued into the Protohistoric and historic periods. The sporadic nature and uncertain extent of early European contact with indigenous groups in Northcentral Texas, coupled with disparities in knowledge about these groups themselves late in prehistory, make it difficult to precisely determine the temporal boundary between the Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic periods. Various sociological factors, primarily the colonization of New Mexico by the Spanish, caused drastic changes in the cultural makeup of Northcentral Texas, as groups from elsewhere migrated into the area and existing groups were forced to adapt to their presence. Meanwhile, Caddo groups continued to dominate the northeastern portion of the region, although significant changes were also occurring there. For purposes of this synopsis, the Protohistoric period begins in 1542 with the first contact between Native Americans and the Spanish in the region. Although contact between Spanish and Native American groups during at least the early portion of the Protohistoric period was indirect and intermittent, European exploration, trading, and settlement 22

affected various indigenous groups in a variety of ways. Unfortunately, historical documentation and archeological evidence are very sparse for the Protohistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin. After 1598, however, Spanish influence was never absent from the Southern Plains. Although actual native contact with Europeans continued to be limited, only brief records of Spanish journeys into or through the North Texas area exist (Hofman 1989b; John 1975). Although European trade items (Sollberger 1953) appear on a limited number of sites, no Protohistoric site has been thoroughly investigated and characterizations of the Native American adaptations during this time period are conjectural at best. Tonkawa, Wichita, Caddo, and Comanche all are likely to have traversed the area. The manner in which many Native American populations responded to contact with the Spanish and their cultural trajectory following this contact is not precisely known, and the exact locations of their sites and detailed ethnohistoric data are almost nonexistent. By the eighteenth century, immigrant Plains Indian groups had moved into and beyond North Texas, and their documentation by traders and explorers marks the beginning of the historic period (Prikryl 1993). Unfortunately, because reliable historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River basin during the early historic period, it is not clear which specific aboriginal groups were residing in the present-day region at the beginning of this period. Clearly, the early native historic era in North Texas was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and amalgamation (see Newcomb 1993). Documentary sources suggest that the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai, Yojaune, Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo traversed the region at various times during the period (Campbell 1983; Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell 1982). At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern Plains became commonplace. This was the result of increasingly peaceful relations between the Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the north and the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory by the United States in 1803. HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1542–1950) The Historic period in the Northcentral Texas region is characterized by early Spanish and French influences in the area. The region was also part of the Texas Republic before becoming a part of the United States of America. This historical sequence resulted in the broad-scale displacement and assimilation of the indigenous groups in the region. The following is a brief discussion of Northcentral Texas during the Historic period (Table 3). 23

Table 3 Historic Chronological Framework for Northcentral Texas Historic Period Time Periods Spanish Exploration A.D. 1542–1758 French Exploration A.D 1700–1763 Texas Republic A.D. 1836–1845 American A.D. 1845–present The first presence of Europeans in Northcentral Texas may have occurred in 1542 when the remnants of the de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered the area in an effort to find a land route to New Spain. Some researchers believe that the expedition crossed Northcentral Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990:61), although others place the route much farther to the east and south (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Chipman 1992; Hudson 1986; Schambach 1989; Weber 1992). A consistent European presence in the region did not occur until the early 1700s, when French traders from Louisiana began to move west along the Red River. The Spanish considered this French incursion to be a threat to the security of New Spain, and they responded by redoubling efforts to counterbalance the French influence with the Native Americans in East and Northcentral Texas. These efforts continued until 1763, when France ceded Louisiana to Spain under the Treaty of Paris. This reduced the perceived threat to the security of New Spain and resulted in a reduction in Spanish investment in eastern and northern Texas. More important from the Native American viewpoint was the severe military defeat inflicted on the Spanish by the Wichita and allied tribes at Spanish Fort on the Red River in 1758. It has been argued that this defeat put an end to Spanish military and missionary expansion to the north (Weddle 1964, 1965). The first European Americans to colonize the region settled along the Trinity River and its tributaries as the frontier grew westward. The area remained largely unsettled until 1841 when people, primarily from the upper southern states, were drawn by a land grant known as the Peters Colony. William S. Peters and the Texas Emigration and Land Company obtained the first land contract in 1841 to populate the newly formed Republic of Texas. Over time, the Texas Emigration and Land Company acquired three additional land contracts, encompassing most of Northcentral Texas. Texas was annexed by the United States in 1846, and the First Legislature of Texas established Dallas County that year. The county was probably named for George Mifflin Dallas, vice president of the United States under James K. Polk. Though the fertile Blackland Prairie soils attracted settlers, prior to the 1870s poor transportation, limited markets, and lack of mechanized farm equipment prevented the large-scale plantation agriculture characteristic of many parts of the South, and most settlers at this time were subsistence farmers living near reliable water and timber supplies along major steams. Because of the difference in economies, slavery was not a major institution in Dallas County. Despite the county’s relatively low reliance on slavery, residents of the county voted overwhelmingly for secession in 24

1861 (Maxwell 2010). Although the fighting never reached Northcentral Texas, the Civil War still inflicted hardships on the region. Because most able-bodied men were away fighting for the Confederacy, most small towns and villages were left unprotected, and the region gradually became impoverished when food and other commodities became expensive and difficult to obtain throughout the course of the war (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958; Works Projects Administration [WPA] 1992:55–58). The region suffered economically in the aftermath of the Civil War; however, it was not as badly affected as other areas of the former Confederacy. This greater economic vitality was fueled in part by streams of immigrants from the rest of the country, who were hoping to make a fresh start in the as yet unsettled West. Other elements in the economy included the nearby presence of one of the cattle trails to Kansas as well as the role of the city of Dallas as a center for the buffalo hide market (WPA 1992:60–70). The establishment of railroads in Dallas County by the 1870s resulted in the continued expansion of the county’s large-scale crop production. 25

CHAPTER 4 PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODS This cultural resources survey was designed to identify prehistoric and historic archeological remains and architectural resources located within the proposed project area and to provide BRW Architects, Inc., and the city of Dallas with information necessary to address the potential for adverse effects on those cultural resources by the proposed project. This investigation consisted of background and archival research, visual reconnaissance and intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed project area, and controlled excavations within the portion of prehistoric archeological site 41DL72. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS NEAR THE PROJECT AREA The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online database of the THC was consulted, and background research was conducted to determine previous cultural resources survey efforts as well as the locations of previously recorded historic or archeological resources in the immediate vicinity of the project area. Seven previous archeological and cultural resources management surveys have been conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area (Figure 3). As a result of these surveys, 14 cultural resources sites have been identified within the 1.6-km search area surrounding the project area (Table 4). In the 1940s, R. King Harris and Forrest Kirkland investigated numerous prehistoric archeological sites in the Dallas area, including sites 41DL72, 41DL73, 41DL74, 41DL84, 41DL100, 41DL103, and 41DL104 within and near the proposed project area. Unfortunately, many of these sites have likely been destroyed by continuing urban development in the years since their discovery. Sites 41DL72 and 41DL73 were previously recorded within the current project area and were revisited during this survey effort. In 1981, Environment Consultants, Inc., conducted a survey for the Dallas Floodway Extension project (Bennett et al. 1981) that encompassed the project area. Twenty-two 27

Floodwater erosion of site 41DL350, located near Lemmon Lake approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) southwest of the current project area, revealed the potential for the presence of prehistoric burials within archeological sites of the Elm Fork floodplain (Dalbey 2003). In 2006 a cultural resources survey was conducted immediately north of the current project area (Naumann et al. 2013). The northern portion of previously recorded archeological site 41DL72 was revisited during that survey effort and the northern boundary of the site was more thoroughly delimited. Results of that survey suggested that the site extended south into the current project area. In 2010, a cultural resources survey was conducted for Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the city of Dallas for the Trinity Forest Trails; however, no cultural resources were documented by that survey (Turner-Pearson and Neel 2010). The most recent cultural resources survey in the vicinity was conducted immediately south of the proposed project area in August 2014 for several Trinity Watershed Management projects (Goodmaster 2015). As a result of that survey, previously recorded sites 41DL204 and 41DL208 were revisited and site 41DL520 was documented. 29

METHODS Archival Methods Information regarding previously recorded archeological sites was gathered through a review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online database maintained by the THC and by a thorough literature review. Prior to field investigations at the proposed project area, a suite of archival sources including historic maps and aerial photographs was reviewed to determine former land use patterns and the locations of historic-age structures within the project area. In addition, deed/title research was conducted to trace twentieth-century ownership of the property. Architectural Survey Methods An architectural historian conducted a reconnaissance survey of non-archeological historic-age resources within the proposed APE during the 2007 survey. Each resource was documented with a minimum of two photographs, one façade view and one oblique view, when possible. On-site documentation noted the current condition, materials, alterations, and other features for evaluating significance and integrity of each historic-age resource. Due to the delay between initiation of the survey in 2007 and its completion, an architectural historian reviewed the recorded architectural resources and updated building descriptions as necessary in 2013. Archeological Survey Methods This cultural resources survey was conducted on property owned by the city of Dallas. Due to the degree of prior ground-disturbing activities in the proposed project area, a survey strategy consisting of visual surface reconnaissance and systematic auger and shovel testing was employed. Visual surface reconnaissance was conducted throughout the entire project area, with shovel testing performed in well-drained areas that had not been previously subjected to sand and gravel quarrying operations. In accordance with CTA guidelines, as approved by the THC, systematic auger and shovel testing was conducted across the majority of the proposed project area in intervals not greater than 100 m (328 ft). A mechanical auger attached to a skid loader was used to excavate auger tests in 40-cm (15.8-in) levels, with the excavated soil passed through 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh screen to facilitate the recovery of artifacts. Shovel tests consisted of hand- excavated units 40 cm (15.8 in) in diameter excavated in 20-cm (7.9-in) levels, with the excavated soil passed through 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh screen to facilitate the recovery of artifacts. In total, 481 auger and shovel tests were excavated within the proposed project area. All auger and shovel tests were excavated on property owned by the city of Dallas. Auger tests were excavated to depths of 80 cm (31 in). Shovel tests were excavated to the Bt soil horizon or to a depth of 100 cm (39.4 in). Depths of the shovel tests were highly variable across the project area and generally 30

ranged from 40–100 cm below surface (cmbs; 15.8–39.4 in below surface [inbs]). The location of each auger and shovel test was recorded with submeter-accurate Trimble® GeoXT™ and GeoXH™ global positioning system (GPS) units, and the exposed soil profiles were documented. Each auger and shovel test was backfilled upon completion of the recording process. To more adequately evaluate the NRHP-eligibility of the potentially intact portion of site 41DL72, four controlled test units were placed along the axis of the terrace landform where artifact densities were observed to be the highest. The test units each measured 1 square meter (m2) and were hand- excavated in 10-cm levels. Excavated fill was passed through 0.63-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh to facilitate artifact recovery. ARTIFACT TREATMENT AND ANALYSIS All artifacts recovered in subsurface contexts and temporally or functionally diagnostic artifacts encountered in surface contexts were briefly examined, bagged, and labeled by provenience in the field. Upon arrival at the Versar Cultural Resources Laboratory facility in Plano, Texas, artifacts were inventoried, cleaned, analyzed, and catalogued. Each artifact was thoroughly examined in order to identify and determine, to the extent possible, its function or role and cultural or chronological affiliation within the identified contexts. Context and attribute data for all materials were recorded in a Microsoft® AccessTM database. The main categories of material recovered were historic period domestic artifacts, prehistoric chipped lithic artifacts, prehistoric ceramic artifacts, fire-cracked rock, faunal remains (animal bone and mollusk shells), burned or baked clay masses, and botanical samples. The following discussion describes analytical strategies and summarizes the attributes recorded during the analysis of each class of material. All artifacts and records generated by this cultural resources survey will be permanently curated at Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin. Prehistoric Artifact Analysis Lithic Analysis The goals of the lithic analysis were to provide information about site function, technology and production, lithic source procurement (exchange/interaction), and cultural affiliation based on the presence of diagnostic chipped stone tool types. In order to address these issues, lithic artifacts were initially separated into five classes: (1) chipped stone tools, (2) chipped stone debitage, (3) cores, (4) ground, pecked, and battered stone artifacts, and (5) unworked stone (fire-cracked or burned rock and manuports). Chipped lithic artifacts identified in the assemblage consisted of chipped stone tools, cores, and debitage. All tools were identified, when possible, to a type or style defined for the Northcentral Texas region. Standard variables (length, width, thickness, and raw material type) were recorded for each tool. A mass analysis strategy was employed in the analysis of the unmodified lithic 31

## Page 48

debitage. Mass analysis involves the separation of the debitage from each provenience into raw material categories (i.e., quartzite, silicified wood, chert). The debitage representing each raw material category from each provenience was divided into four size classes (>1 in, 0.99–0.5 in, 0.49–0.25 in, and > 0.24 in). The debitage within each size class was further subdivided into groups based on the percent of cortex retained on the dorsal surface, and each of these was further divided into subgroups based on the presence or absence of thermal alteration. Thermally altered or fire-cracked rock was sorted into classes based on material type (e.g., sandstone, limestone, quartzite), and the cumulative weight of fire-cracked rock fragments within each class from each archeological context was recorded. Prehistoric Ceramic Artifacts The ceramic artifact class includes any artifact of prehistoric origin that resulted from the burning, firing, or baking of earth or clay, either deliberately or accidentally. The major types of artifacts consist of ceramic vessel (pottery) fragments and burned clay (i.e., impressed clay/daub and unimpressed baked clay). Ceramic vessel fragments, or sherds, are the remains of fired clay vessels or containers (i.e., pots). Sherds are subdivided on the basis of where on the vessel they originate: rim, neck, shoulder, waist, body, base, support, or handle. The remaining analysis of the prehistoric ceramics involves the use of a technological/production model using variables relating to paste and temper, forming and shaping, surface finishing, firing, and style or form. Whenever possible, ceramic type and variety were identified. Burned or baked clay consists of irregular, gravel-sized masses of hardened clay or silty clay, many with evidence of oxidation and/or reduction due to fire. A basic analysis of these masses was performed; including separation by the presence or absence of plant impressions and recording the cumulative weight of burned clay masses within each class and within each context. Botanical Remains The few botanical remains recovered during this investigation consist of opportunistically collected wood charcoal encountered during excavation of the controlled excavation units at site 41DL72. Six ceramic sherds, also recovered within controlled excavation units at site 41DL72, were submitted to PaleoResearch Institute, Inc., for evaluation prior to selecting two specimens for phytolith and starch analysis in an effort to determine contents of the represented vessels. Phytoliths are silica bodies produced by plants when soluble silica in the ground water is absorbed by the roots and carried up to the plant via the vascular system. Evaporation and metabolism of this water result in precipitation of the silica in and around the cellular walls. Opal phytoliths, which are distinct and decay-resistant plant remains, are deposited in the soil as the plant or plant parts die and break down. They are, however, subject to mechanical breakage and erosion and deterioration in high pH soils. Phytoliths are usually introduced directly into the soils in which the plants decay. Transportation of phytoliths occurs primarily by animal consumption, gathering of plants by 32

humans, or by erosion or transportation of the soil by wind, water, or ice. Extraction of phytoliths and starch from ceramic sherd residue was based primarily on heavy liquid flotation and a phytolith diagram was produced for the analyzed samples. None of the six ceramics exhibited visible food residues. Faunal Remains An effort was made to identify bone fragments to the most specific taxonomic level possible. Bone specimens not bearing diagnostic features but similar in size and other formal characteristics were placed within specific size classes: small terrestrial mammal (STM), medium terrestrial mammal (MTM), large terrestrial mammal (LTM), and very large terrestrial mammal (VLTM). Assessments were also made of the following characteristics: bone element, size/weight of fragment, fusion state, rodent gnawing, burning/butchery evidence, and number of identifiable specimens (NISP). Measures of differential preservation (i.e., taphonomy) were carried out on the faunal assemblage as a whole in order to differentiate human and natural modifications to bone surfaces. Historic Artifact Analysis Historic period artifacts recovered during this survey were examined for particular attributes and diagnostic traits using morphological and/or functional classification systems developed by South (1977). Analysis of the recovered materials assigned artifacts to one of four primary categories— Activities, Architectural, Domestic (including Furnishings), and Personal. The Activities category includes nonhousehold items, transportation items, farm-related equipment, tools, and firearms. The Architectural category includes all items related to buildings such as brick, mortar, plaster, nails, window glass, and electrical items. The Domestic category designation is used for items related to food service (tableware) and food storage (including food preparation and tin cans); a Furnishings classification, a subcategory of the Domestic category, encompasses household items such as furniture, stove parts, and lamp glass. The Personal category generally contains items of individual use such as clothing, buttons, shoes, dolls, and smoking pipes. Those artifacts such as unidentifiable pieces of glass and metal that cannot be specifically placed in one of the above major functional categories are classified as Indeterminate. ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE DEFINITION An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural resources. The recognition of a “site” is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent. Content refers to artifacts recovered from surface or subsurface contexts, architectural features, or other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the vertical and horizontal spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. For surficial materials, a site is defined 33

## Page 50

as five or more artifacts of at least two different materials or functional classes or at least two cultural features located within the same vicinity (typically a 400-m2 [0.1-acre] area). The extent of the surface artifacts and cultural features are then defined as the site boundary. When artifacts are encountered in buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally positive excavations. In cases where auger or shovel tests yielded cultural materials, additional delineation shovel tests were excavated to define the site boundary. Shovel tests used to define and delineate archeological site boundaries were excavated in a 20-m-interval (66-ft) grid until two negative shovel tests were encountered in each grid direction. These shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm (3.9-in) levels to determine the vertical extent of subsurface artifacts. The spatial extent of a site is defined within the extent of culturally positive shovel tests plus a 10- m (33-ft) buffer. Sites may also be defined within the extent of surface artifacts or features and positive excavations, within the prescribed buffer, when both are present. Cultural remains meeting these criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted to the TARL to be included in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database. Depending on depositional integrity and cultural content, archeological sites can be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Conversely, discovery of cultural materials that do not meet these criteria are considered isolated occurrences of past human activity and are simply documented by location and content. Modern materials and features (i.e., less than 50 years old) are not considered sites, with only location and content documented. Cultural isolates and modern features are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP because of their failure to meet site definition and their inability to contribute important information. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA National Register of Historic Places The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and regulations. The criteria (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a–d]) for evaluating properties for inclusion in the National Register are codified under the authority of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Based on Advisory Council guidelines, any resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is a “historic property,” and based on federal regulations, “[t]he term ‘eligible for inclusion in the National Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR §800.2[e]). Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, the following four criteria for eligibility are applied: The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and 34

(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or (b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or (c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or (d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR Part 60.4(a–d)]. The principal research objective is to determine whether a cultural resources property possesses the potential to contribute to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Adequate information regarding site function, context, and chronological placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design, determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory and evaluation processes. Criterion D is generally associated with archeological sites, usually prehistoric but also historic-era. Criteria A, B, and C reflect association with historic-era resources, rarely with prehistoric sites. The objective of the current project was to locate and define both horizontally and vertically any cultural resources, document and describe those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility. State Antiquities Landmark For purposes of implementing the Antiquities Code of Texas, the THC is the statutorily created body responsible for protecting and preserving State Antiquities Landmarks under the Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191. A State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) is an archeological site, archeological collection, ruin, building, structure, cultural landscape, site, engineering feature, monument or other object, or district that is eligible to be designated as a landmark or is already officially designated as a landmark. The state of Texas considers all publicly owned archeological sites and historic buildings and structures to have some intrinsic historic value, and the Antiquities Code provides some level of protection for those sites, buildings, or structures regardless of their size, character, or ability to currently yield data that will contribute important information on the history or prehistory of Texas. Additionally, these publicly owned archeological sites and historic buildings and structures are protected from vandalism, or other actions meant to take, alter, or destroy them, and information directly related to the specific location of archeological sites is restricted from open records requests. However, not all cultural resources are equally significant to the history and prehistory of Texas. Some archeological sites may not possess research value sufficient to warrant long-term preservation or investigations beyond survey level recordation, and some historic buildings and structures retain minimal integrity due to damage or deterioration. Therefore, the issue of whether cultural resources are significant and warrant preservation, and/or further research (such as archeological testing and data recovery level investigations), is addressed through official landmark designation, permit issuance, and rules associated with enforcement of the Antiquities Code. Sections 191.091 and 191.092 of the Texas Natural Resources Code provide that archeological sites and historic buildings and structures on 35

## Page 52

lands belonging to state agencies or political subdivisions of the state of Texas are landmarks or may be eligible to be designated as landmarks. Also protected under the Texas Natural Resources Code (Section 191.094) are specially designated landmarks on private property [above information compiled from TAC, Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26, Subchapter A, Section 26.2]. Under the Texas Antiquities Code at the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or designated as an SAL. The commission uses one or more of the following criteria when assessing the appropriateness of official landmark designation, and/or the need for further investigations under the permit process: (1) the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information; (2) the site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site; (3) the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history; (4) the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; (5) there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively, further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site cannot be protected [13 TAC 26.10]. Buildings, structures, cultural landscapes, and non-archeological sites, objects, and districts may be designated as landmarks provided that the following conditions are met: (1) the property fits within at least one of the following criteria: (a) the property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic group; (b) the property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; (c) the property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic value, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinctions (d) the property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas culture or history; (2) the property retains integrity at the time of the nomination, as determined by the executive director of the commission; and (3) for buildings and structures only, the property must be listed in the National Register of Historic Places, either individually, or as a contributing property within a historic district as determined by the Keeper of the National Register or the executive director of the commission [13 TAC 26.19]. 36

CHAPTER 5 SURVEY RESULTS This chapter presents the results of the cultural resources survey and assesses the effects of the proposed Dallas Horse Park on prehistoric and historic archeological sites and historic architectural resources within the project area. Recommendations and management considerations based on the findings of this survey are presented in the following chapter. BACKGROUND AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH RESULTS Based on a review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online database maintained by the THC and a thorough literature review, the project area was determined to have a high probability of preserved prehistoric archeological sites. Although few significant prehistoric archeological sites are known to exist in the uplands of the Blackland Prairie, previously recorded sites are concentrated along upland escarpments adjacent to major drainages. Unfortunately, many previously recorded prehistoric sites tend to be ephemeral, with low artifact densities and diversities, and are often disturbed by modern land use practices. Numerous sites are known to occur along the Trinity River and its associated tributaries, including previously recorded sites 41DL72, 41DL73, 41DL204, 41DL205, 41DL206, 41DL207, and 41DL208 within and immediately adjacent to the proposed project area. The upland escarpment within the proposed project area was extensively quarried for sand and gravel, as evidenced on historic topographic maps and low altitude aerial photography. The ephemeral and intermittent drainages extending from the uplands to White Rock Creek have been severely eroded by quarrying and agricultural activities. Although the proposed project area is situated along an upland escarpment in proximity to a reliable water source, historic quarrying and agriculture are likely to have had an adverse effect on many of the prehistoric and historic sites that existed there. Prior to fieldwork, THC records were also reviewed for the presence of previously designated resources, including NRHP properties, SAL properties, National Historic Landmarks, Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, and Historic Texas Cemeteries, within or near the project area. In addition, a records search of the Dallas County Appraisal District was conducted, along with a review of various historic maps and aerial photographs. 37

Numerous cultural features have been present within the proposed project area, as depicted on various historic period maps and aerial photographs reviewed for this project. No structures, roads, or other cultural features are depicted within the project area on the 1893 United States Geological Survey (USGS) Dallas 30-minute (1:125,000-scale) topographic map; however, the scale of the map likely precludes the depiction of small features such as structures and unimproved roads. The 1900 Sam Street map of Dallas County indicates that two residences existed within the proposed project area. The residence of B. Ridde is depicted in the northeastern corner of the proposed project area adjacent to Pemberton Hill Road, and a tenant residence is depicted near the corner of Pemberton Hill Road and Elam Road. By 1920, in addition to the residence of B. Ridde in the northeastern corner of the project area, several structures are shown along Elam Road and two structures are evident in the westcentral portion of the project area based on the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 15-minute (1:63,500-scale) Dallas County soils map. The pre- 1900 residence of B. Ridde was probably demolished by 1922, based on its absence on the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) White Rock topographic map (Figure 4). It is also evident on this map that sand and gravel quarrying activities are likely to have begun in the area prior to the early 1920s. By the mid-twentieth century, sand and gravel quarrying operations had expanded to impact several areas of the property, particularly along the upland escarpment extending north-to-south across the western margin of the project area. These quarries, in addition to a complex of numerous structures in the northeastern portion of the project area, are recorded on a high-resolution 1952 USGS aerial photograph (Figure 5), the 1958 USGS Hutchins 7.5-minute (1:24,000-scale) topographic map, and the 1959 USGS Seagoville 15-minute (1:62,500-scale) topographic map. By the late-1960s, quarrying activities within the project area appear to have ceased, as recorded on a high-resolution 1968 USGS aerial photograph. Based on recent low- altitude aerial photography and high-resolution satellite imagery, late twentieth-century activities within the project area have included livestock operations that have repurposed the existing structures on the property and refuse disposal that resulted in several concentrations of building materials accumulated across the northern portions of the project area. 38

Deed title research revealed that John Beeman, an early settler of the Dallas area, was granted the original 320 acres of land encompassing the proposed project area in a patent (Number 678, Volume 3) by the State of Texas in 1850 (Dallas County Clerk [DCC] 1850:Deed Book [DB] B:401402). Mr. Beeman also secured nine additional surveys at various locations near the present city of Dallas during the same year; however, no further mention of the subject property could be found in the deed records of Dallas County until 1901, when W. S. Kirby entered into a deed of trust to purchase the southern portion of the Beeman Survey along with portions of the Elizabeth Crockett, Cornelius Cox, Isaac Elam, Patrick Lary, J. L. Hill, and J. A. Thomas surveys (DCC 1901: Deed of Trust [DT] 120:7888). By 1939, W. S. Kirby had filed for bankruptcy and the property was passed to the First National Bank of Dallas (DCC 1939:DT 2135:337339). During the bankruptcy proceedings in 1939, a tenant of Mr. Kirby’s, Ben H. Spross, provided an affidavit in which he mentions the original four-wire fence, three houses, and various wells and barns on the property, although the possible construction dates for the improvements were not mentioned (DCC 1939:DT 2135:333335). After Mr. Kirby’s bankruptcy, Wallace Jenkins purchased the property from the First National Bank of Dallas in 1939. Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins made a number of changes to the land, including conveying an easement to Dallas Power and Light Company in 1939 and another in 1950 (DCC 1939:DB 2157:148149; DCC 1950:DB 3253:471472). Although no further information was found concerning Mrs. Jenkins, Mr. Jenkins passed away in 1961. As trustee of the Wallace Jenkins estate, the Republic National Bank of Texas sold the property to J. D. Kennedy, Jack Miller, Houston Bus Hill, and George Aaron jointly in 1961 (DCC 1961:DB 5688:317322); however, in 1963, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hill, and Mr. Aaron conveyed their interests in the land to Mr. Miller in a deed of trust with the Republic National Bank of Texas acting as Trustee (DCC 1963:DT 128:15801585). Mr. Miller executed a deed to Dallas Power and Light Company for a 100 ft- wide strip of land for use as a utility corridor. The remainder of property was then sold to Trinity Industrial Properties by Mr. Miller in a deed of trust in 1964 (DCC 1964:DT 233:12851295). The Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund acted as Trustee for the transaction; however, Trinity Industrial Properties defaulted on its loan (DCC 1964:DT 495:722732) and in 1965, the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund, through their trustee Francis J. Murtha, sold the property to Metropolitan Sand and Gravel Company (DCC 1965:DB 613:22332243). In 1969, Metropolitan Sand and Gravel Company conveyed the property to Joe Simpkins, Morris A. Shenker, Farrell Kahn, Morris A. Shenker, Jr., and Morris A. Shenker, Trustee, although the mining company retained the right to utilize the land. Mr. Simpkins was also the president of the Metropolitan Sand and Gravel Company, and his share of the property amounted to a 450/1000 undivided interest. Morris A. Shenker was also granted a 450/1000 undivided interest, and Mr. Kahn was granted a 50/1000 undivided interest. Morris Shenker, Jr., and Morris Shenker, Trustee, were granted 33/1000 and 17/1000 undivided interests, respectively (DCC 1969:DB 613:22342243). Mr. Simpkins and his wife, Mildred M. Simpkins, retained joint ownership of 41

his share of the property until 1976, when Mrs. Simpkins passed away. Her share of the property was then transferred to her daughter, Linda M. Kahn. In 1984, Joe Simpkins, Linda M. Khan, Morris A. Shenker, Farrell Khan, Morris A. Shenker, Jr., and Morris A. Shenker, Trustee, released the city of Dallas from all its obligations under a 1967 Sanitary Landfill Agreement between the city of Dallas and all of the aforementioned interest holders (DCC 1984:DB 84119:13291335). Although the Sanitary Landfill Agreement specified a parcel of land immediately to the south of the proposed project area, the negation of the agreement shows that ownership of the entirety of the subject land was still carried by the grantees listed in the 1969 deed. No further transfers or deeds between 1984 and 1998 could be located; however, Linda S. Khan conveyed all rights to the property to Metropolitan Sand and Gravel Company in a 1998 quit claim deed (DCC 1998:DB 98253:19481959). It is assumed that the remaining grantees listed in the 1969 warranty deed conveyed their rights to the property to Ms. Kahn between 1984 and 1998. In 1999, the city of Dallas, at its own expense, demolished a substandard structure on the property for which Metropolitan Sand and Gravel Company failed or refused to reimburse the city. Therefore, a claim was made on the property by the city (DCC 1999:DB 99123:53085309) and Metropolitan Sand and Gravel Company eventually conveyed the property to the city of Dallas in 2008, according to the Dallas Central Appraisal District. ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESULTS Visual surface reconnaissance survey was systematically conducted over the entire project area. Surface visibility was highly variable throughout the project area and ranged from 0 to 100 percent, based on ground surface conditions. Systematic auger testing and shovel testing was conducted over the majority of the proposed project area, with the exception of low-lying, periodically inundated areas and the locations of twentieth-century gravel quarries (Figure 6). Based on this survey effort, four archeological sites previously recorded to exist within the proposed project area (41DL72, 41DL205, 41DL206, and 41DL207) were located and revisited; however, previously recorded site 41DL73 was not definitively relocated. One new archeological site (41DL508) was also documented during this survey. Additional shovel testing was conducted to more thoroughly define archeological site boundaries, and four controlled excavation units were distributed across a portion of site 41DL72 to determine NRHP- and SAL-eligibility of the site. In addition, several architectural resources (Resources 1a–j, Resources 2a–c, Resource 3, and Resource 4) were documented within the project area and evaluated. 42

Site 41DL72 Site 41DL72 is a previously recorded prehistoric occupation site with a single burial and a minor historic period component. The site is partially located within the northern portion of the proposed project area and extends onto the adjacent property parcel to the north. The site, initially recorded in 1940 by Forrest Kirkland, was described as an extensively used surface camp encompassing over 24 acres along the upland escarpment and centered on Big Spring, a large natural spring flowing from the toeslope of the White Rock Escarpment. Previously recorded cultural materials associated with the site include projectile points, blades, debitage, one ceramic vessel fragment, and one human burial. At the time of the initial site recording, these artifacts were in the possession of local collectors and the disposition of the human burial was unknown. The portion of site 41DL72 extending onto the property north of the proposed project area was revisited during a cultural resources survey in 2006 for the city of Dallas (Naumann et al. 2013). The 2006 survey documented several localized areas of intact soils containing prehistoric cultural material surrounded by disturbed soils (Naumann et al. 2013:50–59). In addition, artifacts were observed within the electric transmission line corridor extending east-to-west between the two property parcels. Based on those results, the present boundary of the north portion of the site was more accurately defined. 41DL72 Survey Results During the current survey, the southern portion of site 41DL72 within the proposed project area was revisited and a preliminary assessment of the site for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as an SAL was conducted. Initially, forty-two shovel tests (Shovel tests [STs] 1034–1071 and 1101– 1102) were systematically excavated to define the southern portion of the site within the proposed project area (Figure 7). Twenty-one positive shovel tests were initially encountered along the escarpment of the landform, immediately east of a former sand and gravel quarry location noted during the 2007 survey (Figure 8). Surface artifacts were observed within eroded areas along the electric transmission line corridor and within a two-track road that extends southwest of the site. The southern portion of site 41DL72, within the proposed project area, encompasses 3.1 acres and measures approximately 180 m (590 ft) north-to-south by 60 m (197 ft) east-to-west at an elevation range of 130–132 m (427–433 ft) amsl (Figure 9). Artifacts observed within the transmission line corridor include 24 pieces of chipped lithic debitage and four fragments of thermally-altered rock. Artifacts observed within the two-track road include three pieces of chipped lithic debitage and three fragments of thermally-altered rock. The two-track road descends the upland escarpment and is severely eroded in several areas. The artifacts exposed within the two-track road are not considered to be in a primary context and are therefore not included within the site boundary. The 21 positive shovel tests initially excavated across site 41DL72 during the current investigation yielded 160 lithic artifacts and 10 ceramic or burned clay artifacts. Two dart points, two biface fragments, and two unifacial tools comprise the chipped stone tool assemblage recovered during the initial survey. The majority of the lithic materials, however, are debitage (n=135), with a relatively minor amount of thermally-altered rock (n=19). Ten prehistoric ceramic artifacts were initially recovered, including four vessel fragments. The remaining prehistoric ceramic artifacts 45

consist of amorphous nodules of burned clay, likely from hearths or roasting pits. In addition to the prehistoric artifacts described above, 57 historic-period artifacts were collected during the initial survey from the upper 30 cmbs in seven shovel tests at site 41DL72. These artifacts were concentrated in the southernmost portion of the site, where a structure in evident on a 1952 USGS aerial photograph. Much of the original 41DL72 site area has likely been destroyed by the twentieth century sand and gravel quarrying operation that took place immediately to the west of the remaining portion of site 41DL72 (see Figures 4, 5, and 7). In the southernmost portion of the site, shovel test excavations revealed extensive disturbance to the prehistoric deposits by twentieth century industrial and agricultural activities. Disturbed portions of the site are considered to have little research potential and are not likely to yield any additional information relevant to understanding the prehistoric period within the Northcentral Texas region. The central portion of site 41DL72 within the proposed project area, particularly the summit of the landform, most likely represents the locus of prehistoric habitation within the overall site context based on the concentration of chipped stone tools, ceramic vessel fragments, burned clay, and thermally-altered rock. This portion of the site contains the highest artifact density and diversity at the site as a whole and may contain intact cultural deposits. In addition, at least one human burial has been recovered from the site prior to the 1940s. Based on these preliminary investigations, the intact portion of site 41DL72 was tentatively considered to potentially preserve sufficient data to contribute important information regarding technology, settlement-subsistence patterns, and extra-regional interaction during the Late Archaic or early Late Prehistoric periods. 46

Following the initial survey at site 41DL72, an additional 24 shovel tests (STs 1103–1126) were systematically excavated in January 2013, reducing the shovel test interval to approximately 10 m (33.2 ft) within the potentially intact portion of the site (Figure 10). Of the 24 additional shovel tests excavated at the site, prehistoric artifacts were encountered in 23 shovel tests. The 23 additional positive shovel tests yielded 519 prehistoric artifacts, including 490 additional lithic artifacts and 29 additional ceramic or burned clay artifacts (Table 5). The majority of the additional lithic material was chipped lithic debitage (n=449), with a relatively minor amount of thermally-altered rock (n=35) and four additional chipped stone tools. Prehistoric ceramic artifacts consisted of an additional 29 specimens, including 11 vessel fragments and 18 fragments of burned clay. Relatively high concentrations of artifacts were noted in several shovel tests and the pattern of artifact density corroborated the initial observation that artifacts were concentrated along what remained of the landform summit (see Figure 10). In addition, several shovel tests exposed an overthickened A horizon with evidence of pedogenic melanization within the soil profile, indicating soil formation within an area of moderate anthropogenic activity. Based on these factors, a preliminary NRHP- and SAL- assessment of the site was conducted through a series of four 1-m-by-1-m controlled excavation units (Figure 11). 41DL72 Excavation Results Four controlled excavation units, each measuring 1-x-1-m, were excavated to provide additional data for the NRHP and SAL evaluation of the prehistoric cultural deposits encountered at site 41DL72. Three units (Test Units 1–3) were placed along the axis of the landform and Test Unit 4 was placed within the most intact remnant of the landform summit (see Figure 11). The units were hand-excavated in 10-cm intervals until the Bt soil horizon was encountered. Excavated fill was passed through 0.63-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh to facilitate artifact recovery. As a result of this limited site evaluation, 3,105 artifacts were recovered from 4.1 cubic meters of soil excavated in the four controlled test units within the potentially intact portion of 41DL72. Artifact densities encountered within the units range from 655–1,100 artifacts per cubic meter, with artifact densities from individual 10-cm levels as high as 1,770 artifacts per cubic meter. The majority of the artifact assemblage consists of chipped lithic debitage; however, formal and expedient chipped stone tools, prehistoric ceramics, thermally-altered rock, burned clay, and faunal remains were also recovered from each unit. Despite the high artifact densities encountered during this limited testing, no intact cultural features were identified during excavation. Soils encountered within excavation units at the site typically consisted of a fine sandy loam Ap- A-E horizon sequence overlying a sandy clay loam Bt horizon and appear to represent a variably truncated, texture-contrast Alfisol formed through in situ weathering of the underlying Pleistocene strath terrace deposits. All units yielded evidence of an overthickened A horizon with pedogenic melanization extending to depths ranging from 32 to 68 centimeters below surface (cmbs). The E horizons exposed in several of the test units exhibited discontinuous horizontal lamellae resulting from the illuviation of clay particles due to water percolation through the sandy epipedon. Excavation of the test units was terminated in the uppermost portion of the Bt horizon, which varied from 70 to 125 cmbs across the site. 49

41DL72 Artifact Analysis In total, 3,105 prehistoric artifacts were recovered in 4.1 cubic meters of soil excavated from the four controlled test units within the potentially intact portion of 41DL72 (Table 6). These artifacts consisted of 2,617 chipped lithic artifacts, 11 ground or pecked stone tools, 21 ceramic vessel fragments, 66 fragments of fired or burned clay, 2,850 grams (g) of thermally-altered rock, 96 faunal remains, and two charred botanical fragments. Chipped Lithic Artifacts Chipped lithic artifacts represent a common artifact class in Northcentral Texas. This artifact class includes tools, projectile points, and unmodified debitage (waste material from chipped stone tool manufacture). Within the Northcentral Texas region, chipped lithic artifacts are commonly made from locally-occurring quartzite gravels and, to a lesser extent, chert and other cryptocrystalline materials from surrounding regions. In total, 2,617 chipped lithic artifacts were recovered during the limited excavation at site 41DL72 (Table 7). The majority (n=2,562; 97.9 percent) of these artifacts consist of unmodified debitage; however, non-hafted bifacial tools (n=38), hafted bifacial tools (typically projectile points and/or knives; n=27), unifacial tools (n=12), and cores (n=5) are represented. Interestingly, the chipped lithic artifact assemblage recovered at site 41DL72 does not conform to the typical pattern of lithic raw material use common throughout the Northeast Texas prehistoric cultural area. Previous archeological investigations in Northcentral Texas consistently note the lack of chert within the regional artifact assemblages and the abundance of quartzite (Ferring and Yates 1997; Fields et al. 1997; McGregor et al. 1996; Prikryl 1990; Skinner and Baird 1985). Quartzite is a metamorphic rock consisting primarily of recrystallized quartz (Bates and Jackson 1984:414). Quartzite occurs across the Northcentral Texas region in upland Tertiary gravel deposits, often termed Ogallala gravels (Ferring and Yates 1997), which are commonly redeposited in alluvial settings. Whereas quartzite usually comprises 60 percent or more of the raw material in regional lithic assemblages, only 37.5 percent of the chipped lithic debitage recovered from site 41DL72 is quartzite. The majority of the lithic assemblage (61.3 percent of the debitage; n=1,570) is composed of chert, with at least 235 pieces of debitage and several formal tools identifiable as non-local Edwards chert indicating travel to the Edwards Plateau to the south or trade with groups that controlled or had access to the material. A total of 82 chipped stone tools were recovered during survey and preliminary evaluation of site 41DL72 (Table 8). Most of these tools are nondiagnostic bifaces and biface fragments (n=32) and unifacial tools (n=12). Formal hafted bifaces (n=29) recovered from the site include nine arrow points or probable arrow point fragments, 19 dart points or probable dart point fragments, and one large triangular knife. Arrow points were confined to the uppermost 40 cmbs of the site deposit. With the exception of two small dart points, one recovered at a depth of 20–30 cmbs in ST 1062 56

Several of the arrow points (n=4) recovered during this investigation are consistent with the Late Prehistoric (AD 700–1600) Alba and Bonham points types defined in Northcentral Texas (n=4; cf. Justice 1995:235–236; Suhm and Jelks 1962:263–264; Turner et al. 2011:177, 180). These point types are characterized by triangular blades, typically with straight or incurvate blade edges, pronounced barbed or square shoulders, and small straight to rounded stems with straight or rounded bases (Figure 12). One large triangular chert knife (Figure 13), recovered at a depth of 40–50 cmbs in Test Unit 1, displays a triangular form with retouched blade edges and is manufactured from Edwards chert. Although it does not conform to the classic Gahagan type (Newell and Krieger 1949; Shafer 1973:229; Turner et al. 2011:290) noted to occur on Late Prehistoric southern Prairie Caddo sites (Shafer 2006), this specimen certainly supports the possibility of a reworking/resharpening continuum between the Gahagan type and those of the Friday type (Jelks 1962:42; Shafer et al. 1964:44), as proposed by Shafer (2006:22). This artifact was recovered within a stratigraphic zone characterized by a relatively high frequency of faunal remains and is likely related to the processing or butchering of game animals.

Figure 13. Triangular knife recovered from site 41DL72 Figure 13. Triangular knife recovered from site 41DL72; a) photograph and b) sketch (courtesy of T. Dalbey). A variety of Archaic period dart points were recovered during the survey and preliminary evaluation of site 41DL72 (see Table 8). These consist of 17 dart point and probable dart point fragments, several of which were also likely used as knives based on the presence of asymmetrical blade resharpening. Archaic period stemmed dart points exhibit considerable morphological variability across the Northcentral Texas region. Examples from site 41DL72 are consistent with the Kent (n=4), Yarbrough (n=1), Ellis (n=1), Edgewood (n=2), and Carrollton (n=1) types previously defined within the region; however, with high regional and even intra-site variability, these stylistic designations should be considered with a degree of caution. Several varieties of the Kent and Yarbrough types have been proposed (Johnson 1962); however, their use has been sporadic and irregular across the region by archeologists, underscoring the morphological variability among specimens. Contracting-stemmed Gary dart points are typically ubiquitous at Late Archaic period sites across Northcentral Texas and adjacent regions; however, only one possible example was recovered during the survey and preliminary evaluation of site 41DL72. One small, likely resharpened, dart point with a slightly contracting stem and a rounded base wasrecovered in ST 1063 at a depth range of 20–30 cmbs. While not a distinct example of the Gary style (Newell and Krieger 1949:164–165; Suhm and Jelks 1962:197–198; Turner et al. 2011:107– 108), this specimen is consistent with other small, lozenge- or diamond- shaped dart points recovered in the region (e.g., 41TR170 [Lintz et al. 2008:Figure 30b]) and may be an example of an extensively resharpened Gary point. 62

The Kent type (Figure 14a) is typically characterized as crudely made and examples are identifiable based on large triangular blades with straight stems and flat bases (Suhm and Jelks 1962:199–200; Turner et al. 2011:119–120). Story (1990:222, 251) suggests that Kent points may be variants of the Yarbrough type, while Anderson and Smith (2003:268) note the obvious similarity to the Gary type. This point type is common across the region in Late Archaic contexts and, in less well- defined contexts, may extend into the Late Prehistoric and/or Woodland periods in the Northcentral and East Texas regions. The Yarbrough type (Figure 14b) is characterized by straight to convex blade edges, slightly expanding stems and straight to concave bases. Initially defined by Newell and Kreiger (1949:168) based on examples from East Texas, the style is common across the Northcentral and East Texas regions in contexts dating to the Middle and Late Archaic periods. Like the Kent and Gary points, this style may extend into the Late Prehistoric and/or Woodland periods (Story 1990:220). The Ellis type, originally defined by Newell and Krieger (1949:166–167) occur across the northcentral and eastern portions of Texas and into adjacent states and may span Late Archaic– Woodland period transition (Servello 1983:907; Gray 2002:80). They are characterized as weakly- barbed corner-notched points with crude thick blades, wide expanding stems, and straight to slightly convex bases. The single example recovered from site 41DL72 (Figure 15a) is somewhat atypical of the style in that it is well made, relatively thin, serrated, and asymmetrically resharpened, likely for use as a knife. Regional examples similar to the 41DL72 specimen have been recovered in Northcentral Texas at site 41CO141, identified as Ellis (Ferring and Yates 1997:144, Figure 10.9), and at the Gilkey Hill site (41DL406), identified as Yarbrough (Todd and Skinner 2006:21, Figure 9d). The Edgewood type, defined by Suhm and Jelks (1962:183–184), occurs across Northcentral and East Texas and extend into adjacent portions of western Louisiana. This type exhibits triangular blades with pronounced shoulders or barbs, and expanding stems with straight to concave bases (Figure 15b). Some examples display obtuse hafting angles, giving the points a side-notched appearance, while other examples with acute hafting angles are considered corner-notched. Edgewood points likely date to the Late Archaic–Woodland period transition in the region; however, some examples may date to the Early Archaic period in eastern Texas and western Louisiana (Anderson and Smith 2003:257). The two specimens recovered at 41DL72 are associated with Kent, Yarbrough, and Ellis types (see Table 8), providing some evidence that the Edgewood type dates to the Late Archaic component at the site. Crook and Harris (1952) proposed the Carrollton type in their initial overview of the now outmoded Carrollton foci (the present equivalent of the Middle Archaic period). Carrollton points are characterized by small, crude, triangular blades, and large square stems that are often smoothed and comprise nearly half of the total tool length (Figure 15c). The single example recovered from 41DL72 (Test Unit 1, 83 cmbs; see Table 8) may initially appear to be out of stratigraphic order compared to several presumably younger (Late Archaic) diagnostic tools recovered at greater depths in other test units; however, it should be noted that the Carrollton specimen was recovered 63

within a large root pore penetrating the argillic Bt soil horizon, which was encountered at a more shallow depth in Test Unit 1 as compared to Test Units 2 and 3. The clay-rich Bt soil horizon likely impeded further downward settling of the artifact over time. In summary, the temporally and stylistically diagnostic chipped stone tools recovered at site 41DL72 are consistent with types defined for Northeast Texas that indicate occupation of the site from the Middle Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period. Ceramic Artifacts Fourteen ceramic vessel fragments (sherds) and 24 masses of fired or burned clay were recovered during the initial and extended survey of site 41DL72 (see Table 5). An additional 20 sherds and 66 fragments of burned clay were recovered from the four controlled units excavated at the site (Table 9). Most of the ceramic vessel fragments recovered at site 41DL72 were tempered with grog (n=15; 44.1 percent) or a combination of grog and bone (n=8; 23.5 percent), but bone- (n=2), shell- (n=1), and sand-tempered (n=1) examples were also present. Five of the ceramic vessel fragments are decorated (14.3 percent). Three of the decorated sherds are brush-incised specimens. The two remaining decorated sherd displays a fingernail punctate surface treatment. Most of the ceramic vessel fragments recovered, however, were too eroded to discern surface treatment or decorative elements. Ceramic vessel fragments were generally restricted to the uppermost 40 cm of the site deposits (see Table 9), consistent with the recovery of Late Prehistoric period arrow points at similar depths. However, 17 percent (n=6) of the ceramic vessel assemblage was recovered from depths greater than 40 cmbs, and 11.4 percent (n=4) were recovered from depths greater than 50 cmbs. Whether this distribution is based on artifact movement due to bioturbation of the loose sandy solum mantling the upland landform or the presence of earlier (i.e., Transitional Archaic/Woodland period) ceramics at the site is uncertain. This distribution is generally consistent with archeological expectations, unfortunately, it is not statistically significant due to low artifact frequencies. Earlier researchers largely concluded that the ceramic artifacts in the Northcentral Texas region represent trade goods to unaffiliated central Texas groups (Jelks 1962:88). Recent research, however, suggests that “while there is little direct evidence for indigenous manufacture, the abundance of these types suggests they were produced locally” (Crook and Hughston 2015:17). In addition, the presence of the brush-incised and fingernail punctate surface treatments, coupled with the presence of Alba/Bonham style arrow points and a possible Gahagan knife, may indicate the presence of Caddo groups from East Texas in the Northcentral Texas prairie-savannah or social and trade connections between local groups and the Caddo (Shafer 2006:5). 66

Masses of burned or baked clay are common at prehistoric sites in Northcentral Texas and surrounding regions. Burned clay may be found as massive, fused deposits enclosing hearths or cooking pits (Osburn and Ward 2007), shaped or rounded nodules that served as boiling “stones” (Ford and Webb 1956; Lorrain 2012), fallen wattle-and-daub structures (Boyd 2004), fallen plastered thatch structures (Drass 2008), intrusive or local material deliberately or accidentally trampled into a living surface, masses introduced into a living area on collected plant roots (Goldberg 2008), insect nests that can sometimes be considered as proxy indicators of human occupation (Boyd 2004), or as evidence of forest fires with no direct indication of human activity. No intact burned clay features were encountered during the current investigations at site 41DL72. Burned clay was observed in varying amounts across the four test units (see Table 8). Faunal Remains Limited test excavations at site 41DL72 yielded a total of 95 vertebrate fauna specimens weighing 85 g and one mussel shell weighing 13.1 g. These remains were recovered from seven levels in six shovel tests (n=17) and seven levels in four test units (n=77). Approximately 27.6 percent of the vertebrate assemblage is identifiable, and 17 bone fragments are burned. The remainder of the collection was unidentifiable to any useful diagnostic criteria. In general, the collection is highly fragmented and poorly preserved; bone surfaces are often exfoliated, root etched, and/or rodent gnawed. Table 10 provides the number of specimens (NISP) in the 41DL72 faunal collection, as well as the minimum number of individuals (MNI) and the number of burned bones.

The faunal remains from site 41DL72 demonstrate a subsistence reliance on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), supplemented by freshwater mussels and turtles. Deer appear to have provided the primary source of subsistence and are represented by 21 identifiable elements. The specimens identifiable only as large terrestrial mammal are also likely white-tailed deer remains. At least one deer is immature, as indicated by the lack of epiphyseal fusion of the metapodial condyle. This implies that it was killed during the summer or early fall, as fawns are born in the spring. Although the faunal sample is small in quantity, a general subsistence overview can be recognized. The faunal remains from 41DL72 demonstrate a hunting reliance on large game. The White Rock Escarpment area would be conducive to deer populations as wooded edges are the preferred habitat of deer. The 21 deer bones are mainly comprised of lower limb bone fragments, but two cranial elements and six tooth fragments were also recovered. It is generally thought that non-meat parts of large game are frequently left at the hunt/kill location and only those body parts with high meat yield or tool value are transported from the hunting area back to the habitation site as distance increases. The recovery of certain elements, or lack of recovery, can be considered evidence of the procurement strategies practiced. This sample is void of vertebrae, scapulae, and pelvic bones, suggesting that deer carcasses were initially processed in another location. Botanical Remains Botanical remains identified on prehistoric archeological sites in Northcentral Texas are typically confined to charred plant remains recovered opportunistically within the soil matrix during excavation or during flotation of excavated soil samples. During the current investigation, botanical remains were noted in three of the Test Unit 1 excavation levels (Levels 4 [30–40 cmbs], 5 [40–50 cmbs], and 7 [60–70 cmbs]) as charcoal flecks within the soil matrix (see Table 6). The few botanical remains recovered during this investigation (n=2) consist of opportunistically collected wood charcoal and encountered during excavation and formal identification of these botanical remains was not conducted. Six ceramic sherds were submitted for evaluation prior to selecting two samples (Field Specimen [FS] 237 [Test Unit 1, 72 cmbs] and FS 246 [Test Unit 2, 70–80 cmbs]) for phytolith and starch analysis in an effort to determine the former contents of the represented vessels. None of the six ceramics exhibited visible food residues or yielded starch remains. A heavy liquid flotation method was used to extract phytoliths from the two analyzed sherds. Following extraction, the samples were mounted in optical immersion oil for identification under a light microscope at 500 power magnification. Phytolith analysis yielded an environmental signal from both of the ceramic sherds analyzed (Figure 16). Elongate forms were dominant; however, this form is ubiquitous in grasses, sedges, and various other plants. Therefore, this form cannot be interpreted to represent a specific group of plants. Due to recovery of grass short cells and other cells, it is highly likely that most, if not all, of the elongate forms originate from grasses. Grass short cells are divided into cool season 71

(festucoid) and warm season (chloridoid and panicoid). Morphologies typical of each of these groups of grasses were observed in both samples. Chloridoid (short grass) short cells were dominant, followed by festucoid (cool season), then panicoid (tall grass) short cells. This suggests a combination of short grasses indicating hot, dry summers on the escarpment, tall grasses growing along Big Spring and probably also White Rock Creek and the Trinity River, and cool season grasses growing in the spring and fall. Bulliform cells are responsible for leaf rolling in response to drought. These cells tend to be large and bulky and are thought to survive well in sediments even when the more delicate short cells decay. Their recovery indicates the presence of grasses and perhaps sedges. Grasses and sedges are monocotyledons, having only one seed-leaf. Interstomatal cells are elongated, relatively flat cells located between stomata. They are not considered to be diagnostic. Trichomes are hair cells common on both grasses and sedges. Hairs also occur on dicotyledonous plants, so they cannot be ruled out. Therefore trichomes are considered to represent a variety of plants. Dicots (dicotyledons) have two seed-leaves and constitute the rest of the flowering plants. Compared to the work done on monocots, specifically grasses, dicots have received relatively little attention regarding their phytoliths. Few dicot phytoliths were observed in this study and most can be classified as either thick, bulky forms, thin plates, or parallelepiped (exhibiting 6 parallel sides). A few tracheids (characterized by thick, lignified walls, but no pits) also were noted. Diatoms, spherasters, and sponge spicules were noted only on sample FS 237 from Test Unit 1, 72 cmbs. The small quantities recovered, while suggestive of water, might have been introduced from the sediments rather than indicating cooking using water in this vessel. When water is used in cooking, larger quantities of these organisms usually are present. No phytoliths diagnostic of food plants were observed in this analysis. This record appears to represent the local environment. Radiocarbon Analysis Of particular importance in the evaluation of a prehistoric archeological site for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as an SAL is the potential for the site to contribute information important in understanding prehistory. This information potential is contingent upon the degree of preservation and the applicability of the associated data to local and regional research questions. The availability and adequacy of information regarding site function, context, and chronological placement is essential to a comprehensive evaluation. Because research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and previous research, the identification of site context and chronology of sites and site components is a particularly important objective during the evaluation process. The chronological and contextual integrity of the cultural deposits encountered within the portion of site 41DL203 in the current project area was tested with a pair of radiocarbon dates (Table 11). No cultural features or clearly identifiable living or activity surfaces were encountered in the excavations. The best candidate for such a surface was located at approximately 45–55 cmbs in Test Unit 1, where a relatively dense concentration of faunal remains was encountered in association with a large triangular chert knife. Accordingly, a deer long bone fragment recovered from the matrix at a depth of 54 cmbs within the artifact concentration was selected for bone 73

In addition, a deer calcaneus fragment recovered at a depth of 60–70 cmbs in Test Unit 3, the largest (by weight; 14.1 g) prehistoric faunal element encountered from the site, was selected for collagen extraction and AMS dating. Radiocarbon dating of these two faunal elements yielded statistically identical dates, indicating that the majority of the site deposit dates to the early Late Prehistoric II period. Summary Site 41DL72 represents a prehistoric hunting camp that was occupied repeatedly as early as the Middle Archaic period, with continuing intensification during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, probably on a seasonal basis in the late summer or autumn months. The pattern of late summer and autumn exploitation of upland escarpments along major tributary drainages is postulated to be part of a much larger seasonal scheduling round, with more permanent sites likely located along the main channel of White Rock Creek and the Trinity River. Based on the increased reliance on chert as the primary lithic raw material, either a highly mobile population or one with communication and trade relationships to groups along the Edwards Plateau and East Texas can be inferred. The recovery of a large, thin triangular chert knife (see Figure 13) and ceramics with brush-incised and fingernail-punctate decorations may indicate a shared technological style or cultural affiliation among Caddo groups in the northern prairies during the Late Prehistoric period. Burial of archeological materials on this landform is a function of long-term bioturbation of the sandy surface soils by tree growth and burrowing organisms such as insects, rodents, and other fossorial species rather than by the deposition of sediment. Reworking of material has occurred due to limited amounts of sheet erosion, agricultural activities, and through disturbance of a large part of the former site area due to early-to-mid-twentieth century sand and gravel quarrying activity along the White Rock Escarpment. Based on the extant landform and a review of historic period topographic maps and aerial photographs, perhaps 60–75 percent of the former site area was removed during the operation of the quarry. This activity is also responsible for exposing a human burial prior to the 1940s. Early-to-mid-twentieth century field clearing and cultivation of the site area, as recorded on historic period aerial photographs, is likely responsible for soil mixing within the uppermost 30–40 cm (11.8–15.7 in) of the solum. 74

Site 41DL73 Site 41DL73 is a previously recorded prehistoric habitation site. The site was initially recorded in 1940 by Forrest Kirkland (site 27A-5-9) as an extensively used camp. Cultural materials observed at the site include numerous chipped stone tools, including dart and arrow points, blades, and scrapers, and one ground stone tool. The lack of ceramics at the site was noted at the time of its initial recording. Site 41DL73 is currently plotted in THC records as generally centered on a large twentieth century quarry pond along the western margin of the proposed project area. Numerous shovel and auger tests (n > 60) were excavated in the vicinity of site 41DL73 during the 2007 and 2012 field investigations, but the site was not located (see Figure 6). One auger test excavated in the vicinity of site 41DL73 during the 2007 fieldwork contained prehistoric material consisting of a silicified wood biface thinning flake and one angular piece of Ogallala quartzite debitage. Additional delineation tests were excavated in the cardinal directions in 10-m intervals at the location, but no additional artifacts were recovered. These artifacts may be associated with site 41DL73, but in the absence of additional artifacts, these artifacts are considered an isolate (Isolate 1; see discussion below). Kirkland initially described the site extending 3,000 yards (2.7 km [1.7 mi]) along a “sand bar in the river bottom” located approximately 0.5 mi (0.8 km) east of the confluence of White Rock Creek and the Trinity River. Kirkland’s accompanying site map, however, indicates that the site is only approximately 800 yards (730 m [2,395 ft]) in length, extending from two adjacent houses at the southern end of the site (despite indicating that there were no structures in the site vicinity on the accompanying site form) to a spring at the northern end of the site. It is possible that the two houses Kirkland indicated on his site map are along what is now Elam Road and recorded as historic period domestic sites 41DL208 and 41DL520. It is also possible that a spring once existed at the present location of Pond B prior to its creation by quarrying activities in the mid-twentieth century. Furthermore, the site is described as occupying deep, sandy soils which is incongruent with its description as being on the floodplain near the confluence of White Rock Creek and the Trinity River. The site Kirkland describes is more likely to be located (and observed) along the terrace escarpment rather than within the floodplain environment. It is more likely that Kirkland’s site was re-recorded during the Dallas Floodway Extension project (Bennett et al. 1981) as sites 41DL204, 41DL205, 41DL206, and 41DL207, a series of Archaic period (i.e., pre-ceramic) sites located approximately 0.5 mi (0.8 km) east of the confluence of White Rock Creek and the Trinity River that extend for approximately 700 m (2,296 ft) along the sandy terrace escarpment between the former alignment of Elam Road and the quarry pond. The precise location of site 41DL73 is uncertain. Either the site was completely destroyed by mid- twentieth century quarrying activities along the White Rock Escarpment, or the site was initially misplotted and later re-recorded as a series of smaller adjacent nearby sites (41DL204–41DL207), which have also been impacted by modern land use activities. Regardless, the site is unlikely to retain sufficient data to contribute important information regarding technology, settlement- 75

subsistence patterns, or extra-regional interaction during the Archaic period due to destruction by mid-twentieth century quarrying activities and subsequent erosion. As such, the site is considered to have little research potential and is not likely to yield any additional information relevant to understanding the prehistoric period within the Northcentral Texas region. Thus, it is recommended that site 41DL73 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. No further investigations are recommended at site 41DL73 for purposes of developing the proposed project area. Site 41DL205 Site 41DL205 consists of a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter. The site was initially recorded in May 1981 during a cultural resources survey for the Dallas Floodway Extension project (Bennett et al. 1981). The site was described as a sparse lithic scatter, encompassing less than 2 acres (Bennett et al. 1981:50, 91). Previously recorded cultural materials associated with the site consisted of chert and quartzite debitage. The site was revisited in December 1981 by the previous project personnel, who noted that the site had experienced erosion during the intervening period. Site 41DL205 was revisited during the current survey effort. Based on the results of auger testing in the vicinity of the previously recorded site location, a more accurate location and site boundary was defined (Figure 17). The site is located approximately 85 m (279 ft) northeast of the previously recorded site location. Site 41DL205 encompasses less than 0.05 acres, measuring approximately 10 m (33 ft) north-to-south by 20 m (66 ft) east-to-west at an elevation of 122 m (400 ft) amsl (Figure 18). Prehistoric artifacts were recovered in two adjacent auger tests at the site. Three pieces of Ogallala quartzite debitage were recovered from two auger tests. Auger Test S800/W860 yielded a medial/distal flake fragment from 0–40 cmbs and a piece of shatter from the same depth; these pieces exhibited discoloration and pot-lidding from heating. Auger Test S800/W850 yielded a core flake from 0–20 cmbs and also exhibited heat discoloration. Sizes of the three artifacts ranged from 12.7–38.1 mm (0.5–1.5 in). Site 41DL205 has been impacted by ground-disturbing activities and subsequent erosion associated with mid-twentieth-century quarrying within the project area. Due to the sparse nature of the artifact assemblage associated with the site, it is unlikely that 41DL205 retains sufficient data to contribute important information regarding technology, settlement-subsistence patterns, or extra- regional interaction during prehistory. As such, the site is considered to have little research potential and is not likely to yield any additional information relevant to understanding the prehistoric period within the Northcentral Texas region. Thus, it is recommended that site 41DL205 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. No further investigations are recommended at site 41DL205 for purposes of developing the proposed project area. 76

Site 41DL206 Site 41DL206 consists of a late-nineteenth-to-early-twentieth-century domestic artifact scatter. The site was initially recorded in May 1981 during a cultural resources survey for the Dallas Floodway Extension project (Bennett et al. 1981). The site was described as 10 concentrations of historic period artifacts encompassing less than one acre occupying the edge of a gravel pit (Bennett et al. 1981:50, 95). Previously recorded cultural materials associated with the site consisted of blue-tinted and white refined earthenware, including burgundy transfer print decoration, in addition to clear, green, and olive bottle glass, and steel can fragments and an oil stove burner. The site was revisited in December 1981 by the previous project personnel, who noted that the site had experienced erosion during the intervening period and surface artifacts were no longer visible. Site 41DL206 was revisited during the current survey effort. Based on the results of auger and shovel testing in the vicinity of the previously recorded site location, a more accurate location and site boundary was defined (Figure 19). The site was located approximately 100 m (328 ft) northeast of the previously recorded site location. Site 41DL206 encompasses 0.4 acres, measuring approximately 45 m (148 ft) north-to-south by 40 m (131 ft) east-to-west at an elevation of 122 m (400 ft) amsl (Figure 20). 78

20. Field photograph of site 41DL206, view to the northeast Figure 20. Field photograph of site 41DL206, view to the northeast. A total of 125 historic artifacts was collected from site 41DL206 and are composed of Domestic (n=35), Architectural (n=11), Furnishings (n=1), and Indeterminate (n=78) items. The Domestic category includes both ceramics and glass. The ceramics consist of light ivory tinted whiteware (n=6; post-1920) and yellowware (n=1). The Domestic glass includes amber/brown body sherds (n=8), clear body sherds (n=15; post-1880), a clear bottle base with stippling (post-1940; Lindsey 2012), two clear fruit jar lips with continuous thread lip (post-1870), and a light green bottle lip with non-applied, turn-molded champagne finish (pre-1910). In addition, one piece of clear table glass was also collected (post-1880). The Architectural materials consist of asbestos siding (n=7; post-1905 [Hope 2002:23]), clear window glass (n=3; post-1880), and a wire nail (post-1890; Nelson 1968). The single Furnishings artifact was a clear light bulb fragment. The Indeterminate category contains a broad range of artifacts. One clear glass angular fragment (post-1880) is included, as are a wad of paper, cellophane (n=3; post-1908), a battery core (post-1887), and an articulated plastic bottle top and cap. The remaining artifacts are all iron fragments and are composed of thin metal (n=57), a tin can lid, elements of crimped rim tin cans (n=11; post-1902; Busch 1981), and an unidentified fragment. In addition to the historic period artifacts described above, a single prehistoric artifact was recovered in Auger Test S620/W820. This artifact consists of a single biface thinning flake of undifferentiated chert recovered from a depth of 0–40 cmbs. 80

Site 41DL206 may be associated with a structure depicted near this location on the 1920 USDA Dallas County soils map. The structure, however, is not depicted on the 1922 USACE White Rock topographic map (see Figure 4), indicating that the structure may have been demolished in the early 1920s. Like other archeological sites along the upland escarpment, site 41DL206 has been impacted by ground-disturbing activities and subsequent erosion associated with mid- twentieth century quarrying within the project area. Due to the destruction of much of the original site area, it is unlikely that 41DL206 retains sufficient data to contribute important information regarding agriculture or community development within Dallas County during the historic period. Likewise, the single prehistoric artifact recovered at the site is insignificant to discussions of technology, settlement-subsistence patterns, or extra-regional interaction during prehistory. As such, the site is considered to have little research potential and is not likely to yield any additional information relevant to understanding the prehistoric or historic periods within the Northcentral Texas region. Thus, it is recommended that site 41DL206 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. No further investigations are recommended at site 41DL206 for purposes of developing the proposed project area Site 41DL207 was revisited during the current survey effort. Based on the results of auger and shovel testing in the vicinity of the previously recorded site location, a more accurate site boundary was defined (Figure 21). Site 41DL207 encompasses 0.8 acres, measuring approximately 55 m (180 ft) north-to-south by 90 m (295 ft) east-to-west at an elevation range of 118122 m (387400 ft) amsl (Figure 22). Only three historic artifacts were encountered at site 41DL207 during the current investigation. Two fragments of glass were collected from two shovel tests. One is a clear glass body sherd with a varying thickness, suggesting that it may have been mold-blown (18801910). The other is manganese/solarized glass body sherd (1870s1920; Lockhart 2006). A single pure white refined earthenware fragment was observed on the surface in the northwestern portion of the site. In addition to the historic period artifacts described above, four prehistoric artifacts were recovered during the current investigation in ST 1073. The distal half of a large biface, likely a knife fragment (FS 87.1), was made from gray heat-treated chert; the biface is very finely made with fine retouch along both asymmetrical lateral edges. The biface fragment was collected from the 10–20 cmbs level. A single fragment of Ogallala quartzite debitage was recovered from the 20–30 cmbs level and exhibits indication of heat discoloration. The remaining two artifacts are pieces of thermally- altered rock, both from the 10–20 cmbs level. 81

Site 41DL508 Site 41DL508 is a historic period domestic site initially documented during the 2007 fieldwork; although due to disruption of the project, the site was not completely delimited at that time. Additional fieldwork at the site was conducted in 2012 to more thoroughly determine the site boundary and characteristics of the artifact assemblage. Site 41DL508 consists of an early-to-mid- twentieth-century domestic site with extensive disturbance during the latter half of the twentieth century by agricultural operations. The site is defined within an 11.1-acre area measuring approximately 250 m (820 ft) north-to-south by 240 m (787 ft) east-to-west at an elevation range of 125135 m (410443 ft) amsl (Figure 23). The site boundary is based on the locations of standing architectural structures, surface artifact scatter, and the extent of positive shovel test excavations. The site appears to be centered on the residential structure located at 811 Pemberton Hill Road. One hundred fifty-six historic artifacts were collected from site 41DL508, consisting of items in the Domestic (n=84), Architectural (n=25), Furnishings (n=5), Activities (n=2), Personal (n=2), and Indeterminate (n=38) categories. Eighty-four artifacts were assigned to the Domestic category. Twelve ceramics were collected: blue-tinted, non-vitrified ironstone (n=1; 18501910), green Fiesta- like whiteware (n=2; 19301960), light blue tinted whiteware (n=1; 18801930), light ivory tinted whiteware (n=4; post-1920), and pure white whiteware (n=5; post-1890). The remainder of the Domestic artifacts is glass. The majority of the glass artifacts are sherds lacking other diagnostic elements and include manganese/solarized (n=28; 1870s1920 [Lockhart 2006]), clear (n=13; post- 1880), clear with ash tint (n=22; post-1915), aqua (n=2), emerald green (post-1930; n=1), and amber/brown (n=1). Another amber/brown sherd is thought to be from a mold-blown bottle (post- 1880) and an amber/brown bottle lip is from a machine-made bottle (post-1910). A piece of an opaque milk glass fruit jar inset cap was also found (18701930). Finally, three aqua fruit jar fragments were collected (18701942). Of the 25 Architectural items collected, the majority of the assemblage (n=16) is window glass and is composed of aqua (n=7), clear (n=2), light green (n=5) and light tinted (n=2) colored glass. The remaining artifacts include three nails (two cut [18401880] and one wire [post-1890]; Nelson 1968), two crude porcelain fragments thought to be industrial or plumbing related, a clear-glazed stoneware pipe fragment, two pieces of asphalt shingle/siding (post- 1910), and a piece of tar paper. The five Furnishings-related artifacts consist of four clear glass fragments that probably represent light bulbs and a piece of redware that is glazed on both surfaces. The two Personal artifacts are the base of a milk glass jar thought to represent a cosmetics container and a piece of a 78-rpm, double-sided record (19151955). The Activities-related items are a .22- caliber Long or Long Rifle cartridge with a “U” headstamp indicating that it was produced by the Union Metallic Cartridge Company (18671912; Remington 2012; Steinhauer 2012) and a black plastic cap (post-1942). Thirty-eight artifacts were assigned to the Indeterminate category. The majority of this category are modern plastic fragments (n=29; post-1942) that are translucent white, translucent tan, black, and blue in color. Two pieces of glass are also included, consisting of a clear with ash tint angular fragment and a red, machine-made bottle lip with a round ring finish with a flat top for cork closure (post-1910). Finally, seven thin iron fragments were collected. 84

The earlier twentieth-century component of site 41DL508 may be associated with the B. Ridde residence depicted on the 1900 Sam Street map of Dallas County and the structure depicted near this location on the 1920 USDA Dallas County soils map. This structure, however, is not shown on the 1922 USACE White Rock topographic map (see Figure 4), indicating that it may have been demolished in the early 1920s. Subsequent development appears to have occurred on the property in the early 1950s, based on the presence of a structure complex at this location on a high-resolution 1952 USGS aerial photograph. Due to continued use of the property from the mid-twentieth century to 2008, when ownership of the property was transferred to the city of Dallas, it is unlikely that the early-to-mid-twentieth-century component of the site retains sufficient data to contribute important information regarding agriculture or community development within Dallas County during the historic period. As such, the site is considered to have little research potential and is not likely to yield any additional information relevant to understanding the historic period within the Northcentral Texas region. Thus, it is recommended that site 41DL508 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. No further investigations are recommended at site 41DL508 for purposes of developing the proposed project area. ARCHITECTURAL SURVEY RESULTS Based on background research and the visual reconnaissance survey of the proposed project area, four historic period architectural resources were documented. In general, architectural resources in the vicinity of the proposed project area consist primarily of modern (post-1920) residential properties in the adjacent neighborhood bounded by Pemberton Hill Road on the west and Elam Road to the south, constructed between 1920 and 1950. Through the review of historic aerial photographs, historic maps, and on-site observation, the architectural survey of the proposed project area resulted in the identification of four historic-age structures or structure complexes within the project area (Figure 24). The architectural resources documented within the project area are residential and agriculture-related structures associated with the mid-to-late twentieth century development and were evaluated for NRHP eligibility and SAL designation. These resources include a wood-framed house, wooden and corrugated metal sheds and pens, a barn, a windmill, a concrete dam, and a concrete culvert. Many of the sheds and pens were used to corral livestock at the time of the 2007 fieldwork and have been abandoned and disassembled with the transfer of property ownership to the city of Dallas in 2008. 86

Resource 1 - Residential/Agricultural Building Complex Architectural Resource 1 is a building complex that consists of a residential structure and several associated agricultural-related structures. The one-story, wood-framed house at 811 Pemberton Hill Road (Resource 1a; see Figure 24) is set on a concrete foundation and features a gabled roof with asphalt shingles. The exterior walls are covered with wood drop siding painted white. All windows are double-hung wood sash and were painted white to match the siding. Two triangular wood brackets are mounted at each gable end of the house. Each bracket is placed approximately 1 foot from the corner of the house and is attached to the drop siding and wood eaves. The front entrance is located on the building’s northwest elevation. A wood-framed concrete porch extends across three-quarters of this elevation. The southwest elevation is defined by a group of three windows centered on the wall. The southeast elevation contains two separate windows placed on the left side of the elevation and a group of six windows placed side-by-side on the right side. The northeast elevation features one set of paired windows and one side door reached by a concrete stoop, two risers high (Figures 25 and 26). The residence was constructed in 1950 according to Dallas Central Appraisal District records. 25. Residential structure (Resource 1a) located at 811 Pemberton Hill Road, view to the north Figure 25.

26. Residential structure (Structure 1a) located at 811 Pemberton Hill Road, view to the southeast Figure 26. Residential structure (Resource 1a) located at 811 Pemberton Hill Road, view to the southeast. Northwest of the residential structure is a gable-roofed, medium-sized barn (Resource 1c; see Figure 24). The barn is covered by a corrugated sheet-metal roof supported by a post-and-beam system constructed from milled lumber posts and metal beams. The walls are corrugated sheet metal on the gable ends and scraps of milled lumber on the long ends. A series of simple, hinged wood and corrugated sheet-metal doors, observed during 2007 fieldwork, have been replaced with sheets of plywood. The barn is in poor condition, displaying signs of weathering and neglect caused by a lack of maintenance. The well-worn roof and siding are cracked and buckled and display signs of wood rot in some places (Figure 27). West of the barn and residential structure are several partially dismantled structures (Resources 1d– j) and concrete pads, representing livestock pens, storage sheds, and a well house, flanking a graveled lot. A four-legged windmill (Resource 1h) is located north of the barn and residence. The structure, supported by four tubular metal legs, was approximately 35 feet in height during the 2007 investigations. The metal ladder, the square metal cage at the top of the windmill, and its upper tiers have been removed since the 2007 observations. The windmill is cross-braced with metal cables. The windmill is missing its wheel and no longer functions for pumping water (Figure 28). 89

Resource 2 - Agricultural Building Complex Approximately one-half mile south of the Resource 1 building complex is another group of structures (Resources 2a–c; see Figure 24) consisting of one corrugated sheet-metal barn elevated above a series of horse stalls (Resource 2a), one wooden barn (Resource 2b), one small white shed (Resource 2c), one concrete pad, and one wood shed. Resource 2a is a gable-roofed barn in a state of disrepair (Figure 29). Although the roof’s purlins and rafters are somewhat intact, the sheathing and shingles are missing. The wood walls are intact in some places but missing in others. Tar paper and shingles are also visible on some sections of the walls. The barn is located among dense undergrowth and covered by trees and vines in some locations. Southwest of the wood barn is a large corrugated sheet-metal barn supported by a series of heavy, milled lumber posts and beams. This barn is constructed above a group of horse stalls that are placed directly beneath the structure (Figure 30). One gable end of the barn contains a large opening beneath the structure for bringing horses in and out of their stalls. The other gable end is sealed off by corrugated sheet metal that extends beyond the exterior walls. This end also contains a large vertical slot on the side of the structure where a section of corrugated sheet metal is missing or was removed for ventilation. 29.

30. Horse stalls beneath gable-roofed barn (Resource 2a), view to the south Figure 30. Horse stalls beneath gable-roofed barn (Resource 2a), view to the south. A wood-framed shed (Resource 2b; see Figure 24), located directly southeast of a concrete pad among a grove of trees and dense undergrowth, is in an extreme state of disrepair, although the wood post-and-beam structural system is still visible (Figure 31). A small wood-framed shed covered with plywood siding and painted white (Resource 2c; see Figure 24), is located west of the concrete pad. The building is located near a large oak tree and utility pole among dense undergrowth. The primary elevation is defined by a simple metal-hinged, plywood door (Figure 32). Resource 3 - Concrete Dam Resource 3 is a dam extending across an unnamed intermittent tributary of White Rock Creek south of the Resource 1 building complex (see Figure 24). This 52.5-ft-wide reinforced concrete structure once controlled the water level of a small pond located to the east (Figure 33). Concrete staircases with metal pipe railings are located on each side of the dam and ascend four risers to form the top of the main structure. The main structure spans one side of the pond, and an earthen berm has been constructed along the southern bank of the drainage in the vicinity of the dam. The channel of the intermittent tributary has eroded a new channel to the north of the structure, effectively bypassing it. 92

33. Dam (Resource 3), view to the northwest Figure 33. Dam (Resource 3), view to the northwest. Resource 4 - Culvert A concrete culvert (Resource 4; see Figure 24) spanning the unnamed intermittent tributary drainage was also observed approximately 215 ft downstream of the concrete dam (Figure 34). The culvert is constructed from a steel pipe surrounded by concrete wing walls. Modern, machine- made bricks serve as an abutment on the north side of the drainage. None of the buildings or structures located in the project area is recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Although all structures and structural remains retain integrity of location, all other aspects of integrity––setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association have been compromised by alterations to the setting and numerous alterations, demolitions, and neglect of the individual structures. None of the architectural resources are recognizable as significantly associated with a pattern of community or agricultural development in Dallas County and are not associated with any other historically significant events or persons. Therefore, these resources are recommended not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A and B. These resources do not exhibit the work of a master craftsman and were constructed in a style commonly found throughout the area; therefore, these resources do not possess sufficient significance to meet NRHP eligibility under Criterion C at the state and local levels of significance. 94

34. Culvert (Resource 4), view to the southwest Figure 34. Culvert (Resource 4), view to the southwest. Furthermore, these resources have little potential to provide information that may contribute to an understanding of history. Therefore, these resources are recommended not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D. None of the architectural resources within the proposed project area is recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. ISOLATES Based on the visual surface reconnaissance survey of the proposed project area and systematic auger and shovel testing, three nonsite isolated artifacts were located and documented (Table 12; see Figure 6). None of the isolates documented during this survey is believed to have the potential to contribute significant information regarding the prehistory or history of the area. In the absence of additional artifacts in more well-preserved contexts, none of these isolated occurrences of past human activity meet the criteria for archeological site designation and are therefore not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL, as per 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13 TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8. Therefore no further work is recommended necessary at these locations. 95

CHAPTER 6 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS This cultural resources survey was undertaken to document and assess cultural resources within the Texas Horse Park project area and to provide adequate and relevant information for use in the management of cultural resources within the project area. Information regarding previously recorded archeological sites was gathered through a literature review as well as a review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online database maintained by the THC. Prior to field investigations at the proposed project area, a suite of archival sources including historic aerial photographs and maps was examined to determine the former locations of historic-age structures within the project area. In accordance with CTA guidelines, systematic auger testing was conducted over the majority of the proposed project area (see Figure 6), with the exception of low-lying, periodically inundated areas and the locations of twentieth-century gravel quarries. Shovel testing was also conducted to more thoroughly define archeological site boundaries. Four controlled test units were excavated within the potential intact portion of 41DL72 to provide a preliminary evaluation of the NRHP- and SAL- eligibility of the site. All excavations were performed on property owned by the city of Dallas. Based on this survey effort, four previously recorded archeological sites (41DL72, 41DL205, 41DL206, and 41DL207) were revisited, one previously recorded archeological site (41DL73) could not be definitively relocated, one new archeological site (41DL508) was documented, and the architectural resources within the project area were documented and evaluated. These sites represent or have components that represent both prehistoric and early-to-mid-twentieth-century domestic occupations (Table 13). All of these sites have been adversely affected by sand and gravel quarrying operations, modern agricultural practices, and, in the case of historic period components, demolition or neglect. Furthermore, associating occupancy of the historic period components of these sites with owners or tenants based on archival information is problematic. The integrity of setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association has been compromised for all of the architectural resources due to alterations to the setting and numerous alterations, demolitions, and neglect of the individual structures. Given the limited information potential associated with the historic period components of these sites, it is unlikely that they will provide any additional information relevant to understanding community and regional development in Dallas County during the late nineteenth through early twentieth centuries. Thus, the historic period components 97

The prehistoric components of these sites have been impacted by twentieth century industrial and agricultural activities. Despite these disturbances, a portion of site 41DL72 may preserve intact prehistoric cultural deposits. Based on its information potential (Criterion D), the site is recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as a SAL. Thus, avoidance of this area by ground-disturbing activities is recommended. The potentially intact portion of site 41DL72 has been placed in a preservation easement that includes the adjacent natural spring feature, satisfying this recommendation. Sites 41DL73, 41DL205, 41DL206, 41DL207, and 41DL508 lack significant assemblages of temporally diagnostic artifacts, isolable components, and intact stratigraphy and cultural features and are unlikely to preserve sufficient data to contribute important information regarding prehistoric technology, settlement- subsistence patterns, or extra-regional interaction. Sites 41DL73, 41DL205, 41DL206, 41DL207, and 41DL508 are therefore recommended not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as SALs, under criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 and 13 TAC 26.8, respectively. No additional work is recommended for these sites. Provided the potentially intact portion of site 41DL72 remains within a preservation easement, it is recommended that the project will have no adverse effect to any historic properties. 98
