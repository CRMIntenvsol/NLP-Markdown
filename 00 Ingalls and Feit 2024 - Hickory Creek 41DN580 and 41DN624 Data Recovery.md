A BSTRACT On behalf of the City of Denton and Freese and Nichols, Inc., Acacia Heritage Consulting conducted archeological significance testing and data recovery excavations at sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 within the Hickory Creek Interceptor alignment in Denton County, Texas. The project is sponsored by the City of Denton; thus, investigations were conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) under Permit 30127. Rachel Feit served as Principal Investigator. The Hickory Creek Interceptor project will involve construction of an approximately 2.46- mile-long sewer line in central Denton County, extending from west of IH 35 West to an outfall located east of US Route 377. The project area for the previous survey efforts included the 60-ft-wide utility easement along the entirety of the proposed line. In October 2020, Acacia’s survey identified two archeological sites within the alignment, 41DN580 and 41DN624. Both sites are on the bank of Hickory Creek southwest of the City of Denton. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) recommended avoidance or, if avoidance is not possible, additional testing to determine State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility. Therefore, from 2021-2022, Acacia conducted testing excavations. Subsequent coordination with THC indicated that both 41DN580 and 41DN624 are eligible for listing as SAL and NRHP properties. Data recovery and mitigation excavations at both sites were therefore undertaken by Acacia. This report presents the results of the eligibility testing and data recovery investigations conducted from May 2021 through January 2022. Acacia’s work was conducted under the ACT. The testing and data recovery investigations at sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 sought to identify site chronology and the number of occupations or components at each. Additionally, Acacia hypothesized that the features and their associated activities would allow us to address group foraging strategies and potentially identify seasonal occupation patterns. Finally, Acacia hoped to estimate the size of the social groups occupying the sites and understand their mobility patterns over time. Eligibility testing efforts at site 41DN580 showed it is a stratified multicomponent Prehistoric site on the southwest bank of Hickory Creek. The site contains components dating to the Middle Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. Acacia summarized the results of testing efforts in an interim report that was submitted to THC for regulatory review. THC recommended 41DN580 as eligible for listing as a SAL and NRHP property. Therefore, data recovery and site mitigation efforts were undertaken. Acacia investigated site components through intensive mechanical excavations and scraping, geomorphological study, and hand excavations. A total of 32 cubic meters of sediment was hand-excavated from the site during both phases of investigation. During these excavations, 18 Archaic period features were identified, along with a Late Prehistoric site component initially identified as Feature 14. Archaic period features are primarily composed of fire-cracked rock (FCR) and represent the remains of various cook stone activities. Acacia’s efforts showed that these features represent a range of domestic activities that utilized various aspects of the local environmental mosaic over time. The Late Prehistoric component is represented by scattered, discarded occupation debris from what was probably a temporary campsite (or series of campsites) based on the lack of defined features but the presence of a variety of small and exhausted artifacts. This component notably Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 i

includes Nacona Plain ceramics, which radiocarbon dates indicate may be some of the earliest examples from the region. Likewise, testing revealed site 41DN624 is a multicomponent Prehistoric site with occupations during the Middle and Late Archaic periods. Initial results of testing efforts were submitted to THC in an interim report. The site was recommended as eligible for listing as a SAL and in the NRHP, and data recovery and mitigation efforts were undertaken. Acacia used similar methods as at 41DN580, revealing 13 Archaic period features through excavation of about 25 cubic meters of sediment. These are similarly composed mostly of FCR and represent cook stone activities that utilized multiple resources in the local environment. Features represent three primary periods of occupation from the Middle through Late Archaic periods. Acacia was tentatively able to distinguish several associated activity areas from the latter period. Excavations at both 41DN580 and 41DN624 were limited to the Hickory Creek Interceptor ROW, and therefore the exposures afforded only partial glimpses of the sites. Based on the assemblages recovered, both sites are interpreted as temporary camps as indicated by the predominance of single-use cook stone/FCR features and faunal remains, but a general lack of tools or other artifacts. These occupations show how small groups of hunter-foragers used the abundance of riparian environmental mosaic resources across thousands of years. Although the overall artifact assemblage was relatively small, the number of features and assemblage patterns allow Acacia to address the research questions posed. Site 41DN580 contains at least three primary periods of occupation dating to the Middle Archaic and the Late Prehistoric. 41DN624 likewise has three primary occupations dating to the Middle and Late Archaic periods. At both sites, our interpretations are strongly influenced by preservation bias against organic materials. Riverine resources (primarily Unionidae mussel shells) were common, and palaeobotanical remains also indicate a broad mosaic riparian/woodland/grassland environment. People occupying these sites utilized this ecologically rich zone on their short, temporary stays at each site. While there needs to be more data before we can make solid interpretations about the seasonality of these occupations, the data we have is suggestive of a late summer to fall stay. While it is difficult to make any solid estimates of group size, the small number of materials associated with the identified features indicates these were likely very small groups that did not stay long. Patterns of group mobility are primarily indicated by the frequency of non-local lithic materials. These show that the frequency of Edwards chert from central Texas notably decreases over time. This suggests that group mobility and/or far-reaching socio-economic networks decreased through time. There are substantial avenues for future research. Notably, if exploration outside of the current ROW is possible, that data would give a more comprehensive view of the sites. Other avenues could include additional specialized analyses on the data already collected to potentially include lipids and residue analyses, additional palaeobotanical studies, petrographic and neutron activation analysis on recovered ceramics, and palynological studies. In sum, sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 are considered eligible for designation as SAL properties and for listing in the NRHP. However, Acacia’s excavation efforts mitigated the project’s effects within the Hickory Creek Interceptor ROW. Any future project that could impact the sites beyond the current ROW may warrant further consideration to assess the possibilities for additional contributing Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 ii

components. No further work within the Hickory Creek Interceptor ROW was recommended for Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624, and the THC concurred with those recommendations in letters dated (December 28, 2021 and February 7, 2022). Artifacts and documentation resulting from this project will be curated at Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) in San Marcos. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 iii

1. I NTRODUCTION In 2021 and 2022, Acacia Heritage Consulting (Acacia) conducted testing and data recovery investigations at two sites, 41DN580 and 41DN624, in Denton County, Texas under Antiquities Permit No. 30127 (Figure 1.1). Both sites are precontact Indigenous occupation sites located along Hickory Creek within the easement for the 2.46-mile (mi)-long (13,009 linear foot [ft]) Hickory Creek Interceptor line, which extends from west of Interstate Highway (IH) 35 West to an outfall located east of U.S. Route (US) 377. The sewer line is built in an approximately 60-ft-wide utility easement, with installation occurring through open cut trenching and directional boring. The project is sponsored by the City of Denton, and therefore the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) applies. The ACT requires consultation with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) to identify the effects of a project to cultural resources within the project footprint. Acacia previously conducted an archeological survey of the project area, or Area of Potential Effects (APE), under Antiquities Permit No. 9641 in October 2020. This effort identified that the previously recorded site 41DN580 extended into the interceptor easement. Acacia also identified a new site, 41DN624, on the south side of Hickory Creek near US 377. At that time, both sites were recommended for avoidance or additional testing to determine eligibility for listing as State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties. Therefore, under Antiquities Permit No. 30127, eligibility testing at 41DN580 and 41DN624 occurred in May and June of 2021. These efforts identified six new intact features at 41DN580 and two features at 41DN624. Beyond the identified features, both sites were judged to have good contextual integrity, datable organic materials, and artifact assemblages that could yield significant data about Prehistoric lifeways in north-central Texas. Based on these data, THC recommended that both sites are eligible for SAL and NRHP listing and therefore avoidance or mitigation efforts were required. Antiquities Permit No. 30127 was amended in October 2021 to include data recovery of site 41DN580 and the southern half of site 41DN624. Acacia completed data recovery for site 41DN624 in November 2021 and at 41DN580 in January 2022. From both testing and data recovery efforts at site 41DN580, Acacia archeologists excavated a combined total of 32.38 cubic meters (m3) of sediment across 83, 1 x 1 meter (m) test units, identifying a total of 19 features. Similarly, at 41DN624 Acacia excavated 13 features through a total of 25.32 m3 in 66, 1 x 1 m test units, as well as 11, 50 x 50-centimeter (cm) control units. Geoarchaeological analyses and chronometric modelling were conducted by SWCA, Inc. in support of the archeological effort. Led by Ken Lawrence, geoarchaeologists profiled trench exposures, collected sediment column samples from multiple locations at each site, and collected samples for optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and humate dating. Additional laboratory analyses included artifact analysis by material specialists, flotation, micro-artifact identification, as well as radiocarbon analyses conducted by Beta Analytic (Beta). A complete presentation of raw data is included in the Appendices attached to this report. This report is submitted in accordance with permitting and reporting standards of the THC and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA). All artifacts collected during these efforts will be curated along with project records at the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) in San Marcos.

Rachel Feit served as Principal Investigator, and Victoria Ingalls and Heath Anderson served as Project Archeologists and field leads. Field technicians involved in the project are Chesney Kuper, Manda Adam, Danielle Blut, Kristin Corl, Luc D’Rovencourt, Spencer Gage, Jose Garcia, Jennifer Herrera, Alesia Hoyle, Savanah Neil, Allison Ramirez, Steven Schooler, and Emory Worrell. Ingalls and Feit prepared and edited this report, with substantial contributions by individual materials experts presented in the following chapters of this report. Chapters 2 and 3 outline background environmental, geologic, and cultural data. Chapter 4 outlines Acacia’s methods, Chapter 5 presents results and feature descriptions from site 41DN580. Similarly, we cover results and features from 41DN624 in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 presents Ken Lawrence and Ashley Eyeington’s geoarcheological analyses and chronometric modelling. In Chapter 8, Sergio Ayala and Katharine Pontillo detail their analyses of the lithic assemblage from both sites. The late Timothy Perttula analyzed the Late Prehistoric ceramic assemblage from site 41DN580, and his results and interpretations are presented in Chapter 9. James Ramsey, Jodi Jacobson, and Stefanie Haliburton describe the vertebrate faunal assemblage in Chapter 10. Chapter 11 presents Lori Phillips’ analysis of the invertebrate assemblage, as well as our discussion of the modified shell tools. Leslie Bush presents her paleobotanical analysis of flotation and carbonized material in Chapter 12, and Linda Scott Cummings presents her analyses of pollen, phytolith, and starch in Chapter 13. Ingalls and Feit outline Acacia’s experimental studies and their results in Chapter 14. Finally, Chapters 15 and 16 synthesize interpretations and make recommendations for each site. Previous Investigations Site 41DN580 is a deeply buried precontact site located on the south side of a bend in Hickory Creek. In 2014, Blanton and Associates (Blanton) excavated more than 20 backhoe trenches at this location in support of the then-proposed drainage basin for the Bonnie Brae Road expansion project. Four trenches contained cultural materials, including two identified features (Figure 1.2). Between 80 and 165 cm (2.6-5.4 ft) below the surface (bs), Blanton documented two fire-cracked rock (FCR) features, faunal bone, mussel shell, scattered FCR, and a chert flake (Young 2014). Blanton’s Feature 2 is worth special note. It was over 4 m in length and at least 1 m wide at an elevation of 116-137 cmbs and was made up of FCR (some very large) and scattered mussel shell across a single surface. Although it was mechanically excavated through, archeologists noted no carbonized materials or soil discoloration and suggested it may be a rake out pile from another nearby feature. While that may certainly be the case, this substantial feature represents behavior not seen in Acacia’s later work. Blanton’s four positive trenches are located just outside of the Hickory Creek Interceptor’s APE to the east, while trenches within and west of the current Interceptor easement were negative for cultural materials. The site was recommended for avoidance or further NRHP eligibility testing at that time (Young 2014). Project planners chose avoidance and constructed the drainage basin away from the delineated site limits. The drainage basin was excavated and constructed in 2017, and the new Bonnie Brae Road and bridge were constructed between 2017 and 2019. In 2020, Acacia conducted a survey of the Hickory Creek Interceptor line which was planned outside the western edge of the original 41DN580 site boundary. During this survey, investigators excavated three trenches near the site (Feit 2020). Two trenches contained FCR feature remnants, Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 2

labeled Features 1 and 2, both of which were concentrations of sandstone FCR observed in association with scattered mussel shell (Feit 2020). Cultural deposits were recorded between 150 and 190 cmbs, and characteristics were comparable with Blanton’s original findings. Additionally, Acacia documented scattered FCR and a Late Archaic Kent-like dart point eroding from the drainage basin banks. These eroding materials were clustered to suggest that they are the remains of features and were at roughly the same level below the original surface as the features seen in trenches. No cultural materials were observed below these features, including on the drainage basin floor, which was about 2.5-3 m below the original ground surface (Feit 2020). Acacia’s 2020 report extended site boundaries to the north and west and recommended that the site be avoided, or further NRHP and SAL eligibility testing should be undertaken. Acacia’s 2020 effort also documented site 41DN624 within two hayfields on either side of US 377 and the BNSF Railroad. Investigators delineated the site boundaries through four positive trenches (Figure 1.3). Cultural materials were documented between 90 and 190 cmbs, with materials concentrated between 110 and 150 cm in depth. The site area was delineated to cover roughly 220 m paralleling the south bank of Hickory Creek. Site characteristics were very similar to 41DN580 and include FCR features and mussel shell (Feit 2020). Therefore, avoidance or further testing at site 41DN624 were recommended. Summary of Current Investigations The overarching goal of this project was to document and excavate SAL and NRHP-eligible sites 41DN580 and 41DN624, mitigating the effects of the Hickory Creek interceptor project impacts. Both sites are characterized as deeply buried Precontact period Indigenous campsites. Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 fall on the south side of the main branch of Hickory Creek, less than five miles from Denton’s city center. The area is rapidly transitioning from large, rural agricultural tracts to suburban land uses of new single-family housing developments and associated infrastructure. Across both sites during testing and data recovery, Acacia archeologists excavated a total of 57.7 m3 of soil and documented 32 features. Most documented features date to the Archaic period, although archeologists also recorded a Late Prehistoric component at site 41DN580. During testing and data recovery excavations, Acacia’s team documented a total of 31 Archaic period features at sites 41DN580 and 41DN624, and one Late Prehistoric period feature/component at site 41DN580. Most of the features are small clusters of burned rock, and all include at least some FCR, which was collected by ancestral people from gravels in the bed of the nearby creek. Feature Descriptions and Categories Acacia preliminary grouped the features into three rough categories based on size and shape that may relate to function and/or longevity of use. These categories are: Category 1) non-patterned scatters of FCR (n=14); Category 2) tight clusters of FCR without a distinct basin shape (n=10); and Category 3) earth ovens with a central, basin-shaped depression (n=5). A full discussion of feature types and experimental studies are presented in Chapter 13. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 3

Category 1 is the most numerous feature type encountered across all excavated areas. These features are defined as small scatters of FCR with very little associated cultural material. The majority of FCR pieces are smaller than 10 cm and include an extremely small assemblage of mussel shell. Very little, if any, charcoal or organic materials were found associated with Category 1 features, which also lack soil discoloration. Category 2 features are well-defined, typically circular clusters of FCR that lack a formal basin- shape. Relatively little charcoal or other organic materials were found associated with Category 2 features, which also rarely exhibited any stained or discolored soil. At both sites, lithic flakes and points were recovered near these features, as were some freshwater mussel shell. Our initial interpretation was that Category 1 and 2 features are the remnants of simple, one- time use hearths that did not produce a large thermal signature on the soil as we see in the more formally constructed earth ovens from Category 3. While the lack of associated material does pose certain problems in interpretation, the number of these features across the sites points to repeated, short-term occupation of these locations. Acacia’s experimental studies (Chapter 13) present preliminary data that further suggest some of the Category 1 features may be related to stone boiling and other cook stone activities. Finally, Category 3 features are earth ovens with a central basin or depression. Two features at 41DN580 and three at 41DN624 are identified as earth ovens. These features are constructed fit for purpose and exhibit much more carbonized organic material and soil staining/discoloration than smaller types of features. Additionally, when compared with smaller features, the associated materials are both more diverse and found in higher quantities. These broad patterns suggest an intensity or longevity of use beyond that seen in association with the smaller features. Three Archaic features and the Late Prehistoric site component (originally designated a feature) do not fit into the categories described above. These are 41DN624 Features 9 and 10, as well as 41DN580 Feature 18. Each of these does contain some FCR, although their other aspects and patterning preclude them from direct comparisons with the rest of the sites’ features. Each of these is described in detail below. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 4

2. S S E ITE ETTING AND NVIRONMENT Vegetation and Topography The site areas extend along the main branch of Hickory Creek less than five miles south of the Denton city center. The surrounding area is very rapidly transitioning from rural to suburban, with multiple adjacent small-lot housing developments under construction during this archeological effort. The project setting is within the Grand Prairie region of the larger Cross Timbers environment. The Cross Timbers was named for the historically dense forests that formed a barrier to the open plains and prairies to the east and west. More specifically, Grand Prairie was characterized by undulating plains underlain with limestone beds (Griffith et al. 2007). Natural vegetation in this ecoregion is dominated by grassland species including little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper), eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), and switch grass (Panicum virgatum). In addition, mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), hackberry (Celtis laevigata), juniper (Juniperus ashei), bois d'arc (Maclura pomifera), and post and live oak (Quercus stellata and virginiana) are often observed in the woodlands along streams. However, little is left of this native environment, as the current landscape is a mix of urban and agricultural land with limited riparian woodlands. Native fauna include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit, raccoon, striped skunk, nine-banded armadillo, and various rodents such as rats and squirrels. Common bird species include scissor-tail flycatcher, northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove, killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird. Reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat snake, eastern hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake, copperhead, western diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog, diamondback water snake, Houston toad, and green anole. There are 44 known species of fish and 15 species of mussels that inhabit the waterways of north-central Texas (Todd 2014). Although herds of bison, red wolf and antelope were once common, these species were decimated through programmatic hunting and predator control programs of the nineteenth century (Griffith et al. 2007). Soils and Geology Ken Lawrence and Ashley Eyeington, SWCA Although the topography of the Denton area consists of rolling hills, the project areas along Hickory Creek are on the relatively flat floodplain. The elevation at both sites is approximately 570- 575 ft above mean sea level (amsl) (Figure 2.1). Both sites are on the west, depositional side of the creek while rolling hills slope up and away to the east. Soils Both 41DN580 and 41DN624 are mapped as the frequently flooded Frio silty clay (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2021). These deposits are characterized as very deep, slowly Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 8

permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium that occupy floodplains and river valleys (NRCS 2021). Typical horizons for this series include an A1 horizon (0 to 20 cm), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay when dry, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, moderate fine and medium granular structure, hard and firm consistency, moderately sticky, moderately plastic, roots, few shell fragments, moderately alkaline with a clear smooth lower contact boundary. Below this is an A2 horizon, which typically is described as a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam when dry, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) when moist, with a moderate and coarse subangular blocky structure giving way to moderate fine subangular blocky structure, few roots inclusions, few shells fragments, moderately alkaline, with a clear smooth boundary. Underlying the A2 horizon is a Bk1 horizon with characteristics including a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam when dry, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) when moist, with a moderate fine and medium prismatic structure towards moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure, with a hard and firm consistency, few roots, films and threads of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), few shell fragment inclusions, moderately alkaline, with a gradual and smooth lower boundary. The fourth zone of a typical solum is a Bk2 horizon described as a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam when dry, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) when moist, with a moderate fine and medium prismatic structure towards moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure, with a hard and firm consistency, few roots, films and threads of CaCO3 present, moderately alkaline, with a gradual smooth lower contact boundary. The underlying zone is a Bk3 horizon consisting of a grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay when dry, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) when moist, with a moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to a weak coarse blocky structure, with a hard and firm consistency, few roots, with many fine films and a few soft masses of CaCO3 (NRCS 2021). Geology The floodplain of Hickory Creek underlying 41DN580 and 41DN624 is mapped as Holocene- age Quaternary (Qal) deposits composed of alluvium (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS] 2021). The alluvium is generally described as containing sand, silt, clay and gravel. The surrounding uplands are mapped as Cretaceous age Grayson marl and Main Street Limestone, undivided (USGS 2021). The Grayson marl is characterized as a fossiliferous formation of light greenish-gray to medium gray marl the interbeds with the Main Street limestone. The Main Street limestone is described as yellowish gray to white limestone (USGS 2021). No outcrops of the unit were observed in the project area. Hydrology Hickory Creek is within the Upper Trinity River basin and is a tributary of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. It joins the Elm Fork approximately 13.5 mi (21.7 kilometers [km]) downstream from 41DN624 and eventually the Trinity River. Hickory Creek at 41DN580 and 41DN624, is located in south-central Denton County, approximately 3.25 mi (5.2 km) southwest of Denton, Texas (see Figure 17.1). The Hickory Creek valley at this location is approximately 1 mi (1.6 km) wide and appears to have an unpaired terrace system floodplain near the two sites (Waters 1992:150–151). Specifically, the right bank (west side) of Hickory Creek has at least one alluvial landform (T0) composing the floodplain while the left bank (east side) quickly rises to the surrounding upland of the valley margin. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 9

## Page 34

At 41DN624, the T0 landform is generally 0.4 mi (640 m) wide at roughly 565–570 ft amsl. At 41DN580, the T0 landform is generally 0.35 mi (560 m) wide at roughly 570–575 ft amsl. Notably, the T0 landform around both sites is dissected in several locations across the floodplain by tributary channels. The tread of the T0 landform is positioned about 8–10 ft (2.5–3 m) above the channel base and quickly rises to the nearby valley margins on the left bank (east side) and gradually rises to the valley margins on the right bank (west side) containing 41DN580 and 41DN624. Hickory Creek at this crossing has a high Sinuosity Ratio (SR) of 1.3, indicating that it is a sinuous channel (Charlton 2008). This elevated SR value indicates that lateral erosion (exterior bends) and extensive sediment deposition (interior bends) are occurring within the channel, particularly at exterior and interior meander bends. Notably, site 41DN580 on the right bank (west side) is positioned on an interior meander bend, whereas 41DN624 is located on a relatively straight section of the drainage. Put simply, both 41DN580 and 41DN624 are in locations that appear to be actively expanding through continual flood deposition. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 10

3. C B ULTURAL ACKGROUND Denton County is within the north-central Texas Archeological region (Perttula 2004). Research driven archeological investigations in this portion of Texas have not been as extensive as in adjacent regions such as Central Texas, Northeast Texas, and Deep East Texas (Perttula 2004:7). The bulk of prior archeological research in the region has been conducted for large-scale reservoir projects including Lake Lavon (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lynott 1975; Stephenson 1950), Lake Ray Hubbard (Harris and Suhm 1963; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968), Ray Roberts Reservoir (Ferring 1987; Ferring and Yates 1997; Prikryl and Yates 1987; Skinner et al. 1982), Lewisville Lake (Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring and Yates 1998; Stephenson 1950), Grapevine Lake (Ferring 1975; Morgan 1975), and Mountain Creek Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988). However, as this region continues to see a huge increase in population, the resulting archeological projects are bringing substantial new data to our understanding of past cultural groups and their lifeways. More recent site-specific investigations in the north-central Texas region have refined understanding of how humans interacted with the environment of north-central Texas in the millennia leading up to European contact (see Fields et al. 2000; Nickels 2014; Tinsley et al. 2011). This work is gradually bringing the precontact period into sharper focus, with an emphasis on understanding the ways in which precontact period people interacted with their environments in their daily cultural practice. Precontact chronology of the north-central Texas archeological region, like most of Texas, follows a tripartite model, encompassing three primary time periods: the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric Periods. Paleoindian The earliest known human occupation in north-central Texas dates to the Paleoindian period (12,000 years Before Present [BP] to ca. 8500 BP). In north-central Texas, few sites of this age have in situ materials and stratigraphic integrity; most evidence derives from surface or mixed contexts. To date, the Lewisville and Aubrey sites at Lewisville Lake in Denton County have the only intact Paleoindian components (both associated with Clovis Complex occupations) in north-central Texas and these were excavated more than 40 years ago (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958; Ferring 1989, 2001). At the Aubrey site (41DN479) Clovis points and lithic debitage that dated to 11,500 BP were discovered under eight meters of Holocene alluvium on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River (Ferring 1989, 2001). Research at the Aubrey, Lewisville, and Paleoindian sites elsewhere have contributed to an overall impression that lifeways were characterized by high mobility, exploitation of a wide range of plant and animal resources, highly efficient use and curation of lithic materials (some which was procured long-distances from campsite locations), and possibly high task differentiation within sites (Bever and Meltzer 2007; Ferring 2001). Archaic In north-central Texas the Archaic spans the period from 8500–1250 BP and is broadly divided into the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic sub-periods (Prikryl 1990). Researchers believe the Archaic Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 13

period was precipitated by a climate shift to generally warmer, drier conditions, which began at the end of the Pleistocene and persisted for several millennia. By about 6000 BP, the Cross Timbers mosaic was formed in north-central Texas (Prikryl 1990). This climate shift hastened the extinction of most Pleistocene megafauna with the exception of bison (Haynes 1993), and archeologists believe that this also affected human subsistence patterns and culture expressions. Projectile point styles transitioned from unstemmed spear points to stemmed varieties such as the Martindale and Uvalde types (Black 1989). Most researchers posit that these stylistic changes correspond to changing adaptive strategies that focused subsistence on smaller game. The archeological record also demonstrates a heavier reliance on plant food processing, a wider variety of site functions, and more localized lithic resource procurement. This is reflected in an increase in the number of projectile point styles that proliferated during the Archaic, suggesting increasingly restricted mobile territories and a development of more localized production (Collins 1995). The archeological record, as it stands currently, reflects a paucity of Early Archaic sites in north-central Texas. No sites with intact Early Archaic components in this region have been documented with any detail and only two Middle Archaic sites have been investigated, 41DN102 (Calvert Site) and 41DN20. The Middle Archaic component at 41DN20 has a small assemblage and is heavily mixed with an Early Archaic component, making it nearly impossible to separate materials and features into discrete components (Ferring and Yates 1998). At site 41DN102 (the Calvert Site), there are no direct radiometric dates; the Middle Archaic component was dated entirely on projectile point styles and relative stratigraphy. Thus, archeologists’ understanding of Middle Archaic lifeways of north-central Texas and its chronology is still tentative (Ferring and Yates 1997). This scarcity of data may result from some combination of poor preservation, geoarcheological conditions related to site formation, or simply a factor of low regional populations at the time. There is presently not enough data about Early and Middle Archaic sites in this region to understand how these forces worked in tandem. Mobility probably remained relatively high throughout much of the Early and Middle Archaic period, and this is reflected in lithic source material, much of which still comes from non-local cherts of the Edwards Plateau or High Plains (Todd 2014). However, other evidence suggests that, over time, Archaic period groups may have begun to move in smaller bands, returning to certain campsites repeatedly (Ferring and Yates 1997; Peter and McGregor 1988). Prikryl’s 1990 research into the archeological data from the lower Elm Fork of the Trinity River indicates that most Middle Archaic sites are situated on the first terrace above stream flood plains, suggesting that Middle Archaic peoples stuck closely to major drainages in their hunting rounds and migrations. Sites from the Late Archaic period, which began around 3500 BP (although there is some discrepancy, see Perttula 2004; Prikryl 1993:199; Story 1985, 1990; Todd 2014), are vastly more numerous than those of earlier periods, and it is still not clear whether this reflects increased population, differences in site location selection, site preservation processes, or some combination of both. This period corresponds to the formation of the West Fork Paleosol, which has been identified throughout the Trinity River drainage basin in north-central Texas. The Pilot Point alluvium and West Fork Paleosol formed along primary waterways during the late Holocene through initially rapid aggradation, with local vegetation and pedogenic processes becoming more prominent than depositional processes thereafter (Hall et al. 2011:548; Tinsley and Dayton 2011:104).

colleagues (2011:548) used stable carbon isotope, molluscan fauna, and geomorphological data to conclude that this horizon “formed in a wet meadow environment dominated by C4 tallgrass species.” Although the frequency of open campsites increases during this period, the size and scale of sites tend to be smaller. Diagnostic dart points of the Late Archaic period include Dallas, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, Ensor, Gary, Kent, Godley, Marcos, Trinity, and Yarborough types (Prikryl 1990:54). Smaller game continued to be exploited along with plants, the latter of which are indicated by an increase in lithic tool types associated with plant processing activities (Brownlow et al. 1999). Stone tools in the latter part of the Late Archaic are more commonly made from local quartzite and chert gravels which suggests decreased mobility (Lintz et al. 2008; Tinsley and Dayton 2011; Todd 2014). Late Archaic sites also contain a wide variety of features that include burned rock heaths, ovens, rock scatters, lithic reduction features, rockless pits filled with ash and charcoal, burned clay features, and dense scatters of faunal remains (Lintz et al. 2008; Nickels 2014; Tinsley and Dayton 2011). Baked clay, some with stick impressions, is a common feature at many of the sites recently surveyed and tested in north-central Texas (41TR170, 41DL203, 41DL436, and 41COL309), and researchers still do not know whether these remains reflect thermal elements used for cooking, intentionally thatched surfaces for dwellings, or something else (Bentley and Feit 2018; Lintz et al. 2008; Nickels 2014; Tinsley and Dayton 2011). Sites from this region are frequently characterized by abundant faunal remains and/or mussel shell, coupled with a dearth of lithic tools and tool debris. Although there is little evidence of sedentism and horticulture for Late Archaic peoples-- such as that which began to emerge in East and West Texas regions during this period-- these groups clearly used the area for camping, hunting and gathering, and likely adapted their environments to suit their needs (Tinsley and Dayton 2011). Late Prehistoric The transition from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric is evidenced by significant changes in technology and subsistence in the material record. The commonly held date for the beginning of this interval is 1200 BP, although there exists some degree of overlap between diagnostic tools and features that are considered Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric. Nonetheless, researchers see a distinct alteration in the material record over time, which can be mapped onto corresponding changes in lifeways. A hallmark of the transition from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric is the introduction of the bow and arrow, which enabled Indigenous hunters to pursue animals from greater distance. In north-central Texas arrow points such as the Alba, Catahoula, Steiner, and Scallorn are commonly seen at many Late Prehistoric sites (Prikryl 1990:58). Another climatic shift to dryer conditions occurred around 800 BP (AD 1150), which seems to have created more abundant grasslands which bison herds fed on, and which may account for the increase in bison remains represented on some sites of the Late Prehistoric II period. Technological expressions that enter the corresponding archeological record for this time include the diagnostic Perdiz point, alternately beveled bifaces, and specialized processing kits which are thought to be an adaptation to flourishing bison populations (Ricklis 1992). Increased reliance on bison hunting during the latter part of the Late Prehistoric period has been observed at some but not all Late Prehistoric sites excavated in north-central Texas (Nickels 2014; Tinsley and Dayton 2011).

There is also some evidence of early horticulture as Woodland Period sites of East Texas grew and influenced adjacent territories (Perttula 2004). Investigators at Site 41DL436 on Fish Creek Slough noted evidence of early horticulture and potentially intentional burning during the second phase of the Late Prehistoric period (Nickels 2014). Excavations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) revealed possible house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, burned corn, and grog-tempered ceramics, suggesting significant adaptive transitions during the Late Prehistoric period (Peter and McGregor 1988). Evidence from the Late Prehistoric Harrell site in the western portion of north-central Texas reveals extensive trade networks and influences between the Plains Villages of the High Plains and settled Caddo peoples of east Texas. However, the precise way in which those networks materialized in north-central Texas is still poorly understood. While some researchers posit cultural influences coming in from southern Plains groups to the north and west (Prikryl 1990), others see influences from Woodland and Caddo peoples to the east through both tools and ceramics (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). These conflicting interpretations coupled with data recovered from excavated cemeteries has led some to posit that the transition between Late Prehistoric I and Late Prehistoric II was “a time of upheaval and extreme violence” (Texas Beyond History 2002). Evidence from dozens of cemeteries throughout Texas and Oklahoma from AD 1000-1300 show signs of violent death, mutilation, and mass burials. All of this implies that densifying population, coupled with lower mobility and greater territoriality, interaction, and exchange occurred in the Late Prehistoric II period, but the precise ways that these forces affected the people and adaptive strategies in north-central Texas has yet to be fully explored. Historic Period Documentary sources indicate the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai, Yojaune, Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo occupied the north-central region at various times between AD 1500 and 1700 (Campbell 1983; Newcomb 1961). Prior to about AD 1725–1750, Apachean groups appear to have dominated the High Plains of Texas and Oklahoma, west of the Denton area. After that time, the area was increasingly controlled by the Comanche and Kiowa. Within the area encompassing Denton County, the Wichita tribes became dominant during the eighteenth century (Bell et al. 1967). The Wichita are believed to have been Caddoan language speakers who migrated south and westward from the Arkansas River Valley to settle around the Red River valley in the Southern High Plains sometime around the sixteenth century (Newcomb 1961). Subgroups of the Wichita include Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni, Taovaya, Iscani (Waco), all of which eventually amalgamated to form the Historic period Wichita Tribe. The Wichita were described by European observers as living in semi-fortified villages of grass huts, surrounded by fields where they grew maize, pumpkins, melons, beans, and squash. They are believed to have acquired horses from the New Mexico pueblos sometime around the early seventeenth century and this helped them refocus their subsistence and economy around bison, which became an important staple and trade item (Newcomb 1961). Europeans entered Texas starting around AD 1528 but did not settle there until around AD 1700 when the French built fur trading outposts among the native groups who occupied the Southern High Plains (Webb 1952). In the middle of the seventeenth century, the French helped negotiate an alliance between the Comanche and Wichita, who then built a trading post along the Red River known Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 16

in Texas as Spanish Fort, in Montague County. The Wichita continued to move southward during the eighteenth century, building settlements and trading posts along the Brazos and Trinity Rivers (Newcomb 1961). However, to date there is no evidence that any of these large Indigenous villages were in Denton County in the period between 1600 to 1800. Likewise, material evidence of early Spanish and French explorers moving through or settling in Denton County is missing (Odom 2010). It was not until Anglo settlers from the United States came in the 1840s that Denton County had any significant non-Indigenous presence. The Cross Timbers region was attractive to early Anglo settlers because of its abundant wildlife, timber, and water. Settlers from the Peters Colony began to inhabit this region in 1841 (Odom 2010). Denton County was carved out of Fannin County in 1846, and named after John B. Denton, a lawyer and military captain from Tennessee, who was killed in the battle of Village Creek in 1841 (Hoole 2010). In 1848, Frenchman Étienne Cabet started a “utopian” socialist community, the Icarian Colony, in the southwestern portion of the county; the community failed in less than a year and the site was abandoned (Davidson 2010). The town of Denton was first settled in 1857. However, it was not established with an official charter until after the Civil War in 1866. In 1881, the Texas and Pacific Railway from Sherman to Fort Worth, and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway from Denton to Dallas were completed, providing Denton railway access. Denton soon grew as an agricultural trade center with flour mills, cottonseed oil mills, and small cottage industries, like blacksmith and pottery shops. Texas Normal College (now University of North Texas) opened in 1890, followed in 1903 by Girls’ Industrial College (Texas Woman’s University). These two universities contributed to the economic growth and cultural expansion of Denton in the early twentieth century (Odom 2010). Denton Field, located 2.5 mi northeast of town, served as a training center for civilian pilots until World War II, when the focus was changed to training military pilots (Minor 1994). In the 1940s, a need for increased water storage capacity and additional flood control led the United States Congress to pass the River and Harbors Act of 1945, calling for additional construction in the Trinity River basin in Denton County. In 1948, the Corps of Engineers began development of Lewisville Lake near Denton, which would not only include Lake Dallas, but also impound Hickory Creek to the west, and Stewart, Panther, Cottonwood, Doe Branch, and Little Elm creeks to the east. The establishment of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport and the construction of Interstate 35 in the 1950s lead to a rapid influx of people to the Denton area (Odom 2010). Denton continues to expand rapidly as part of the larger Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. The lands surrounding both sites have historically been used for agricultural production. Other disturbances at site 41DN580 include a gas pipeline that runs east-west along the southern boundary of the site, installed between 2001 and 2005. Since 41DN580 was first recorded in 2014, a drainage basin has been excavated around the north and west sides of the previously delineated site area. Additionally, an existing sewer line runs east-west through the center of the site boundary. At the time of this testing and data recovery effort at site 41DN624, the surrounding property was until very recently under cultivation. The site also spans US 377 and the BNSF Railroad, which run from southwest to northeast across the site area. There are additional utility lines, including a gas pipeline that run parallel to these transportation facilities. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 17

4. M ETHODS Both testing and data recovery efforts involved mechanical trenching and scraping supplemented by hand excavated units. Backhoe trenches initially established the maximum depth and typical soil profile of each site and scraped the site areas down to the level of identified features at each site. During mechanical excavations, archeologists monitored and screened sediment, and excavations ceased in a specific local when features or cultural deposits were identified. Detailed methods used in each phase of the project are described below. Recovered artifacts and samples were sent to material specialists for detailed analyses; specific methods used by each of these experts are described in Chapters 7-12. Artifacts, excluding culled materials such as burned rock and soil, and project records will be curated at CAS in San Marcos. Testing Field Methods During testing, Acacia anticipated excavating up to five trenches placed arbitrarily across Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 within the project area to maximize data yield. During the initial machine excavations, new features and artifact concentrations were noted and flagged for more targeted hand- excavations. The trenches varied in size, depending on the depth of Holocene alluvium, features encountered, and presence of the water table. Trenches ranged in length from 7-19.5 m, and in width from 1.2-6 m. Trenches that were deeper than 1.5 m were widened and stepped to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines for trench safety. Survey data indicated that the top 60 cm (2 ft) of soil at both sites did not have intact archeological materials, and therefore, the upper 50-60 cm sediments were stripped from the excavation work area without screening. However, excavated soil below this level was closely inspected for evidence of cultural materials. Feature numbering at each site followed from Acacia’s 2020 survey work. Hence, at Site 41DN580, new features uncovered during testing began at Feature 3; while at Site 41DN624, new features uncovered during testing began at 2. Test units were placed within the trenches over features and in areas of dense artifacts. Acacia excavated eight 1 x 1 m units at 41DN580, and eight 1 x 1 m units and three 50 x 50 cm soundings at 41DN624 totaling approximately 5 m3 of hand excavated sediments at each site. All excavation units were dug in 10 cm levels, all soil from test units was screened through ¼-inch wire mesh. Shovel skimming was the primary excavation technique, with troweling and small tools used in instances where finer detail and provenience control was required (i.e., during feature excavations). All non-FCR artifacts were collected for analysis. Burned and FCR found in test units were counted and weighed in the field. Random samples of FCR from features were collected for analysis and curation. Investigators collected soil samples from within features as well as soil columns from contexts close to features to gather macrobotanical and other types of data aimed at paleoenvironmental reconstruction (Figure 4.1). Columns were placed off hand-excavated test units to supplement feature-focused samples and provide control samples. Soil columns were 25 x 25 cm in size and were excavated 5-cm levels.

Figure 4.1. Soil Samples collected during testing. Features, excavation units, trench corners, surface finds, and other topographic or geographic features were mapped using a Trimble RTK R10 Rover system with sub-centimeter accuracy. This same device, which provided real-time and accurate georeferenced coordinates and elevations for all points, was used to map local datums and elevations throughout both sites. Acacia also plotted and hand-mapped concentrations of in-situ artifacts and all features. Geoarcheological studies were led by Ken Lawrence of SWCA, Inc. to provide data for the interpretation of the integrity and depositional environment of sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 (see Chapter 7). This work involved onsite characterization of trench profiles and the collection of various samples from each site. Geoarcheologists collected bulk humate samples for subsequent analyses to provide chronometric data for the profile stratigraphy. Further geoarcheological analyses included the determination of laboratory-derived physical properties (e.g., texture), organic matter, magnetic susceptibility, particle size distribution, and calcium carbonate content. Acacia used the data gathered to assess whether these sites may be eligible for NRHP or SAL listing. Data Recovery Field Methods Data recovery methods generally followed the Testing methodologies outlined above. Additional documentation and collection methods were implemented; these are described below. Data recovery excavations at site 41DN580 commenced by mechanically removing the upper 1-1.5 m across the interceptor easement (Figure 4.2) and the subsequent excavation of 1 x 1 m units around newly identified features and regularly spaced control units along the length of the APE at Site 41DN580. At 41DN624, mechanical scraping was used to open wide exposures down to roughly 40-60 cm below the surface (Figure 4.3). As these wide exposures took up most of the ROW and were Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 19

much shallower than the trenches, these wide scrapings were labeled as Blocks. Deeper trenches were excavated within and around these blocks to capture the vertical extent of cultural materials. The scope of work called for hand excavation of a minimum of 25 m3 at each site. In addition to feature-focused units, control units were proposed along a transect line through the site at regular 5 m intervals. Going into the data recovery, investigators anticipated a large number of features to be identified during mechanical scraping, similar to the frequency and density excavated during testing.

unidentified features. Additional units were placed around these positive control units to fully expose identified features and the surrounding surfaces. In each unit, investigators size-sorted FCR from each level, counted and weighed them, and noted quantities and rock-type on level forms (Figure 4.4). A 10 percent sample of FCR from outside of feature contexts from each level of each unit was saved. Unburned gravels were noted and quantified when encountered but were not collected as these are unmodified and naturally occurring. All faunal remains, charcoal, mussel shell, ocher, and lithic debitage were saved from all contexts. Once features were identified (Figure 4.5), they were fully excavated by hand. First, features were uncovered, then measured, plan-mapped, and photographed for photogrammetry. Multiple elevations were taken using a Trimble RTK R10 Rover system with submeter accuracy for x, y, and z coordinates. Discrete features were then bisected to remove half the feature and examine the feature’s profile. Profiles were mapped and photographed again, then remaining FCR were removed, and the fill collected as bulk sediment samples. All feature rocks were then size graded, counted, and weighed. Size grading consisted of three categories: small (0-5 cm), medium (5-10 cm) and large (greater than 10 cm). At least 50 rocks representing all size classes from each feature were saved. When features contained fewer than 50 pieces of FCR, all rocks from that feature were saved. In cases where artifacts or burned rock distribution associated with features seemed to continue beyond the initial units, wherever feasible, unit excavations were expanded in that area to capture associated debris and activity areas around the feature surface. Multiple methods were used to record features. In addition to standard notes, hand-drawn plan and profile maps, and photographs, dozens of overlapping photos of each feature were taken and processed using photogrammetry software to create 3D digital models (Figures 4.6-4.7).

Figure 4.7. 3D Photogrammetry model of 41DN624 Feature 12. Laboratory Methods After fieldwork of each phase of the project was complete, all artifacts were brought to Acacia headquarters in Austin for processing. Non-FCR artifacts were first catalogued and washed in tap water with a soft brush to remove dirt particles. Once clean, these were left to dry before being bagged by provenience and artifact class. Each class of artifact was then sent to material specialists for in- depth analysis. The results of these analyses are presented in subsequent chapters of this report. Soil samples gathered in the field were likewise brought back to Acacia for processing through flotation in an attempt to obtain palaeobotanical remains and possible micro-artifacts (Figure 4.8). A standard two liters of matrix from each soil sample was floted to separate organic material (light fraction) from sediment and micro-artifacts (heavy fraction), if present. Acacia archeologists sorted and analyzed the heavy fraction using 5 and 8 diopter magnifying lenses. Naturally occurring gravels and inclusions were sorted from possible micro-artifacts, which were likewise sorted based on material type. Light fraction materials were preliminarily examined to identify possible carbonized and ancient organic remains. Samples with organic materials were sent to Leslie Bush for analysis (Chapter 12).

Figure 4.8. Acacia staff operating flotation machine. Research Domains and Questions for Data Recovery Precontact period sites found in north-central Texas are typically characterized by deeply buried archeological deposits (often associated with the rapidly aggrading Pilot Point formation and West Fork Paleosol) with a paucity of stone tools and flaking debris, but comparatively higher frequencies of faunal materials that commonly include freshwater mussel and turtle shells. Ash filled pits and baked clay lenses or features have also been identified at a number of the recently investigated sites of north-central Texas (e.g., 41DL203, 41TR170, 41DL436, 41COL309), all of which are Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric in age (Bentley and Feit 2018; Lintz et al. 2008; Nickels 2015; Tinsley and Dayton 2011). Due to a paucity of locally abundant lithic sources, lithic tools and tool debris from sites in north-central Texas tend to be highly curated and made from river gravels that come from outside the immediate area (Abbott 2011). Unusually, the Middle Archaic component of the nearby Calvert Site (41DN102) was made up primarily of locally sourced lithic materials. There are few burned rock middens in north-central Texas (41DN612 is a notable exception), and none of the scale and density as those found in the adjacent Edwards Plateau and West Texas areas. Several theories have been advanced to explain this pattern. One reason for the lack of burned rock middens in the area may be because the plant foods (such as agave, sotol, and other cacti) utilized in areas where burned rock middens frequently occur were not common in north-central Texas. A second interpretation focuses on the link between burned rock middens and the processing of acorns, which some believe requires limestone to leach the acids from the acorns. By contrast, the bedrock found in the oak savannahs of north Texas is typically sandstone and is chemically inert (Prikryl 1990). In either case, the natural and cultural factors that allowed such middens to proliferate appear to be absent in the region. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 25

The emerging picture is that prevailing environmental conditions of north-central Texas in the Middle to Late Holocene were unique and so were the adaptive strategies among Native American peoples who lived in the region. But other factors almost certainly contributed to the unique suite of features, archeological remains, and site types found in north-central Texas. Recent investigations of precontact period sites in north-central Texas have begun to create a more detailed picture of local Indigenous land use, social behaviors, and environmental conditions of the Late Holocene (see Lintz et al. 2008; Nickels 2014; Nielsen et al. 2021; Tinsley and Dayton 2011; also, Ferring & Yates 1997, 1998). The majority of known sites in north-central Texas date to the Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric periods. However, very few sites with contextual integrity are known from earlier periods, and to date only two Middle Archaic period sites, 41DN102 (Calvert Site) and 41DN20, have been investigated. In the case of 41DN20, the Middle Archaic component was limited and heavily mixed with an Early Archaic component, making it difficult to separate materials and features reflecting several thousand years of site use (Ferring and Yates 1998). In the case of the Calvert Site (41DN102), dating of the Middle Archaic component was based entirely on projectile point styles and relative stratigraphy, not radiocarbon dates. Thus, archeologists’ understanding of Middle Archaic lifeways of north-central Texas and its chronology is still somewhat tentative (Ferring and Yates 1997). Based primarily on lithic, faunal, and feature evidence from a Middle Archaic component of the Calvert Site, Ferring and Yates (1997) posited that the Indigenous peoples of the north-central Texas Middle Archaic were highly mobile, with territories that crossed diverse physiographies. Faunal subsistence focused on hunting deer and small game such as rabbits and canids, and capturing fish, turtles, and other aquatic species. Compared to Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components of the Calvert and other sites in the region, animal processing may have been less intensive, involving butchering and cooking large elements directly over a fire, as opposed to boiling and cracking for marrow extraction. However, these hypotheses about the Middle Archaic Indigenous lifeways of the Trinity River drainage basin were formulated with limited data from just one site. More than twenty years later, almost no new investigations of the Middle Archaic have occurred. Consequently, archeologists fundamentally know very little about even the basics of human culture and adaptation in the Trinity River Basin area before 3800 BP. For this reason alone, data recovery investigations at Site 41DN580 have enormous potential to fill in the tableau for the Middle Archaic period in north-central Texas. Data from Site 41DN580 and 41DN624 resonate to some degree with the general cultural outline posited by Ferring and Yates from their work at Sites 41DN102 and 41DN20. The multiple small thermal features associated with a limited lithic and faunal assemblage certainly suggest short term, but reoccurring occupations along Hickory Creek. And the preponderance of mussel shell at both sites, with very little lithic and faunal materials suggest that there may have been a focus on aquatic resources, as opposed to hunting large game. The few burned faunal specimens collected from features at Site 41DN580 were highly burned, which superficially tracks with Ferring and Yates data set. The primary goals of gathering more data from site 41DN580 is to develop a more robust baseline for the Middle Archaic and also to better dialogue with Ferring and Yates initial culture- behavior model for this period. Notably, the Middle Archaic artifact assemblages from 41DN580 and 41DN102 are compositionally distinct.

represented by a single hearth feature with faunal remains (over 20 identified taxa) and lithic production debitage. However, 41ND580 has numerous small hearths and exceedingly few lithics or faunal remains other than mussel shell. Along with other distinguishing characteristics, this suggests distinct site use patterns and could further indicate differences in local resource availability, site seasonality or length of use, different group sizes or cultural traditions, temporal differences, etc. During archeological testing, the questions Acacia sought to answer for Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 involved first assessing where precisely the sites fit into the chronological framework for north-central Texas, whether they have single or multiple components; and if the latter, are those components discernibly different in content and context. These basic questions are answerable for both sites, which have multiple components. From these basic questions, we formulated higher order theoretical frameworks aimed at understanding how Indigenous peoples of the region were using the landscape and its resources during the periods of occupation. We posited that if sites like 41DN580 and 41DN624 represent short- term seasonal camps of small groups on their way to someplace else, the archeological assemblage would allow us to estimate the limits of population territories. We also hypothesized that it may be possible to estimate the size of the groups that camped at these sites, based on the number and size of features and the size/extent of the artifact assemblages. Further, if these groups were highly mobile over large territories, what made these locations along Hickory Creek a place where people returned to again and again. And finally, we hoped to address if land use and resource focus changed over time from the Middle Archaic to later periods and, if so, what could explain those changes. The results of field investigations along with subsequent analyses were used to address these hypotheses. Results are presented in Chapters 5-14, while interpretations and a discussion of how our data address these hypotheses is presented in Chapter 15.

5. R F I 41DN580 ESULTS OF IELD NVESTIGATIONS AT Site 41DN580 is on the south side of a bend in Hickory Creek in a formerly level floodplain (Figure 5.1). Across the creek to the north, rolling hills overlook the floodplain. From both testing and data recovery efforts at 41DN580, Acacia archeologists excavated a combined total of 32.38 m3 of sediment across 83 test units, identifying a total of 19 features (Figures 5.2-5.5; Table 5.1). The majority of these are Archaic period clusters of FCR with small amounts of associated faunal material (primarily freshwater mussel shells). A full description of each feature is presented below, and the results of specialized analysis of each artifact category are presented in the following chapters. Recent infrastructure improvements have significantly altered the landscape surrounding the currently defined site boundaries. These include an existing sewer line that runs east-west through the field just south of the site area, and a gas line that runs from northwest to southeast west of the site. Additionally, in 2017-2018 the new Bonnie Brae Road and bridge were constructed roughly 100- m west of the site. As part of this work, a large water detention pond was excavated around the west and north sides of the then defined site area. In wet years like 2021, the detention pond holds water for months at a time and evidence of erosion around the edges of the pond was evident. Aquatic species and water birds (notably heron) were abundant during these periods. In dry years, as in 2022, it is possible to walk and drive large vehicles across the area and fewer faunal species were observed. During dry periods, too, one can see artifacts (mostly FCR) eroding from the sloping banks and across the bottom of the artificial detention pond. The presence of these artifacts suggests the site originally extended beyond its present boundaries and outside of the current APE. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 28

Testing During the initial site visit prior to Acacia’s testing effort, archeologists noted large quantities of FCR and other cultural materials eroding from the bank of the recently constructed detention pond. Acacia point-plotted observed surface artifacts using the Trimble and collected diagnostic materials (including lithic tools). In addition to FCR, these surface finds include the base of a Marshall-like dart point, a chert flake, a mano, and mussel shell. A Kent-like point was found in this same location of the site during Acacia’s previous survey work (Feit 2021b). It is clear that site 41DN580 originally extended beyond the current interceptor APE and into the newly constructed pond, whose depth extends below the level of recorded features. For the testing phase, investigators mechanically excavated three large trenches in the interceptor easement (A, B, and C) covering a total area of approximately 250 m2 (Figure 5.2). The three trenches exhibited similar soil profiles, except along the bank of the detention pond where the A-horizon had been scraped away (see Chapter 7). Acacia excavated units with a total volume of 6.68 m3 (Table 5.1). Through these testing efforts, archeologists identified and investigated eight features, two previously identified during Acacia’s survey and six new FCR features (Features 1-8). Only one of these, Feature 3, represents the remains of an earth oven. The remaining features were all small clusters of FCR that had little evidence of burning and relatively little associated material. A total of 30 soil samples were collected, as well as six carbon and four FCR samples. Seven of the soil samples and all FCR and carbon samples were taken from features. At the southern end of the site, Acacia opened Trench A (6 x 19.5 m) between the existing sewer line and gas pipeline. Mechanically excavated to 2.4 m below the surface, it hit the top of the water table and began filling quickly. Additionally, significant rains occurred over the course of testing efforts, flooding the trench with over a meter of water which it retained even after being pumped out. Units 5-7 were initially opened in Trench A, and these encountered Feature 5. However, due to the heavy rains and issues with water, Trench A was inundated above the elevation of the units for several days (Figure 5.6). Once accessible, Feature 5 was fully excavated.

Figure 5.6. Trench A filled with water, facing south. North of Trench A, Trench B (7.6 x 3.6 m) was scraped back from the pond bank to expose FCR seen eroding about 1.5 m below the ordinary ground surface. Unlike Trenches A and C, the Trench B profile lacked the dark clay A-horizon, which had been completely removed and truncated during the course of the detention pond construction (Chapter 7). Five 1 x 1 m units were excavated within Trench B (Units 1-4, 10) laid out over the exposed FCR. This block of contiguous units uncovered Features 3, 4, 6, and 8 (described below). Located between Trenches A and B, Trench C (5 x 10 m) opened onto the bank of the detention pond in an attempt to capture features related to materials seen eroding from the bank. Within Trench C, archeologists excavated Units 8 and 9 over a single visible concentration of sandstone FCR. Designated Feature 7, this is a small cluster of FCR associated with mussel shell and a single chert flake. No other features were observed within Trench C. Data Recovery During data recovery, Acacia machine scraped an area of about 890 m2 of the interceptor easement in three large trench blocks (D, E, and F). Trenches D-F filled the areas between the sewer and gas lines and the previously excavated trenches. Machine excavations generally stopped between 1-1.5 m below the existing ground surface, at or just above the level of previously identified cultural deposits. Newly exposed features were identified and flagged for excavation. Although 11 new features were identified and documented, overall artifact recovery was low. Stone tool and tool debris, as well as faunal remains were primarily confined to one area of the site. While mussel shells were present throughout the site (typically associated with features), the preservation of these materials is poor. The same can be said for other organic remains. Carbonized organic materials and burned soil were sparse and found only in the largest and densest features; no macro-botanical remains were evident in any of the contexts investigated.

Overall, the machine scraping revealed fewer features than expected based on testing. To respond to these unanticipated field conditions, Acacia placed large blocks of contiguous 1 x 1 m units in areas where features were not visible in the hopes of identifying still buried features. In the end, Acacia exceeded the volumetric goal of 25 m3, excavating 73 total 1 x 1 m units for a total volume of 27.3 m3. Over the course of data recovery fieldwork, Acacia made minor adjustments to the originally proposed field methods and level of effort in response to the actual conditions encountered, and the THC was notified of these adjustments through email updates. At the southern end of the site area and just north of an existing gas pipeline, Trench D (24 x 16 m) was the largest trench opened at 41DN580 (Figure 5.5). Twenty-nine units were excavated in this trench (Units 11-39), uncovering five small features (Features 9-13). Unlike the features at the northern end of the site, the features in Trench D were all loose scatters of FCR without a clear pattern. The Trench D features cluster into two elevations, 172.9-173.0 m above mean sea level (amsl) (Features 9 and 10) and 172.6-172.7 m amsl (Features 11-13). Across all contexts in this trench, archeologists recovered and collected 134 grams (g) of shell, 14 lithics, and 153 pieces of FCR. Trench E, roughly 16 x 17 m, opened onto the detention pond bank between Trenches A and C (Figures 5.4, 5.7). Four features were recorded in and around this trench (Features 14-17) and a total of 31 units were excavated in and around the trench (Units 40-66, and 84-85). Although no dates are available for Features 15, 16, and 17, their elevations (approximately 1.5-2 m below the current surface) indicate they likely belong in the Middle Archaic. These appear similar to other features across the site, and comprise a loose scatter of FCR, a cluster of FCR, and an earth oven or rock-lined pit. The associated artifact assemblage is also similar, comprising 82 collected pieces of FCR, 74.7 g of mussel shell, 1 lithic, and a single piece of faunal bone. Figure 5.7. Trench E in the foreground, facing north. In addition to the anticipated Middle Archaic component, during mechanical scraping of Trench E, investigators noted whole mussel shell and faunal bone occurring roughly 15-30 cm below the surface in a defined area. Acacia excavated 16 units to explore this site component, originally identified as Feature 14 (Units 40-51, 64-68, 84-85). These upper units yielded 93% (168.8 g) of all faunal Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 37

bone, 92% of lithic material (including 5 of the 7 recovered points and tools), and all the ceramic material from 41DN580. This site component is discussed in greater detail below. Trench F (20 x 12 m) opened the area between Trenches B and C along the detention pond bank (Figure 5.3). Unlike every other trench, however, no features were visible after the mechanical scraping. Acacia archeologists opened a contiguous block of 12 units (Units 69-80) and two control units (Units 81-82) in an attempt to identify as yet invisible features. Two small features were identified through these efforts, Features 18 and 19. Feature 18 is unlike others at the site, in that it comprises a pile of mussel shells from a single meal and a lithic tool directly associated, with very few FCR. Feature 19 is a small scatter of FCR. Unit 83 expanded off Unit 81 to capture these features. In total, while only two very small features were identified in Trench F, 18 lithic artifacts, 127 pieces of FCR, and 786 g of shell were recovered from excavations. These materials primarily came from Units 69-80 and are at the same level as most of the features documented in other trenches, suggesting this could be an associated activity area or even the scattered remains of previous features. Features at 41DN580 In total, Acacia investigated nineteen features at site 41DN580. This includes two small features that were discovered during Acacia’s initial survey in 2020, and 17 additional features that were excavated during testing and data recovery efforts. These include six Category 1 and seven Category 2 features, two earth ovens, and two unclassified features. Descriptions of each feature documented during testing and data recovery efforts are presented below. Feature 3 Feature 3 is a circular cluster of FCR arranged around a central circular depression, a Category 3 feature (Figures 5.8-5.9; Tables 5.5- 5.5). During testing, Acacia archeologists noticed FCR eroding from the feature into the detention pond and subsequently opened Trench B and five 1 x 1 m test units, Units 1-4 and 10, around this feature. The amount of FCR eroding from the pond bank probably indicates that the feature originally extended further to the north. Artifacts associated with Feature 3 that were eroding on the surface include a partial Marshall dart point (Figure 5.10), FCR scattered across the bank, and Figure 5.8. 41DN580 Feature 3 excavated in Unit 10 and exposed on surface, facing west.

a Kent-like point previously recorded during the survey (Figure 5.11; Feit 2021b). The Marshall point is made of Uvalde chert and the tip was broken by an impact fracture (Chapter 8). FCR comprising the feature is mostly tabular sandstone, but irregular and rounded limestone rocks are also present. All are highly burned and discolored pinkish red color, and many cracked in place. Many of the smaller rocks appear to be spalls from the larger rocks. It is possible that Features 4 and 6 are rake-out piles from this central thermal feature, but this interpretation remains tentative. Two radiocarbon assays from Feature 3 returned slightly different age ranges. Burned bone collected as Sample 15 (Beta No. 595861) returned dates at 3590 ± 30 BP, with calibrated dates at 3980- 3829 (93.9%) and 3788-3777 (1.5%) cal BP (calibrated at 2σ with IntCal20 [Ramsey 2009; Reimer et al. 2020]). Sample 19 (Beta No. 595860) was charcoal and returned dates at 4050 ± 30 BP, with calibrated ranges at 4616-4421 (92.5%) and 4786-4767 (2.9%) cal BP (Ramsey 2009; Reimer et al. 2020). This less than 500-year discrepancy could be caused by many factors, but in either case places the feature at the end of the Middle Archaic period. Additionally, paleobotanical analysis (Bush, Chapter 12) identified carbonized hardwood (species indeterminate) and chenopod seed fragments (Chenopodium sp., aka Goosefoot) from this feature. Chenopod seeds as well as the greens are edible, although they must be processed (typically cooked) prior to consumption to remove nitrates and other toxins (Texas Beyond History 2023). These are common and typically available from early spring through early fall. Like most features and excavation units, the majority of faunal remains near Feature 3 are fragmented freshwater mussel shell. The shells fragments are very friable and most do not appear to have any signs of human modification. A representative sample of shells is presented in Figure 5.12.

Feature 4 Feature 4 is a small concentration of FCR extending slightly into the east wall of Unit 2 (Figure 5.13; Tables 5.6-5.7). Nine rocks appear to have been placed on a single, flat surface, indicating Feature 4 belongs to Category 2. No other discoloration or clear signs of burning were observed in or around Feature 4, but a soil sample was collected nonetheless from matrix in and under the feature. This feature is approximately 1.6 m southeast of Feature 3 and at a similar elevation. Given this and the lack of soil discoloration or evidence of burning at this location, it may be a rake out or discard pile associated with Feature 3. The materials associated with Feature 4 are like those near Feature 3 and include primarily FCR from the feature and mussel shell fragments (e.g., Figure 5.12). The two lithics from this context are small tertiary flakes with no signs of use-wear (specimens 37-01 and 37-02; see Chapter 8). Figure 5.13. 41DN580 Feature 4 shown facing east.

Table 5.7. Summary of Feature 4. Feature Size (cm) Elevation (m) Assoc. Units 4 35 x 20 173.322 2 Feature 5 Feature 5 is the only feature in Trench A (Figure 5.14; Tables 5.8-5.9). Units 5-7 were opened to explore this Category 2 feature. However, heavy rains flooded Trench A and it retained water for several days. Once the water had drained enough for archeologists to enter, the rest of the feature was excavated. The soil surrounding the FCR was visibly discolored, likely by an intense thermal event. FCR size ranged from 5-15 cm. Acacia collected soil samples, FCR, and a charcoal sample from this feature, as well as scatters of mussel shell fragments, and two lithics. The two lithics, specimens 15-01 and 13-01, are one secondary and one is a tertiary flake, both Edwards Plateau chert with modification and use-wear (see Chapter 8; Figure 5.15). Carbonized organic material was identifiable as hardwood, as well as dewberry cane (Rubus sp.) (see Bush, Chapter 12). The cane is especially interesting as dewberry is not only a seasonal food, but the cane can be used for basketry and fiber products, suggesting possible activities taking place here. Organic material (Beta No. 595859) returned a calibrated date of conventional dates at 4450 ± 30 BP, with calibrated 2σ ranges at 5142-5960 (52.5%), 5285-5161 (41.2%), 4927.4914 (1%), 4895-4886 (0.7%) cal BP (Ramsey 2009; Reimer et al. 2020).

Feature 6 Feature 6 is a circular cluster of FCR set in a single layer with FCR ranging in size from 5 to 15 cm thick (Figure 5.16; Tables 5.10-5.11). Most FCR were tabular sandstone slabs with a red/orange hue. The feature also yielded a small amount of mussel shell, and a single tertiary chert flake fragment from within it. Bisected east-west, the southern half of the feature was collected as two soil samples and removed. This is possibly a rake out pile for Feature 3 given its proximity (1.4 m southwest), although Feature 6 had a well-defined shape and structure, it was placed within feature Category 2. The FCR and mussel shell fragments are like those recovered from nearby contexts (see Figure 5.12). There is one flake recovered from just below the level of the feature (Table 5.11; Figure 5.17). It is a tertiary flake on Edwards Plateau chert with moderate use-wear (specimen 23-01; Chapter 8). Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 44

While discussed in future chapters, if Feature 3 was an earth oven designed for slow roasting/steaming some particular foodstuffs, the duration of that process could necessitate additional meals be eaten in the meantime. In short, this could be a separate cook-fire associated with the same event as Feature 3. It could also be coincidence, or even that the stones from one feature or the other were reused to make a new feature on a separate visit.

Figure 5.17. Specimen 23-01, tertiary flake from near Feature 6. Feature 7 Much like Feature 6, Feature 7 falls into Category 2 and is composed of a single layer of FCR arranged in a tight circular cluster (Figure 5.18; Tables 5.12-5.13). Near the southern edge of Trench C, Units 8 and 9 were opened to explore this feature. Once excavated, Feature 7 did not have a depression, nor was there any notable discoloration in the soil around the feature. The FCR comprising Feature 7 are limestone, breccia, and sandstone. FCR ranges in size from 5 cm to up to 20 cm in size. Figure 5.18. 41DN580 Feature 7. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 46

A few FCR are cracked in place and many others are clearly fire-reddened. Associated materials were very sparse, although investigators recovered a large Edwards chert scraper with heavy use-wear just outside the feature (Figure 5.19; Chapter 8).

high thermal environment (e.g., Neubauer 2018; Chapter 14). While most of the other features encountered during this testing project consisted of burned tabular sandstone, these limestone rocks are lumpy and irregularly shaped, which could also suggest that rocks were cooled by water in stone boiling activities. There is no identifiable basin or pit shape to the feature. Acacia collected three samples of carbonized material– two from between the FCR and one from just outside the feature. One sample (Beta No. 595858) returned conventional dates at 4470 ± 30 BP, with calibrated 2σ ranges at 5289-5155 (50.6%), 5148-5025 (35.5%), and 5014-4975 (9.3%) cal BP (Ramsey 2009; Reimer et al. 2020). This date is comparable to Feature 5. Samples were also sent to Bush (Chapter 12) for paleobotanical analysis; material from Feature 8 includes carbonized hardwood.

Materials recovered from around Feature 8 are extremely similar to materials in the surrounding features and units. In addition to the small fragments of mussel shell (e.g., Figure 5.21), one small tertiary flake was collected from just above the feature elevation (specimen 6-01). Ayala notes it has light, unidirectional use-wear but is otherwise unremarkable (Chapter 8). Figure 5.21. Sample of shell from unit surrounding Feature 8. Feature 9 Feature 9, approximately 150 cm below ground surface in Trench D, is a nonpatterned scatter of small FCR belonging to Category 1. The rocks are mostly irregularly shaped limestone that are so heavily burned they have lost integrity and crumble upon contact (Figure 5.22; Tables 5.16-5.17). The amorphous nature of the feature suggests it is a hearth remnant or possibly the result of stone boiling activities. This is supported by an absence of charcoal, bone, and burned earth at the feature. Mussel shell fragments were recovered in test units around Feature 9, although at relatively low frequencies. 41DN580 Feature 9 was in the northwest corner of a block of 17 contiguous units, Units 11-27. Small to very small, scattered pieces of FCR were found in adjacent units at the same elevation as Feature 9 but lacked feature patterning. Given the relative lack of integrity or discernable profile, this feature was not bisected. However, Acacia took two soil samples from immediately under the FCR.

Feature 10 On the northeast side of Trench D, Feature 10 is a loosely defined scatter of burned limestone and sandstone FCR (Category 1) (Figure 5.23; Tables 5.18-5.19). It was first identified during the initial mechanical scraping, and 5 excavation units were placed around it with the goal of exposing additional elements of the feature. However, the feature was limited in size and integrity. FCR are primarily limestone and are arranged in a single layer or on a single surface. Some are cracked in place and fire reddened. Like Feature 9, the feature’s shape is amorphous. Mussel shell fragments were recovered in all test units around Feature 10, although again in relatively low quantities compared with features excavated during testing. Due to the undefined shape, this feature was not bisected, but all FCR and soil from under the FCR were collected as samples. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 50

Survey and testing data indicated that site 41DN580 was primarily a Middle Archaic site whose features were buried approximately 1.5 to 2 m below the surface. However, during mechanical scraping at Block E prior to data recovery excavations, investigators noted whole mussel shell pieces and faunal bone appearing only 15-30 cm below the surface in a single discrete area. Many of these were complete or nearly complete shell halves, and several exhibit signs of modification Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 54

(Figure 5.27; Chapter 11). Therefore, Acacia placed a total of sixteen 1 x 1 m units – Units 40-51, 64-68, and 84-85 – within this upper component to explore its integrity and extent. These units were arranged in two large contiguous excavation blocks, the first encompassing units 42-49, and the second units 40, 41, 50, 51, and 64-68. This component appears to be a relatively discrete activity area. Acacia placed Units 84 and 85 approximately 10 m northeast of Units 64-68 to determine the limits of this component. We recovered almost no material from these units, with only one piece of mussel shell and one small faunal bone fragment recorded. Further, Acacia recorded no evidence of this component during mechanical excavations or profile examinations in Trenches D and F. At least within the Interceptor easement, this upper component appears to be relatively isolated around the north side of Trench E. This site component is a thin scatter of cultural material between 174.6 and 174.43 m amsl (Figure 5.28). Small bits of burned clay were scattered across this ancient surface along with a very minute flecks of carbon. The artifacts from this upper component make up the vast majority of all recovered material from the site. This component yielded 87% (168.8 g) of faunal bone, 69% of lithic material (n=102, including 5 points or tools) (Figure 5.29), and all of the ceramic material (Figure 5.30). The faunal remains (n=459) include unidentified large and medium mammal bones, notably American beaver and white-tailed deer, as well as turtle remains (see Chapter 10). Most of the turtle carapace fragments were significantly burned and were very small in size. Ramsey and Jacobson identified that all bones with clear evidence of butchering from the site were recovered from this site component (Chapter 10). Moreover, 93 bones showed carnivore modification. Although difficult to determine with certainty, it is possible this represents the presence of domesticated dogs. Only 40% of recovered mussel shell came from this provenience but given that only 16 of the 73 units at site 41DN580 targeted the upper component, it still constitutes a notable shell to volume ratio. Thirty-two of the shells and fragments exhibit modifications (see Figure 5.27; Chapter 11). Some have been used for scraping, others have been cut into angular pieces, and several exhibit evidence of battering and notching. There are lateral abrasions on the exterior of several of these specimens that suggest use as tools; cut specimens without use-wear may be adornment preforms. One small, polished bone fragment is possibly from a bone needle or awl (Figure 5.31). This artifact is a highly polished, tapered cylinder with a clean snap fracture on the narrow end, and a step fracture on the wide end. Along one surface is a cut or scraped section. This needle fragment was associated with large, modified shell fragments with heavy battering and polish. Together, it’s possible these artifacts indicate hide processing was taking place here. Also worth noting is that the mussel shell species represented in this component appears to be different from that represented in the Middle Archaic component. Although most specimens are not complete enough to identify to the species level, species in the upper component include threeridge, yellow sandshell, bank climber, bleufer, and Texas lilliput, while the predominant Archaic period species, notably from Feature 18 (see below), are Texas lilliput. This difference in species breadth in each assemblage could be a function of differential preservation. However, it could also signal a shift in resource focus over time, as it fits broader site patterning across the north-central Texas region (Todd 2014). This upper component is the only area of the site where ceramic sherds were present. Fifty- nine ceramic sherds were collected from this site component. These are relatively thick, heavily Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 55

burned on one or both sides, and very brittle. They appear to be completely oxidized and heavily tempered with ground shell. This is consistent with Late Prehistoric and early Contact period ceramics from the north-central Texas region known as Nocona Plain ware, and possibly relate to the still poorly defined Henrietta Phase (see Chapter 9). Acacia collected a number of charcoal samples from the upper component; these were sent to Beta Analytic for processing. The results are presented in Table 5.26 (Ramsey 2009; Reimer et al. 2020). These radiocarbon dates place this component solidly within the Late Prehistoric period. Additionally, two macrobotanical samples included ash wood charcoal (Fraxinus sp.), black walnut nutshell (Juglans nigra), and walnut wood charcoal (Juglans sp.) (see Bush, Chapter 11). Figure 5.27.

Acacia initially identified this feature during mechanical scraping that caught the west edge of the feature. The damage was very minor, and overall integrity of this feature is excellent. The main part of the feature is about 100 x 60 cm in size and consists of clustered, stacked, tabular burned sandstone rocks, many of which are heavily burned and cracked in situ (Table 5.29). Thin flakes of this sandstone were actively sloughing off during excavation. It is evident that most of the rocks comprising this feature were originally medium to large in size, with the largest rocks originally measuring up to 27 cm in maximum length. The large rocks were placed along the outside edges of the feature and smaller to medium sized rocks used to fill in the center. Archeologists placed four units, Units 58, 59, 62, and 63 (Table 5.30), around Feature 16, which was bisected roughly north/south and profiled.

carbon sample was collected from just below the feature’s FCR. A soil sample was also collected from this area. While difficult to see in resulting photographs, Feature 16 FCR were slightly canted inwards to an off-center depression. This is not as pronounced as other earth ovens uncovered by Acacia, nor was the FCR stacked as deep. Feature 16 appears more like a rock-lined pit or griddle than it does an earth oven. The dominance of large sandstone tablets lends additional credence to the interpretation of this feature as a griddle. Functionally, a rock-lined pit is in the same ‘family’ as an earth oven. Rocks are quite literally used to line a depression or pit and a fire is lit above. These features are designed to increase heat retention and reduce fuel usage. While typically interpreted as cooking features, these could also result from other behaviors (used for warmth, sweat baths, etc.). Griddles, on the other hand, would have been constructed around the center of the heating element, possibly over coals, and foodstuffs would have been placed directly on the hot rocks.

A small cluster of FCR in Category 2, this feature comprises chunky, irregularly shaped limestone. While excavators hoped the feature would extend into and under the remaining pond bank, this was not born out in excavation. The sediment surrounding the feature was loose and silty, presumably newly deposited from receding water in the detention basin. Additionally, the rocks comprising the feature were loose and small, suggesting that Feature 17 has low integrity. The only artifacts associated with the feature were 1.5 g of mussel shell fragments. While it was bisected on a north/south axis, it was not photographed for photogrammetry because of its overall lack of integrity. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 61

top of one another within an area of about 50-70 cm (Figures 5.36-5.38; Tables 5.33-5.34). Scattered, small to medium pieces of FCR ring the shell drop area, and while not in a clear cluster or pattern, are certainly associated with the same ancient surface. The feature was excavated in Unit 83, which was expanded to the east and south to capture the whole feature up to the trench wall. On the east edge of the feature, and immediately abutting the trench wall, archeologists observed a circle of discolored soil. This stain contains a darker, looser sediment which excavators believe may represent a small ash pile. It is possible that this could represent a posthole, although the shape (with a curved or dome-shaped profile) is not believed to fit this interpretation. Acacia collected a sample of this discolored soil for further analysis. Macrobotanical analysis of the light fraction from this sample revealed vervain seed and grasses, but not a great deal of other paleobotanical information. Nearly all of the mussel shell recovered from this feature are Toxolasma texasiense (Texas lilliput) (see Chapter 11; Figure 5.38). This possibly indicates both environmental conditions and foraging choice. In addition to the mussel shell, 5 faunal bone fragments were recovered from this feature. All are identified as medium or large mammal bones (Chapter 10). However, this feature could not be fully explored as it extended into the trench wall. Within the shell drop area southwest of the discolored soil, excavators uncovered an Edwards Plateau chert unifacial tool with wear along one edge (Figures 5.33, 5.39; Chapter 8). Ayala (Chapter 8) indicates this may have been a hafted scraper or adze, giving us tantalizing insights into specific tool use. This heavily utilized but relatively small tool could have been hafted and used to forage and collect mussel shells from the creek, and/or to open them once back in camp. Together, these data lead us to believe this feature is the result of a single episode, interpreted as discard pile of processed, cooked, and consumed mussels.

Figure 5.39. Specimen 338-01 from Feature 18, scraper of Edwards Chert. Photo by Ayala, Chapter 8. Feature 19 Acacia originally identified this Category 1 feature in profile as a small cluster of FCR at the base of a control unit, Unit 81 (Figure 5.40; Table 5.35-5.36). Excavators therefore placed an additional unit (83) immediately to the east to explore this feature’s potential. Unit 83 first encountered Feature 18, and upon further excavation revealed Feature 19 to be an exceptionally small and poorly defined cluster of FCR and mussel shell fragments. Archeologists also documented small, unmodified river gravels around this feature. However, this feature is exciting because, although it is very scattered, it is one of the lowest in elevation at the site (172.729 m amsl), and it produced both a bone fragment and dart point. The point (Specimen 424-01) is a small, light grey chert biface with heavy patina and mineral buildup (Figure 5.41). The mineral buildup is thick enough to almost appear like cortex in some areas. The point has a triangular body with gently convex lateral edge, weak shoulders, and expanding stem. The base is slightly convex as well. Manufactured on novaculite, it is a Kent type dart point (see Chapter 8). Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 66

Figure 5.41. Kent dart point from Feature 19 (Photo by Ayala, Chapter 8). Summary In sum, Acacia’s efforts at 41DN580 resulted in the identification of 19 features through the excavation of 32.38 m3 across 85 units in six trenches (Table 5.37). These features represent two major components dating to the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. A total of 694 pieces of FCR, 299 g of mussel shell, 148 lithics, 388 faunal bone fragments, and 59 ceramic sherds were collected (Appendix B). Two of these features fit into Category 3, meaning they are formal cooking features, one a rock- lined roasting pit and the other a more typical earth oven. Seven features are identified as Category 2 clusters of FCR that, while clearly the remains of discrete events, do not have the formal characteristics of the cook features from Category 3. Archeologists identified six features within Category 1, and these represent loose, nonpatterned scatters of FCR. Additionally, there are two features whose primary expression was not through FCR and so they do not fit well within the categories defined by Acacia for analytical purposes. These are Feature 14, which was later identified as a separate Late Prehistoric site component, and Feature 18, which is a cluster of mussel shells.

6. R F I 41DN624 ESULTS OF IELD NVESTIGATIONS AT Roughly a kilometer southeast of 41DN580, site 41DL624 is on the south/west floodplain of Hickory Creek (Figure 6.1). At 41DN624 Acacia excavated 13 features through a combined total of 25.32 m3 in 66, 1 x 1 m test units, as well as eight 50 x 50 cm control units (Figures 6.2-6.5; Table 6.1). The site area spans US 377 and the BNSF railroad, which bisects the site from northeast to southwest. This extremely level plane has been used for agricultural production for at least the past six decades, if not longer. However, while mowed, the field was not under active cultivation during excavation efforts. Known disturbances near the site include the railroad, built in the late 1800s, and US 377, which was commissioned in the 1930s. Multiple utility lines parallel these transportation routes. There is also a gas pipeline that runs just outside the site boundary to the west. All of these infrastructure developments are subject to ongoing maintenance and upkeep.

site boundary. These testing investigations uncovered very different sets of remains on the north side of US 377 from the south side, likely representing different ages as well. While originally recorded as a single site, given the knowledge of hindsight, 41DN624 should probably be divided into two separate sites. Therefore, the following discussion breaks the site into two areas: 41DN624.1 representing the remains on the north side of US 377, and 41DN624.2 representing the remains on the south side of US 377 (see Figure 6.2). Acacia’s testing efforts opened Trenches A, B, and C at 41DN624.1 on the north side of US 377 while Trenches D, E, F, and G are on the south side at 41DN624.2. In total across both sites, testing efforts excavated eight 1 x 1 m test units along with three 50 x 50 cm control units. Acacia hand- excavated a total of 5.05 m3, with another 1.93 m3 of soil collected from column samples. Artifacts collected include a total of 15 lithics (mostly small chert flakes, no formal tools), 853 pieces of mussel shell, and 2 faunal bone fragments. At 41DN624.1, archeologists excavated Trenches A, B, and C and recorded two features (Features 1 and 2). Trench A (4.5 x 9.5 m) was shallow, mechanically scraped down to 1.35 m below the surface. Feature 1 was exposed at the bottom of Trench A but was repeatedly submerged during heavy rains. Due to the standing water for the duration of fieldwork, Feature 1 was cataloged, but not investigated. Briefly, this feature was characterized by an amorphous collection of 7-8 medium to large sized tabular FCR scattered across an area about a meter in diameter. The feature did not exhibit a discrete shape, nor was there any soil discoloration or associated materials. This was the only feature observed in Trench A. 41DN624.1 Trench B extended off the west side of Trench A and was mechanically excavated to a depth of about 3.3 m below the surface (Figure 6.6). Archeologists observed Feature 2 in Trench B at about 1.3 m below surface (171.592 amsl) and excavated it in Units 1 and 2. This feature is a scatter of tabular sandstone FCR on a single surface. An unusually high number of lithics (n=5) were recovered near this feature. Detailed descriptions of the features are presented below. Acacia excavated Trench C at the northern end of the site area. While archeologists did not observe any features or materials during mechanical excavations, Acacia excavated two units (Units 3 and 5) in the hopes of identifying additional features (Table 6.3). None were found. Table 6.3. 41DN624.1 Units 3, 5 artifacts.

Figure 6.6. Action shot of 41DN624 Trench B during testing; camera facing southeast. The quantity of any interpretable cultural materials found during testing at 41DN624.1 was low. Fourteen pieces of lithic debitage and about 460 g of mussel shell were collected from across four test units. The amount of debitage is certainly interesting, especially given the lack of associated features and general scarcity of lithic materials across the site. However, these were found at varying elevations across multiple units, so while they likely support our hypothesis of repeated site occupations, their lack of associations with any other materials/features limits data potential. Therefore, at the end of testing efforts, Acacia recommended (and regulatory agencies concurred) that no additional work is warranted at 41DN624.1. South of US 377 at 41DN624.2, Acacia machine excavated four trenches, D, E, F, and G (Figures 6.2-6.5), hand excavated four 1 x 1 m units, and three 40 x 40 cm soundings. Based on survey data, investigators predicted that 41DN624.2 would have no intact features or deposits south of US 377. Thus, trenching in this area was designed to sample deposits to confirm this initial hypothesis. As luck would have it, our initial predictions were wrong and investigators found a rather large and intact feature, Feature 3, in Trench E. Trenches D and F were opened at the northern and southern ends of the previously defined site area. No features were observed in Trench D (2.5 x 7.7 m). Although some scattered FCR and mussel shell were noted, these did not form a discernable pattern, cluster, or feature. Trench F (2.5 x 6 m) contained no cultural materials, suggesting it is outside the southern site boundary. Therefore, no hand-excavated units were opened in either trench. Between Trenches D and F, Acacia excavated the L-shaped Trench E. Mechanical excavation encountered a substantial concentration of FCR at a soil change about 55-60 cm below the surface, designated Feature 3. It is a circular earth oven composed of thin tabular sandstone with a central depression. This feature was located at an elevation of 172.113 m amsl, or about 50-80 cm below Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 80

surface and was very different in size, morphology, geologic context, and presumably age from the features recorded at 41DN624.1. Acacia placed a block of four contiguous units (Units 6-9) around this feature. During testing, very little cultural material was present around the feature. Radiocarbon dates place this feature in the Late Archaic period (see below; Appendix D). After identifying Feature 3, Acacia excavated Trench G immediately south of Trench E to get additional exposure of the Feature 3 surface. No additional features were observed during mechanical scraping so we hand-excavated three 40-50 cm square soundings to test for additional materials. Only one of these encountered material – six FCR not clustered or defined enough to designate as a feature. No other cultural materials were encountered in Trench G. At the end of testing efforts, Acacia recommended that Feature 3 and its surroundings should be investigated further. Data Recovery Based on the results of testing efforts in coordination with the THC, all data recovery efforts were undertaken at 41DN624.2 south of US 377. Mechanical scraping covered 1,050 m2 of the interceptor easement in two main blocks: Block A and Block B (BA and BB) (Figure 6.2-6.5, 6.7). Machine scraping generally stopped about 40-60 cm below the ground surface, however, four areas (Trenches H-K) were excavated deeper to provide better exposure of the sediment from the surface to channel deposits, as well as to assess whether older archeological components might be present at this portion of 41DN624.2. In addition to the three features identified during testing, data recovery efforts identified a further ten features, although overall quantities of artifacts are low. Notably, stone tools and tool debris were primarily confined to one area of the site. While faunal bone and freshwater mussel shells were present throughout the site and closely associated with features, the preservation of these materials is poor. The same can be said for other organic remains. Figure 6.7. Action shot of 41DN624 Block B, facing south. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 81

Over the course of fieldwork, Acacia made minor adjustments to the original field methods and level of effort in response to the actual conditions encountered, and the THC was notified of these changes. In terms of total excavated volume, Acacia exceeded the proposed level of effort, excavating more than 5 m3 beyond the targeted 15 m3 for a total volume of 20.2 m3. Going into the data recovery, Acacia believed that Feature 3 could be an isolated occurrence as survey and testing found little data to indicate that other features were present. Therefore, Acacia planned to excavate 5 m3 around Feature 3 plus 10 m3 across the rest of the site. Additionally, control units were proposed along a transect line through the site at 5-m intervals. However, as luck would have it, the machine scraping of the ROW revealed many more features than expected. These features were distributed throughout the two scraped blocks. To respond to these unanticipated field conditions, Acacia notified the THC with a request to modify the scope somewhat by diverting some of the excavation effort away from Feature 3 area to apply elsewhere at the site. In the end, Acacia exceeded the volumetric goal, excavating a total volume of 20.2 m3 across 58, 1 x 1 m units, and eight, 50 x 50 cm units (Figures 6.4-6.5). Acacia placed seven new units around Feature 3, as well as continued excavations on Units 6-9 started during testing for a total volume of 4.1 m3 in that area. Additionally, as excavation units covering feature areas were relatively evenly distributed across the scraped easement, transect control unit placement was modified from every 5 m to every 10 m. None of the control units contained any artifacts or features. Acacia identified and fully excavated 10 new features along with the previously recorded Feature 3. In cases where artifacts or burned rock distribution associated with features seemed to continue beyond the initial units placed, wherever feasible, unit excavations were expanded in that area in an effort to capture associated debris and activity areas around the feature surface. Block A, roughly 512 m2 in size, was mechanically scraped to remove the top 50-75 cm of soil. Trenches I and J were excavated within the larger scraped block. These efforts exposed the area around Feature 3 as well as the four newly identified Features 4-7. Archeologists excavated 29, 1 x 1 m units within this block (Units 6-28, 31-34, 43-44), with four, 50 x 50 cm control units, CU 5-8. Trench I (14 x 3.75 m) was roughly in the center of Block A. Acacia opened seven contiguous units (Units 21-24, 31-33) in Trench I around Feature 6, a concentration of tabular sandstone. This feature is likely an earth oven remnant or stone-lined pit, and radiocarbon dates place it within the Middle Archaic period. Associated materials are mussel shell fragments and two lithic flakes (specimens 132-01 and 137-01). Trench J (13 x 4 m) makes up the northern end of Block A. During mechanical excavations, no cultural materials or features were observed in this trench. As several features were seen within Blocks A and B directly north and south of this trench, no units were opened here and our efforts concentrated on known features. At the southern end of the site area, Trench H extended from Block A 10 m to the south. Two units (Units 29-30) were excavated over a small exposure of FCR. These identified Feature 8, stratigraphically the lowest and therefore earliest Middle Archaic feature identified. No other features were identified in Trench H, and only mussel shell and FCR were recovered from around Feature 8. North of Block A, Acacia scraped Block B – another large area equal in size at 512 m2. This large block covered the previously excavated Trenches 15 and D, excavated during survey and testing Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 82

respectively. Trench K was excavated at the northern end of this block, near US 377, down to approximately 2.5 m below the surface. While no cultural materials were documented in this deep trench, five features were identified and excavated across Block B (Features 9-13). Archeologists excavated 30, 1 x 1 m units (Units 35-42, 45-64) and four, 50 x 50 cm control units (CU 1-4). Features at 41DN624 Feature 2 Archeologists documented Feature 2 in Unit 1 as a small cluster of tabular sandstone FCR on a single surface (Figure 6.8; Table 6.4). Although no soil staining or burning was clearly evident, a flotation sample taken from around the largest FCR concentration included carbonized oak (Quercus sp.) wood (Chapter 11). Acacia recovered six lithics from the units around this feature. As discussed in Chapter 8, these are all flakes, four of which have light use ware, two are Edwards chert, and one is chalcedony. However, these flakes are also distributed across roughly 50 cm in the profile, indicating they are not the result of a single occupation; however, this does support our general hypothesis that the site is the result of repeated and likely short-term occupations over time. Only one may be directly associated with Feature 2; Specimen 7-01 is a tertiary flake on Edwards Plateau chert (Figure 6.9). No formal tools and only moderate amounts of mussel shell were found in this area (Table 6.4). Table 6.4. 41DN624 Units 1 and 2 artifacts. Blue highlights level of Feature 2.

Feature 3 Feature 3 at 41DN624 was the largest earth oven we encountered during excavations. It was a meter and a half across and had a distinct, central basin shape when bisected (Figures 6.10-6.13; Tables 6.5-6.8). The top of the feature is at an elevation of 172.113, or about 53 cm below ground surface, and the base of the feature is 171.893 (75 cmbs). A block of eleven contiguous excavation units, Units 6-16, were placed around this feature and fully revealed it. Feature 3 consists of a circular and basin-shaped cooking feature with an outer ring of rock at a higher elevation than rocks in the center of the feature. The rocks are mostly angular tabular sandstone, stacked and arranged in a concentric ring around a central depression. Other rocks include fractured and irregularly shaped breccia or sedimentary conglomerates. FCR around the central basin is canted inward at notably steep angles. The outer ring is approximately 2 m north/south by 1.5 m east west. The central depression is about 45 cm in diameter. FCR spill out to the northeast forming an amorphous cluster that may be a rake-out pile. Radiocarbon samples from a bone found within this feature returned conventional dates at 2680 ± 30 BP, with calibrated age range at 2849-2750 cal BP (95.4%) (calibrated at 2σ with IntCal20 [Ramsey 2009; Reimer et al. 2020]), within the Late Archaic period. Artifacts associated with 41DN624 Feature 3 include mussel shell, burned faunal bone, and one lithic biface (Figure 6.15), showing an intensity of use above that seen at other features. Of the faunal remains associated with this feature, 41 bone fragments exhibited signs of carnivore modification, which may represent the provisioning of domesticated dogs (Ramsey, Jacobson, and Haliburton, Chapter 10). Unfortunately, however, the mussel shell was heavily fragmented and none were identifiable to the species level (Figure 6.16; Phillips, Chapter 11). Multiple paleobotanical samples from this feature were analyzed (Chapter 11). Carbonized plant material was identified as hardwood, but more specific identifications could not be made. Acacia opened a block of four contiguous excavation units during testing, Units 6-9, and fully revealed the feature itself. At that time the feature was bisected, and archeologists excavated two additional 10-cm levels in the south half of the feature. Acacia left the northern half of the feature in place at the end of testing efforts. During data recovery, investigators placed seven new units (Units 10-16) to the south and west of Feature 3, as well as excavated the north half of the feature in Units 6 and 7 (Figure 6.14). All units were excavated four or five levels each to depths of 171.78 and 171.87 m. These investigations uncovered a diffuse scatter of FCR, bone and shell in the adjacent units, mostly in Units 12 and 13 at the same elevation as the feature. These likely represent the activity area associated with the feature. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 85

more a hearth remnant than an intact hearth per se. This is supported by an absence of charcoal, bone, or burned earth observed around and under the feature rocks. In fact, no debitage and only one piece of burned medium-large mammal bone was found to be associated with Feature 4. Mussel shell was recovered in all four test units around Feature 4 with the largest quantity found at or just below the level of the feature. However, like other contexts, these mussels shell are small fragments of mostly unidentifiable Unionidae. Figure 6.17. 41DN624 Feature 4. Table 6.9. 41DN624 Feature 4 summary.

Feature 5 Feature 5 was first identified during the initial mechanical scraping of the site (Figure 6.18; Tables 6.11-6.12). The top of a small cluster of large tabular burned sandstone was uncovered and marked as Feature 5. Four excavation units were placed around it with the goal of exposing additional buried elements of the feature. However, as it turned out, the feature was limited in size and integrity, with no discrete shape or associated debris. One small bone fragment, no lithic debris, and only 2.4 g of mussel shell were recovered. And again, like other contexts, the mussel shell is small and fragmented, unidentifiable to the species level. We are interpreting it as a feature remnant. Due to its very small size and lack of integrity, this feature was not bisected, but all rocks and soil from directly under the larger rocks were recovered and saved as samples. Once floted, these samples revealed no additional materials either in the light or heavy fraction. Table 6.11. 41DN624 Feature 5 summary. Size (m) Elevation (m) Assoc.

Feature 6 Archeologists identified Feature 6 at a lower elevation than most other features at 41DN624, within a Middle Archaic soil zone (Figures 6.19-3.20; Table 6.13-6.15). Acacia opened seven units in Trench I to explore this feature – Units 21-24, and 31-33. Feature 6 was an intact rock-lined hearth or earth oven feature. The main part of the feature is about 90 x 80 cm in size and consists of very tightly clustered, stacked, tabular sandstone, many of which are canted inward toward an interior depression. The feature is set within a shallow pit, the lowest portion of which is 12-20 cm lower than the rocks along the periphery. The sandstone rocks comprising Feature 6 are heavily burned, and many are fractured in place with thin flakes actively sloughing off during excavation. These exfoliated fragments account for a good portion of the smaller FCR weighed and counted during feature excavation. It is evident that most of the rocks comprising this feature were originally medium to large in size, with the largest rocks placed along the outside edges of the feature and smaller to medium sized rocks used to fill in and stack the periphery. The bottoms of the rocks were highly fire-reddened or blackened, oftentimes staining the earth below them. This feature is very similar in composition and overall shape to 41DN580 Feature 16, which is also comprised nearly exclusively of large sandstone tablets. A loose scatter of burned sandstone slabs and rocks spills out from the feature to the northeast and southwest. The scatter around the discrete oven feature may represent either rake out or possibly displacement from flood events. Small, unburned gravels were noted in the matrix around the feature, as well as in soil matrix under the feature, with density of natural gravels increasing with depth. This feature also exhibited a large quantity (434.4 grams) of mussel shell fragments around its periphery, and at the same elevation (roughly 171.380 m amsl) in all adjacent units. Five of these are nearly whole shells of the same species, Amblema plicata (Phillips, Chapter 11). Two associated lithics are specimen 132-01 and 137-01. 132-01 is a tertiary flak of Edwards Plateau chert with light use-wear, while 137-01 is a secondary flak of Uvalde chert, also with light use-wear (Figure 6.21; Ayala, Chapter 8). A sample of burned sediment (Beta No. 624821) returned radiocarbon dates at 4900 ± 30 BP, with calibrated 2σ ranges at 5564-5584 (88.5%), 5714-5681 (6.9%) BP (Ramsey 2009; Reimer et al. 2020).

Feature 7 Feature 7 is a small circular concentration of mostly medium sized tabular sandstone in Units 34 and 43 (Figure 6.22; Tables 6.16-6.17). As with Feature 6, many of the larger rocks were found to be cracked in place, exfoliated during excavation, and account for the majority of the smaller sandstone FCR collected from this feature. Burned soil was evident along the southern edge of the feature, as well as underneath several of the larger rocks. One large, possible griddle stone at the east exterior edge of the feature exhibited red residue underneath it and staining the soil below it. This is likely due to the high iron content of the rock itself. Bisection and profiling revealed that these FCR lined a shallow 10-cm deep pit. Investigators collected 9.7 g of mussel shell fragments, but no lithic debris or faunal bone were present. The mussel shell is unidentifiable Unionidae.

It is buried at the southern end of the site in Trench H, approximately 1.3-1.4 m below ground surface and just 10-20 cm above gravel deposits associated with the Hickory Creek paleochannel. In Units 29-30, this very small feature consists of a roughly circular arraignment of burned, mostly tabular sandstone (Figure 6.23; Tables 6.18-6.19). FCR in the feature are primarily medium to large sizes with smaller unburned gravels found in the matrix around and below the feature. As with other features at this site, FCR are generally canted inward toward the center of the feature, many are cracked in place, and many of them exfoliated smaller tabular pieces during excavation. The undersides of the rocks are fire reddened and earth immediately below it is also stained red. Intact, whole mussel shells were documented and collected from inside and immediately adjacent to the feature (Figure 6.24); four of Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 95

these are identifiable as Cyclonais pustulosa and Toxolasma texasiense (Phillips, Chapter 11). A total of 105.2 g of mussel shell was associated with this feature. No lithic debitage or faunal bone were present. A sample of burned sediment (Beta No. 624820) returned radiocarbon dates at 5030 ± 30 BP, with calibrated 2σ ranges at 5897-5705 (87.8%), 5694-5661 (7.6%) BP (Ramsey 2009; Reimer et al. 2020).

It is a circular burned rock concentration over a meter in diameter surrounded by a diffuse FCR scatter extending outward another meter around the main concentration (Figures 6.25- 6.26; Tables 6.20-6.22). The feature is 60-70 cm below the surface and was excavated in Units 35-42. The FCR in this feature is primarily limestone with a small amount of sandstone, as well as limited quartzite and other materials. Most rocks are small to medium size, however, there are some huge, boulder-sized rocks too. One sandstone boulder located at the southwest edge of the feature measures more than 30 cm across (collected). Rocks within the main concentration, as well as the surrounding scatter, are generally arranged one rock deep, although excavators did note some tabular sandstone rocks underlying the chunky limestone rocks forming the main concentration in Units 37 and 40. The matrix under and around Feature 9 was unburned, although a very slight ashyness was detected in the matrix in the center of the feature. Acacia collected one charcoal sample from under a rock along the southwestern edge of the concentration. Two whole mussel shells were mapped in situ outside of the southwest edge (Figure 6.27), while large mammal bone fragments were found in situ southeast of the main concentration. Further analysis identified both small and medium-large mammal bones with green and spiral fractures, indicating cultural butchering activities (see Chapter 10). A small amount (less than 35 g) of mussel shell was found in all units around Feature 9, but was highest in Units 35, 38 and 40, again outside the main FCR concentration. Eight discernable fragments and a cluster of very small broken fragments were found in the units around the main feature concentration, while three additional bone fragments were recovered from inside the feature center. Two lithic flakes were present just outside the central feature (specimens 327-01, 327-02; Figure 6.28). Both are tertiary flakes of Edwards Plateau chert with light use-wear (Chapter 8). Table 6.20.

below the ground surface. Excavation around these concentrations revealed them to be just that – loose concentrations of burned rock, scattered together with a notable quantity of bone, a large amount of whole (or nearly whole) mussel shell, and a significant amount lithic material (Figures 6.30-6.33). In fact, 56 of the 62 total pieces (90%) of chipped stone from data recovery at 41DN624 came from the 14 units around Features 10 and 11, primarily Units 46-48 and 61 (Figures 6.32-6.33; see discussion in Chapter 8). Of the 56 lithics from Feature 10/11, 36 (64%) are Edwards Plateau chert. These are mostly tertiary flakes with light use-wear. One biface fragment and one Godley point also came from this context (Chapter 8). Additionally, this area contained the highest density of shell from the site, weighing 443 g. The specimens identifiable to the species level are primarily Amblema plicata, as well as six examples of Toxolasma texasiense (Chapter 11). Vertebrate faunal material from this context is heavily weathered and fragmented medium-large mammal bone (Chapter 10). Interestingly, however, 96.6% of the bone from this context shows signs of carnivore modification. When combined with the heavy weathering, this could indicate either the provisioning of domesticated dogs, or significant post-abandonment scavenging (see Chapter 10). Feature 10 was ultimately documented as a loose collection of tabular sandstone adjacent to a defined mussel shell concentration (Figures 6.30-6.31). One of the tabular sandstone pieces is large and smooth enough to be a possible a metate and was collected. A broken projectile point, Godley type, was recovered on the surface near Unit 46 prior to test unit excavation (Figure 6.32). Figure 6.29. 41DN624 Feature 10 facing east.

Ultimately the importance of Features 10 and 11 (Table 6.23) and the area around them lies not with their morphology but as an apparent discrete activity area where lithic tools were used and resharpened. The lithic debitage recovered from this area in Units 45-57, 61-63 are small tertiary flakes from tool retouching. And the disproportionate density of bone, whole shell, and lithics certainly suggests that some form of specialized processing took place in this area that was not happening elsewhere around the site. Additionally, if we assume that Feature 9 is associated with the activity area of Features 10 and 11, this area likely represents a single occupation. This occupation surface accounts not only for 90% of the site’s lithic material, but also 58% of the faunal bone (64% of which has carnivore modifications) (see Chapters 7 and 9).

Feature 12 is in the middle of the Block B excavation area at approximately 75 cm below the ground surface and was explored in Units 56, 58-60.

periphery with smaller sandstone pieces stacked over them. Many rocks in the upper layers are canted inward toward a central depression. The topmost rocks in the center of the feature are limestone that are so highly burned, they have turned into a crumbly slake that falls apart once dislodged from their locations. The sandstone rocks at the base of the pit are also highly burned and fragmented. Burned soil underlies the rocks and carbonized material is interspersed around and between the FCR. Acacia recovered three charcoal samples from the feature at an elevation of 171.785 m. It is evident that the rocks were initially fired from below. Organic material from multiple flotation samples contained hardwood and Oak (Chapter 11). Since so many of the rocks were either cracked in place or broke during excavation, the number of small rocks (>2 cm) recovered from this feature was disproportionately high, and likely does not reflect the actual number of smaller rocks originally used. The small FCR were weighed but not individually counted, as their number definitely exceeds 500. Although a small amount of mussel shell was noted in situ around the feature, the total occurrence/weight was not notable. A projectile point fragment (Specimen 384-01) was adjacent to Feature 12 (Figure 6.35). The point is broken and made of a pinkish gray Ogallala quartzite. It is possibly a Godley or Trinity type point, but its base has broken off making identification uncertain (Chapter 8). No bone was found in any of the units surrounding Feature 12. These data tell us quite a bit about the construction of this feature. First, a small pit was dug and a fire built up in it. Likely once the fire was somewhat smaller or reduced to coals, the pit was lined with tabular sandstone slabs which were layered with additional hardwood fuel around a central depression. Limestone rocks at the top of the feature may have been used for stone-boing activities taking place while other foods were slow-cooking. In addition to possible packets of foodstuffs wrapped and placed across the rocks, the central depression could have contained a higher volume of foods, possibly items that needed a longer roasting time or possibly a higher temperature. Based on the near absence of faunal remains near the feature, we can speculate that this oven was primarily used to cook plants, and/or that any faunal processing and consumption was taking place elsewhere during this occupation, away from this feature.

Feature 13 Feature 13 is less than 3 m north of Feature 12 and is a loose group of burned sandstone and limestone that lack discrete shape (Figure 6.39; Tables 6.26-6.27). Excavated in Units 65 and 66, the FCR are small pieces. The surrounding matrix was uniform in color and composition throughout the level and below the FCR. None of the sediment around the rocks exhibited signs of burning. This feature appears to be a continuation of the lithic scatter area around Features 10 and 11. Acacia recovered a small broken projectile point with barbed shoulders, possibly a Scallorn, from Unit 65 (specimen 376-01), as well as a complete Darl point (specimen 838-02; Figures 6.40-6.41). The Darl point is heavily refurbished and made of Edwards Plateau chert. There are also two lithic flakes from this context, both are small tertiary retouching flakes (Chapter 8). Additionally, unidentifiable Unionidae shell fragments were recovered throughout the top two levels from each of the test units around Feature 13. No other artifacts are associated with the feature.

Summary During both testing and data recovery efforts at 41DN624, Acacia’s archeologists documented a total of 13 features and excavated 25.32 m3 in 66 units, and eight control units (Table 5.7). These efforts documented 623 pieces of FCR, 62 lithics, 2482.2 g of freshwater mussel shell, and 95 faunal bone fragments (Appendix B). All recovered materials and features date to the Middle and Late Archaic periods. Of these 13 features, three were Category 3 earth ovens, three fit into Category 2, and five were classified as Category 1. Two features, 10 and 11 are uncategorized, as there were very few associated FCR and Acacia believes these represent an activity area rather than two discrete features. Together, Features 9-11 likely represent a single occupation, the central area of the campsite, with an activity area surrounded by cook features. The lithic assemblage (Chapter 8) shows that many activities likely involved scraping tool use, and the possible ground stone suggests other types of plant processing were taking place. Together, these give us a clearer picture of what daily life at these sites was like. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 109

7. S G R UMMARY EOARCHAEOLOGICAL ESULTS By Ken Lawrence, M.A. and Ashley Eyeington, M.A. SWCA Project Description - Background SWCA conducted a geoarchaeological investigation of sites 41DL580 and 41DL624 that included documenting the encountered stratigraphic and cultural deposits at each site, appropriate matrix sampling and analyses, and providing a report of these results. The interpretation of these investigations and recommendations is the subject of this report, which is done in conformance with reporting standards of the THC and CTA reporting guidelines. Previous Regional Geoarchaeological Research To provide context for the project area, a review of previous geoarchaeological investigations in the region relevant to the project area was conducted. The most extensive geoarchaeological investigations within the Upper Trinity River basin occurred about 13 mi (21 km) northeast of 41DN580 and 41DN624 for the Ray Roberts-Lewisville Reservoir Project in Cooke, Denton, and Grayson Counties (Prikryl and Yates 1987; Ferring and Yates 1997). The creation of these reservoirs from the impoundment of segments of the Elm Fork River generated archeological investigations extending over two decades by a variety of interdisciplinary researchers (e.g., Southern Methodist University [SMU], Environmental Consultants, Inc., USACE Fort Worth District, and University of North Texas). These seminal investigations have set the foundation for subsequent investigations within the Trinity River basin and northern Texas. Among the many notable accomplishments from this research was the discovery and investigation of the Aubrey Clovis site (41DN479), which is situated on the Elm Fork River and was identified to have an intact stratigraphy extending into the Pleistocene (Ferring 1990a, 1990b, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995a, 1995b, 2000, 2001; Humphrey and Ferring 1994). Most significant, the site has a Paleoindian occupation with well-dated stratigraphy that suggests it is one of the oldest Clovis sites currently known (Ferring 2001). In addition, the extensive investigations at the Aubrey Clovis site have provided a robust radiocarbon dataset and information from past environments. A summary of this research is provided followed by other subsequent investigations in the Trinity River basin. In summarizing the alluvial history of the Upper Trinity River basin of which Hickory Creek is a part, Ferring (1994) recognized four morphostratigraphic units (i.e., landforms) composed of deposits from six alloformations. The morphostratigraphic units identified from oldest to youngest include the Stewart Creek Terrace, Hickory Street Terrace, Denton Creek Terrace, and the Floodplain that are interpreted to encompass the Middle Pleistocene up to the present. The Stewart Creek Terrace, which is composed of Irving alloformation deposits, and the Hickory Street Terrace, which is composed of the Coppell alloformation deposits, are indicated to date to the Pleistocene, sometime around 30,000 years ago (Ferring 1994; Ferring and Yates 1997). Ferring (1990a) indicates that the Hickory Street Terrace has been identified by previous researchers as having several designations through the years. The more recent Denton Creek Terrace is composed of Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 113

deposits from the Carrollton alloformation that contain Pleistocene faunal remains (e.g., Bison antiquus) and is interpreted to date to roughly 30,000 to 20,000 years ago (Ferring 1994:47-48). Ferring (1994) indicates that the Aubrey alloformation dates to the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition. The terminus ante quem for this alloformation is from the Aubrey Clovis site (41DN479), which initially calibrated to 17,030 calibrated (cal) years (yr) before present (BP) (SMU-2236) and terminates sometime after 14,410 cal yr BP (Ferring 1994; Ferring and Yates 1997). The initial calibration of the overlying Sanger alloformation begins in the Late Pleistocene prior to 13,460 cal yr BP (AA-5274) and extends to sometime after 7,550 cal yr BP (SMU-2339) (Ferring 2001:Table 3.2). Ferring (1994:58–59) notes that the Sanger alloformation is capped by a moderately developed buried soil that in several locations has been eroded by the Pilot Point alloformation. The Pilot Point deposits began prior to 4,470 cal yr BP (SMU-2401) and terminated sometime after 1,676 cal yr BP (Beta-14963). A well-developed cumulic soil identified as the West Fork soil frequently caps the Pilot Point alloformation interpreted to encompass the last 4,000 years. Beginning in the Late Pleistocene, the alluvial history of the Upper Trinity River basin, as defined by Ferring (1994:147–149), has a period of stasis with no discernable geomorphic activity occurring between 14,000 to 11,000 years ago (17,000–13,000 calibrated). Specifically, Ferring (1994:147) notes that no alluvial or colluvial deposition or evidence of a disconformity is associated with this period. Subsequent to 11,000 years ago (13,000 calibrated), a period of rapid alluviation occurs in the basin, initiating a phase of valley filling. Interestingly, this period of rapid alluviation occurred shortly after the Clovis occupation at the Aubrey Clovis site and continued until 7,500 years ago (7,550 calibrated) (Ferring 1994:148). This event is inferred to be associated with a shift to a moister (i.e., mesic) climate. By the middle of the Holocene, a shift to a drier (xeric) climate occurred as evidenced by soil development in the Sanger alloformation and eolian deposits in some of the uplands of the upper basin of the Trinity River (Ferring 1994:148). These xeric conditions seemingly continued until approximately 4,500 years ago when a period of rapid alluviation occurred and the deposition of the Pilot Point alloformation began (Ferring 1994:148–149). The rapid alluviation is particularly apparent between 3,000 to 2,000 years ago (Ferring 1994:149). In contrast to other researchers, Ferring (1994) notes that alluviation in the Upper Trinity River basin does not correlate with arid conditions. Instead, Ferring (1994:150–153) noted in this basin that the fluvial response to moist conditions was rapid alluviation and/or erosion while drier conditions led to stability and soil development and that the primary internal influence on a landscape’s evolution is the underlying bedrock, which affects the vegetation. Specifically, the calcareous loams and clay loams derived from weathered limestone support a prairie environment that is more resistant to erosion. Conversely, the non-calcareous soils derived from sandstone and shale supports a mixed forest environment that has a lower threshold for erosion. Two primary external influences identified are the climate and changes in sea level. Although no examples are provided, eustatic influence is not proposed here as a possible influence on the upper extent of the basin. Regarding overall archeological potential within the upper basin, Ferring and Yates (1986, 1997) indicate that archeological sites occur in two principal contexts (i.e., terraces and upon or below floodplains). For the terraces, Ferring and Yates (1997) propose that the Trinity River terraces between Dallas and Valley View are Late Pleistocene in age. As such, any archeological sites less than 11,000 Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 114

years old (~13,000 calibrated) could occur on the terrace surfaces, which are supported by numerous surveys in the area, particularly in Denton, Dallas, and Tarrant Counties (Ferring and Yates 1997:279). For the floodplains in the Upper Trinity River basin, the age of the sites on the floodplains can be predicted by their stratigraphic location (Ferring and Yates 1997:Table 18.2). Unfortunately, Ferring and Yates (1997) note that cutbank exposures along Elm Fork River are “poor” and alluvial units thicken as they progress downstream. Consequently, older sites will become increasingly difficult to discern downstream. This will be particularly evident for Paleoindian to Middle Archaic sites, which will likely require mechanical excavation for their discovery. In contrast, the Pilot Point alloformation is exposed within the cutbanks of the entire upper extent of the basin and is characterized as thick, dark, and clayey with a buried soil (West Fork soil) located beneath recently deposited sand (Ferring and Yates 1997:280). Further, the West Fork paleosol developed within and caps the Pilot Point alloformation, which itself dates from 4,500 to 1,800 years ago (Abbott 2011). By extension then, the West Fork paleosol would date to the latter parts of 4,500 to 1,800 years ago. Previous researchers (Hall et al. 2011) conducting investigations on the Clear Fork of the Trinity River examined the West Fork paleosol and refined the age of the buried soil as dating more specifically from 2,300 to 1,000 years ago. These dates, performed on humate samples, aligned stratigraphically in comparison to charcoal assays in the study (Hall et al. 2011:542–544). Notably, Frederick et al. (2006:32) and others observe that other research along the Trinity River dates the upper limits of the Pilot Point alloformation as 300 years BP. An important component of the work done at 41TR203 (Mercado site) was an informative compilation of previous chronometric analyses (n=40) conducted on the West Fork soil (Frederick and McKee 2019:78–82). This synthesis determined that the dates for the West Fork spanned between 4,000 to 250 cal BP, with a majority falling between 2,400 to 700 cal BP. These data appear to currently be the most secure age for the West Fork soil. Other relevant investigations include the geoarchaeological work conducted at 41TR170 in 2005 by Geo-Marine, Inc. (Geo-Marine) for the State Highway 21 project (Hall et al. 2011; Lintz et al. 2008). The investigations on a relic channel of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River included a geoarchaeological assessment of the site deposits extending below 8 ft (2.5 m). These investigations were located on a relic channel of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River roughly 35 mi (56 km) southwest of 41DN580 and 41DN624. In addition to recent alluvium, these investigations encountered deposits from the West Fork paleosol underlain by a pre-paleosol alluvium and cemented Pleistocene gravels (Lintz et al. 2008:45–62). The Pre-paleosol alluvium is characterized as Holocene-aged yellow and gray clays (Lintz et al. 2008:45–62). Although not referenced, the pre-paleosol alluvium is here interpreted to be Pilot Point alloformation. Also in 2005, geoarchaeological coring was conducted by Geo-Marine for the Central City/Trinity River Project (Osburn et al. 2005). These investigations occurred at several locations along the West Fork of the Trinity River roughly 30 mi (48 km) southwest of 41DN580 and 41DN624. The investigations extended to 23 ft (7 m) in places and encountered recent alluvium overlying West Fork paleosol-Pilot Point alluvium. The researchers note that in several locations the Pilot Point alluvium may have been underlain by the Arlington paleosol-Sanger alluvium (Osburn et al. 2005:37-38).

Between 2006 and 2010, investigations were conducted by Geo-Marine at 41COL172 for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) associated with the realignment of FM 1378 in southern Collin County (McKee 2010). The investigations on Muddy Creek, a tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity River, is located roughly 35.6 mi (56 km) east-southeast of 41DN580 and 41DN624 and included intensive geoarchaeological investigations of the site. These investigations extending to roughly 13 ft (4 m) encountered recent alluvium overlying West Fork paleosol-Pilot Point alloformation deposits (McKee and Frederick 2010:110–113). Between 2007 and 2019, investigations were conducted by Geo-Marine at 41DL203 (Tinsley and Dayton 2011). The investigations on Rowlett Creek, a tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity River, is located roughly 35 mi (56 km) east-southeast of 41DN580 and 41DN624 and included intensive geoarchaeological investigations of the site. The investigations encountered recent alluvium overlying West Fork paleosol-Pilot Point alluvium above Sanger alluvium (Frederick 2011:98–100). In 2012, investigations were undertaken by AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) for a borrow pit associated with the Trinity Uptown development project (Trierweiler et al. 2013). The investigations included a geoarchaeological assessment of the deposits extending to 25 ft (7.6 m) below surface. These investigations were located at the confluence of the West Fork and Clear Fork of the Trinity River roughly 30.5 mi (49 km) southwest of 41DN580 and 41DN624. In addition to recent alluvium, these investigations encountered deposits from the Pilot Point and Sanger alloformations (Trierweiler et al. 2013). In 2014, archeological investigations were conducted at 41TR203 (Mercado Site), mentioned above, by aci consulting (Shipp et al. 2019). This site is located about 28 mi south of 41DN580 and 41DN624 on the West Fork of the Trinity River and had considerable geoarchaeological investigations conducted (Frederick and McKee 2019). In addition to recent alluvium, these investigations encountered deposits from the Pilot Point and Sanger alloformations (Frederick and McKee 2019). In 2018, archeological monitoring and investigations were conducted at 41TR314 (Violet Site) by AR Consultants, Inc. on behalf of the City of Fort Worth (Davis 2020). The investigations on West Fork of the Trinity River, located roughly 35 mi (56 km) southwest of 41DN580 and 41DN624, included a geoarchaeological assessment of the site deposits extending below 13 ft (4 m). In addition to recent alluvium, these investigations encountered deposits from the West Fork paleosol and Pilot Point alloformation above the Arlington paleosol of the Sanger alloformation (Taormina 2020). The Arlington paleosol-Sanger alloformation was observed at roughly 310 cm below surface that are characterized as a massive clay with 40 percent CaCO3 nodules (Taormina 2020). Notably, an accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) date on charcoal (D-AMS 028436) recovered near the top of the Arlington paleosol-Sanger deposits returned a calibrated age of 3810–3560 BP (2σ) (Davis 2020). This is dramatically younger than other chronometric data associated with the Arlington paleosol-Sanger alloformation. In 2019, archeological investigations were conducted at 41EL246 by Versar, Inc. (Versar) on behalf of TxDOT for the replacement of US 77 Viaduct in central Ellis County (Short et al. 2021). The investigations on Waxahachie Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River, is located roughly 57 mi (92 km) southeast of 41DN580 and 41DN624 and included intensive geoarchaeological investigations of the Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 116

site. These investigations encountered recent alluvium overlying West Fork paleosol-Pilot Point alloformation (Frederick and Costa 2021). Also in 2019 and closer to the project area, investigations were conducted at 41DN612 (Hardemann Midden site) by SWCA (Lawrence et al. 2020; Nielsen et al. 2021). The investigations at this stratified Transitional Archaic site on Denton Creek contained deposits that correlated with the Pilot Point alloformation capped by the West Fork paleosol. The site contained two periods of prehistoric occupations that bracketed the end and beginning of the Transitional Archaic separated by a recognized period of change within Denton Creek when the drainage channel changed course around 1,740 years ago (Lawrence et al. 2020; Nielsen et al. 2021). Field Methods Geoarchaeological Methods Geoarchaeological field investigations for the significance test excavations were conducted in May 2021 for both 41DN580 and 41DN624 (Lawrence and Eyeington 2021). The geoarchaeological field investigations for the data recovery excavations occurred in November 2021 at 41DN624 and January 2022 at 41DN580. These investigations consisted of a geoarcheologist examining multiple trenched and excavation units that provided an exposed stratigraphic profile across each site. When available, supplemental data from natural exposed cut banks and exposures were also examined. The geoarchaeological results of the significance test excavations were extensively utilized and revised as appropriate. The exposed profiles were thoroughly examined and characterized using a modified soil profile documentation advocated by Birkeland (1999) and Schoeneberger et al. (2012) (Appendix C). All Munsell colors, unless indicated otherwise, were recorded dry. Additionally, samples were collected to provide detailed information on soil stratigraphy, depositional environments, and chronometric data from the exposed profiles. These field investigations, conducted by SWCA geoarcheologist Ken Lawrence, M.A. and David Yelacic, M.S., incorporated documentation of the physical characteristics of the horizon matrices as well as systematic sampling to provide matrix for laboratory analyses. Laboratory Processing and Analysis Methods Geoarchaeological Investigations As mentioned above, laboratory data acquired during the significance test excavations were used to supplement the data acquired and analyzed during data recovery investigations. The significance test excavations laboratory analyses included texture analyses, calcium carbonate content, magnetic susceptibility (MS), and radiocarbon dating (Lawrence and Eyeington 2021). Where appropriate, these data are again presented along with geoarchaeological laboratory analyses conducted for the data recovery investigations of sites 41DN580 and 41DN624. Notably, no additional texture analyses or calcium carbonate content initially performed by Texas A&M Soil Characterization Laboratory were undertaken for the data recovery investigations. Additional analyses performed for the data recovery investigations include organic carbon and stable carbon isotopic analyses, optically Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 117

stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, as well as additional radiocarbon and magnetic susceptibility analyses to supplement the significance test excavation analyses. The organic carbon and stable carbon isotopic analyses were performed by Dr. Bruce Barnett at the Keck-NSF Paleoenvironmental and Environmental Stable Isotope Laboratory (Keck-NSF Lab) at the University of Kansas. The OSL analyses were performed by Dr. Tammy Rittenour at the Utah State University (USU) Luminescence Laboratory and the radiocarbon analyses were performed by Beta Analytic, Inc. The remaining magnetic susceptibility analyses were conducted in-house at the SWCA laboratory by Jessica Ulmer under the supervision of Ken Lawrence. Subsequent interpretations and results were compiled by Ken Lawrence and Ashley Eyeington. Particle Size (Texture) Analysis To examine the texture of the matrix at the two sites, select samples collected during the 2021 significance test excavations were submitted to Texas A&M Soil Characterization Laboratory. At the laboratory, the samples were removed from their initial shipping containers, placed in aluminum or other non-porous, non-corrodible shallow containers and oven dried at 65 C (+2 C) in a forced air oven for 16 hours or until dry. Following oven drying, samples were pulverized using an open-mesh- bottom hammer-style soil pulverizer. All soil exiting the pulverizer was screened to remove all particles greater than a 2-millimeter (mm) diameter. The texture analyses used the pipette method and identified the percentages of coarse fragments (>2.00 mm), sand (2.00–0.05 mm), silt (0.05–0.002 mm), and clay (<0.002 mm). The data from these analyses are summarized in the report. Calcium Carbonate Equivalent Select samples collected during the 2021 significance test excavations were submitted to Texas A&M Soil Characterization Laboratory. At the laboratory, a small (1.7 g) portion of the <2-mm matrix of each soil/sediment sample was then dried overnight at 105˚C, subsequently ground in a mortar and pestle, and used to determine the calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) by means of a Chittick apparatus (Dreimani 1962; Machette 1986). The dried and ground samples were weighed and placed into a small (250 [milliliter] ml) Erlenmeyer flask. Once attached to the Chittick apparatus, the liquid level in the measuring burette was set to -10 ml, then the stopcock was closed to prevent off gassing, and the leveling bulb was lowered to establish a vacuum inside the sample chamber. Subsequently, the barometric pressure and room temperature were recorded. Then 10 ml of 50 percent hydrochloric acid (HCl) was delivered to the sample flask and was periodically agitated until the reaction was complete (about 1–2 minutes). The leveling bulb was then raised to the elevation of the liquid level of the sample in the burette. The volume of gas evolved was then measured and the calcium carbonate equivalent was calculated. The data from these analyses are summarized in the report. Organic Carbon and Stable Carbon Isotopic Analysis Carbon is found in soils in two forms consisting organic carbon and inorganic carbon (Kolb 2017; Milne 2023). The organic carbon or soil organic matter is derived from the natural decomposition of flora and fauna and by extension human activities including their byproducts like food and waste (Kolb 2017). However, the most significant anthropogenic alteration of organic matter is thermal activity (Kolb 2017:16). Inorganic carbon can be produced by flora that contains crystals (e.g., opaline Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 118

silica and calcium oxalate), but primarily comes from parent materials like carbonate rock (Kolb 2017). The measurement of organic carbon within soil organic matter typically decreases vertically with depth in a soil profile (Nordt and Holliday 2017). In addition to possibly identifying areas of enhanced anthropogenic activity in a profile, the measurement of organic carbon may identify unconformities expressed as paleosols within sedimentary deposits. Measurements of the stable carbon isotope (δ13C) composition of the soil organic matter can also provide information on the structure of past plant communities since the uptake of the heavier 13C isotope during photosynthesis differs between C3 (e.g., arboreal species) and C4 (e.g., warm season grasses) plants (Nordt 2001; Nordt and Holliday 2017; Vogel 1980; Weiner 2010). The determination of δ13C has also been used for analyzing past climates (Mandel et al. 2007; Nordt et al. 1994, 2002, 2007). Of particular interest for this project is the δ13C VPDB (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) or the carbon stable isotope standard derived from a Cretaceous-age formation in North Carolina. This metric can be used to interpret regional flora communities for paleoenvironmental and subsistence or diet reconstructions (Ehleringer and Monson 1993; Lohse et al. 2014b; Nordt 2001; Weiner 2010). Generally, the ratio of 13C to 12C (i.e., δ13C) can indicate whether C3 or C4 plant communities were more abundant. C3 flora (e.g., trees, shrubs, and cool season grasses) are adapted to more temperate climates and have a lower percentage of δ13C isotopes around -27‰ parts per thousand (Boutton 1991a, 1991b; Ehleringer 1991; Hoppe et al. 2006; Julien et al. 2012; Lohse et al. 2014b; Nordt 2001; Nordt and Holliday 2017). The C4 plants (e.g., warm season grasses) occur in arid environments and have a higher percentage of δ13C around -13‰ (Boutton 1991b; Ehleringer 1991; Hoppe et al. 2006; Julien et al. 2012; Lohse et al. 2014b; Nordt 2001; Nordt and Holliday 2017). Put simply and in relation to this project, an increase in C3 plants should indicate a wetter more temperate environment while a decrease exhibited in increasing C4 biomass is indicative of drier and warmer conditions (Mandel et al. 2007:56). Nordt and Holliday (2017:903) note that δ13C around -20‰ could most likely indicate a mixed community of C3 and C4 biomass. However, other researchers in the area have selected the δ13C value -19‰ as the demarcation of a mixed C3 and C4 biomass (Hall et al. 2011:542). For the purposes of these investigations, the δ13C value of -20‰ is considered the threshold for a mixed C3 and C4 biomass. A distinction must be made when considering δ13C for interpreting paleoenvironments when using data from 14C analyses from radiocarbon laboratories. Specifically, the δ13C correction 14C/12C ratios during the analyses are typically not as accurate as that conducted at a stable carbon isotope geochemistry laboratory (Nordt and Holliday 2017:905). Put simply, the resulting δ13C from the radiocarbon analyses may not accurately reflect past environmental data and warrants some caution (Collins and Bousman 2015:6; Nordt and Holliday 2017:905). In the context of these investigations, the δ13C values derived from humate dating from Beta Analytic were compared against δ13C samples from the Keck-NSF Laboratory from the same elevations. In each instance (n=9), the humate dating δ13C values were +-2‰ different than the δ13C values from the Keck-NSF Laboratory. Although these data are still useful, the humate dating δ13C values from 41DN580 and 41DN624 were not included in the δ13C analyses. The δ13C VPDB values provided by Keck-NSF Laboratory were converted to percentages of C3 and C4 plant biomass. The equation uses the interpreted mean δ13C values for C3 and C4 and is presented below (Bousman et al. 1990). Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 119

% C3 plant biomass = [(δ13C-3.5) + 13]/-0.14 The equation subtracts the average assumed fractionated value of microbial decomposition (3.5‰) from the δ13C and adds the average value of C4/CAM biomass (-13‰) (Bousman et al. 1990:94; Collins and Bousman 2015:60). Another point to reiterate is that the average δ13C value of -13‰ for C4 and -27‰ for C3 are not universally agreed upon. For the purposes of these investigations, these δ13C values will be used. For these analyses performed at the Keck-NSF Laboratory, samples were weighed and wrapped in 5×9-mm pressed tin capsules, combusted in a Costech Instruments ECS 4010 (Elemental Combustion System), resulting gases were interfaced to a Thermo FinniganTM MAT 253 Stable Isotope Mass Spectrometer, in continuous flow mode, via a Thermo Finnigan Conflo III. The measurements of organic C, N, δ13C, and δ15N were obtained using the Costech 4010 elemental analyzer in conjunction with a FinniganTM MAT 253 Stable Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer from Thermo Electron Corporation on a matching set of soil/sediment samples. Carbonates were removed from the samples through dissolution prior to analysis. The data from these analyses are summarized in the report and in Appendix E. Magnetic Susceptibility (MS) Analysis Magnetic Susceptibility (MS) analyses of soils have been utilized for archeological investigations for several decades, and have largely been directed toward surveys (e.g., Crowther and Barker 1995; Dalan 1996, 2008; Rosendahl et al. 2014; Van Leusen et al. 2014; Wiewel and Kvamme 2014). More recently, these investigations have focused on archeological site formation and associated depositional processes (Dalan 2006, 2008). These analyses have assisted in identifying buried or thermally altered soils associated with cultural activities, as well as identifying the horizontal extent of cultural features (e.g., Dalan and Banerjee 1998; Dalan and Bevan 2002; Dinckal et al. 2022; Ellwood et al. 1995; Frederick 2010; Jones and Leffler 2003; Mauldin and Figueroa 2006; Nickels 2010; Peters and Thompson 1999; Rivers et al. 2004). Extensive reviews of the processes of environmental magnetism and particularly the application of MS have been produced (e.g., Dearing 1999a, 1999b; Gale and Hoare 1991:201–229; Maher et al. 1999; Thompson and Oldfield 1986; Verosub and Roberts 1995). Briefly, however, magnetic minerals are prevalent in the natural environment and are sensitive to environmental changes (Gale and Hoare 1991:202). The measurement of MS, χ (Chi), is a quantification of the “magnetisability” of the material (Dalan 2008; Dalan and Banerjee 1998; Dearing 1999b:5; Gale and Hoare 1991:202–204). The mineralology, the size and shape of the grains, internal stress, and other factors can initially influence the susceptibility value (Dearing 1999a, 1999b; Gale and Hoare 1991:204). However, of relevance to this discussion, factors including organic content, pedogenesis, thermal alteration, and cultural activities (e.g., ash-charcoal and refuse) can subsequently alter (usually increase) the susceptibility values. The implications of using MS for archeological research is that when examining either vertical or horizontal areas, the susceptibility values can assist in identifying cultural activity areas that may otherwise be blurred at a macro level.

MS analysis has been used to define the limits of cultural features and living spaces in excavation blocks (e.g., Mauldin and Figueroa 2006; Wiewel and Kvamme 2014). Vertically, the MS results have been applied to recognizing and delineating cultural horizons (e.g., Frederick 2010, 2012; Lawrence and Frederick 2012). For the significance test investigations at 41DN580, MS samples were collected from profile walls of Trenches B and C. During the data recovery investigations, MS samples were also collected from the profile walls of Trenches D and E excavation areas. At 41DN624 during the significance test excavations, samples were collected from Trench E. For the data recovery investigations at 41DN624, MS samples were collected from Trenches H and J and select samples were collected in proximity to Feature 7 and near some FCR in the profile wall of Trench K. As both sites, the MS samples were typically collected up profile in systematic 5-cm intervals. Each of the samples were mapped into the profile, effectively correlating them to site stratigraphy and excavation elevation. The select samples were placed in 8-cc inert plastic cubes and correlated with the respective profile stratigraphy. These samples were subsequently analyzed using a Bartington MS2 meter and MS2B dual frequency sensor to examine both low (χlf) and high (χhf) frequency (470 and 4700 Hz, respectively) MS. The cube samples were measured at the high sensitivity setting (i.e., 0.1) compared to the normal sensitivity setting (i.e., 1.0). The high sensitivity setting was necessary since the frequency dependency of the MS samples were also calculated (Gale and Hoare 1991:223– 224). The values for each cube sample were catalogued twice at both the low and high frequencies to provide an average value using the Système International scale. Each of the χlf, χhf, and the average values were recorded, as well as each sample’s weight in an Excel table. After every five readings, the Bartington MS2 meter was “zeroed” out to recalibrate the meter. The cube samples from this analysis were subsequently calculated using the methods outlined by Gale and Hoare (1991:223–226). Briefly however, the primary metric for recognizing MS values of interest is the coefficient of frequency dependency (χfd). This calculation is indicated as: χfd= 100 [(χlf-χhf)/ χlf] This calculation uses χlf as the ‘normal’ sensitivity value and contrasts it with the χhf value to reveal significant values of difference in percentages (Dearing 1999a:47, 1999b:17–18; Gale and Hoare 1991:226). Elevated values of χfd can represent concentrations of fine to ultrafine magnetic grains (e.g., maghemite), which are commonly associated with pedogenesis (Dalan 2006:164; 2008:22; Dinckal et al. 2022:846). Conversely, low values of χfd can represent multidomain grains which can be associated with anthropogenic influences (Tiwow et al. 2021). Several factors may cause an increase in χlf values including biological (e.g., bacteria) or inorganic (e.g., natural weathering of iron minerals) processes. In an archeological context, an increase in χlf values may reflect cultural activities from thermal features and general refuse (Dalan 2008; Dalan and Banerjee 1998; Frederick 2012). Ideally, when applied to a vertical profile on an archeological site, collected in systematic intervals (e.g., 2–3 cm), and contrasted with cultural data (e.g., artifact frequencies), this analysis can provide valuable data to interpret site formation and cultural activities.

Radiocarbon Analyses Radiocarbon analysis was also conducted during the investigations to assist in providing chronostratigraphic data. Due to the paucity of charcoal samples for AMS analyses at 41DN580 and 41DN624, most of the chronometric analyses at these sites were done on bulk humate samples of sediment. During the significance test excavations at 41DN580, three samples of charred material and five samples of bulk humate were analyzed. For the data recovery excavations at 41DN580, two samples of charred material, one bone fragment, and five samples of bulk humate were analyzed for an overall total of 17 analyzed assays at 41DN580. During the significance test excavations at 41DN624, one sample of charred material and four bulk humate samples were analyzed. For the data recovery excavations at 41DN624, one sample of charred material and seven samples of bulk humate were analyzed for a total of 13 analyzed assays examined at the site. All of the samples were sent to Beta Analytic, Inc., who conducted the analyses. Notably, radiocarbon years (14C) are not calendar years, but rather a measurement of remaining 14C isotopes (Bartlein et al. 1995; Blackwell and Buck 2008; Blackwell et al. 2006; Blockley et al. 2007; McCormac and Baillie 1993; Mock and Bartlein 1995; Ramsey 2008a, 2008b, 2009:337; Stuiver and Suess 1966). Consequently, the 14C years must be converted to a calendrical format (i.e., calibrated) for general interpretation and comparison (Mook and Waterbolk 1985:20; Taylor and Bar-Yosef 2014). This study uses the nomenclature proposed by Nordt (1992) and the journal of American Antiquity guidelines for distinguishing between uncalibrated radiocarbon and calibrated radiocarbon results. Specifically, the results of these analyses are here reported in both conventional radiocarbon age (14C yr BP) and the calendar calibrated (cal BP) results. The Gregorian calendar year AD 1950 is recognized as the beginning point of BP (Hua 2009; Mook and Waterbolk 1985; Stuiver and Polach 1977; Taylor 1997:67– 68; 2009). The data from these analyses are summarized in the report and provided in Appendix D. Optically Stimulated Luminescence Analysis Due to the sparse quantity of radiocarbon assays from both 41DN580 and 41DN624, OSL analyses were also conducted during the data recovery investigations at these sites. Detailed histories and principles regarding luminescence dating, which includes OSL, are extensively covered by previous researchers (e.g., Aitken 1998; Bateman 2019a; Mahan and DeWitt 2019; Malainey 2010; Nelson et al. 2015) and are not elaborated here. Briefly, however, luminescence dating can provide an age estimate of the last exposure of quartz or feldspar minerals to light (e.g., sunlight) or heat. Considering that quartz and feldspar are the two most prevalent minerals on the Earth’s crust and that luminescence dating can date samples between 25 and 300,000 years in age, the implications for archeological chronostratigraphy is obvious (Rittenour 2008). Several paired sets of OSL samples were collected for analyses at both 41DN580 and 41DN624. The approach was to target stratigraphic contexts at both sites to bridge the gap between the lower resolution chronometric assays (i.e., organic sediment) to the higher resolution assays (i.e., charcoal assays) at each site. These samples were paired (i.e., two samples collected in the same location) to provide a reserve should some unforeseen mishap in analyses occur. At 41DN580, two sets were Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 122

collected from the stratigraphy of Trench D. At 41DN624, two paired sets were collected from Trench H and two paired sets were collected from Trench J. These samples were collected using methods outlined by Nelson et al. (2015) and Bateman (2019b) that involves driving a 20-cm-long and 3.8-cm-diameter opaque metal tube horizontally into a clean profile. The interior and exterior ends were capped and sealed immediately after extraction to prevent the sample getting exposed to sunlight. Prior to sample tube extraction, an environmental dose rate sample was collected within a 30-cm radius around the tube and placed in a quart-size bag and sealed. After the tube was extracted, a moisture sample was collected from the sample tube location and sealed in an airtight cannister. The entire OSL sample set was clearly marked, labeled, and placed into a gallon-size bag and tightly taped shut to prevent movement. The specific location and context of each sample was documented and photographed. A total of four OSL samples were submitted to the USU Luminescence Laboratory with the remaining four samples held in reserve. The submitted samples included two from Trench D at 41DN580 and two from Trench J at 41DN624. These OSL samples were processed using the single grain method on quartz to provide the most accurate results (Duller 2008). The data from these analyses are summarized in the report and provided in Appendix F. Chronometric Modelling The chronometric data obtained from the significance test and data recovery radiocarbon analyses were examined in a variety of ways with statistical modelling. The conventional radiocarbon results from Beta Analytic, Inc., were recalibrated and subsequently examined with Bayesian modeling. Briefly, the calibration software (e.g., OxCal, Bcal, and Calib), interprets the conventional 14C data with a probability distribution (Banning 2000; Ramsey 1995, 1998, 2001, 2008a, 2009). The calibration software plots the 14C dating results onto the calibration curve (for this research the recently updated IntCal20 curve was used) and then characterizes the probability of the interpolated outcome (Ramsey 1995, 1998, 2001, 2008a, 2008b, 2009; Reimer et al. 2020). More than a half dozen software packages are available for calibration, but the one used for the 41DN580 and 41DN624 analyses was OxCal Version 4.4. The analyses were primarily conducted using default settings with output set at both 68.2 percent (1σ) and 95.4 percent (2 σ) and rounded to the nearest decade for a minimum of 30,000 iterations. One major benefit of this program is that it can incorporate Bayesian statistics into the characterization of the dating results, which can include radiocarbon. Bayesian statistics enables a researcher to incorporate new information as well as accounting for prior information to provide the most probable result. The technique uses Baye’s theorem that expresses the uncertainty of an event or set of parameters occurring before and subsequent to the results of an analysis (Buck 2004; Buck et al. 1996; Christian 1994). Put another way, the Bayesian analysis of chronometric data considers all possibilities of the outcome (prior) with the measured data (likelihood), and then determines the probability of those results occurring in relation to the other parameters (Bayliss and Ramsey 2004; Blackwell and Buck 2008; Buck 2004; Buck et al. 1991, 1992a, 1992b, 1994, 1996, 2006; Christian 1994; Heaton et al. 2009; Ilan 2001; Lulewicz 2018; Ramsey 2009). A prior probability can be inferred from relative dates (e.g., stratigraphic position) and then compared Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 123

with the likelihood probability that is available from the absolute dates (e.g., 14C or OSL dates), which culminates in the determination of the posterior probability. When comparing multiple events simultaneously, the large number of individual combinations that are considered for each outcome (iteration) can become infinite. To aid in these analyses by calibration software, a sampling algorithm, such as the Metropolis-Hastings or equivalent, is typically used (Ramsey 2009). Metropolis-Hastings is an algorithm of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which randomly examines each event across a defined distribution, gradually increasing the confidence of the result (Breyer 2010; Heaton et al. 2009; Ramsey 2009). Further, the implementation of MCMC allows for the inclusion of the uncertainty of multiple factors that can allow for the comparison of points as well as their deviations on the curve (Buck and Blackwell 2004:1101; Everitt 2002; Upton and Cook 2006). The chronometric assays from each site were each examined with regards to their respective stratigraphic horizon and vertical position. These OxCal analyses compared both the radiocarbon results using the Phase model (under the Sequential setting) and the Deposition model (under the Poisson distribution P_Sequence setting) (Ramsey 2008a, 2009). The sequential setting allows for sets of chronometric data to be grouped in a sequence (i.e., stratigraphic) and contrasted both within the group and against other groups (Ramsey 2009). Further, the sequential setting operates under the assumption that another group (i.e., horizon) cannot be temporally contiguous or overlapping (Ramsey 2009). The P_Sequence in the Deposition model assumes the deposition is a function of another parameter, typically depth (Ramsey 2008a). The intent of using this suite of modelling techniques were twofold. The first was to determine how secure each assay correlated with their respective depth and against the other assays. Considering that most of the chronometric assays were on bulk humate this outlier review was an important factor to establish. Secondly, the modelling assisted in quantifying the rates of sedimentation, which could also be used in evaluating integrity of the cultural deposits at the sites. A summary of the results of these analyses are discussed below. Results Of Investigations at 41DN580 As previously mentioned, geoarchaeological field investigations for the significance test excavations (Trenches A–C) were conducted in May 2021 followed by data recovery investigations (Trenches D–F) in January 2022 (Figures 7.1-7.3). These geoarcheological investigations involved examining, sampling, and documenting multiple profiles across the site. To supplement the profile data from the significant test investigations, the data recovery investigations focused on portions of the site that provided the best representative and deepest stratigraphy. Site Stratigraphy The profile of Trenches A and D provided the deepest exposures at 41DN580. Trench A, exposed during significance test excavations and contained six horizons including a thin deposit of dredge material (Lawrence and Eyeington 2021:Figure 2). The profile of Trench D, exposed during data recovery excavations, contained seven horizons (Figure 7.4). The deposits of Trench D were very Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 124

similar to that observed during the significance test excavations with the addition of a lower Zone VII (Bk4 horizon). Notably, the Bk1 horizon within Trench A was divided into a B and Bk1 horizon within Trench D (see Appendix C). The remaining trenches and excavations areas contained five horizons (Figures 7.5–7.7). Detailed profile descriptions are presented in Appendix C. The surface horizon (Zone I) in Trench D extended to 12 cmbs (174.31 m elevation) consisted of a very dark grayish brown to dark grayish brown (10YR 3/1–3/2) clay loam with a friable consistency and subangular blocky structure and had a clear and smooth lower boundary. Zone I (Ap horizon) in Trench D was present in all of the excavations across 41DN580 except Trench B and is interpreted to be the initial ground surface on recent Holocene alluvium. Notably in Trench A, this surface horizon is capped by dredge material while the excavations to the north of Trench A appears to be partially truncated with the greatest disturbance occurring at Trench B, the northernmost excavation of 41DN580. In Trench D, underlying Zone I is the second stratum (Zone II) that extends to 49 cmbs (173.91 m elevation) that consists of a very dark gray to very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/1–3/2) clay loam with a friable consistency, a subangular blocky structure with a gradual and smooth lower boundary. Zone II (A horizon) in Trench D was present in all of the excavations across 41DN580 and is interpreted to be Holocene alluvium. Based on the chronometric data and temporally diagnostic artifacts (e.g., ceramic sherds in Trench E) encountered in this horizon appears to correlate with the West Fork soil. The underlying horizon is Zone III that extends to 101 cmbs (173.42 m elevation) consisting of dark brown to brown (10YR 3/3–4/3) loam to clay loam with a friable consistency with a subangular blocky parting to angular blocky structure containing a few snail fragments and a gradual and smooth lower boundary. Notably, this horizon was identified as a Bk1 horizon in Trench A. This horizon in Trench D was divided into a B–Bk1 horizon based on the visible calcium carbonate (CaCO3) morphology. Zone III (B horizon) in Trench D was present in all of the excavations across 41DN580 and is interpreted to be Holocene alluvium that correlates with the Pilot Point alloformation.

The underlying Zone IV in Trench D extends to 139 cmbs (173.04 m elevation) consists of a brown to yellowish brown (10YR 4/3–5/4) sandy clay loam with a firm consistency and angular blocky parting to prismatic structure containing common filaments and films of CaCO3 with a clear and smooth lower boundary. Zone IV (Bk1 horizon) was observed in all of the excavations across 41DN580 and was where a portion of the cultural materials at the site were encountered including Feature 3 in Trench B (see Figure 7.7). Based on the chronometric data, this horizon appears to correlate with the upper limits of the Sanger alloformation. The next horizon (Zone V) in Trench D extended to over 209 cmbs (172.34 m elevation) consisted of a dark yellowish brown to yellowish brown (10YR 4/4–5/4) sandy clay loam with a very firm consistency and prismatic structure containing few snail fragments, abundant filaments and films of CaCO3 with a clear and smooth lower boundary. Zone V (Bk2 horizon) was only clearly observed in the Trench A excavation area (as Bk3 horizon) and contained scattered cultural materials including Features 5 and 8. Only the upper portions of Zone V (Bk2 horizon) is present in excavation areas Trench B, C, E, and F and contained scattered cultural materials (see Figure 7.7). The underlying horizon (Zone VI) in Trench D consisted of a yellowish brown to light yellowish brown (10YR 5/4–6/4) sandy clay with a firm consistency and angular blocky structure containing abundant filaments and films of CaCO3 with a clear and wavy lower boundary. Zone VI (Bk3 horizon) was only clearly identified in Trench D, but is interpreted to have been present in Trench A. This horizon was likely not recognized during the significance test excavations due to the high- water table that was present during inspection (see Lawrence and Eyeington 2021:Figure 2). The chronometric data from these depths in Trench A (i.e., Beta-597409) roughly correlates with the chronometric data from this horizon in Trench D indicating some contemporaneity (see Figure 7.7). The chronometric data for Zone VI (Bk3 horizon) correlates firmly within the recognized age of the Sanger alloformation. The lowermost horizon (Zone VII) observed in Trench D and 41DN580 extends to 251 cmbs (171.92 m elevation) consists of a yellowish brown to light yellowish brown (10YR 5/4– 6/4) sandy clay with a firm and angular blocky structure containing abundant filaments and films of CaCO3 and, with depth, increasing amounts of calcine coated subrounded gravels. Beginning at 246 cmbs (171.97 m elevation) the calcine coated gravels composed over 30 percent of the matrix. The lower boundary for Zone VII is unobserved. The chronometric data for Zone VII (Bk4 horizon) correlates firmly within the recognized age of the Sanger alloformation. Geoarchaeological Analyses Particle Size Distribution A series of soil geomatrix samples were collected at 41DN580 during the 2021 significance test excavations to help characterize the deposits at the site. The geomatrix samples from site 41DN580 (n=17) were collected from Trench A (n=10) and Trench C (n=7). The sampling in Trench A began in Zone I below the noted dredge materials designated as Zone Ia. The sampling continued downward vertically to the base of the profile (Figure 7.8). The selected samples in Trench C began in Zone II below the base of the ground surface horizon (Zone I) and extended to the base of the profile. The results of the particle size texture analyses from the geomatrix samples by the Texas A&M Soil Characterization Laboratory for Trench A indicates that Zones I-III are silty clay loam and transitions into a clay loam for Zones IV and V (Table 1). Similarly, in Trench C the upper Zone II into Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 133

III is a silty clay loam transitioning into a clay loam around Zone IV. The overall site deposits show a very slight coarsening upward of clast materials (Figure 7.8). Zone I of Trench A did have seven percent fraction of coarse clast materials (>2 mm) consisting of subrounded pebbles and gravels. No other coarse materials were measured in the geomatrix samples of Trench A or C (Figure 7.9). The coarse materials in Zone I of Trench A is interpreted to be attributed to the dredge materials (Zone Ia) draping portions of the site. The particle size distribution exhibits a generally continuous profile of alluvial deposits with a gradual transition from a silty clay loam into a clay loam down profile. No evident unconformities or dramatic fluctuations were observed in these deposits. Calcium Carbonate Equivalent Similar to the particle size analyses from the 2021 significance test excavations, the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) equivalent analysis from those investigations were incorporated into the data recovery investigations (Table 7.1). These samples were collected from Trenches A and C and exhibited no dramatic fluctuations down these profiles but rather a gradual and steady increase of CaCO3 down profile (see Figures 7.8-7.9). Notably, in Zone I of Trench A the CaCO3 begins as slightly elevated before a slight decrease of CaCO3 before gradually increasing down profile. As with the coarse materials, this fluctuation is attributed to the dredge materials (Zone Ia) draping portions of the site. Organic Carbon and Stable Carbon Isotope δ13C Analysis Organic Carbon analyses at 41DN580 in Trench D excavations revealed a steady decrease with depth, but there were a few notable fluctuations (Figure 7.10). These fluctuations were at 174.28 elevation at the top of A horizon, at 173.98 and 173.68 elevation in B horizon, and at 173.18 elevation in Bk1 horizon (see Figure 7.10). The fluctuation observed at the top of the A horizon is interpreted to be associated with the dredge disturbance in the area. The lower fluctuations in the B and Bk1 horizon are subtle and may correlate with anthropogenic activity. The overall results of the stable carbon isotope (δ13C) analyses at 41DN580 ranged from a high of -14‰ and a low of -20‰ (see Figure 7.10; Appendix E). These data suggest that at the base of the excavations in the Bk2 and Bk3 horizons, the environment for the site was mixed grassland and arboreal. After that, the C4 biomass increased with more dominant grasslands until the upper A horizon (see Figure 7.11). From the A horizon to the surface, the C4 biomass decreased and was returning to a mixed grassland and arboreal environment. Magnetic Susceptibility For the magnetic susceptibility analyses at 41DN580, two columns from the significance test excavations (Trenches B and C) and two columns from the data recovery excavations (Trenches D and E) were examined (Figures 7.11-7.12). For Trench B (n=55) at the northern end of the site encompassed deposits from 5–149 cmbs (174.17–172.73 m elevation). Trench C (n=54) positioned south of Trench B encompassed deposits from 3–176 cmbs (174.73–173.00 m elevation). The samples in Trench E (n=41) near the center of the site were collected at two exposures roughly 3 m apart to provide the deepest exposure overlapping vertically at roughly 173.07–173.02 m elevation or 165–170 cmbs. The data of the Trench E columns were combined to encompass 174.67–172.82 m elevations but consequently Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 134

there is variability as the data is merged. The samples in Trench D (n=46) at the southern end of the site were collected at two exposures roughly 50 cm apart to provide the deepest exposure between 174.38–172.13 m elevation and continued the sequence without overlapping. The MS results from Trench B show a general decrease of MS values typically seen within natural soil profiles. Within Zone III a small, localized increase in values occurred at 71 cmbs (173.5 m elevation) in sample B22 (see Figure 7.12). Additionally, the values within Zone IV show the erratic merged MS data mentioned above between roughly 90–100 cmbs (173.3-172.2 m elevation). Below this, there are subtle fluctuations at 119–121 cmbs (173.03–173.01 m elevation) and 130–135 cmbs (172.92–172.87 m elevation). These lower fluctuations are interpreted to correlate with cultural activities in proximity to the MS column as Feature 3 is at roughly 173.12 m elevation while Feature 8 is at 172.92 m elevation. Both of these elevations illustrate a fluctuation, particularly for Feature 8. Overall, the Trench B MS column does not exhibit any unconformities, but rather a steady and gradual decrease in values down profile. The MS results from Trench C gradually decrease down profile from Zone II which had the highest values peaking in sample C12 (174.36 m elevation) (see Figure 7.9). There is one notable fluctuation at the boundary between Zones III and IV in sample C41 at 135 cmbs (173.41 m elevation). Although this spike in values may be attributed to cultural activities it is interpreted to correlate with a rodent burrow noted at the base of the zone roughly from 112 to 134 cmbs (173.64-173.42 m elevation). While no clear spike in MS values is exhibited within Zone IV, the values remain steady through most of the zone. Interestingly, Feature 7, mussel, FCR, and possible ocher fragments were noted from approximately 140 to 174 cmbs (173.36-173.02 m elevation) adjacent to the MS column. Therefore, it appears that cultural activities at Trench C have a subtle correlation to the MS values. Overall, the Trench C MS column does not exhibit any unconformities, but rather a steady and gradual decrease in values down profile. The general MS results from Trench E exhibit a gradual decrease in χlf values down profile (see Figure 7.11). There are several fluctuations occurring at the contact from Zones I and II (~174.57 m elevation) and Zones II and III (~174.24 m elevation) which may reflect the abrupt transitions of those horizons. Notably, there is a jump in χlf values beginning at 173.52 m elevation near the base of Zone IV that continues to the base of the excavations at 172.82 m elevation (see Figure 7.11). The deposits through these elevations had scattered mussel shell and Features 15, 16, and 17. The gradual and continued increase in χlf values is interpreted to be associated with the cultural activities in proximity to the Trench E sample column. Finally, at the southern end of the site in Trench D, the MS results exhibit a more dynamic trend than observed in the other MS columns at the site (see Figure 7.10). Specifically, there is a large increase in χlf values from Zone I into Zone II before it gradually decreases in values vertically down the profile. The large increase in Zones I and II is attributed to the abrupt contact of the disturbed Ap horizon into the A horizon interpreted to be the West Fork soil. The χlf values below that gradually decrease with one notable fluctuation in Zone V between ~173.00–172.80 m elevation. The deposits through these elevations contained Features 9, 10, and 11 in the area and the increased χlf values are interpreted to be associated with cultural activities (see Figure 7.10). The notable fluctuation in the χfd values between ~172.53–172.38 m elevation near the base of Zone V may correlate with cultural Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 135

activities associated with Feature 12 or 13 observed as these depths. However, it is more likely attributed to pedogenesis commonly associated with an increase in χfd values (Dalan 2006:164; 2008:22; Dinckal et al. 2022:846). Figure 7.8.

Optically Stimulated Luminescence Analysis As mentioned previously, OSL analyses were also conducted during the investigations at 41DN580. Two OSL single grain samples from the Trench D profile were analyzed to assist in the chronometric data for the site. One sample (D02, USU-3870) was collected near the top of Zone IV Bk1 horizon while the second sample (D01, USU-3869) was collected from the Zone VI Bk3 horizon near the base of the excavations (see Figure 7.7). These samples bracketed the geomatrix humate samples to assist in providing some resolution to the chronometric data. Due to the high overdispersion (OD) values exceeding 20%, the age of the samples was analyzed using the Central Age Model (CAM) advocated by Galbraith and Roberts (2012). Sample D02, USU-3870 at 173.3 m elevation returned a 1σ age of 5,320±480 BP with an OD value of 25+3% (Appendix F). Further down, sample D01, USU-3869 at 172.2 m elevation returned a 1σ age of 7,480±680 BP with an OD value of 26+3% (Appendix F). For context, single grain OD values between 9–20% in sedimentary settings like 41DN580 are considered to have been well bleached during deposition (Mahan and DeWitt 2019:20). However, single grain OD values exceeding 20% may indicate the mixing of grains of various ages from post-depositional processes or the partial resetting of grains (Bateman et al. 2003). Accordingly, these samples are interpreted to have been well bleached during initial deposition but have experienced some partial post-depositional mixing. Radiocarbon Analysis During significance test excavation at 41DN580 five geomatrix humate samples from Trench A were submitted for analyses between 174.33–172.25 m elev. (57–265 cmbs) and three AMS charcoal assays were submitted for analyses from three of the excavated thermal features (i.e., Features 3, 5, and 8). These eight chronometric samples were supplemented with an additional nine samples from the data recovery excavations for a total of 17 assays (Table 7.2). Five of the data recovery radiocarbon samples were collected from Trench D between 173.13–172.07 m elev. (130–236 cmbs). These organic sediment samples were collected from contexts to fill in the gaps of the significance test excavations and date the lowest contexts at 41DN580. Of the remaining four data recovery excavation radiocarbon samples, three consisted of charcoal (Beta-619325–619327) and one organic sediment assay (Beta- 624819) and all collected in proximity to identified features. The chronometric dates for all 17 samples were examined with statistical modelling. The dates of the features and the elevations of these samples were integrated with the humate chronometric data that indicate the deposits between 174.48–172.07 m elevation ranged from 7300–1100 BP (Table 7.2). Although the samples were collected in several locations across 41DN580, the results of the chronometric assays returned an overall good elevational and stratigraphic correlation. Put simply, with only one exception (Beta-619325) the assays were in a good sequence regarding their elevation and age compared to the other samples. The one exception (Beta-619325) fit well within the appropriate stratigraphic zone (i.e., Zone II), but its elevation was slightly below a sample (Beta- 597405) collected from Trench A at the top of Zone III. This difference in elevations between these samples, separated by over 10 m distance, may be attributed to the slight topographic difference across the site. When comparing these dates solely by stratigraphic position, the ages of the samples fell into an excellent sequence. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 142

The conventional 14C results for each of the 41DN580 samples from Beta Analytic were modelled in OxCal v4.4.4 using the IntCal20 calibration curve and examined with several analysis models to determine an appropriate age-depth model. These data were examined with two different approaches using their stratigraphic order and elevation. The first approach used the deposition model under the Poisson (P_Sequence) setting (Ramsey 2008a). The elevation of stratigraphic breaks of each Zone was included in the models as a change in boundary (Figures 7.13-7.14). The second approach used the Phase model (under the Sequential setting) (Ramsey 2008a, 2009). The second approach excluded the elevation data and associated the respective assays into their stratigraphic zones (Figure 7.15). Table 7.2. Radiocarbon Results for 41DN580.

Calculations were conducted of the combined chronometric data to determine an approximate deposition rate at 41DN580. Based on the current data from all 17 radiocarbon and two OSL assays, the overall average deposition rate at 41DN580 is 3.4 cm per 100 years. These overall average rates of sedimentation at 41DN580 would be categorized as Slow under Ferring’s (1986:261) sedimentation categories. Using the OxCal Deposition Model output, some initial calculations of sedimentation by stratigraphic zone were also conducted using the assays in excellent vertical context. Specifically, the assays from Trenches A and D were used for the lower strata and the assays from Trench E were used for the upper strata modelling. Beginning in Zone VI (modelled ages of ~7300–6800 cal BP), the rates of deposition from Sample 580.D02 to the modelled boundary change suggests an average of 2.4 cm per 100 years (see Figure 7.14). The overlying Zone V (modelled ages of ~6800–4800 cal BP), the rates of deposition from Sample 580.A10 to the modelled boundary change suggests an average of 3.7 cm per 100 years. This period of deposition encompasses Features 3, 5, and 8 (see Figure 7.14). The overlying Zone IV (modelled ages of ~4000–2800 cal BP) extends from the modelled boundary change of Zone IV/V upward to the modelled boundary change of Zone III/IV and includes Sample 580.A06 and has an average of 5.2 cm per 100 years, almost doubling that observed in Zone V. For the Zone III sedimentation rate calculations, the lone Zone III assay from Trench A (sample 580.A04) suggests a modelled age of ~2000–1300 cal BP for the upper and lower limits for the horizon. These data suggest an average of 4.2 cm per 100 years. Finally in Zone II (modelled ages of ~1300–600 cal BP) extends from the modelled boundary change of Zone II/III and upward through the three charcoal assays in Zone II and suggests an average of 4.4 cm per 100 years (see Figure 7.15). Additionally, calculations were performed of the charred material of the examined features (Features 3, 5, 8, and Trench E Zone II charcoal) at 41DN580. This examination was conducted to try and determine approximate spans of occupation and the duration between Feature 3 and Feature 8. The modelling was also conducted to assess if the Trench E Zone II charcoal were likely to be one or multiple activities. These data were modelled under the OxCal v4.4.4 Phase tool using the Span and Interval query function. The chronometric data for Features 5 and 8 were interpreted to be a single phase and the span (i.e., span of the dated events) was calculated. Specifically, the modelled span for the data of Features 5 and 8 indicates a span of 0–234 years (2 σ). This suggests that the activities encompassing these two features occurred within less than 234 years. However, based on the vertical proximity of these two features (roughly 6 cm apart in elevation), these features are interpreted to be generally concurrent. Since the Span of activities for Feature 3 occupation is limited to one date, the current interpretation for this cultural zone is solely based on the Feature 3 date. For the determination of the interval between Feature 3 and Feature 8 to determine the length of time between these cultural zones, the span of these dates is 1029–1421 years apart based on 2 σ modelled dates. This suggests a minimum of interval of roughly 1000 years between the occupations. Similarly, span modelling was conducted on cultural features of 41DN580 to quantify the possible periods and duration of activity. The modelled span for the analyzed feature data in the Sanger deposits (i.e., Features 5 and 8) indicates a span of 0–232 years (2 σ) between 5290–4960 BP. Although limited to the dates from two features, this data may reflect a single occupation or very limited occupations during that period.

The modelled span for the feature data for the Pilot Point and West Fork deposits are a bit more dispersed. The assays from Feature 3, 580.301, 580.174, and 580.304 have a span of 3300 years (2 σ) between 4000–690 BP. However, when you isolate the assays from 580.301, 580.174, and 580.304 there is an overlap between 740–720 BP with a span of 0–210 years (2 σ). These data suggest at least two periods of activity during the Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation. The earliest, associated with Feature 3 would be between 4000–3700 BP while the latter would be between 800–700 BP. 41DN580 Synthesis The deposits at 41DN580 are interpreted to encompass the Pilot Point-West Fork and Sanger alloformations commonly encountered in the Trinity River basin of which the site is a part (Abbott 2011; Ferring 1990a, 1990b, 1991, 1992, 1994). Ferring (1994) indicates the Pilot Point deposits began deposition prior to calibrated 4470 BP (SMU-2401) and terminated sometime after calibrated 1676 BP (Beta-14963). However, Frederick et al. (2006:32) observe that other research along the Trinity River dates the upper limits of the Pilot Point alloformation more recently as 300 years BP. Underlying the Pilot Point alloformation is the occasionally recognized Sanger alloformation that is capped by the Arlington soil. The deposition of the Sanger alloformation has been dated elsewhere to be between 13,400–7,500 cal BP followed by a period of stability (Arlington soil) to be generally between 7500– 4500 cal BP (Ferring 1994; Frederick and McKee 2019). The oldest humate date from 41DN580 (Beta- 62775) returned a 2σ calibrated date of 7790–7620 BP while the modelled age of the deepest OSL sample (USU3869) returned a date of 7090–6905 BP. These data securely place the 41DN580 deposits as beginning in the Middle Holocene and extending to the present. As noted previously, most of the chronometric data at 41DN580 was obtained from bulk humate (organic sediment), which is a factor that warrants some discussion. Abbott (2008) provides an excellent summary on the limits of using “humate ages” uncritically and without caution. Briefly, this analysis provides an average time of death for a large variety of organic materials contained within the soil (e.g., plant material, carbonized remains, cellulose, lipids, etc.). Abbott (2008:18) indicates that humate ages for soils in upland settings provides an average age of all the organics in the system sometimes referred to as ‘mean residence time’. In this situation, young carbon is continually being mixed with the older decaying carbon and frequently date younger than the actual age of deposition (Birkeland 1999:137–140). Within a lowland setting, such as site 41DN580, the humate samples incorporate the organisms in the vicinity of the sample as well as organisms from the surrounding uplands. Abbott (2008:18) indicates the humate samples in lowland settings commonly date older than their age of deposition. It is cautioned that it is not the radiocarbon analyses of humate samples that may be incorrect, but rather the interpretation (and expectations) of the researcher that may be in error (Abbott 2008:19). Considering how narrow the Hickory Creek valley is that encompasses 41DN580, the influence of upland organics likely affected chronometric data to some degree. However, based on the strong correlation of ages compared to their depths illustrated in the regression model (see Figure 7.16) the influence of upland organics on the humate ages appears to have been consistent. Further, the deeper humate dates compared with the single grain OSL assays compare remarkably well despite some apparent post-depositional mixing.

Interestingly, the deposits at 41DN580 exhibited no clear evidence of a buried soil or any erosional disconformities to clearly demarcate the boundary between the Pilot Point and Sanger alloformations. The overall average deposition rate at 41DN580 is 3.4 cm per 100 years (see Figures 7.14 and 7.15). These data suggest a gradual, cumulic deposition for the site that would be categorized as a Slow sedimentation category (Ferring 1986:261; Yates and Ferring 1986:189). The occupations at 41DN580 as indicated by the cultural features (i.e., site furniture) appear to suggest minimally three periods of primary occupation (see Figures 7.11 and 7.12). The oldest in Zones IV and V (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons) encompassing Features 5, 8, and possibly Features 15–17 roughly ~5000–4800 BP. The next oldest in Zone IV (Bk1 horizon) encompassing Feature 3 and possibly Features 4–6 at roughly ~4000– 3800 BP. Finally, the most recent prehistoric occupation in the partially truncated Zone II (A horizon) encompassing Feature 14 at roughly ~750–700 BP. Results Of Investigations 41DN624 As previously mentioned geoarchaeological field investigations for the significance test excavations (Trenches A–E) were conducted in May 2021 followed by data recovery investigations occurred in November 2021 (Figures 7.17-7.19). The data recovery investigations (Trenches F–K) focused on the southern portion of the site, particularly around Trench E. These geoarcheological investigations involved examining, sampling, and documenting multiple profiles across the site. To supplement the profile data from the significant test investigations, the data recovery investigations focused on portions of the site that provided the best representative and deepest stratigraphy. Site Stratigraphy The profile of 41DN624 was provided by Trench E during significance test excavations and Trenches H, I, J, and K during the data recovery excavations (Figures 7.18-7.19). All of these exposures were examined and documented as well as exposed excavation units and the stratigraphy across the site was relatively consistent. Detailed profile descriptions are presented in Appendix C. The profile of Trench J provided the deepest exposure extending from 172.64–170.67 m elevation and contained six horizons (Figures 7.20–7.23). The remaining site profiles contained all or most of the observed horizons and varied depending on depth of excavation (Figure 7.24). The surface horizon at Trench J extended to 21 cmbs (172.49 m elevation) and consisted of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam with a friable consistency and subangular blocky structure (see Figure 7.22). The lower boundary of Zone I was clear and wavy and designated as an Ap horizon. The underlying horizon (Zone II) extended to 42 cmbs (172.28 m elevation) consisted of brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam with a friable consistency and subangular blocky structure with a clear and smooth lower boundary. The chronometric data for the underlying horizon suggests that Zone II may correlate with the West Fork soil. The underlying third horizon (Zone III) extended to roughly 76 cmbs (171.94 m elevation) and consisted of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt clay loam with a friable consistency and angular blocky structure, few subrounded pebbles and common CaCO3 filaments. The lower boundary of Zone III was gradual and smooth and was interpreted to be a Bk1 horizon. The chronometric data for Zone III correlates firmly within the recognized age of the Pilot Point Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 150

alloformation. The underlying Zone IV extended to 166 cmbs (171.04 m elevation) and consisted of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt clay loam with a firm consistency and angular blocky parting to prismatic structure. This stratum contained many CaCO3 filaments, few Rabdotus snails, few 5–30 mm subrounded pebbles, cluster of mussel shell beginning at 133 cmbs (171.31 m elevation). The lower boundary of Zone IV was gradual and smooth and was interpreted to be a Bk2 horizon. The chronometric data for Zone IV correlates with the recognized age of the Sanger alloformation. The fifth horizon (Zone V) extended to 189 cmbs (170.81 m elevation) and consisted of yellowish brown to dark yellowish brown (10YR 5/4–4/4) silty clay with a firm consistency and prismatic structure. Zone V contained common 20–50 mm subrounded pebbles with vertical and horizontal orientation, and many CaCO3 filaments. The lower boundary of Zone V was abrupt and irregular and interpreted to be a Btk horizon. The chronometric data for Zone IV correlates with the recognized age of the Sanger alloformation. The lowest stratum observed at 41DN624 was Zone VI and extended below 203 cmbs (170.67 m elevation). Zone VI consists of a yellowish brown to dark yellowish brown (10YR 5/4–4/4) clay with a firm and angular blocky structure containing common many CaCO3 filaments, common 2–3 mm many CaCO3 masses, many matrix supported subrounded limestone and sandstone pebbles, and few mussel shell fragments. The lower boundary for Zone VI is unobserved and was interpreted to be a C horizon. The age of the Zone VI deposits is based on the OSL sample (7270+630 BP) from the overlying Zone V. Based on the abrupt contact between Zones V and VI it is uncertain how extensive and how many deposits are missing from erosion. Accordingly, the age of Zone VI is currently interpreted to be greater than 7500 BP. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 151

Geoarchaeological Analyses 41DN624 Particle Size Distribution A series of soil geomatrix samples were collected at 41DN624 to help characterize the site deposits. The geomatrix samples for the data recovery excavations were collected from Trench E (n=6) during the significance test excavations and utilized for the data recovery investigations (Table 17.3). The results of the particle size texture analyses conducted by the Texas A&M Soil Characterization Laboratory for Trench E the upper Zone I–III is a silty clay loam transitioning into a clay loam near the base of the excavation. The overall site deposits show a very slight coarsening upward of clast materials (Figure 7.25). There is a slight (1 percent) fraction of coarse clast materials (>2 mm) consisting of subrounded pebbles and gravels indicated in one sample of Zone III of Trench E. No other coarse materials were measured in the geomatrix samples of Trench E. Overall, the particle size distribution exhibits a generally continuous profile of alluvial deposits with a gradual transition from a silty clay loam into a clay loam down profile. No evident unconformities or dramatic fluctuations are present in these deposits. Calcium Carbonate Similar to the particle size analyses of the geomatrix samples from site 41DN624, the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) equivalent analysis shows no dramatic fluctuations (Table 7.3). The data indicates a gradual and steady increase of CaCO3 down profile (see Figure 7.25). Organic Carbon and Stable Carbon Isotope δ13C Analysis Organic Carbon analyses at 41DN624 in Trench J excavations revealed a large decrease in values in the upper Ap horizon followed by a steady decrease with depth (Figure 7.26). There are a few subtle fluctuations in the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons (see Figure 7.26). Although minimal, these fluctuations are roughly equivalent in elevation to cultural features near Trench J and may correlate with anthropogenic activity. The overall results of the stable carbon isotope (δ13C) analyses at 41DN624 ranged from a high -14.57‰ and a low -18.77‰ (see Figure 7.26; Appendix E). Although fluctuating, these data suggest that the environment for 41DN624 has been predominantly composed of C4 biomass with grasslands. Within the lower Btk horizon and overlying Bk2 horizon, the δ13C values show decreasing C4 biomass and the environment was approaching mixed grassland and arboreal for periods of time. Similar to 41DN580, the uppermost A horizon to the surface had decreasing C4 biomass and was returning to a mixed grassland and arboreal environment. Magnetic Susceptibility Two columns of MS samples were collected at 41DN624. One column was collected in Trench E (n=41) and one column from Trench J (n=60). The MS results from Trench E exhibits a steady and gradual decline in values down profile (see Figures 7.25 and 7.26). Interestingly, while no clear spike in MS values can be seen in Zone III where Feature 3 (roughly 172.11), the values remain steady through the zone. Feature 3 is a large thermal feature situated about 2 m south of the MS column. Therefore, it appears that cultural activities at 41DN624 have no evident correlation to the MS values.

Overall, the Trench E MS column does not exhibit any unconformities, but rather a steady and gradual decrease in values down profile. Although the second MS column in Trench J exhibits a steady and gradual decline in values down profile, gradual decrease in values the samples exhibited a bit more variability. There are notable fluctuations in Zone II (172.29 m), Zone III (172.11 m), and Zone IV (~171.20–171.11 m) (see Figure 7.26). The subtle MS fluctuation in Zone II may be attributed to recent disturbance. The MS fluctuation in Zone III is at a comparable depth as Features 9–10 and are interpreted to be associated with cultural activities. The fluctuations in χlf and the χfd values near the base of Zone IV where not in proximity to any recognized cultural activities. These fluctuations are more likely attributed to pedogenesis commonly associated with an increase in χfd values (Dalan 2006:164; 2008:22; Dinckal et al. 2022:846). Overall, the Trench J MS column does not exhibit any clear unconformities, but rather a steady and gradual decrease in values down profile. Optically Stimulated Luminescence Analysis As mentioned previously OSL analyses were also conducted during the investigations at 41DN624. Two OSL single grain samples from the Trench J profile were analyzed to assist in the chronometric data for the site. One sample (J01, USU-3871) was collected near the base of Zone IV Bk2 horizon while the second sample (J02, USU-3872) was collected from the Zone V Btk horizon near the base of the excavations (see Figures 7.22 and 7.24). Notably, no OSL samples were collected from the lowermost stratum (Zone VI) due to the prevalence of large clast materials. The collected samples bracketed the geomatrix humate samples to assist in providing some resolution to the chronometric data. Due to the high overdispersion (OD) values exceeding 20%, the age of the samples was analyzed using the Central Age Model (CAM) advocated by Galbraith and Roberts (2012). Sample J01, USU-3871 at 171.2 m elevation returned a 1σ age of 6,860±650 BP with an OD value of 22+4% (Appendix F). Further down, sample J02, USU-3872 at 171.0 m elevation returned a 1σ age of 7,270±630 BP with an OD value of 24+2% (Appendix F). In sedimentary settings like 41DN624 single grain OD values between 9–20% are considered to have been well bleached during deposition (Mahan and DeWitt 2019:20). However, single grain OD values exceeding 20% may indicate the mixing of grains of various ages from post-depositional processes or the partial resetting of grains (Bateman et al. 2003, 2007). Accordingly, these samples are interpreted to have been well bleached during initial deposition but have experienced some partial post-depositional mixing. Regardless, the chronometric data for these samples were modelled with the radiocarbon assays to refine the chronometric data. Radiocarbon Analysis At 41DN624, twelve samples were analyzed to provide chronometric data for the site. Specifically, four geomatrix humate samples from Trench E between 172.53–171.63 m elevation, four geomatrix humate samples from Trench J between 171.43–170.80 m elevation, two AMS charcoal assays from Feature 3 (172.11 m) and Feature 12 (171.79 m), and two organic sediment samples from Feature 6 (171.53 m) and Feature 8 (171.38 m). Cumulatively, these assays (n=12) indicated deposits ranging between 5900–1390 BP (Table 7.4). Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 161

The dates and elevations of the features were integrated with the humate chronometric data for chronometric modelling (Figures 7.27-7.29). The geomatrix humate samples were collected from a vertical column in Trenches E and J while the radiocarbon samples from the features were collected from across the excavations. The overall results of the chronometric data returned a good elevational and stratigraphic correlation. Put simply, none of the assays were dramatically out of stratigraphic order regarding their elevation and age compared to the other samples. The conventional 14C results for each of the 41DN624 samples from Beta Analytic were modelled in OxCal v4.4.4 using the IntCal20 calibration curve and examined with several analysis models. These data were examined and modelled using their stratigraphic order and elevation with the deposition model under the uniform (U_Sequence) and Poisson (P_Sequence) setting (Ramsey 2008a). The elevation of stratigraphic breaks of each Zone was included in the models as a change in boundary (see Figure 7.27). Table 7.3.

Notably, the lowest three humate samples (samples 624.J02–J04) do skew younger than their likely age (see Figure 7.29). However, the regression model of the calibrated ages and their elevations returned a value of R2=0.8252 suggesting an overall good correlation of the deposits with their ages. These skewed ages may, as previously mentioned, be attributed to younger carbon being mixed with older carbon and frequently date younger than the actual age of deposition (Abbott 2008:18; Birkeland 1999:137–140). Calculations were conducted of the combined chronometric data to determine an overall approximate deposition rate at 41DN624. Based on the current data, the overall average deposition rate at 41DN624 is 2.5 cm per 100 years (see Figure 7.28). The overall rates of sedimentation would be categorized as Slow under Ferring’s (1986:261) sedimentation categories. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 164

Further using the OxCal Deposition Model output, some initial calculations of sedimentation by respective stratigraphic zone were also conducted (see Figure 7.28). As with 41DN580, these preliminary sedimentation rates were conducted as a gross approximation based on the available data. Beginning in Zone V (modelled ages of ~8000–7100 cal BP), the rates of deposition from USU3872 up to the modelled boundary change at the top of Zone IV calculates an average of 3 cm per 100 years. In Zone IV (modelled ages of ~7100–4000 cal BP), the rates of deposition between the upper and lower modelled boundaries calculates an average of 1.7 cm per 100 years. The overlying Zone III (modelled ages of ~3700–2500 cal BP) and contains Feature 3 extends from the modelled boundary change of Zone III/IV to the top of Zone III and calculates an average of 7 cm per 100 years. In the upper Zone II (modelled ages of <1500 BP) calculates an average of 1.4 cm per 100 years. These rates of sedimentation would generally be designated as Slow under Ferring’s (1986:261) sedimentation categories. However, Zone III containing most of the cultural features encountered on the site (e.g., Features 3–5, 9, 10, and 12) with 7 cm per 100 years is approaching Moderate under Ferring’s (1986:261) sedimentation categories which is considered favorable for preserving isolable occupation surfaces. Span modelling was conducted on cultural features of 41DN624 to quantify the possible periods and duration of activity. The modelled span for the analyzed feature data in the Sanger deposits (i.e., Features 6 and 8) indicates a span of 0–259 years (2 σ) between 5900–5600 BP. Although limited to the dates from two features, this data may reflect a single occupation or very limited occupations during that period. For the Pilot Point and West Fork deposits, the modelled span data from the features (i.e., Features 3 and 12) indicates a span of 700–900 years (2 σ) between 3700–2700 BP. Similar to the cultural deposits observed at 41DN580, these data suggest at least two periods of activity during the Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation. The earliest, associated with Feature 12 would be between 3700–3500 BP while the latter for Feature 3 would be between 2900–2700 BP. 41DN624 Synthesis The deposits at 41DN624 are interpreted to encompass the Pilot Point and Sanger alloformations commonly encountered in the Trinity River basin of which the site is a part (Abbott 2011; Ferring 1990a, 1990b, 1991, 1992, 1994). The oldest humate date from 41DN624 (Beta-62775) returned a 2σ calibrated date of 5720–5580 BP while the modelled age of the deepest OSL sample (USU3872) returned a date of 8310–6090 BP. These data securely place the 41DN624 deposits as beginning in the Middle Holocene and extending to the present. Interestingly, the deposits at 41DN624 exhibited no clear evidence of a buried soil or any erosional disconformities to clearly demarcate the boundary between the Pilot Point and Sanger alloformations. The overall average deposition rate at 41DN624 is 2.5 cm per 100 years (see Figure 7.28). These data suggest a gradual, cumulic deposition for the site that would be categorized as a Slow sedimentation category (Ferring 1986:261; Yates and Ferring 1986:189). The overall occupations at 41DN624 as indicated by the cultural features (i.e., site furniture) appear to suggest minimally three periods of primary occupation (see Figures 7.24 and 7.27). The oldest in Zone IV (Bk2 horizon) within the Sanger alloformation there is one primary occupation indicated by Features 6–8 between ~5900– 5600 BP. Within the Pilot Point and West Fork alloformation there are likely two periods of primary Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 168

occupation. In Zone IV (Bk1 horizon) encompassed by Feature 12 and possibly Features 9 and 10 was between ~3700–3500 BP. The third primary occupation is indicated by Feature 3 and possibly Features 4–5 at roughly ~2900–2700 BP. 41DN580 and 41DN624 Regional Comparisons The deposits at 41DN580 and 41DN624 on Hickory Creek are interpreted to encompass most of the Holocene with cultural activity primarily occurring within the latter Sanger alloformation deposits and throughout the Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation. For context, the data from both 41DN580 and 41DN624 were compared with available data from other regional studies. For the stable carbon isotope (δ13C) and C3/C4 biomass comparisons, previous studies in the region were reviewed (Table 7.5). For more southern latitudes the Richard Beene Site in Bexar County, Hall’s Cave in Kerr County, and Owl Creek in Coryell County were examined (Mandel et al. 2007; Meier et al. 2014; Nordt et al. 2002; Waters et al. 2021). For studies closer to 41DN580 and 41DN624, Site 41TR170, 41TR198, and the Mercado Site (41TR203) in Tarrant County, Site 41DL203 in Dallas County, Site 41COL172 in Collin County, and Waxahachie Creek-1 Site (41EL246) in Ellis County were used (Frederick 2011; Hall et al. 2011; Lintz et al. 2008; Peter and Harrison 2011; Shipp et al. 2019; Short et al. 2021). Unfortunately, the comparison of regional rates of deposition was limited to only within the last 3000 years. Fortunately, there are many studies within proximity to 41DN580 and 41DN624 for comparison (Table 7.6). Specifically, the Mercado Site (41TR203) on the West Fork of the Trinity River (Frederick and McKee 2019), the Hardemann Midden Site (41DN612) on Denton Creek (Lawrence et al. 2020; Nielsen et al. 2021), site 41EL246 on the Waxahachie Creek (Frederick and Costa 2021), the Merrill Site (41DN99) on Isle du Bois Creek (Colvin 2013; Ferring and Yates 1997), and the Gemma Site (41CO150) on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River (Colvin 2013; Ferring and Yates 1997). Comparisons of 41DN580 and 41DN624 with the data from other regional investigations will be discussed in regard to alloformation period. Namely, the Sanger alloformation (~13000–4500 BP) and the Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation (~4500–300 BP). Sanger Alloformation Context Within the Sanger alloformation at 41DN580 the cultural activities most likely occurred between 5290–4960 BP while at 41DN624 the activities likely occurred between 5900–5600 BP. During this period, the stable carbon isotope (δ13C) data at these sites had values ranging from a high of -14‰ to a low of -17‰ (Table 7.5). These data suggest a mixed grassland and arboreal environment that transitioned to an increasing grassland environment through the Holocene. At the Richard Beene Site, the investigators examined the δ13C and C3/C4 biomass of buried soils and noted from 14,000–12,000 BP values of -22–25‰ suggesting an arboreal habitat (Mandel et al. 2007: Figure 3.20; Nordt et al. 2002: Figure 3). Between 12,000–7800 BP the vegetation appears to have become increasingly mixed with values of -20–21.5‰ to more grasslands from 7800–4500 BP with values of -18–20‰ (Mandel et al. 2007:Figure 3.20; Nordt et al. 2002:Figure 3).

From the Late Pleistocene until 5400 BP the C4 biomass exceeds 80 percent suggesting dominant grasslands (Waters et al. 2021:13–14). From 5400– 5200 BP there is an increase of arboreal contributions as there is a decrease to 70 percent C4 biomass (Waters et al. 2021:13–14). At Fort Hood in Central Texas, researchers examined a profile on Owl Creek, a tributary of the Leon River within the Brazos River basin (Meier et al. 2014). These investigations documented the δ13C and C4 biomass data for the last 14,000 years. Between 14,000–12,000 BP, the researchers identified an arboreal environment with values of -24 to -26‰ that shifted to increasing C4 values of -19 to -21‰ until 9500 BP (Meier et al. 2014:162–166). From 9500 BP to the present, the environment with values of -20 to -21‰ was mixed grasslands and timber becoming increasingly arboraceous in the recent past (Meier et al. 2014:162–166). Overall, the regional δ13C studies suggest the Late Pleistocene had an arboreal environment with a steady increase of mixed arboreal and grasslands into the Holocene. Notably, Bousman (1998:210) does report that pollen stratigraphic records from several bogs and rock shelters in Texas suggest several periods of low arboreal pollen from the Late Pleistocene into the Holocene. These low percentages of arboreal pollen imply open grassland habitats at 16,500 BP, 12,500 BP, 9000 BP, 7000– 4000 BP, 1500 BP, and 800–500 BP (Bousman 1998:210).

The rates of deposition for 41DN580 and 41DN624 sites during the Sanger alloformation roughly ranged between 2–4 cm per 100 years (Table 7.6). Specifically, the calculations at 41DN624 between ~7300–7100 BP (i.e., 6.3 cm per 100 years) show a slightly higher deposition rate than the 2.4 cm per 100 years at 41DN580 at roughly this time (~7800–6200 BP). Conversely, between ~7100–4000 BP at 41DN624, the deposition rates (i.e., 1.7 cm per 100 years) are lower than at 41DN580 between ~6200–4000 BP which were 3.7 cm per 100 years. Interestingly, the highest rate of deposition at both 41DN580 and 41DN624 occurred from roughly 4000–2500 BP which ranged from 5 and 7 cm per 100 years, respectively. These overall rates of deposition are interpreted as Slow under Ferring’s (1986:261) sedimentation categories. Pilot Point-West Fork Alloformation Context For the occupations at 41DN580 and 41DN624 within the Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation there are minimally two periods of occupation at each site. At 41DN580, the modelled dates from the features indicate primary activity between 4000–3700 BP and 800–700 BP. At 41DN624, the modelled feature dates indicate activity between 3700–3500 BP and 2900–2700 BP. The stable carbon isotope (δ13C) data at these sites during this period had values ranging from a high of -14‰ to a low of -16‰ suggesting an environment shift from mixed grassland and timber to increasing grasslands (see Table 7.5). Notably, both sites exhibit a sharp decrease in values to -19‰ beginning in the West Fork deposits that continues to the present indicating a mixed grassland and timber environment (see Figures 7.10 and 7.26). At the Richard Beene Site, from 4500–500 BP the δ13C values suggest increasing grasslands with values of -17 to -18‰ followed by a shift back to mixed arboreal and grasslands from 500 BP to the present with values of -19‰ (Mandel et al. 2007:Figure 3.20; Nordt et al. 2002:Figure 3). At Hall’s Cave (41KR474), from 5200–3400 BP, the habitat becomes increasingly mixed with C4 biomass between 60–70 percent followed by a decrease to 50 percent mixed grassland and arboreal habitat extending to the present (Waters et al. 2021:13–14). At the Mercado Site (41TR203) on the West Fork of the Trinity River, the δ13C values suggest a mixed grassland and timber environment with values of -20 to -21‰ between 2700–1500 BP (Frederick and McKee 2019:117). The environment became increasingly arboreal from 1500 BP to the present with values of -21 to -24‰ (Frederick and McKee 2019:117). At 41EL246 on Waxahachie Creek a tributary of the Trinity River, the δ13C values suggest a balance between C3 and C4 biomass from 1200 to 450 BP with values between -19 to -21‰ followed by a shift towards more arboreal C3 biomass between 450–200 BP fluctuating between -21 to -23‰ (Frederick and Costa 2021:101). At 41DL203 on Rowlett Creek, a tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity River, the δ13C values from 3100–500 BP ranged between -17 to -18‰ suggesting mixed arboreal with increasing grasslands followed by a shift with values around -19‰ suggesting mixed arboreal grasslands after 500 BP (Frederick 2011:101–102). The data for the recent alluvium encompassing 500 BP to the present was unfortunately removed and not sampled (Frederick 2011:102). At 41COL172 on Muddy Creek a tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity River, the δ13C values indicate a balance between C3 and C4 biomass with values fluctuating from -18 to -22‰ between 1000–400 BP followed by increasing in C4 biomass of -17 to -18‰ with increasing grasslands from 400 BP to the present (McKee 2010:117–119).

δ13C data between 2300–1000 BP had values of -17.7 to -18.9‰ suggesting grasslands (Hall et al. 2011:546-547; Lintz et al. 2008:58-63). From 1000–150 BP, values ranged from -20.7 to -21.75‰ suggesting mixed grasslands with increasing arboreal habitat (Hall et al. 2011:546-547; Lintz et al. 2008:58-63). The overall regional δ13C studies for the Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation suggest a transition from more open grasslands to increasing mixed arboreal habitat. This seems particularly evident at 41DN580 and 41DN624 within the last 300 years. Regarding the rates of deposition at 41DN580 and 41DN624 within the Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation. These sites ranged between 5–7 cm per 100 years which is an increase compared to the preceding Sanger alloformation period (Table 7.6). Notably, these rates are lower than other examined deposition rates in the region. At the Mercado site (41TR203), Frederick and McKee (2019) conducted an extremely detailed breakdown of periods of rapid and slower sedimentation on the West Fork of the Trinity River between 2700–1880 years BP. The researchers noted that between 2700–2600 years BP the sedimentation rate was 15.75 cm per 100 years, followed by a decrease down to 5.28 cm per 100 years between 2600–2040 years BP (Frederick and McKee 2019:Figure 6-13). The sedimentation rate then increased again to 13.4 cm per 100 years between 2040–1880 years BP and then decreased to 3.24 cm per 100 years (Frederick and McKee 2019:Figure 6-13). The averaged sedimentation rates at 41DN580 and 41DN624 (5–7 cm per 100 years) is much lower than observed at the Mercado site. Similarly, the rates of deposition at 41DN612 (Hardemann Midden Site) on Denton Creek were slightly higher than 41DN580 and 41DN624. Site 41DN612 is situated about 8.5-mi southwest of these sites on a comparably sized drainage and contained deposits from the last 600 years (Lawrence et al. 2020; Nielsen et al. 2021). Approximate depositional rate calculations of these Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation and recent alluvium deposits suggest an average deposition of 10 cm per 100 years between 2200–1100 BP. This is slightly higher than at 41DN580 and 41DN624 during the same period. Much further downstream in the Trinity River basin in Ellis County, site 41EL246 on the Waxahachie Creek (Frederick and Costa 2021). The calculation of sedimentation rates between 1200–400 BP indicated rates that fluctuated between 2.2–3 cm per 100 years (Frederick and Costa 2021:102–104). These rates of sedimentation are slightly lower than at 41DN580 and 41DN624. At the Merrill Site (41DN99) on Isle du Bois Creek between 1300–1100 BP the deposition rates were 19 cm per 100 years and then dropped to 5 cm per 100 years between 1100–500 BP (Colvin 2013:149; Ferring and Yates 1997:175–179). At the Gemma Site (41CO150) on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River between 1900–1500 BP, the rates of deposition were 21 cm per 100 years (Colvin 2013:149; Ferring and Yates 1997:175–179). These rates of sedimentation are higher than at 41DN580 and 41DN624. Overall, the deposition rates in the region during the Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation were varied. Not surprisingly the highest rates of sedimentation was observed on sites (i.e., Mercado Site) situated on larger drainages compared to the smaller waterways and tributaries. Regardless, all of these rates of sedimentation would be categorized as Slow to Moderate under Ferring’s (1986:261) sedimentation categories.

41DN624 was conducted (Figures 7.30–7.32). Specifically, the chronometric data from the two sites were compared with the Greenland ice core temperature data. Although not specific to the region, the ice core data can provide a proxy of the climatic conditions globally that may also have occurred at the two sites. By placing an intersect across the predominant ice core temperatures during the periods of occupations at the sites, the occupations within the Sanger alloformation coincided with a period of warmer global temperatures (Figures 7.30–7.32). The Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation occupations occurred when the global temperatures cooled. Interestingly, the more recent Late Prehistoric occupation at 41DN580 coincided with a period when the temperatures dramatically cooled, sometimes identified as the Little Ice Age (see Figure 7.31). This was a period of colder temperatures, greater storminess, and unpredictable climatic shifts (Fagan 2000). Although tenuous, these global trends do seem to corroborate with the δ13C values observed at 41DN580 and 41DN624. Specifically, these data indicate increasing C4 (warmer grassland environment) throughout the deposits and then increasing C3 (cooler arboreal environment) within the last 300–500 years (see Figures 7.10 and 7.26).

Figure 7.32. Sequence model of modelled radiocarbon from 41DN624 with NGRIP Ice Core data; red dates are charcoal. Conclusions On behalf of Acacia, Freese and Nichols, Inc., and the City of Denton, SWCA conducted geoarchaeological investigations of sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 in Denton County, Texas. The investigations were designed to assist Acacia’s significance testing and data recovery excavations at the two sites to comply with requirements of the ACT, which protects archeological sites and historic buildings on public land.

Regarding 41DN580, except for the uppermost horizons at the site where erosion and dredge material are present, the deposits have excellent integrity. Similarly, except for slight disturbance at the ground surface, the deposits at 41DN624 have excellent integrity. The geoarchaeological analyses of the site matrices and chronometric data for these sites on Hickory Creek are interpreted to encompass almost the entire Holocene. Although not initially recognized during the significance test excavations, the data recovery investigations determined the site deposits at both sites contained Sanger alloformation deposits capped by Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation up to the present. While there are some recognized periods of variable rates of deposition for both sites, the overall average is a gradual, cumulic rate of deposition. The context of the encountered features and chronometric modelling at both sites suggest at least one distinct period of activity in the Middle Archaic within the latter portions of the Sanger alloformation and minimally two distinct periods of activity in the Late Prehistoric throughout the Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation. The low quantities of cultural materials at both sites surrounding an apparent prevalence of thermal features is notable. This may be attributed to the scarcity of serviceable lithic raw material in the region to produce commonly recognized cultural materials. However, the presence of the thermal features in combination with the “low visibility” of cultural debris at the sites could be attributed to natural processes. Specifically, one of Ferring’s (1986) observations was that sedimentation rates in a fluvial basin (both high and low) can affect the density of a site’s assemblage. The higher the accumulation of sediment the more isolable and separated activity areas and occupations will be. Conversely, slower rates of accumulation will trend more to sites with a palimpsest as well as hinder the preservation of organic materials (Colvin 2013; Ferring 1986). The sedimentation rates at these sites were categorized as Slow and comparable or even lower than other sites in the region with similar sized drainages. Both 41DN580 and 41DN624 match almost all the criteria for sites potentially having poor integrity outlined by Ferring (1986:263–265). Yet, the subtle vertical and horizontal separation of the encountered cultural features at these sites suggests otherwise and is paradoxical. Other sites in the region (i.e., Hardemann Midden Site) had Slow deposition, relatively poor preservation, and limited cultural materials (Nielsen et al. 2020). In contrast to 41DN580 and 41DN624, the Hardemann Midden Site did have substantial overlapping activities that mixed the cultural occupations. Therefore, the occupations at 41DN580 and 41DN624 may in fact be discrete and isolable, but within a Slow sedimentation context. Although these sites likely suffered from poor preservation of organic materials, the cultural features and materials have good integrity. Recommendations The depth and breadth of the alluvial deposits at both sites was surprising. Specifically, both sites had intact, older Holocene alluvium at a much shallower depth than anticipated. The cultural deposits within the older alluvium provided an excellent glimpse of Middle Archaic cultural activities. This period in the Holocene has been previously recognized in the region to have a comparatively lower frequency of archeological sites than the other cultural periods (e.g., Collins 2004:115; McKinney 1981; Prikryl 1990:73–74). Although the cultural materials at both sites are sparse, the cultural materials, features, and data derived from their analyses was extremely informative.

opportunities are assuredly available at yet unidentified sites if the exploration approach considers the possibility. Therefore, several recommendations for future investigations are proposed. Future investigations, particularly on moderate sized tributary drainage valleys in the upper reaches of the Trinity River basin, should consider the possibility of encountering early and middle Holocene deposits. In settings similar to 41DN580 and 41DN624 the older Holocene deposits may be more easily reachable compared to further downstream in the basin where they become more deeply buried. Simply put, the location of a project area and the investigative approach is recommended to be heavily considered and tailored with respect to its placement within a larger drainage system. Next, systematic chronometric sampling (when conducted) should ideally have a tight vertical resolution (~5 cm) uniform spacing for better control and data yield. Among the potential benefits will be assisting the identification between cultural and natural transformations to a site (Schiffer 1996). Additionally, rates of deposition may be calculated and compared to other studies in the region. The metrics for Ferring’s (1986) system of rates of sedimentation may need to be refined. Specifically, the threshold of Slow to Very Rapid categories may need to be adjusted (i.e., decreased) for the smaller drainages. Admittedly, Ferring (1986:261) notes that the terminology is to facilitate conversation and by extension comparison and research. This is not in dispute, but rather some thought may need to be directed towards some standardized refinements. Considering that both 41DN580 and 41DN624 did exhibit the criteria for a site with Slow deposition (e.g., poor preservation) the current system of rates of sedimentation may be appropriate. However, this system is recommended to be further tested and refined if necessary. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 179

8. C S A S 41DN580 HIPPED TONE NALYSIS FOR ITES AND 41DN624 By Sergio J. Ayala and Katharine Pontillo Introduction & Background Some of the most difficult and useful knowledge to acquire in chipped stone analysis is how various kinds of tools were made and used. In this study, we examine the lithic material from 41DN580 and 41DN624 including tools and tool-making debris, identify the stage of manufacture, and draw on patterns of use and flake scar signatures to infer modifications on flakes for expedient tool craft. No micro-debitage was present in the examined heavy fraction from flotation samples; all recovered material was collected during excavations. The greater proportion of the lithic material represents the exhaustive curation of small, chipped stone flakes and bifacial thinning or margin trimming flakes to quickly craft opportunistic scraping, cutting, and abrading tools. The stimulus for such tools is situational with no requirement and need of extensive pre-planning. A Contemporary Review of the Uvalde Gravels Understanding the geographic position of these sites is paramount in comprehending much of the source stone material available to Prehistoric peoples and the manners in which it is leveraged. The northern prairies and cross timbers of Texas are nestled on the farthest margin of the West Gulf Coastal Plain, with a surface geology consisting of several Upper Cretaceous formations. From east to west these are the Austin Chalk, Eagle Ford, and Woodbine (Prikryl 1990). Within the soils of the cross timbers and prairies are Uvalde Gravel deposits, which date to the Miocene and originate from New Mexico. Comprising cherts, quartzites, igneous rocks, metamorphic rocks, vein quartz, and silicified wood, these gravel deposits are often considered remnants of ancient streams that no longer exist. Steve Stoutamire and Mike McBride shed light on the origins of the Uvalde Gravels in their publication in the Texas Archaeological Society Bulletin (2020). They focused on the purple Uvalde Gravel quartzites, crucial for understanding the origins of these gravel deposits. The transport of quartzites began around 16 million years ago with the erosion of New Mexico quartzites, carried eastward by braided streams as gravel-to-boulder size pieces. These were then deposited within the Ogallala Formation. Subsequently, the early erosion of the Ogallala Formation led to the redeposition of gravels into the Uvalde/Willis gravel depo centers during the Late Pliocene. Finally, during the Pleistocene, the erosion of the Ogallala Formation edges occurred, with central and lower Texas streams forming new drainage areas that cut new river valleys. As a result, today’s streams erode though Uvalde/Willis deposits, carrying material downstream to form Pleistocene/Holocene river terraces. The cherts within the Uvalde/Willis Gravels primarily come from Cretaceous Edwards Limestone, Texas Pennsylvanian and Cambrian Limestone, and the mountains of New Mexico, following similar erosional and depositional sequences and pathways as the quartzites (Stoutamire and McBride 2020). Consequently, in the field one finds well rounded chert gravels (Figure 8.1). The lithic assemblages within the Hickory Creek sites demonstrate a significant reliance on Uvalde Gravel Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 180

cherts and quartzites, particularly by hunter-gatherers of the Middle and Late Archaic. However, small amounts of chalcedony, novaculite, Ogallala quartzite, and silicified sandstone are also present. Figure 8.1. Common varieties of cherts within the Uvalde/Willis Gravel Belt (from TexasBeyondHistory.com). Key Terms Terms are often used in archeological reporting without definitions, causing a loss in meanings through a type of expected universal understanding. However, commonly understood terms and meanings may not fit the context of all studies, particular technical perspectives, or the theoretical position of all analysts. “Terminology and definitions that are adequate for one analysis are not always applicable to another” (Odell 1979:332). Consequently, the authors feel it important to be transparent about the meanings connected to terms in this report. Theoretically, much of the authors’ perspectives come from specific schools of thought and method such in Behavioral Science, Cognitive Anthropology, Symbolic Anthropology, Linguistics, the Chaîne Opératoire school of thought, and Human Behavioral Ecology. Technology – the co-emergence of cognitive and social information relating to knowledge acquisition, the performance of manufacture, the final materialized cultural product and its waste byproducts (debitage), and the manners in which such products are used in human lifeways. Thus, ancient technology (as a modern object of scientific analysis) is a keystone toward discovering the processes of manufacture and its life history in ancient socio-cultural contexts. Behavior – utilitarian, adaptive, and symbolic thought and actions to fulfill individual and social needs within a socio-cultural network. Technological Behavior – behaviors specific to meeting technological needs that can be utilitarian, adaptive, and/or symbolic needs. Importantly, knowledge acquisition and physical processes in the manufacture of technology may be symbolic in themselves. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 181

Unidirectional Modification – flake removal signatures that are a byproduct of modifications or usage that initiate and release in a single direction (multiple techniques and usage can cause this). Resultant flake scars are only present on one face of an edge or margin. Bidirectional Modification - flake removal signatures that are a byproduct of modifications or usage that initiate and release on both faces from the margin (multiple techniques and usage can cause this). Resultant flake scars are only present on both faces/sides of an edge or margin. Chipped Stone Behaviors Contextualized Hunter-gatherer life is often characterized by opportunism, leading to the creation of various functional tools from a single flake that can be utilized for numerous tasks including scraping, cutting, gouging, perforating, or shaping shafts though notching and denticulation, as well as for butchering purposes. Given that the majority of cultural material in these site investigations was hypothesized to consist of heavily curated chipped stone flakes, the primary objectives of the analysis in this study were twofold: first, to understand the techniques used in crafting the tools and creating specific types of flakes; and second, to identify the types of edge modifications performed. These modifications encompassed various techniques such as scraper retouch, abrupt retouch, invasive retouch, notches and denticulations, burinations, battering, bifacial rotary retouch, and intentional breaks (Hayden 2022). Finally, any significant chipped stone behaviors associated with the major features, primarily Feature 14 from 41DN580 and Feature 10/11 from 41DN624, are examined to either confirm or refute potential theoretical models of Middle and Late Archaic mobility patterns of North Texas. Preliminary insights into this aspect are provided based on the limited lithic evidence and site context available. Methodology All material culture relating to chipped stone behaviors underwent multiple rounds of study to extract as much behavioral information as possible within natural time constraints. While all avenues of analysis could not be pursued, we hope more in-depth use-wear analysis can be done in the future for 41DN580. Nonetheless, interpretations rely on substantive data. Each artifact underwent visual analysis, including examination under microscopes and both short-wave and long-wave ultraviolet light. We initially sorted and described artifacts based on several basic properties, beginning with notations of color, banding, quality of the crystal grain structure, subcortex color, and microfossil signatures of the chippable stone materials. The presence or absence of edge-modification was assessed. Specimens were isolated based on their morphology from manufacture and the nature of the edge modifications or lack thereof. Materials were fluoresced using an Analytikjena short- wave/long-wave ultraviolet light to confirm or negate the presence of Edwards Chert materials known to have unique orange-yellow hue signatures. We then performed high-resolution observational analysis using a Zeiss Stemi SV 6 microscope at low-to-medium power (250-500x) to identify subtle cultural modification across all tool classes. Over 500 high-resolution scans were taken at 6,900 dots per inch² (dpi), alongside microscopic photographs from the Zeiss Stemi microscope, mounted with an iPhone 11 Pro Max camera.

Bifaces and bifacially worked artifacts were classified according to the manufacturing stage, functional tool type, and established named types where possible. Identifications of manufacturing stage followed the TxDOT Chipped Stone Analytical Protocol (2014), which divides bifacial reduction into five categories. These five stages are: 1) initial package reduction; 2) blank preparation; 3) preform shaping and thinning; 4) final edge trimming and sharpening; and 5) rejuvenated forms. Most of the bifaces across both sites fall into stage 4 or 5. The fourth stage includes artifacts that have reached the end stage of manufacture, and often enter the archeological record due to breakage, caching, being lost or otherwise abandoned (TxDOT 2014:6). The fifth and final stage of reduction includes rejuvenated and exhausted forms that have notable edge retouching or remodeling and/or evidence of a secondary production and use trajectory in contrast to its initial form (TxDOT 2014:6). Named point typology typically followed Turner, Hester, and McReynolds (2011; also see Davis 1995). Debitage was sorted into shatter and flake subgroups, and flakes were identified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on the amount of extant cortex. Primary flakes contain approximately 90% or more cortex on the dorsal surface; secondary flakes contain 1-90% cortex; tertiary flakes have no cortex and include interior flakes and bifacial thinning flakes. Shatter was noted when the dorsal and ventral surfaces cannot be identified on typically angular pieces with or without cortex. Material color and other notes specific to the stage of reduction or use were also recorded. Additionally, the chronology of each specimen was noted based on elevation and relative position within the site and soil profile. Tables presenting the results of all analyses are in Appendix B. Analysis – Site 41DN624 There are 63 total lithic artifacts from 41DN624: 50 modified/used flakes, 7 formal tools (points, knives, scrapers, perforators, etc.), and 3 “other” (neither flaked stone or a formal tool). All artifacts were preliminarily analyzed to identify the type (flake, tool, biface, shatter, etc.) and stage of reduction (primary, secondary, tertiary, formal tool, etc.). Fifty-eight artifacts were analyzed in more detail to include fluorescence, material sourcing, and type of use-wear. There are no primary flakes from 41DN624, and the majority of lithics (n=48) are tertiary flakes (Figure 8.2). All artifact data is presented in Appendix B; below are the results of detailed analysis of 58 artifacts. From the total assemblage at 41DN624.2 (south of Hwy 377), 91.5% of the specimens were recovered from Block B (Table 8.1). This represents 74% of the overall assemblage from the site. The area defined as Feature 10/11 (in/around units 45-55, 57, 61-64) accounts for 39 specimens, 62% of the total assemblage (Table 8.2; Appendix B). As most units were also feature-focused, the recovered lithic material is also associated with documented features. Observations, including microscopic examination and UV fluorescence of 58 artifacts showed that 45 (77.5%) is Edwards Plateau chert. Of the remaining 13 artifacts, 17% are Uvalde Chert locally and regionally sourced in Denton County. Three flakes make up the remaining 5% and are categorized as “other”: one flake is chalcedony, one is silicified sandstone, and one is a quartzite projectile point (specimen 384-01; Tables 8.3-8.4).

Table 8.4. Source Material Counts. Material Qty. Edwards Plateau 45 Uvalde Chert 10 Chalcedony 1 Silicified Sandstone 1 Quartzite 1 Analysis revealed that six artifacts are refurbished bifaces and/or projectile points and 56 are flakes. Almost all of the flakes are relatively small in size, ≥17 mm to ≤24 mm. They have dorsal faces with an arris that typically runs longitudinally from the platform to the distal end, a trait common in skilled bifacial thinning procedures. Most are tertiary flakes meant to shape blanks or refurbish bifaces and points. Most of these flakes had small, concentrated platforms, very flat, thin or no bulb of percussion, along with a small lip on the ventral edge of the platforms which are often the results of indirect, punch percussion. Although 56 artifacts are flakes, only 3 were unused/modified pieces of debitage. The remaining flakes have unidirectional or bidirectional flaking on one or both margins, with light to heavy use or controlled modifications through chipping and pressure techniques. Thus, the flake assemblage represents situational and expedient tasks. A significant portion of the modified/used flake material appears to have been used once, by few individuals, and possibly single individuals for single encampments. One overshot flake (271-01) exists in the assembly (Figures 8.4-8.6). A brief review of this flake type is necessary to place the specimen in a proper temporal, technological, and cultural context. Overshot flakes can be an accidental byproduct or a controlled product. Thus far, there are two well- known formal technological systems in prehistory that incorporate controlled, overshot flaking into their bifacial, lanceolate technologies: the Solutrean of southern Europe (Upper Paleolithic) and Clovis of the Americas (Upper Paleolithic) (Bradley et al. 2010; Stanford and Bradley 2012). On specimen 271- 01, flake scares on the dorsal face of the platform represent a failed attempt in strategic mass removal. The second attempt succeeded. In profile the bulb of percussion is thin and flat. Additionally, the platform is lipped. Based upon experimental work by the authors, these combined traits are most common when incorporating indirect, punch percussion techniques, and less common with direct, billet percussion. Indirect percussion can be accomplished in a multitude of ways, such as using a deer antler beam (all the tines are trimmed), a short antler tine punch (drift), or the combination of slotting a stick inside the soft interior of a large deer antler tine that incorporates a leg-assisted technique. However, through the battery of our experimental sessions using all of the above-mentioned indirect percussion techniques, leg-assisted punch percussion and antler beam punch percussion provide the best-fit techniques that produce these lipped-platforms with shallow, and thin bulbs of percussion. Other significant technological signatures and traits to assess are the flake scar patterns and signatures on the dorsal face, along with the flake’s longitudinal cross-section. The flake scar signatures are not consistent with controlled, methodical over-shot bifacial thinning. Instead, the flake scars denote early-phase, opportunistic flaking by an experienced and knowledgeable flintknapper. Thus, though controlled and skillfully removed after a single error, this overshot flake does not fit or Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 188

relate within a strategy that involves sequenced overshot flakes. While this removes the possibility that this overshot was accidental, it also removes the possibility that this could have been a recovered Clovis overshot flake that was modified with some minor abrupt flaking toward the dorsal face. Figure 8.3. Leg-assisted punch percussion (Marty Rueter - flintknapper) with a stick inserted into the soft portion of white tail deer antler. A Visual Review of 41DN624 – Modified Edge Signatures and Traits (Highlights) The following images represent modification and use behaviors often under-reported in archeology. Edge-modification signatures can sometimes come from controlled, sequenced flake removals by human agency. Some are the result of single or multiple task behaviors. In the case of artifacts that may cause confusion, extended explanation is provided to support the interpretations of artifacts and assemblages. Regarding any highlighted artifacts that are in close association to a major feature, these are given their own place of discussion after this ‘visual review’. Features in 41DN624 are not rich in chipped stone material. However, there are repeated behaviors on specimens that offer intimations of human behaviors connected to these features, as well as how the features were used and what situational needs the chipped stone materials provided. The following images provide many repeated behaviors, particularly the light and single use of flakes for scraping and cutting (Figures 8.4-8.21). Peripherally, perforating, battering, chopping, and food processing are also represented. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 189

Figure 8.21. (Specimen 5-01) At a higher magnification; light, abrupt micro-chipping from scraping motion. Specimen 147-01 (Figures 8.22-8.26) is a scraper manufactured on Edwards Chert. The edges are steeply beveled and there are both unidirectional and bidirectional flaking with significant polish on the margins. Specimen 219-05 (Figures 8.27-8.28) is a distal fragment. The lateral flake removals are crude and oblique in patterning across the face of the flake. It is manufactured on Edwards chert and has edge-wear fractures on both lateral margins. Specimen 220-01 (Figures 8.29-8.30) is a small, triangular point with prominent shoulders which have been side notched. The stem is expanding with a convex base that has been ground. Specimen 220-01 is a Godley point and dates to the Late Archaic period. It is manufactured on a variety of poor-quality Uvalde Gravel Chert. Specimen 384-01 (Figures 8.31-8.32) is a Godley or Trinity Point manufactured on Ogallala quartzite, which was locally sourced near the site. This point is alternately beveled from base to stem; both margins have bidirectional flaking in addition to some lateral refurbishing flakes. One lateral margin has more prominent flaking than the other. The midline is crooked and the distal end is absent, possibly used as a knife.

margins of the stem are beveled in one direction and the blade edges are beveled in the opposite direction. This point is shouldered. The lateral margins are parallel and the base is concave and split. There are deep basal thinning flakes that extend beyond the terminus of the stem, into the blade portion of the point. The stem is relatively long and the cross section is thick for the size of this point (an effect from heavy refurbishing). Manufacturing flakes are in an oblique-lateral pattern with some smaller finishing flakes along the blade margins. The lateral margins and basal edge are ground. Both margins of the blade have use-wear and polish. Specimen 376-01 (Figures 8.35-8.36) is a projectile point with a broken distal end and base. The flaking patterning is chevron in orientation. This point has weak shoulders, one is broken. The distal break is indicative of strong compression forces. Specimen 171-01 is a modified bifacial tool (Figures 8.37-8.40). There is battering, crushing, and bidirectional flaking on the left margin. Figure 8.22.

Behaviors Associated with Lithic Artifacts and Features Data recovery associated with hearth features can provide expanded opportunities for lifeway and site-function understandings. For this reason, after specimen analyses were completed, contextual data relating to features was examined for any possible, unique chipped stone behaviors. Within site 41DN624 some features have lithics and some do not. Out of a total of 13 features in the site, the significant features are 3 and 10/11. Feature 3 is a large, well-defined feature, with cooking and consumption evidence (bone, charcoal, and mussel shell). Features 10 and 11 represent an activity area that contained numerous flake tools, but the associated behaviors (scraping and cutting tasks) mirror behaviors found distant and disconnected from the features. The eight edge- modification behaviors that the analysts looked for (scraper retouch, abrupt retouch, invasive retouch, notches and denticulations, burinations, battering, bifacial rotary retouch, and intentional breaks) revealed what appears to be very short-term, rarely repeated, expedient scraping and cutting tasks, two of the eight possible edge-modification behaviors. On a macro level, a total of 63 lithic pieces were present at the site, 40 of these were recovered from Features 10 and 11 (Table 8.5). All specimens from Feature 10/11 were modified/utilized, while within the overall site assemblage, 89% of all flakes are utilized. Nonetheless, the overall assemblage is small. Due to such a small assemblage and the nature of their use and modifications, the interpretation is that these features likely represent single events. Complimenting this, the chipped stone material around each feature likely represents the archeological capture of single, momentary stays of individuals performing few, functional tasks before moving on. Table 8.5. 41DN624 Lithic counts from features by elevation (m amsl). Feature 2 3 4 6 9 12 13 10/11 None Total Elevation 172-172.1 1 1 1 3 172.3-172.4 1 1 172.2-172.3 17 17 172.1-172.2 2 3 21 26 171.9-172 1 1 1 3 171.8-171.9 1 1 171.7-171.8 4 2 2 8 171.6-171.7 1 1 171.5-171.6 1 1 171.4-171.5 1 1 171.3-171.4 1 Total 5 3 1 2 2 1 4 40 4 63 Thus, the data support the view that 41DN624 is a seasonal, short-term stay for individuals or small groups from Middle Archaic times and forward. In terms of the nature of these brief stops along Hickory Creek, the scant evidence of biface and dart point manufacture, the refurbishing of points and knives, along with the numerical degree of flake tools and the nature of their modifications, the ancient, brief stays appear to involve animal and plant processing, along with an aquatic food focus.

Analysis – Site 41DN580 There were 136 total artifacts recovered from site 41DN580: 65 modified/used flakes, 8 tools (points, knives, bifacial tools, scrapers, etc.), and 63 “other” (unused flakes, shatter, etc.). Of the 136 lithics, 74 artifacts were analyzed in more detail (all angular pieces and shatter were excluded). Appendix B presents the results of all analyses. From the total assemblage, all lithic artifacts were recovered from the most northern sections of the site; none were found in Trench D. These include 12 bifacial tools or points, and 121 flakes; the majority are tertiary flakes (n=82), followed by secondary (n=27), and few primary flakes (n=13) (see Figures 8.41-8.42). In particular, 77% of the assemblage (n=105) came from units in the Late Prehistoric period component outside the margins of Block E (Table 8.6).

Fluorescence of 74 artifacts showed that 58% of the materials (n=43) are a variety of chert from Uvalde Gravels. Of the remaining artifacts, 32.4% (n=24) are from the Edwards Plateau, 9.5% are categorized as “other”. In the “other” category, microscopic analysis identified three flakes of silicified sandstone and one of Ogallala quartzite. The silicified sandstone and quartzite are locally sourced in Denton County.

Figure 8.61. (Specimen 304-05) Light, unidirectional use-wear, smoothening. Specimen 258-01 is a Colbert or Hayes arrow point that was attempted on poor quality chert from an unknown source (Figures 8.62-8.63). There is barb loss and heavy stacking on the margin from unsuccessful pressure work. The lateral edges of this point are recurved. The existing barb is wide but the stem is not typically straight like a Colbert arrow point. The stem of this arrow point appears to have more of a diamond shape which is common with Hayes arrow points. Specimen 424- 01 is a Kent dart point made on chert from an unknown source (Figures 8.64-8.65). The body is asymmetrical and there is only one defined shoulder which is weak. This is a poorly made dart point on poor quality material. Specimen 338-01 is a small adze or a scraper (Figures 8.66-8.68), manufactured on Edwards Plateau chert. One margin is heavily beveled through intentional modification of a flintknapper. The other has evidence of use-wear. This tool might have been used for multiple functions. Specimen 232-01 (Figure 8.69) is a fragment of a biface or projectile point that was manufactured on chert that is of an unknown source.

material is novaculite from the Arkansas/Oklahoma region of the United States. This spall does have polish along the margin where the cutting edge is present. Specimen 170-01 (Figures 8.70-8.71) is an Alba arrow point manufactured on poor quality chert from an unknown source. This point is triangular in shape, although the distal end has been snapped off. The lateral margins are slightly concave. It has shoulders and a stem that are parallel. Specimen 301-01 (Figures 8.72-8.73) is a snapped distal end of a biface or projectile point. Manufactured on chert from an unknown source, the basal edge has been refurbished and thinned down. The body is triangular and on one face there are finishing pressure flakes in lateral pattern. There is a pot lid on one face of this tool indicating it was exposed to high heat. Specimen 304-04 (Figures 8.73-8.75) is likely a small preform for a Fresno arrow point. The body is triangular and small in size. Both faces have chevron patterned finishing flakes that extend down the body of the point. The basal edge is not ground and has a platform still present, leaving the point unfinished. This point was manufactured on chert from an unknown source. Specimen 207-12 (Figures 8.76-8.77) is a longer, prismatic flake that has characteristics similar to a burin spall. There are two platforms on both distal and proximal ends. This tool has one edge that has been modified and heavily used. There is a lateral flake on one face that was removed in the opposite direction of the spall on the ventral face. All three edges have evidence of use-wear. This tool was manufactured on chert of an unknown source. Specimen 31-01 (Figures 8.78-8.79) is a scraper that was manufactured on Edwards Plateau chert. One margin is modified and heavily beveled. The working edge has evidence of heavy use. Specimen 10-01 (Figures 8.80-8.81) is a refurbished specimen that fits morphologically in the ranges of either a Marshall or a Bell point fragment. The flake scars are more aligned with Marshall dart point thinning and notching techniques. The distal snap occurred from high force-loads, possibly an impact fracture. Such examples highlight the challenges in classificatory work. Some refurbished dart points, when they are greatly reduced, are quite similar in dimensions, leaving only the flaking technology to reveal their temporal and cultural root.

Figure 8.84. Possible Alba point base/stem, bifacially worked (specimen 188-01). Behaviors Associated with Lithic Artifacts and Features Out of all the features in 41DN580, Feature 14 (the Late Prehistoric component) is the most significant, contributing 105 pieces (71%) to the total lithic assemblage (Tables 8.10-8.11). Originally recorded as a feature during investigations, continuing excavations revealed Feature 14 is a cultural component dated to Late Prehistoric. Of the 58 Late Prehistoric specimens with an identified material source, 14 are Edwards Plateau chert, and 38 are on Uvalde chert. When we break out these categories further, all 14 of the Edwards chert specimens are flakes, 11 tertiary and 3 secondary; there are no primary flakes, bifaces, or formal tools made from Edwards chert in the Late Prehistoric site component. All points and bifaces, as well as at least 32 flakes (7 heat-treated), from this component are made of Uvalde Gravel chert. This data indicates that Edwards chert tools and materials were present at the site, were reduced to produce expedient flake tools, and further suggests the bulk of Edwards material was heavily curated and reused, leaving only the few utilized flakes behind. The activities represented by the used flakes in this component (Feature 14) are like 41DN624, except for the considerable amount of polish signatures on flakes. It is uncertain what specific activity is the cause of the polishing, though the current hypothesis is that the kind of light, reflective, and fluid-like appearance on some edges is the result of frictional heat and the spreading of plant opal. Further analysis and experiments would be required to affirm or disaffirm this hypothesis. Overall, the flake tools and significant amounts of polish on flake margins suggests a wider array of flake tool tasks than the task signatures on flakes connected to the primary features in 41DN624. Additionally, while Uvalde Chert is the primary source of material for Late Prehistoric period lithics, 14 pieces (13.7%) are identified as Edwards Chert. The primary type of Edwards Chert in Feature 14 is the Georgetown variety, a light-medium gray, fine-grain chert. This fits Prikryl’s (1990) explanations of source-stone use and selectivity over time. Prikryl (1990:83) argued that Late Prehistoric societies favored quality cherts instead of improving local medium-to-poor quality cherts Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 260

Below, we discuss implications of the patterns and observations made above, including the types of behaviors indicated by the lithic assemblage, what the abundance of certain materials and tool types at each site indicates, and presents possible interpretations for why so much of the 41DN580 assemblage is present in the Late Prehistoric component (Feature 14). Climatic and ecological data could provide valuable insights into the nature of short-term encampments along Hickory Creek during the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. While some climatological data present conflicting views, much of our current understandings come from studies conducted in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s (Baker and Penteado-Orellana 1977; Bond 1966; Bryant 1977a, 1977b; Bryant and Shafer 1977; Holloway et al. 1985). It seems evident that significant ecological transitions to more arid conditions occurred during the onset of the Middle Archaic, and again during the Late Prehistoric period. These transitions influenced human behaviors, including the utilization of flaked stone, and how localities were leveraged during climactic and ecological changes. Humans are highly adaptable, adjusting their tools and behaviors to suit changing environmental conditions. Notably, these climactic conditions align with periods of population growth and the increased presence of plant processing tools and features (Brownlow et al. 1999). We see this reflected in the types of stone tools and the use-wear on them, as well as the increasingly localized material procurement practices which suggest decreasing mobility patterns over time (e.g., Lintz et al. 2008; Tinsley and Dayton 2011; Todd 2014; alternately, see Prikryl 1990).

While we cannot specifically correlate this lithic data with broad climactic patterns noted above, it is worth noting that similar resource processing activities were taking place at both sites and across long periods of time. With additional localized and fine-grained environmental data, this could be used to explore more specific human-environment interactions and potentially get at issues of seasonality across time. To better understand the types of use-wear documented at 41DN580 and 41DN624, four individuals modified 37 experimentally produced flakes on silicified sandstone, chalcedony, and chert. They performed two timed episodes of scraping on juniper and oak wood, as well as mussel shell. Time was determined in the number of scrapings, where ‘light use’ equals two scrapes, and ‘moderate use’ equals twenty scrapes. The two woods constitute soft and hard material, oak being much harder than juniper. The experiment was implemented to seek possible distinct use-wear and polish signatures on the stone sources, analogous to the Hickory Creek site materials. Overall, the study revealed that use-wear signatures rarely occur with two scrapes on soft or hard wood, or mussel. Thus, it is important to consider this when interpreting degrees of use-wear on lithic tools. Another crucial aspect to consider regarding the Hickory Creek sites is the procurement and processing of lithic material from locational and behavioral perspectives. The Hickory Creek locality boasts an abundance of Ogallala quartzite and Uvalde gravels. However, when comparing the assemblages of both sites across different periods, the evidence suggests there is a difference in choice and material use between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric site components. Data shows that Archaic period people favored higher quality Edwards Chert over nearby Uvalde Gravel chert varieties, while the Late Prehistoric component comprises primarily Uvalde chert. This shift may be influenced by factors such as group alliances, mobility, trade, social forces, or individual choice that may have hindered the investment in improving local chert stone through thermal alteration. Further investigations in this region of Texas are therefore crucial for understanding patterns in life-way behaviors during the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. At 41DN580, evidence suggests cutting and scraping activities were common, and the high polish on many specimens and across time periods (Archaic and Late Prehistoric) suggests significant plant processing was a focus of the site’s many occupants. This polish is present most frequently on tertiary flakes but is also present on at least two bifaces and several secondary flakes. Unlike 41DN624, this type of use-wear is seen across all material types, but still suggests a reliance on expedient flake tools for many activities. Edwards chert debitage at 41DN580 is most numerous from 174.4-174.6 m amsl (n=14), at the top of the Late Prehistoric site component. In the Archaic assemblage, while there is a slight decrease in the number of Edwards lithics they make up a much higher proportion of the assemblage (n=10, 38.5%). However, the overall assemblage for the earlier Archaic components is much smaller (n=28), which could have an impact on the diversity of materials present. There is no geological cause recognized that accounts for differential distribution of chert types, which is best explained by material source choice. These patterns show that local Uvalde Gravel cherts were more common in the Late Prehistoric, while earlier deposits are marked by the favor and reliance on Edwards chert. One notable datapoint is the presence of novaculite among the source stone specimens in both the Middle Archaic and Late Prehistoric assemblages at 41DN580. Novaculite, which has appeared in Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 262

other regional assemblages, is acquired from the western Ouachitas, as seen at the Aubrey Clovis site (41DN479). Despite representing vastly different archeological periods and lifeways, the finding is significant, with several lithic specimens from 41DN580 visually matching this novaculite. Microscopically, these specimens exhibit fine-grained textures and white to light gray coloring with yellow undertones. Table 8.10. 41DN580 Material type by elevation.

Edwards chert pieces account for 45 of the 63 total lithics present at the site (71%). Of these, four are bifacial tools/points. Most notably, the activity area that is Feature 10/11 has 36 Edwards chert specimens, which is 90% of the material from that feature area. More than any other area at either site, the lithics from Feature 10/11 reflect the choice of high-quality but distant materials over lower quality and locally available materials. At 41DN624, the identifiable use-wear patterns indicate scraping and cutting activities, primarily on tertiary flakes (Appendix B). Although the specific materials these tools were used on could not be identified from the wear patterns, the visibility and extent of the wear suggests significant resource processing was taking place.

flakes as opposed to formal tools could suggest that high-quality materials and tools were highly curated and therefore taken when people moved on from the site leaving behind only exhausted and expedient tools. Another behavioral component meriting review is the fracture and refurbishment signatures on projectile point technologies (see Appendix B). Refurbishing on projectile points in both sites across time periods is extensive and heavy, some points are completely exhausted. Additionally, the manner of reduction on some specimens may indicate a dual purpose. First, the use of points as a possible source of flakes for flake tools. This may be particularly true for the few or absent Edwards tools but the notable count of Edwards flakes, especially at site 41DN624. Second, projectile points indicate breakage with no associative evidence of new manufacturing, such as primary and secondary flake debitage. Freshly made dart and arrow points are not present in these assemblages. Discards from different time periods without associated manufacturing suggests that favored manufacturing areas were elsewhere, and the Hickory Creek sites functioned as short-term staging areas. Again, this gives the overall impression that high-quality lithic materials from more distant sources were heavily curated across occupations, while locally available cherts were primarily used during the Late Prehistoric habitation of 41DN580 for both expedient flake tools and to make small bifaces. Human behaviors across time at the Hickory Creek sites show a consistent use of short-term camps from the Late Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods. These camps, often accommodating only a few people or single individuals passing through, demonstrate a reliance on tool kit usage and stone tool craft for expedient tasks, not specialized hafted knife or projectile weaponry. Instead, significant manufacturing is not archeologically visible at these sites, suggesting a highly mobile strategy involving transportable clutches of thinning flakes. Conclusion Some of the most difficult and useful knowledge to acquire in chipped stone analysis is how various kinds of tools were manufactured and used by their makers, and what their presence in the archeological context can say regarding chronologies and technological behaviors. Sites 41DN624 and 41DN580 contain Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric cultural components with fire cracked rock, mussel shells, and bone, with low densities of chipped stone material. Evidence for Middle Archaic occupation is meager and difficult to leverage for any significant insight. The greater proportion of the lithic material represents the exhaustive curation of small, chipped stone flakes, the intentional modification of spalls, and bifacial thinning or margin trimming flakes to quickly craft opportunistic scraping, cutting and abrading tools. Many of the Transitional period flake tools also have polish related to vegetal processing. All the flake tools for both sites suggest a mobility strategy for traveling with a clutch of usable thinning flakes for flake tools. A much smaller proportion of the lithic material at both sites involves the refurbishing and modification of projectile weaponry and knives (arrow and dart points), which require a greater investment to complete. Feature data aids the view that the Hickory Creek locality was an established short-stop locality. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 264

9. S -T C V S HELL EMPERED ERAMIC ESSEL HERDS FROM 41DN580, D C , T ENTON OUNTY EXAS By Timothy K. Perttula Archeological investigations in 2022 recovered a small assemblage of Late Prehistoric shell- tempered body and base sherds from shallow contexts (20-50 cm below datum [bd]) at 41DN580 in northern Denton County (Figure 9.1), north of Lake Lewisville. The assemblage includes 31 ceramic vessel sherds (including several refit body and base sherds from Unit 68) mainly from Units 50, 23 sherdlets (less than 1.5 cm in length and width) also primarily from Units 50, and 39 pieces of burned clay (mainly in Unit 64). The 14 separate but joinable body sherds refit to form two body sherds, and two base sherds conjoin to form one base sherd. Figure 9.1. The location of Denton County in North-central Texas. By depth, the shell-tempered sherds from the site are distributed from 0-50 cmbd. They are concentrated between 20-30 cmbd (n=19), and between 30-40 cmbd (n=5). There are sherd refits between 27-37 cm bd, 30-40 cmbd, and 40-50 cmbd, pointing to an active occupational zone. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 265

These attributes are: sherd type (i.e., rim, body, and base), temper, firing conditions (i.e., oxidizing, reduced, etc.) (see Teltser 1993), surface treatment (i.e., smoothed, burnished, etc.), wall thickness (in mm), and decoration, if any (Table 9.2). All of the sherds from 41DN580 are from coarse-tempered and relatively thick-walled shell- tempered vessels, most likely from sturdy cooking jars (Table 9.2). The shell temper has been burned and crushed before it was added to the vessel paste. It is probable that these sherds are from Late Prehistoric Nocona Plain vessels, characteristic of ceramics made in the southern Plains of Texas and Oklahoma (Drass 1998; Ellis et al. 2015; Ferring and Yates 1998; Krieger 1946; Prikryl and Perttula 1995; Perttula 2016, 2020).

The most distinctive of the sherds from this vessel are the two conjoined base sherds (Figure 9.2). The base sherd is flat with rounded corners and is an impressive 15.2 mm in thickness. The mean thickness of the body sherds is a robust 8.26 + 0.64 mm, with a range of 6.6-9.7 mm. The sherds are from vessels that were commonly smoothed on their exterior surface, Figure 9.2.

One of the sherds from 41DN580 has parallel brushing marks on the vessel exterior surface (Figure 9.3). These marks, made with swathes of grass bundles dragged across the wet vessel surface, would have run vertically from near the vessel rim to the vessel base. Such decorated vessels are present in other Late Prehistoric shell-tempered ceramic assemblages in the Southern Plains, including Henrietta phase sites such as Harrell (Perttula 2016) and Henderson (41CY6) (Perttula 2020). We may dub these Nocona Brushed, and suspect they were first made after ca. AD 1200-1250. Summary of the Assemblage The ceramic vessel sherd assemblage from 41DN580 is comprised of a small sample of sherds from a few plain shell- tempered Nocona Plain jars with flat bases. These jars have been fired and cooled predominantly in a reducing or low oxygen environment, occasionally smoothed on their exterior surface, and were made with thick vessel walls. These are sturdy cooking jars. One of these jar sherds is from a Nocona Brushed vessel. Finally, three calibrated radiocarbon dates have been Figure 9.3. Parallel brushed shell- obtained on the deposits from 41DN580 with the shell- tempered body sherd, TU 40, Feature 14, 20-30 cm bd, Lot 207. tempered ceramics, providing data on the likely age of the assemblage. At two sigma, the highest probabilities are AD 1221-1282, 1156-1262, and AD 1120-1222. These dates overlap in the early 13th century, suggesting the Nocona Plain and Nocona Brushed ceramics represent an early Late Prehistoric use of the site as well as the early manufacture of shell-tempered ceramics in this part of the Southern Plains. Radiocarbon Dates from Sites on the Little Elm Fork of the Trinity at Lake Lewisville with Shell-Tempered Ceramics Shell-tempered ceramics are a common feature of Late Prehistoric, Henrietta phase, sites at Lake Lewisville (Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring and Yates 1998), especially at sites such as 41DN27 and 41DN372. There are a few radiocarbon dates (n=7) on these Henrietta phase sites and ceramics, but they are younger than the shell-tempered component at 41DN580. Using Version 8.2 of Calib.org (accessed September 11, 2022), the Lake Lewisville sites have age ranges on shell-tempered ceramics that range from AD 1212-1421 (with a median probability of AD 1307) to AD 1290-1496 (with a median probability of AD 1405). The shell-tempered Nocona Plain and Nocona Brushed sherds from 41DN580 are apparently at least three or more generations older than the shell-tempered assemblages at the sites at Lake Lewisville.

10. V F A 41DN580 ERTEBRATE AUNAL NALYSIS OF AND 41DN624 By James O. Ramsey, Jodi A. Jacobson, and Stefanie L. Haliburton Identification and Analysis All bones analyzed for this study were identified through use of the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) Vertebrate Comparative Collection at Texas State University, the analyst’s private faunal collection, use of loan specimens from the University of Tennessee’s Department of Anthropology’s Vertebrate Comparative Skeletal Collection, and assorted identification manuals and articles (Cohen and Serjeantson 1996; Cox McLain Environmental Consultants 2019; France 2009; Jacobson 2004; Olsen 1964, 1968, 1972; Schmidly and Bradley 2016; Romer 1997; Peterson 1988; Nagorsen 2002), as well as various online virtual osteological databases (Idaho Virtual Museum 2020; The University of Michigan Museum of Zooarchaeology n.d.; The University of North Texas Digital Library 2011a, 2011b, 2011c, 2011d, 2011e, 2011f). Taxonomic classification follows Sisson et al. (1975), Hillson (1996), and Adams and Crabtree (2012) for mammals, Olsen (1968) for reptiles and amphibians, Peterson (1988) for birds, and Page and Burr (1991) for fish. All identification and analysis were conducted by James O. Ramsey, M.A., under the supervision of Dr. Jodi Jacobson. All bone was identified to the most specific taxonomic level possible. When diagnostic characteristics were not as variable, for example presence of a character which had been noted as defining only 65 percent of the time in a species, identifications to species were listed as “compares favorably” or “c.f.” For example, in the case above a species determination would have been listed as c.f. Odocoileus virginianus. In addition, given the location and temporal association of the site, some identifications where characteristics to differentiate between them and a similar North American species were absent, taxonomic designation may have determined based on known and assumed distributions. Invertebrate remains were analyzed separately (see Chapter 11), although there were a few specimens that appeared in the faunal assemblage analyzed by CAS. Invertebrate remains were identified through use of limited material in the analysts’ private faunal collection and identification manuals and online resources such as Georgia Biodiversity Portal (2020), Elm Fork Natural Heritage Museum (2021), Parmalee and Bogan (1998), Cox McLain Environmental Consultants (2019), The University of North Texas Digital Library (2011a, 2011b, 2011c, 2011d, 2011e, 2011f), The University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (n.d.), NatureServe (2021), and Leal (2020). All invertebrates were identified to the most specific taxonomic level possible. Many marine bivalves were identified to the order; however, some were identified to genus and species. Like the bone, when characteristics precluded identifying to species the identification was listed as “compares favorably” or “c.f.”. Any animal bone not discernible to class based on fragmentation to a degree enough that the bone could be consistent with multiple classes and was indiscernible to a specific class was left at the greater level of phylum vertebrata. An example of this is thin fragments of cortical bone not equally consistent with bird, amphibian, or fish, so designation would be left at the broader but accurate level of vertebrata. As not all animal bones were identifiable beyond class, size categories were used to Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 270

differentiate the various bones for analytical purposes. Size categories by class or other taxonomic level are useful for understanding human subsistence strategies and prey choice preference (high biomass versus low biomass) within an environment. Size categories may also give an indication of an environment’s overall species richness (Lawton 1990). The size categories for mammals included large (e.g., bison, elk, black bear), medium-large (e.g., deer, pronghorn antelope), medium (e.g., coyote, dog, raccoon, bobcat), small-medium (e.g., opossum, beaver, skunk), small (e.g., rabbit, squirrel), very small mammal (e.g., wood rat, hispid cotton rat, vole), and microtine mammal (e.g. mouse, shrew). Size categories for birds included large (e.g., swan, great blue heron), medium-large (e.g., goose, turkey), medium (e.g., mallard duck, caracara, red-tailed hawk), small (e.g. dove, grackle, screech owl), and very small (e.g., golden-cheeked warbler, finch, bluebird). Size categories for reptiles included medium (e.g., rat snakes, river cooter, re-eared slider), small (e.g., racers, box turtle, musk turtle), and very small (e.g., gecko, earth snake). Artiodactyla bones not identifiable to species were subdivided into large (e.g., bison, cow, elk), medium-large (e.g., white-tailed deer, mule deer, pronghorn antelope) and medium or larger (any artiodactyl such as bison or deer of a size larger than a sheep or goat). Enough specimens were classifiable to the family Muridae (rats, mice, and voles), but not to species that subcategories of very small Muridae (e.g., cotton rats, wood rats, prairie vole) and microtine Muridae (e.g., plains harvest mouse, Texas mouse, northern pygmy mouse) were included. Bones not identifiable beyond the level of class and/or identifiable to order or family but with taxa within those that vary in size so can still benefit from additional information refining to animal body size to aid in differentiating possible taxa represented. For instance, within the order Carnivora there are many shared characteristics on bones which may make differentiation to more specific taxa difficult with fragmentary bone given shared characteristics, but where could have a wide range of animals within that order including taxa greater in size such as bear, mountain lion or wolf, or medium-sized taxa such as coyote or bobcat, small-medium fox, skunk, or raccoon, or small weasel or mink. The ability to differentiate whether a larger predator animal may have been present (mountain lion or wolf) versus a relatively smaller carnivore more typical for scavenging (raccoon or weasel) can provide interpretive value. In addition, while positive identification to a specific size of taxa, for example small mammal, may not always be possible with fragmentary bone due to inter and intra- species variation, changes in body size through development and aging, shifts in animal taxa sizes over time with different climatic variables, hybridization, and sexual dimorphism of any given taxa, broader grouping ranges, e.g., small/small-medium and medium-large/large, medium or larger, can still provide interpretive value on human subsistence strategies and whether relying primarily on overall larger taxa (sheep/goat size and larger) or if more dependence needed to be placed on smaller taxa such as rabbits, squirrels, etc. For example, a juvenile bison's long bone diaphysis can be comparable size-wise to a large adult deer and, without epiphyseal evidence, cannot be separated further from fragmentary samples. While broad, it provides information on the environment, tool adaptations, and subsistence strategies that may have been needed based on what was available when hunting (Jacobson 2023; Outram 1998, 1999, 2001). In addition to taxonomic and elemental identifications, data including the portion of element present; degree of fusion; age or sex of animal indicators; cultural modifications to the bone (cuts, Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 271

chops, saw marks, tool modification or use) (Greenfield 2006); any thermal alteration evidence and degree of burning; evidence of animal modification such as rodent or carnivore gnawing or breakage (Haynes 1983; Sala and Arsuaga 2016); taphonomic modifications from root etching, abrasion, and degree of weathering; types of bone fragmentation such as spiral or dry breaks; and any pathologies (e.g., healed breaks, arthritic lipping, pitting and reabsorption of bone) were all recorded during analysis. Summaries of material recovered from the site as a whole and discussions regarding environment and subsistence strategies, taphonomy, cultural bone modifications, and interpretations are discussed in the following sections, along with a discussion of the same topics divided by cultural context. The presentation of vertebrate and invertebrate taxa for both sites follows Schmidly and Bradley (2016) for mammals, Stebbins (2003) for reptiles and amphibians, Peterson (1988) for birds, Page and Burr (1991) for fish, and The University of North Texas Digital Library (2011a, 2011b, 2011c, 2011d, 2011e, 2011f) for invertebrates for taxonomic designations and ordering of animals. 41DN580 Overview The total vertebrate number of identified specimens (NISP) in the 41DN580 assemblage analyzed was 498 of which 259 (52.0%) were identifiable to Class, though an additional 1 bone (0.2% of the assemblage could be narrowed to one of two classes (Mammal/Aves). Those specimens are included in the “Vertebrata” section in Table 10.1. The dominant class of vertebrate represented in the assemblages was mammal accounting for 76.8% (n=199) of the bones identifiable to Class. Reptile, with 60 bones (23.2%) identifiable to class, accounted for the second most prevalent class of remains present. No bones could be conclusively identified as fish (Osteichthyes) or bird (Aves). The total invertebrate NISP in the assemblage analyzed was 15, of which only one specimen was identifiable to Class. The majority of the invertebrate specimens (n=14; 93.3%) were only identifiable as Mollusca (indeterminate mollusk) and 1 specimen (6.7%) was identifiable as Unionidae (freshwater mussel). A detailed account of taxa identified and the NISP and minimum number of individuals (MNI) for each taxon are listed in Table 10.1. In addition, a breakdown by Class for occurrence based on NISP is presented in Figure 10.1. The minimum number of individuals (MNI) for each taxon was calculated and are presented in Tables 10.1 and 10.2. All identifiable taxa had MNIs of one. While mussel shells and other invertebrate remains have a high presence at the site, only 15 total shell fragments were submitted to and identified by CAS. The results of invertebrate analysis are presented in Chapter 11. Therefore, analysis within this report is focused on vertebrate fauna only and any discussion of use and interpretation of mussel presence, or measures of aquatic versus terrestrial habitats is limited.

Figure 10.4. A representative sample of smaller mammals: Carnivora/didelphimorphia premolar (left) and small- medium mammal femur exhibiting carnivore gnawing and digestive indicators (right) at 41DN580. Reptilia There was a total of 60 reptile bones identified in the sample assemblage from 41DN580. Turtles were the only identifiable reptile species. Small/Medium turtles (e.g., Map Turtle, Soft Shell Turtle, Sliders) accounted for one bone (1.7% of the reptile assemblage). Small turtles (e.g., box turtle, mud/musk turtles) accounted for 59 bones (98.3% of the reptile assemblage). Vertebrate There was a total of 238 indeterminate vertebrate bones identified from 41DN580 (47.8% of the vertebrate sample assemblage). In addition, 1 bone (0.4% of the vertebrate sample assemblage) was identified as Aves/Mammalia (i.e., small bird or rabbit). Breakage and Completeness Bone is a unique material in that it contains two major components: an inorganic component (primarily hydroxyapatite) that contributes to its rigidity and an organic component (primarily Type I collagen) that permits some degree of elasticity. After an organism’s death, the organic component gradually decomposes, ultimately changing the biomechanical properties of the bone. Consequently, the form of bone fractures in “fresh” bone (i.e., that with higher amounts of collagen) often appear very different from fractures to more “dry” bone (i.e., where the majority of collagen has decomposed) (Lyman 1994). In addition to distinguishing between fresh and dry breaks, fresh fracture types can be further divided into spiral and other green breaks (e.g., oblique fractures). Spiral fractures are often the result of percussion impacts and are generally considered to be indicative of intentional cultural breakage. Other green breaks may be produced by alternative taphonomic agents, such as carnivore gnawing. Carnivore gnawing can occasionally produce spiral Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 276

fractures, but these spirals are typically distinguishable from human modification because they are overlain by splintering, jagged edges, or gnaw marks (Haynes 1983). In addition, not all green breaks are naturally produced. Some processing, such as cracking open the rib cage while field dressing an animal can result in splintering or peeling breaks along ribs that would be characterized as green breaks. When possible, notations on green breaks that may have been cultural are noted in the inventory. For this analysis, break types were recorded as spiral, green, dry, indeterminate, or unbroken. Indeterminate break types include those with fracture characteristics that were obscured by other taphonomic processes, such as abrasion, burning, and weathering. A total of 492 bones (98.8% of the vertebrate assemblage) from 41DN580 exhibited a break (Table 10.3). Spiral breaks were identified on an artiodactyl (Artiodactyla) long bone, a bird/mammal (Aves/Mammalia) long bone, medium/medium-large mammal long bones (n=8), and small- medium/medium mammal long bones (n=2). Green breaks were identified on a c.f. mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) metacarpal, an artiodactyl (Artiodactyla) metatarsal, medium/medium-large mammal bones (n=9), small-medium/medium mammal bones (n=7), and a small/small-medium mammal bone. Whole elements include a white-tailed deer (O. virginianus) middle phalanx, deer (Odocoileus sp.) premolars (n=3), and a raccoon/skunk/opossum (Carnivora/Didelphimorphia) premolar. In addition, the unfused head of a small-medium mammal femur was identified with no breaks present. All bones exhibiting spiral and green breaks were recovered from units associated with Features 14/the Late Prehistoric site component. Of the 498 vertebrate bone fragments analyzed from 41DN580, 484 bones (97.2%) were less than 3 cm in size with 291 (58.4%) actually less than 1 cm in size (Table 10.4). Only 6 bones (1.2%) were unbroken. Table 10.3. Breakage identified on bone from 41DN580.

Smaller taxa would have smaller bones and a lower size category may not indicate higher fragmentation. Whenever possible, bones were assessed for completeness from 0 to 6 (0=<5%; 1=5-20%; 2=20-40%; 3=40-60%; 4=60-85%; 5= >85%; 6=100%).

and therefore the original size of the bone could not be determined. Of the bone able to be assigned to degree of completeness (n=159), 134 bones (84.3%) were less than 5% complete. Of the remaining bone, 20 bones (12.6%) were 5-to-85 percent complete, and 5 bones (3.1%) were whole and unbroken. The 5 mammal bones assigned a degree of completeness of 6 include a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus sp.) middle phalanx, deer (O. sp.) premolars (n=3), and a raccoon/skunk/opossum (Carnivora/ Didelphimorphia) premolar.

Overall, both smaller and larger taxa exhibit similarly low rates of completeness suggesting that the high amount of breakage was primarily due to natural taphonomic reasons rather than intentional human modification. Thermal Modification Of the 262 bones that had been thermally modified (52.6% of bone recovered from the site), 120 bones (45.8%) had been fully calcined, 59 bones (22.5%) exhibited gray discoloration, 55 bones (21.0%) exhibited blackening, and 28 bones (10.7%) exhibited brown discoloration (Table 10.6).

Brown discoloration indicates short-term and lower heat burning, such as exposure to a grass fire or campfire for less than six minutes (Lyman 1994). Blackened bone has been carbonized and would indicate prolonged exposure to a grass fire or campfire. Grey and white bone has been fully calcined which means that it has lost all organic matter and become plastically deformed. Combined, gray and calcined bone make up 68.3% (n=179) of thermally altered bone. These bones’ prolonged exposure to heat could be due to a couple of different mechanisms of burning, including the disposal of food waste and fuel for anthropogenic fires, among others (Lyman 1994). A large amount of the calcined, gray, and blackened mammal bone was from medium or larger sized mammals (n=28, 51.9.0%) (Table 10.7). Of the calcined, gray, and blackened mammal bone (n=54), 7 bones (13.0%) exhibited a fresh break of some type. The large amount and frequency of thermal modification present on medium and larger mammal bones combined with the high rates of comminution suggest that intensive bone processing was occurring. Typically, burning and comminution are linked with processing for bone grease extraction and disposal of fragments either within the fire or with ember remains of the fire (Jacobson in press), but the high degree and frequency of calcination requires a more intensive examination as it is not as consistent with that interpretation. The skeletal frequency analysis of burn bone and which elements and taxa were identifiable is also not as typical of a bone grease processing cause. All of the burned bone (n=262, 100% of the burned vertebrate bone) was recovered from units associated with Feature 14, the Late Prehistoric site component. Burned turtle shell fragments are present within the site (Tables 10.8-10.9; Figure 10.5). The high amount of burned turtle shell (n=40, 66.7% of the turtle assemblage from 41DN580) suggests that their remains are primarily the result of food consumption or a byproduct during food preparation (roasting). For thermally modified turtle carapace fragments, the majority of specimens were calcined or gray. The opposite is true for thermally modified turtle plastrons where most specimens were discolored black or brown. Since a relatively large amount of turtle carapace fragments were unburned, it is also possible that they were used as tools (bowl or ladle) for cooking, or for creating rattles, or other cultural use in addition to being consumed. In addition, one turtle carapace specimen was recorded as exhibiting black discoloration on the exterior and brown discoloration on the interior. The rest of burned turtle shell fragments were consistent colors on both sides of the specimen. Given the degree of alteration for the carapace and plastron, one interpretation would be that the “bowl” of the turtle was placed directly in the fire and subjected to direct heat for whole turtle roasting or as an expedient container for cooking and the plastron as a “lid” or top that was exposed to high enough indirect heat and smoke for charring in most cases, though enough heat for calcination in others.

Figure 10.5. Thermally altered testudines carapace from 41DN580 (Lot 178, Unit 45, Level 1), exhibiting roasting. Bones were categorized by degree of completeness and level of burning (Table 10.10). Overall, as the level of burning increases, the degree of completeness decreases. This suggests that thermal modification may have been a factor behind the high amount of fragmentation recorded at the site. Table 10.10. Degree of completeness by level of burning, 41DN580. Calcined and Gray Black and Brown Unburned Completeness NISP %NISP NISP %NISP NISP %NISP 0 36 94.7% 28 93.3% 70 76.9% 1 2 5.3% 12 13.2% 2 2 6.7% 2 2.2% 3 2 2.2% 4 5 6 5 5.5% Total 38 30 91 The same pattern of completeness decreasing in relation to increased thermal modification was observed when bones were categorized by level of burning and size range (Table 10.11). This further supports that thermal modification was the primary factor behind the high amount of fragmentation at the site. Both forensic and experimental archeological studies have indicated that burned bones are more fragile or brittle than unburned bones and in forensic studies the longer the delay for retrieval of burned bone the greater the fragmentation (Steiner et al. 1995; Waterhouse 2013), further supporting the extensive burning as the cause for high degree of comminution.

Cut marks were identified on a deer (Odocoileus sp.) metapodial on the caudal surface of the condyles. Cut marks in this area are suggestive of skinning the hide during the initial processing of the carcass. Cut marks were also identified on an American beaver (Castor canadensis) femur on the lateral side of the major trochanter and along the diaphysis. Several cut marks were also identified on a small/small-medium mammal long bone. The same beaver femur also exhibited several chop marks on the minor trochanter. The cut marks on the major trochanter and chop marks on the minor trochanter are likely associated with severing the iliofemoral ligament connecting the femur to the pelvis to disarticulate the femur. The cut marks along the diaphysis are likely the result of removing the meat from the bone. A single percussion mark was identified on an artiodactyl long bone. Percussion marks are created when a fresh bone is struck with a stone or other heavy object and is typically done to break open the bone to access the medullary cavity for marrow, to break bone down the bone in preparation for rendering bone grease, or during processing to crush joints and separate carcass portions. A higher degree of percussion impacts would be anticipated if bone processing for marrow or bone grease were occurring at the site. The overall low frequency of butchering marks could be a result of the high comminution and thermal alteration of the bone. Identification is more difficult on smaller fragments and cut marks would create weak points where bones are more likely to fracture while being heated or, if broken, obscuring the cuts. All bone exhibiting butchering modification were recorded from Units 41 and 67, which are adjacent to one another and associated with the Late Prehistoric site component. All burned bone was also recovered from this component. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 282

Modification NISP Cut 3 Chop 1 Percussion Marks 1 Weathering Degree of weathering was recorded following Lyman’s (1994) synthesis of Behrensmeyer (1978), Andrews (1990), and Johnson (1985). The scale rankings weathering from 0 to 5, where 0 represents a bone with some flesh still attached and 5 would be a disintegrating bone with large splinters. Typically, all archeological material would be minimally assigned a 2 or 3 ranking. Usually, bone assigned a ranking of 5 was exposed to sun and the elements for a prolonged time prior to burial, whereas bones with a ranking of 2 or 3 would have been buried at or shortly after discard. Weathering on bone from 41DN580 is summarized in Figure 10.7. The highest-ranking weathering stage was stage 3 which included 42.8% (n=213) of the bones. Eleven bones (2.2%) were assigned a weathering stage of less than 3 and 274 bones (55.0%) were assigned a weathering stage of greater than 3.

To further assess the relationship between weathering and fragmentation, bones were divided by weathering stage and standardized by fragment size (Figure 10.8).

All completeness categories exhibited average weathering scores of between 3 and 3-4 except completeness category 6 which had an average weathering score of between 3-4 and 4. In general, the more complete a bone was, the higher its weathering stage was, which is the inverse of what would be expected where bone grease processing was occurring. As boiling of bone removes the grease during grease rendering, boiled bone tends to have a higher weathering stage than bones deposited at the same time that were not boiled (Jacobson 2023; Roberts et al. 2002). Weathering weakens bone, making it more susceptible to post-deposition fragmentation, and is therefore used to estimate the length of time bone was exposed on the surface prior to deposition.

completeness and weathering at 41DN580 suggests that the factor responsible for the high rate of fragmentation may have also decreased the rate of weathering. To further refine the relationship between weathering and fragmentation, medium-large or larger mammal bones were divided by weathering stage and standardized by completeness (Figure 10.10). Though constituting a smaller sample size, the medium-large or larger mammal remains reflect a similar pattern of average weathering scores with average weathering stage increasing (more weathered) with higher completeness and decreasing (less weathered) with lower completeness. 80.0% 70.0% 60.0% 50.0% P 2-3 S IN 40.0% % 3 30.0% 3-4 20.0% 4 10.0% 0.0% 0 1 2 3 6 Completeness Figure 10.9.

its average weathering score is between 3-4 and 4. Overall, as thermal modification increases, weathering decreases. This pattern of weathering is consistent with expectations for thermally modified bone since the crystalline structure of carbonized or calcined bone has already been altered and partially mineralized; weathering affects the same crystalline structure and is therefore limited by the change that has already occurred (Steiner et al. 1995). Burned bone tends to survive better than unburnt or only slightly thermally modified bone (Mays 1998). Boiling, however, causes accelerated deterioration of bone (Roberts et al. 2002). These results support burning as a primary cause of the high amount of fragmentation. Further, results suggest that site occupants were not boiling significant amounts of bone as would be expected if bones were being processed for bone grease. 100.0% 80.0% P 60.0% S IN % 40.0% 20.0% 0.0% 2 2-3 3 3-4 4 4-5 5 Weathering Stage Calcined and Gray Black and Brown Unburned Figure 10.11. Standardized weathering scores by degree of thermal modification for 41DN580 bone. Carnivore and Rodent Modification Potential signs of carnivore modification include gnaw marks and scoring/pitting, puncture marks from the canines, scrapes from incisors, and the polish, striations, and angled but abraded edges consistent with scatological or other digestive erosion. Carnivore modifications differ from rodent modifications in the size of the gnaw marks, scoring, punctures, whereas rodent modifications are often smaller and narrow, occur sporadically, and often in sets of two (see Figure 10.12). Gnaw marks resemble cut marks but are often shallower and narrower, rounded out, and sometimes have an initial indention from incisors where the mark began (Haynes 1983). Carnivore modification was identified on 110 bones (22.1% of the vertebrate assemblage) from 41DN580 (Tables 10.13-10.14). No elements were identified exhibiting rodent modification. The proportion of bone recovered from 41DN580 exhibiting carnivore modification (22.1% of the vertebrate assemblage) is relatively consistent with other sites that have been argued to contain evidence of domesticated dogs. Morey and Klippel (1991) documented a high degree of carnivore modified deer bone at a site in East Tennessee, the Hayes Site (40ML139), a Middle Archaic Shell Midden site with a presence of dog burials. Greater than 25 percent of the deer bone at the site had evidence of carnivore modification. At the Jayroe Site (41HM51) in Hamilton County, Texas, over 26% of the bone had evidence for carnivore modification (Jacobson et al. 2019).

The majority of bone exhibiting carnivore modification (n=93, 84.5%) was recovered from the concentration of units associated with Feature 14/the Late Prehistoric component. Additionally, although not recorded as a feature during the excavation, 16 bones (14.5%) were recovered from three adjacent units from a block of 12 units in the central portion of Block F. One bone (0.9%) was recovered from Unit 85 which is located between Blocks E and F and dates to the Late Prehistoric period. Although the entire extent of the site is not known, and only a small section was excavated within the Hickory Creek Interceptor easement, the large amount of bone with carnivore modification recovered from the Late Prehistoric component (n=93, 84.5%) indicates carnivores were able to easily access the site. This could indicate that the carnivore modification was the result of human-canid interaction and potential provisioning of domesticated dogs (Jacobson and Ramsey 2022). Moreover, since 14.5% of the carnivore modified bone was recovered from a concentration of units in Block F not associated with any features, this could suggest that carnivore scavenging also occurred. Further refining site use and spatial distribution of human activities would be required to determine what proportions of the site the carnivore modified bones are associated with and whether Block F represents the periphery of the site or an arbitrary boundary.

For most features, carnivore modification was concentrated within 2-to-3 adjacent levels. This may indicate that the site was continually occupied, or if it was seasonally occupied it was revisited with only short intervals between absences. The Late Prehistoric component/Feature 14 is notable in that carnivore modification is dispersed across four levels. This may indicate that this site component was occupied or reutilized for much longer than other portions of the site, or that different depositional or taphonomic processes affected this component. To determine if carnivore modification may be a factor in the high rate of fragmentation observed in the assemblage, carnivore modified bones were divided by size category (Figure 10.13). Most bones belonging to smaller size categories exhibited no carnivore modification. This suggests that carnivore modification was not a significant factor in the high rates of fragmentation at the site. Table 10.16. Percent of carnivore modified bone by level.

Environment When possible, taxa were classified by habitat use (Figure 10.14). Only 5 specimens were able to be assigned to specific habitats. Recorded habitats include woodlands/riparian, scrub brush, and aquatic. Woodland/riparian species identified in the faunal assemblage include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus, n=1). Scrub brush species identified in the assemblage include c.f. mule deer (O. hemionus, n=1). Aquatic species identified in the assemblage include American beaver (Castor canadensis, n=2), box turtle (Terrapene sp., n=3), indeterminate turtle (Testudines, n=57), and freshwater mussel (Unionidae, n=1). Although the geographic range of western box turtle (T. ornata), a non- aquatic turtle, overlaps the site, all turtle remains were assumed to be aquatic given the higher prevalence of aquatic turtle species present in the area. The mussel shells identified in the field during excavation of the site were not included in the present analysis. Since mussel shells were recorded as making up 93% of all cultural material, aquatic habitats would be the most highly represented (Boudreaux et al. 2022a). Given the inability to identify much of the assemblage to species given the comminution of bone, it is likely terrestrial species are under-represented and the percent would be slightly higher if the mammal bone identifiable to size of taxa alone was identifiable further. 70 60 50 40 P S IN 30 20 10 0 Woodland/Riparian Scrub Brush Aquatic Figure 10.14. Breakdown of bone NISP by species habitat use. Seasonality Although the seasonal use of a site can often be reconstructed based on a variety of indicators including seasons of death, the presence of hibernating or migrating species, or elements with seasonal growth patterns (i.e., fish otoliths, mussel shell, some teeth), the only indicator identified in the 41DN580 assemblage was the presence of hibernating species. All of the identified reptile specimens were turtle (n=60, 12.0% of the vertebrate assemblage), which hibernate at temperatures below 38-45 degrees Fahrenheit (Roots 2006), which indicates the site was used during warmer seasons (see Figure 10.5). In Denton County, modern averages indicate that the temperature does not drop below 45 degrees Fahrenheit from mid-March to mid-November (Weather Spark 2022) which suggests a spring, summer, and/or fall occupation of the site. Furthermore, as many amphibians and aquatic reptiles will estivate during times of drought, typically their presence suggests wetter season and absence would Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 290

indicate dryer conditions. Although the turtle remains suggest occupation during warmer seasons, their presence does not exclude a possible winter occupation of the site as well. Features Two features at 41DN580 yielded vertebrate faunal material: Features 14 and 18. In addition, three contiguous units from Trench F (Units 74, 75, and 80) also yielded faunal bone material. Feature 14/Late Prehistoric Component Nearly all bone from 41DN580 was recovered from the Late Prehistoric site component/ Feature 14 (n=459, 92.2% of the vertebrate assemblage) (Table 10.17). In addition, 10 invertebrate remains from Feature 14 were analyzed by CAS. Only one specimen was identifiable as Unionidae (freshwater mussel shell); the remainder are indeterminate. The analysis of invertebrate remains is in Chapter 11. Most of the bone recovered from Feature 14 was less than 3 cm in size (Table 10.18).

Of the burned bone, 147 are calcined or gray (57.6%), 63 bones are black or brown (24.7%), and 155 (41.5%) are unburned. To determine whether burning may be responsible for the high degree of fragmentation of the feature as suggested for the site as a whole, bone counts from units identified with Feature 14 were divided by degree of thermal alteration and standardized by size category (Figure 10.15). As fragment size increases the degree of thermal alteration decreases. This supports the interpretation that the high degree of fragmentation observed in the feature was caused by thermal modification. 100.00% 80.00% P 60.00% Calcined or Gray S IN Black or Brown % 40.00% Unburned 20.00% 0.00% <1 cm 1-3 cm 3-6 cm 6-9 cm Figure 10.15.

These bones include cut marks identified on a deer (Odocoileus sp.) metapodial, cut and chop marks on an American beaver (Castor canadensis) femur, and percussion marks on an Artiodactyl long bone. The cut and chop marks on the beaver femur are likely associated with primary disarticulation of the carcass while the cut marks along the deer metapodial diaphysis are likely the result of removing the meat from the bone during secondary processing/consumption. Percussion marks are typically associated with secondary processing activities such as breaking open the bone to Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 292

access the medullary cavity for marrow or breaking bone down the bone in preparation for rendering bone grease. As previously discussed, a higher degree of percussion impacts would be anticipated if bone processing for marrow or bone grease were occurring at the site. The overall low frequency of butchering marks could be a result of the high comminution and thermal alteration of the bone. Identification is more difficult on smaller fragments and cut marks would create weak points where bones would be more likely to fracture while being heated or if broken, obscuring the cuts. Of the carnivore modified bone, 93 bones (84.5%) were recovered from the Late Prehistoric component (Table 10.20). It is possible that the carnivore modified bone represents consumption by domesticated dogs rather than wild carnivore scavenging; however, since the site appears to have been occupied for a relatively short period of time, the carnivore modification could also represent scavenging by wild predators after the site was abandoned. When examining the frequency of carnivore modified bones from each level of Feature 14, 14.8% of the bone from Level 3 exhibited carnivore modification, 18.6% from Level 4, 18.8% from Level 5, and 25% from Level 6. This may indicate that the Feature 14 area/Late Prehistoric component was occupied or reutilized over a long period of time. Table 10.20. Carnivore modified bone from Feature 14, 41DN580. NISP Percent of Total Percent of Total Carnivore Modified Feature (n=459) Modified Bone (n=110) 93 20.3% 84.5% Given that this component contains the fresh broken bone, most of the burned bone (97.4%), and all the bones exhibiting butchering modification from 41DN580, this component likely represented a discard area, whether initial use or re-purposed use, in which remains of secondary butchering and consumption were being discarded. Feature 18 Only five bones were recovered from Feature 18, all of which were identified as medium-or- larger mammal bones. All bone was less than 3 cm in size (Table 10.21). No bones exhibiting butchering modification were recovered from Feature 18. All bone fractures were classified as dry breaks. Only one was recovered from Feature 18 exhibiting blackened thermal modification. No carnivore modified bone was recovered from this feature. Table 10.21.

A total of 20 bones (4.0% of the vertebrate assemblage) were recovered from the Block F concentration (Table 10.22). All are less than 3 cm in size and were classified as dry or indeterminate breaks (Table 10.23). There is no evidence for culturally modified bone, none of the bone recovered from the Block F concentration exhibited butchering marks of any kind or thermal modification. Sixteen bones (14.5%) exhibiting carnivore modification were recovered from the Block F concentration (Table 10.24). Since the Block F concentration appears to be located at the northern periphery of the site carnivore modification could be due to wild carnivore scavenging. Table 10.22.

All vertebrate remains represented in the assemblages identifiable to Class were identified as mammals. No bones could be conclusively identified as reptiles (Reptilia), fish (Osteichthyes), or bird (Aves). In addition, no specimens could be identified as invertebrates (i.e., mussels, snails, mollusks, etc.).

Figure 10.16. A representative sample of mammal bones from 41DN624; medium or large mammal from Lot 145, Unit 13, Level 3. Breakage and Completeness All 197 bones (100%) from 41DN624 exhibited breakage (Table 10.27). A spiral break was identified on a small-medium/medium mammal long bone. A green break was identified on a medium/medium-large mammal long bone. One deer (Odocoileus sp.) calcaneus identified in the assemblage was composed of two rejoining fragments that had a dry break. So, although technically a whole bone, this calcaneus was coded as a dry break and as a 6 for degree of completeness. The bones exhibiting a spiral and green break were both recovered from units associated with Feature 9. Table 10.27. Breakage identified on bone from 41DN624.

To better assess the issue of cultural versus natural breakage, degree of completeness was assessed based on taxa size (Table 10.29). Of the bone able to be assigned to degree of completeness (n=70), 68 bones (97.1%) were less than 5% complete. Of the remaining bone, 1 bone (1.4%) was 85-to- 100 percent complete and 1 bone (1.4%) was whole. Of note, the only whole bone identified in the 41DN624 assemblage was a deer (Odocoileus sp.) calcaneus which was actually two rejoining fragments with a dry break. The one bone assigned a degree of completeness of 5 was a deer central and 4th tarsal that exhibited slight fragmentation along the caudal surface. Given that the smaller taxa exhibit similarly low levels of completeness as larger taxa, the fragmentation of the site is likely primarily the result of natural taphonomic factors rather than intentional human modification. Table 10.29. Completeness of identifiable elements from 41DN624 by Class, size, and degree of completeness. Completeness Class Size 0 5 6 Mammalia medium-large 1 1 medium/medium-large 66 small-medium/medium 2 Grand Total 68 1 1 Thermal Modification Only seven bones (3.6%) recovered from 41DN624 had been thermally modified (Tables 10.30- 10.31). Of these, five bones (71.4%) had been fully calcined and two bones (28.6%) exhibited gray discoloration. No bones exhibited black or brown thermal discoloration. Of the thermally modified bones, only one bone also exhibited a fresh break. Of note is that 5 of the burned bone were recovered from Levels 1 and 1-2 from Feature 9. Feature 9 is described as a 1 x 1 m circular burned rock concentration surrounded by a diffuse burned rock scatter extending outward another meter around the main concentration. The remaining 2 burned bones were recovered from Levels 1 and 2 from Units 49 and 45, respectively, which are also closely associated with Features 10 and 11. Features 10 and 11 were identified as loose concentrations of burned rock with a notable quantity of burned bone and mussel shell. In addition, most of the lithic material (91%) recovered from the site was associated with Features 10 and 11. Table 10.30. Degree of thermal alteration of bone recovered from 41DN624.

Although this may be due to the small sample size or the overall function of the site, the 41DN624 faunal assemblage was heavily affected by carnivore modification which may have obscured any surface modification that may have originally been present. Weathering Weathering recorded on bone recovered from 41DN624 is summarized in Figure 10.17. The majority (n=156, 79.2%) of the vertebrate bone was assigned a weathering stage of 4-to-5. Of the remaining bone, 36 specimens (18.3%) were assigned a stage of less than 3-to-4 and 5 specimens (2.5%) were assigned a stage of greater than 4-to-5. This pattern of weathering is much higher than a typical archeological assemblage and suggests that the bone recovered from 41DN624 had been allowed to weather for significantly more time before final deposition. 160 140 120 100 P S 80 IN 60 40 20 0 3 3-4 4-5 5 Weathering Stage Figure 10.17.

domesticated dog. While archaeological evidence for domesticated dog in Texas is sparse, there are ethnographic (Hammond and Agapito 1940; Swanton 1942; Winship 1896), aDNA (Tito et al. 2011), and rock art evidence for domesticated dog in Texas dated to as early as 9,200 calBP at Hinds Cave in Val Verde County, Texas (Tito et al. 2011). Morey and Klippel (1991) documented a high degree of carnivore modified deer bone at a site in East Tennessee, the Hayes Site (40ML139), a Middle Archaic Shell Midden site with a presence of dog burials. Greater than 25% of the deer bone at the site had evidence of carnivore modification. In addition, they conducted actualistic studies feeding deer bone to a large domestic dog. They both picked up abandoned remains and retrieved bone from scat. They also found that the dog was able to efficiently fully consume softer spongy bone such as the pelves and the epiphyses of long bones, but shafts were frequently left behind. While not fed vertebrae, the vertebrae of deer and bison is similar in texture as the pelvis and as a bone with minimal bone grease return may have been discarded once meat had been successfully removed. The high degree of carnivore modification at other sites in Texas in conjunction with canid bone indicating an integrated use has been used to strongly suggest the presence of domesticated dogs. At the Jayroe Site (41HM51) in Hamilton County, Texas, over 26% of the bone had evidence for carnivore modification. In addition, there was a modified bone tool, which had canid gnaw marks on it, overlain by charring of the bone suggesting a cultural use, canid modification, cultural use sequence of events (Jacobson 2023; Jacobson et al. 2019). That finding was boosted by a Canid metapodial bone larger than a coyote but smaller than standard wolf and in keeping with known domesticated dog breeds utilized by Native Americans at contact. Similar findings of highly canid gnawed bone from within feature context at Smith Rockshelter (41TV42) in McKinney Falls inspired additional aDNA investigations, yet bone tested was either not adequate for results or inconclusive given close relationship and many shared DNA markers between coyote and domesticated dog (Jacobson and Ramsey 2022). Given the high degree of carnivore modification associated with this site, especially in Feature contexts, similar to suspected and/or confirmed domesticated dog presence elsewhere in Texas, considerations for whether material was scavenged by wild canids coming in after a short-term site was abandoned versus domesticated dog provisioning should be considered.

Features Thirteen features were identified at 41DN624, described in detail in Chapter 6. Faunal material was recovered from Features 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11. Feature 3 is a circular earth oven. Feature 4 is a loosely defined concentration of burned limestone rocks interpreted as a hearth remnant. Large amounts of mussel shell were identified in the units immediately surrounding Feature 4. Feature 5 is a small, isolated concentration of tabular burned sandstone. Feature 9 is a large FCR concentration with a scatter extending outward another meter around the main concentration. Features 10 and 11 were immediately adjacent to one another and are loose concentrations of burned rock with a notable quantity of bone, mussel shell, and lithic material (Boudreaux et al. 2022b). Given their proximity to one another, Features 10 and 11 may represent a single activity area and are therefore discussed as a single feature (Feature 10/11) in the faunal analysis. Species Frequency A total of 195 specimens (99.0% of the 41DN624 assemblage) were recovered from or were closely associated with features. All faunal material recovered from feature contexts exhibited a very low level of identifiability with only 3 specimens (1.5%) identifiable beyond taxonomic Class (Table 10.34). These remains include a deer (Odocoileus sp.) calcaneus and tarsal and an artiodactyl metapodial fragment, all of which were recovered from Feature 3. Table 10.34.

The high number of indeterminate breaks identified on specimens from Feature 10/11 is likely the result of the overall high amounts of weathering associated with this Feature. Fifty-seven specimens (98.3%) from Feature 10/11 exhibited a weathering stage between 4 and 5. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 302

Thermally modified bones were only identified from Features 9 and 10/11 (Tables 10.39-10.40). Although only 7 bones exhibited thermal modification, only calcining and gray discoloration was recorded. The high degree of burning suggests that these animal remains were likely disposed of in a fire after utilization and/or used as supplemental fuel for the fire. This may indicate that some of the remains were disposed of immediately after the cooking and consumption of meat. Although bones were often disposed of in fires after being processed for bone grease, the lack of spiral fractures and consistency of completeness across taxa of different sizes suggests that bone grease processing was not occurring, and the fragmentation of the faunal assemblage was mostly caused by natural taphonomic factors.

Conclusion and Comparison The assemblages from 41DN580 and 41DN624 both exhibited relatively low rates of intentional butchering and breakage. 41DN580 contained a relatively high amount of burned bone. The butchering modification recorded from 41DN580 is consistent with activities such as disarticulating, defleshing, but is very minimal. Very little of the bone recovered from 41DN624 exhibits intentional breakage or thermal modification and none exhibits evidence of butchering such as cut, chop, or percussion marks. Given the extremely high rates of carnivore modification present at site 41DN624, it is possible that much of the evidence for intentional modification was obscured or destroyed, or that some of the bone does not have actual cultural association. Although intentional modification recorded from 41DN624 is low, Feature 9 contains most of the thermally modified bone and all of the fresh broken bone recovered from the site. A small amount of thermally modified bone was also recovered from Feature 10/11. Given the lack of other modification and the overall small sample size, it is difficult to interpret the use of the features and whether the bones were being processed, disposed of, or used as a fuel source. Both sites exhibit high rates of carnivore modification; however, 41DN624 exhibits extremely high rates of carnivore modification, totaling 57.4% identified in Features 3, 9, and 10/11 at 41DN624. Furthermore, 96.6% (n=56) of the bone recovered from Feature 10/11 exhibited carnivore modification. Overall, 22.1% of the bone recovered from 41DN580 exhibited carnivore modification and was recorded in Feature 14 and the Block F concentration. Carnivore modified bone was recovered from across 41DN580 while at 41DN624 it was associated with features. It is possible that the carnivore activity represents provisioning domesticated dogs; however, since the site appears to have been utilized for a relatively short period of time and wild carnivores may have scavenged the site after it was abandoned, no definitive assessment of the presence of domesticated dogs can be made. The absence of dog bone at a short-duration occupation site does not limit their presence if they were living as companions and help-mates to humans, especially at a short-term occupation site. Since both sites’ assemblages contain large amounts of mussel shell, it is possible that the primary functions of these sites were processing and cooking mussel shells with animal remains serving as a caloric supplement. For 41DN624, since there is very little evidence of intentional human modification of animal remains, the human inhabitants of the site may have been processing and consuming a larger amount of mussels than terrestrial animals. For 41DN580, humans were likely consuming a much higher amount of animal remains although still collecting and processing a large amount of mussels as well.

11. I F A 41DN580 NVERTEBRATE AUNAL NALYSIS OF 41DN624 AND By Lori Phillips, with discussion by Victoria Ingalls and Rachel Feit This chapter presents a description of the freshwater shellfish remains recovered during the archeological excavation of sites 41DN580 and 41DN624. Identification includes taxonomy, element, side, natural modifications, and cultural modifications. Taxonomic identification to the genus or species level was attempted when possible, but the majority of the invertebrate assemblage could only be identified to Unionidae or unidentifiable mollusc (e.g., Figures 11.1-11.2). When diagnostic features were obscured or difficult to distinguish, specimens were identified as “c.f.” meaning they compared favorably to a species. If a specimen could not be determined beyond genus, they were identified as “spp.”. When preservation permitted, taxonomic identification was aided by a comparative collection on loan from the Environmental Department of Freese and Nichols and virtual databases such as the Mussels of Texas (2023). Data is presented using two quantitative units, NISP (number of identified specimens) and MNI (minimum number of individuals) (Lyman 2008). MNI was calculated by the presence of non-repetitive elements that were identified to the genus or species level, in this case the umbo and/or psuedocardinal teeth of the left or right valve. NISP includes both identified and unidentified specimens, i.e., unidentifiable molluscs and those identified to the Family or more specific level. Figure 11.1.

Figure 11.2. Mussel shell fragments with umbos, 41DL580 Unit 10 Level 2. Site 41DN580 A total of 2,851 invertebrate remains were analyzed from site 41DN580 (Table 11.1). The majority of the assemblage is composed of Unionidae, with Rabdotus and fossilized Exogyra comprising the remainder. The fossil Exogyra were not likely utilized by human inhabitants of the site, do not show signs of human modification, and likely represent natural deposition during bedrock formation so will not be discussed further. The Rabdotus specimens are all less than 5 cm in maximum length and do not show signs of cultural modifications or use. Over 90% of the assemblage could not be identified beyond Unionidae due to a high fragmentation rate and a lack of preserved identifiable features. Of the identifiable specimens, six genera were identified with Toxolasma texasiense (Texas lilliput) and Amblema plicata (Threeridge) the two most abundant bivalve species (Table 11.2; Figure 11.3). All identified species can be found in nearshore or main-channel environments with slow to moderate currents and are found in the area today, with one exception (Mussels of Texas 2023). Plectomerus dombeyanus (Bankclimber) is no longer found in modern streams in the area but has been documented in other north Texas archeological assemblages (Randklev and Wolverton 2011; Randklev et al. 2010).

Five of the six identified genera, all burned shell, and the majority of modified shell come from this feature as well. Conversely, 75% of all Toxolasma species from 41DN580 come from Feature 18, a Middle Archaic mussel deposit. These shells do not show any signs of modifications or thermal alterations and may represent a discrete consumption or discarding event focused on Texas lilliput. Temporal changes within the site cannot be investigated due to large differences in sample sizes across the site, with the Late Prehistoric component being overrepresented compared to the earlier Middle to Late Archaic deposits. In zooarchaeological assemblages, species richness increases with larger sample sizes (Lyman 2008), therefore the higher taxonomic richness of the Late Prehistoric component is more likely driven by the much larger sample size than any real change in subsistence strategy or environmental changes compared to the much smaller Middle Archaic assemblage.

Figure 11.4. Representative sample of thermally altered shell. Cultural modifications include cut edges and edge use-wear that may indicate shell usage as tools (Table 11.5). Edgewear was noted on Amblema plicata and one Toxolasma texasiense and found almost exclusively within Feature 14. Edgewear on these specimens are characterized by smoothed edges with vertical striations running ventral to dorsal. Many of these specimens also have small grooves along the margins as seen in Figure 11.5. While these specimens do not retain beveling similar to experimental and archeological shell scrapers (e.g., Dockall and Dockall 1996; Eyles 2004; Harris et al. 2015), it is possible a similar activity resulted in these striations and they may have functioned as expedient tools with a short use life. Additionally, two specimens had characteristics of cut and smoothed edges (Figure 11.5). No other modifications were noted on these specimens and their use is unknown. Table 11.5.

Figure 11.5. Examples of cultural modifications from 41DN580. Edgewear on Amblema plicata (left) and Unionidae with cut edges (right). Site 41DN624 A total of 1,102 invertebrate remains were analyzed from site 41DN624 (Table 11.6). Most of the assemblage is composed of Unionidae, with Rabdotus and fossilized Exogyra comprising the remainder. The fossil Exogyra were not likely utilized by human inhabitants of the site, do not show signs of human modification, and likely represent natural deposition during bedrock formation so will not be discussed further. The Rabdotus specimens are all less than 5 cm in maximum length and do not show signs of cultural modifications or use. Over 80% of the assemblage could not be identified beyond Unionidae due to a high fragmentation rate and a lack of preserved identifiable features. Of the identifiable specimens, four genera were identified with Toxolasma texasiense (Texas lilliput) and Amblema plicata (Threeridge) the two most abundant bivalve species (Table 11.7). All identified species can be found in nearshore or main-channel environments with slow to moderate currents and are found in the area today (Mussels of Texas 2023). When grouped by Feature (Table 11.8), distribution is slightly more even compared to site 41DN580, with roughly equal numbers of invertebrates coming from Features 8, 9, and 10. Three of the four identified genera are from Feature 8, and all thermally modified specimens are located in Features 8 and 9. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 312

Figure 11.6. Unionidae fragment with possible puncture in the lower left. Comparison The invertebrate assemblages from 41DN580 and 41DN624 are both highly fragmentary with low species identifiability. However, inhabitants of both sites were likely utilizing the same environments for freshwater shellfish procurement as indicated by the similarity in species documented at both sites. Amblema plicata, Lampsilis teres, and Toxolasma texasiense are present at both sites and are typically found within nearshore habitats with slow to moderate currents. Amblema plicata’s habitat ranges from the Lower Nueces River drainage to the Sabine and Red Rivers and can be found in a variety of aquatic habitats but most often within the banks and backwaters rivers with mud or sand substrates with still to moderate currents. Lampsilis teres have a wide distribution ranging from the Rio Grande to the Sabine and Red River drainages. Like Amblema, this species often inhabits streams or rivers with mud or sand substrates and slow to moderate currents. Lastly, Toxolasma texasiense has the same habitat range as Lampsilis and prefer the same slow to moderate currents of rivers (Mussels of Texas 2023). This also suggests these were important species through time being utilized in the Middle Archaic at 41DN624 and the Late Prehistoric at 41DN580. Thermal modifications are seen at both sites and likely indicate cooking and/or discard practices, though this is much more apparent at 41DN580 than 41DN624. Edgewear and cut shell pieces indicate some shell remains were utilized beyond subsistence and were possibly used as tools, such as scrapers. Freshwater Mussels Shell Tools and Their Implications Rachel Feit, Victoria Ingalls, and James Karbula At 41DN580, the Late Prehistoric component described as Feature 14 yielded over 40% of the site’s molluscan total assemblage (over 1100 specimens, both whole and fragmentary), with at least five common species represented: threeridge (Amblema plicata), Texas Fatmucket (Lampsilis spp.), Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 315

Bluefer (Potamilus purpuratus), Texas Lilliput (Toxolasma texasiense), and bankclimber (cf. Plectomerus dombeyanus). Several of the Feature 14 shells were burned suggesting mussels were collected and eaten in the camp. More significantly, there are 32 modified freshwater mussel shell specimens from this component. Modifications include scraping, polishing, cut edges, battering, and notching. These modified shells can be grouped in three primary categories: battered, cut and smoothed, and notched. Specimens with cut edges often have at least one other type of modification such as battering, polishing, nicking, and notching (Table 11.10). Most modifications are made on threeridge and bankclimber shells—in other words, the larger species. Of note is the absence of drill holes on any shells in the assemblage. Data from other sites show that small drill holes are most common on shell pendants and adornments, while larger holes occur on shells that were hafted and used as hammers, hoes, and adzes.

Battered shells were likely broken open expediently, initially for food but also to be used later, possibly as digging implements or as adzes. There are six examples of large shells with battering and heavy use wear (Figure 11.7). On these large, thick shells, battering is primarily along one edge and side, conforming to typical expectations for hoes or adzes. However, unlike presumed hoes/adzes known from other sites, the 41DN580 examples do not have a hole that would allow them to be hafted, nor are there other indications that these were hafted another way. Additionally, there is not the type of polish or retouching expected if these were being used as adzes in woodworking. Although speculative, one possibility is that these were opportunistic tools used to dig up plant bulbs and tubers that were likely growing along the creek and floodplain, then discarded after use. Two specimens (Figure 11.7b and 11.7e) are fragmentary and it is possible that these pieces represent tool-making debris as opposed to an intentional tool. In the case of the fragmentary example from Lot 202, a small nick and groove are evident across the dorsal face extending from a battered edge of the shell to its outer margin (Figure 11.7e). Figure 11.7. 41DN580 modified shell with battering. In the 41DN580 assemblage, there are 19 examples of cut shells. A common means for cutting shell was the groove and snap method, whereby a groove would be sawn into the shell using a sharp tool, then snapped to form a clean break (Kozuck 2007). Several specimens not only exhibit cuts made Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 317

in this manner, but also have other types of use wear along the outer shell margins (Figure 11.8a-c). All three examples in Figure 11.8 have at least one side with a smoothed, snapped edge, and another margin edge that is ground, nicked, or notched from use that might have included hide-scraping, smoothing or shaping wood implements, and/or polishing ceramics (Figures 11.9-11.10). The specimen labeled as Collection 4 (Figure 11.8c) may have been used as a spoon or a scoop, as it compares favorably to examples of scoops/spoons described on freshwater and marine shells along the Upper Mississippi Valley and along the Florida coast (Lamb 2011:11; Lyles 2004:126-132).

Of the cut shells, there are five shaped examples shown in Figure 11.11 that are distinct from the other modified shells in the assemblage. These five specimens show that cut edges were smoothed. However, none have the type of edge use-wear that would suggest they were used as tools. Comparable examples from the Harrell Site have been described as pendant blanks (Dial and Black 2002). However, no concrete evidence of pendant manufacture and use, such as shells with drilled holes or uniform notching, is present at 41DN580. Another thought is that the specimens with pointed tips (Figure 11.11a, b and e) were used as awls or gouges. Shell awls are commonly found at coastal sites on columellae and lightning whelk (Dockall and Dockall 1996l; Lyles 2004). The specimens in Figure 11.11 may be freshwater versions of this type of tool. One example from lot 172 has been battered and polished on the pointed end and nicked along the posterior margin. Notching is also present on four examples from 41DN580, although the size of these notches varies greatly (Figure 11.12) and present differences in grinding and polish. These range from 3-5 mm in size to more than a centimeter, and the larger of these also shows signs of significant wear and distinctive chop marks around the notch. Figure 11.11.

Figure 11.12. Modified shells with notching from 41DN580. The notched shells all have other modifications that include snapped edges, evidence of scraping or grinding, and likely represent a diversity of possible activities. Because of the variation in size and tasks these could represent, we hesitate to make a single interpretation of their use. For instance, the unprovenienced specimen labeled Collection 2 (Figure 11.12b) has been snapped, notched, smoothed, and polished. It also exhibits a groove along its dorsal beak suggestive of a tool still in the process of manufacture. Nonetheless, because of the comparability across sites with lithic tools, we suggest the tools with notches may have similar uses to ‘spokeshaves’, lithic tools used for cutting or scraping wood, edges of leather, sinew, or bone (Davis 1995). These typically have similar notches that exhibit various degrees of wear based on the material types they were used to process. Comparison with other Sites in Texas and Beyond The archeological record in North America and globally shows that people modified shells for both adornment and utilitarian tasks, especially in settings when other durable material resources such as lithic material were scarce (Cuenca-Solana et al. 2011; Schmidt et al. 2001). Shell tools can be made of marine or freshwater varieties, although in coastal environments marine shell is preferred because it is typically less susceptible to fragmentation. However, in parts of North America, freshwater shells are used as opportunistic tools, often for short or defined tasks because of their higher friability but ubiquity along perennial waterways (Cuenca-Solana et al. 2011; Dockall and Dockall 1996). It is well documented that Indigenous peoples across the Americas, particularly in coastal regioms, fashioned shells as personal adornments, including pendants, gorgets, earrings, hair ornaments, musical instruments, clothing accessories, and even engraved shell cups (Dockall and Dockall 1996; Dreiss 2024). Indigenous peoples also fashioned shells into tools. Shell tools were used for any number of tasks, including processing animals, plants, minerals and pigments, or as scoops, hoes, awls, net-weights, scrapers, adzes, polishers, or ceramic rib tools (e.g., Cuenca-Solana et al. 2011; Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 321

Lidour and Cuenca-Solana 2023). They were sturdy and easily worked, and since coastal regions where shell tools are most ubiquitous often lack good quality lithic raw materials, precontact peoples took full advantage of molluscan resources. Activities that required shell tools can often be identified through both macro- and microscopic use-wear analysis. Broadly, experimental studies show that, like lithic tools, micro-chipping flaking along edges and polish are typically seen when the tools were used repetitively on softer, organic materials, while irregular breakage, step fractures, grinding, and jagged splintering or delamination is caused by activities that require battering and heavy impacts. Worldwide, the most common use of shells is for scraping (Cuenca-Solana et al. 2011). This is typically evidenced by modification of one edge of a lateral margin on the inferior portion of the valve (Schmidt et al. 2001). Although scrapers can be hafted, they are most often hand-held tools. Similarly, hoes and adzes typically exhibit wear along one edge, although these wear marks are more dramatic and evidence the types of battering expected from heavy use. Additionally, hoes and adzes are often shaped and/or have drilled or pecked holes used for hafting and attachment to a handle/shaft (Dockall and Dockall 1996; Lamb 2011; Lidour and Cuenca-Solana 2023). In other regions of inland North America, shell ornaments and tools (both freshwater and imported marine shells) similar to the assemblage at 41DN580 are present at Mississippian period sites of the Midwest along major drainages. Examples have been found at sites in the Missouri, Mississippi, and Illinois River basins, for instance (Lamb 2011; McLeester 2019). In Texas, modified shells and shell tools occur most commonly in the coastal region (Figure 11.13), which exhibit the greatest variety of tool and adornment types on marine and freshwater mollusks (e.g., Black 1978; Ricklis 1995, 1996; Story 1968). Coastal sites with significant shell assemblages frequently include cemeteries (e.g., 41LK28, 41GV66, 41VT1). For example, the Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) on Galveston Island was a seasonal camp site and burial ground occupied from approximately 1300 BP until the mid-eighteenth century (Ricklis and Black 2009). None of the shell items at the site were identified as tools but as personal adorments. Similarly, Morhiss Mound (41VT1) has an Archaic period cemetery where archeologists recovered more than 3,300 shell artifacts (Dockall and Dockall 1996). Among these were over 200 tools that include whelk shell hammers and adzes, as well as assorted cutting and scraping tools manufactured from marine and freshwater bivalves (Dockall and Black 2007). Most relevant to this study are notched and unifacially retouched bivalve cutting tools similar to stone tool forms. The whelk shell hammers exhibit use wear in the form of battering and polish from use. Beveled shell axes exhibit wear and fracture patterns suggestive of hafted wood working tools, like chipped stone Guadalupe and Clear Fork tools (Dockall and Black 2007). Remarkably, similar shell implements are documented not just in Late Prehistoric contexts, but at numerous Archaic period coastal sites including those along Oso Creek, which empties into the Nueces Bay system near Corpus Christi. The morphology of these shell tools indicates the use of direct percussion and cutting to create usable segments for tools and ornaments. Cutting was accomplished by tabular sandstone abraders and the groove and snap technique was used to segment shell into pieces. Other coastal sites with a significant number of modified shells include the Kent-Crane Site (41AS2), Blue Bayou (41VT94), Buckeye Knoll (41VT98), Live Oak (41AS3), Crestmont (41WH39), Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 322

Ferguson (41FB32), Ernest Witte (41AU36), and 41NU114, among others (Dockall and Dockall 1996; Feit and Goldstein 2019; Ricklis and Black 2009). Outside the coastal plain of Texas, shell ornaments and adornments on marine shell are often found in mortuary contexts only on Caddo sites and Late Prehistoric period sites, suggesting that marine shells were traded long distances between Indigenous groups starting around AD 1000. A few examples include items found at the Eli Moores Site (41BW2) in Bowie County, the Womack (41LR1) and Sanders (41LR2) sites in Lamar County, Olmos Dam (41BX1), in Bexar County, and the AC Saunders site (41AN19) in Anderson County. Tools made on freshwater shells are significantly rarer as one moves inland from the coast. There are scattered examples of freshwater shell tools in inland portions of Texas, although many of these are one-off examples and are only briefly mentioned in reports. For instance, a small number of shell tools were documented at site 41LK67 in the Choke Canyon Reservoir area of deep south Texas. Authors reported five intentionally modified specimens with snapped and/or smoothed edges from a Late Prehistoric component, but there is no discussion of their use (Brown et al. 1982:94-95). Notched freshwater mussel shell specimens were also reported by Shafer at 41CK76 and 41CK70 along the upper Colorado River basin (discussed in Dockall and Dockall 1996). However, outside of mortuary contexts and coastal contexts, the use of shells as tools, particularly freshwater mussels, seems to be rare and is not well documented. To some extent, this may be a problem with identification and reporting. Modifications on freshwater mussel shells may not always be recognized, and when they are, good documentation and analysis is often lacking. To date, there has been no attempt to systematically study the types of modifications on freshwater mussel shells or map their occurrence outside the coastal plain in Texas. Within Texas, the best comparison for freshwater mussel shell tool use occurs at the Harrell site (41YN1) in north Texas on the Clear Fork of the Brazos River in Young County, west of the City of Denton and sites 41DN580 and 41DL624. The Harrell site has a long history of occupation from roughly 5000 BP through the Late Prehistoric, likely after AD 1200 (Dial and Black 2002; Krieger 1946). Similar to 41DN580, Harrell had significant and repeated Archaic period occupations represented by scattered hearths and burned rock features suggesting repeated but likely short-term use. Importantly, the Harrell site’s similarities with 41DN580 also extend into the Late Prehistoric period, with comparable artifact and ceramic assemblages (Dial and Black 2002; Krieger 1946). During the Late Prehistoric II period from roughly AD 1200-1500, early Plains Villager groups made farming implements from deer and bison bone, antler, and less frequently shell. While only a few partial bison scapula hoes are present at the Harrell site, there are 33 mussel shells with heavy use-wear and battering along their edges, suggesting they may have been used as digging implements instead (Dial and Black 2002; Krieger 1946). Several of these also have pecked holes indicating they were hafted. Dial and Black postulate that bone hoes are rare at the site due to the availability of large, thick mussel shells to serve that purpose. In addition to the utilitarian implements, beads and other cut and perforated mussel shells from the site were probably worn as pendants and adornments. Some mussel shell pieces were oval disks cut from the flat sections of larger shells. These pieces may have been unfinished blanks for pendants or tools in the making.

Figure 11.13. Representative sample of site locations with shell tools in Texas (Note: not a comprehensive list). Summary To summarize, shells are a common feature of archeological sites across Texas. As a food source, both saltwater coastal varieties and inland freshwater mussels and clams were consumed by ancestral peoples throughout the world. Outside of consumption, native peoples along the Gulf Coast and coastal plains often converted saltwater marine shells into tools, personal ornaments, ritual objects, and as offerings for the honored dead. Evidence for use and trade of shell ornaments found in mortuary contexts is particularly well-documented throughout Texas regions. Broadly, shell tools are more common in areas where shells are abundant but lithic materials scarce, and also seem to replace bone tools in some situations. However, far less common is evidence for locally produced mussel shell tools at inland sites, particularly those in central and north-central Texas. For this reason, the worked shell assemblage at 41DN580 is rare. At Hickory Creek 41DN580, freshwater mussels available in the nearby creek were heated and consumed for food, used as expedient tools, and possibly for personal ornamentation, which correlates to a small body of evidence in Texas.

some 41DN580 specimens may compare favorably to those interpreted from other sites to be pendant blanks, ornaments, or awls. Striations, nicking, evidence of battering, and notching on the Hickory Creek specimens may represent use-wear from digging or possibly scraping. Due to the absence of evidence for hafting, we think it is less likely these were chopping and woodworking tools such as adzes. While some shells could have been used as knives and cutting implements, the types of wear and modifications seen in the Hickory Creek assemblage do not align with expectations for those types of tools. Rather, most tools seem to have been employed for digging, cutting, scraping and smoothing. The idea that the 41DN580 shell tools were mostly expedient and used in place of bone or stone tools seems to align with other evidence of site/component function. Site 41DN580 appears to have been a short-term, repeated use campsite for most of its history, even during the Late Prehistoric component period. There is no other evidence for Late Prehistoric permanent structures, horticulture, or long-term occupation (see Chapter 16), despite a wide variety of artifact types not often seen at comparable sites (e.g., ceramics, shell tools, bone tools). Regional interactions and the place of 41DN580’s Late Prehistoric component are discussed further in Chapters 15 and 16 of this report. Regarding the shell artifacts of the Late Prehistoric component, there is scarce direct evidence (apart from the Harrell site) for the utilization of freshwater mussel and clam shells in the north Texas archeological record, and as such these artifacts represent an important research theme. The presence of modified mollusk remains at site 41DN580 broadens our understanding of the use and importance of freshwater mussel shells as tools by precontact groups.

12. F S R M LOTATION AMPLES AND ADIOCARBON ATERIAL S 41DN580 41DN624 FROM ITES AND By Leslie L. Bush Thirty flotation light fractions and nine macrobotanical samples from Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 were submitted for sorting, identification, and interpretation (Table 12.1). These were analyzed in two batches, the first in 2022 and a second group in 2024. Cultural materials at site 41DN580 consisted of burned sandstone, burned and unburned mussel shell, non-human bone, and charcoal. The 19 exposed features were burned rock clusters of varying sizes, including several possible hearths (also see Young 2014). Cultural materials recovered at site 41DN624 were similar but fewer, consisting of scattered burned sandstone features and mussel shell (THC Site Form 11/17/2020). Table 12.1.

Setting The two sites are located along Hickory Creek in central Denton County, Texas, in the Trinity River drainage, with site 41DN580 approximately one kilometer upstream (northwest) of site 41DN624. The area lies in the Grand Prairie section of the Cross Timbers region (Level III/IV Ecoregion 29d) where precontact vegetation was mixed grass prairie in the upland areas. Common grasses include big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), yellow Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), Texas wintergrass (Nasella leucotricha), and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea) (Griffith et al. 2007). Honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and junipers (Juniperus spp.) are common in the uplands today but would have been less prevalent in the past (Griffith et al. 2007), when fires and a lack of fences confined trees mostly to riparian zones and river valleys. Mesquite would have been absent until perhaps 1,000 years ago. Common riparian trees would have included elms (Ulmus spp.), hackberies (Celtis spp.), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), Shumard oak (Q. shumardii), pecan and other hickories (Carya spp.), roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii), soapberry (Sapindus saponaria), and American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) (Bezanson 2000:115). Floodplains also support useful vines such as grapes (Vitis spp.) and Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia). Plants with edible bulbs such as camas (Camassia spp.) and wild onions and garlic (Allium spp.) grow on the banks. Oxbows, sloughs, marshes, and other wetlands associated with Denton Creek would have offered plant resources such as cattail (Typha spp.) and aquatic tubers or rhizomes including arrowhead (Sagittaria spp.) and spatterdock (Nuphar lutea) (Bezanson 2000:115-116; Diggs et al. 1999:45-48; Gould 1962). Mean annual precipitation in Denton County during the period 1951-1980 was 33.5 inches (851 mm). Precipitation has a bimodal distribution with modest peaks in May and September. The frost- free season averages 226 days and runs from March 27 through November 8 (NFIC 1987:465-466). Examination of the paleosol from which features were excavated at site 41DN580 indicates Middle Archaic conditions in the area were wetter than present (THC Site Form 1/25/22). The mix of upland grasses may have included more Indiangrass and perhaps also eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), which is currently at the western edge of its range in Denton County (Kartesz 2015). Riparian trees and other plants would have been better able to colonize terraces and uplands, and wetland areas with their attendant resources would have been more common than in recent times. Methods Macrobotanical and carbon samples were examined under a Leica S9i stereoscopic microscope at 6.1-55 X. Carbonized botanical material larger than about 1.0 mm was separated from soil, and plant parts were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Hoadley 1990; InsideWood 2004; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980; Wheeler 2011). Plant nomenclature follows the PLANTS Database (USDA, NRCS 2022). After identification, specimens were counted, labeled, recorded, and weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic balance. To retain suitability for radiocarbon dating, samples were placed on freshly washed Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 327

glassware when not in specimen containers, and they were handled only with rubber finger cots and metal forceps. Flotation samples were processed at Acacia. Heavy fractions were examined for carbonized botanical material at Acacia and sent to Macrobotanical Analysis where they were combined with the light fractions. Samples were sorted according to standard procedures in the Macrobotanical Analysis laboratory (Pearsall 2015). Each flotation light fraction was weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic balance before being size-sorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh. All carbonized botanical materials that did not pass through the No. 10 mesh (2.00 mm square openings) were sorted under a Leica S9i stereozoom microscope at 6.1-55 X, then counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Gastropod fragments, soil particles, and uncarbonized botanical material larger than 2 mm (usually rootlets) were weighed, recorded, and labeled. Materials that fell through the 2 mm mesh were examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 6.1-55 X magnification. Due to the scarcity of carbonized botanical remains in these samples, any material that did not fall through the No. 25 mesh (0.71 mm square openings) was removed from residue, as were larger particles that did fall through that mesh size. Uncarbonized macrobotanical remains other than rootlets (seeds, juniper needles) were recorded on a presence/absence basis on laboratory forms. Wood charcoal identification was attempted for any specimen large enough to be picked up and snapped for a clean transverse section while wearing finger cots. Wood charcoal fragments were snapped to reveal a transverse section and examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 6.1-55 X magnification. When necessary, tangential or radial sections were examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting, and other characteristics. Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; InsideWood 2004; Martin and Barkley 1961; Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980; Wheeler 2011). Plant nomenclature follows that of the PLANTS Database (USDA, NRCS 2022). Results Macrobotanical Samples Nine macrobotanical and carbon samples from site 41DN580 contained identifiable wood charcoal (Tables 12.2-12.3). The sample from Unit 64 Level 3 (Lot 301) consisted of a single specimen of ash wood charcoal (Fraxinus sp.) with approximately seven growth rings (Figure 12.1). The sample from Unit 68 Level 5 (Lot 304) contained a fragment of black walnut nutshell (Juglans nigra; Figure 12.2) and a fragment of walnut wood charcoal (Juglans sp.) with approximately two growth rings. Black walnuts are a potential food source for site inhabitants. The woods from carbon samples consisted of ash (Fraxinus sp.), elm (Ulmus sp.), black walnut (Juglans nigra), and a fragment belonging to the hickory/walnut family (Juglandaceae) that may be either walnut or pecan (Table 12.3). Examples of the wood charcoal recovered are shown in Figures 12.3-12.5. Ash, elm, and walnut trees are likely to have grown in the riparian area along Hickory Creek in Middle Archaic times.

Figure 12.5. Transverse section of black walnut wood (Juglans nigra) from Lot 217, Site 41DN580. Flotation Samples Site 41NDN580 Twenty-one flotation samples were examined from 41DN580, seven from feature contexts (Features 5, 7, 8, 11, 17, and 18), four from units, and ten from Soil Column 2 (Table 12.4). Uncarbonized seeds and leaves are interpreted as modern, as conditions on the site are not conducive to the long-term preservation of botanical material (Lopinot and Brussell 1982; Miksicek 1987). In addition, the uncarbonized seeds represent weedy species expected in the soil seed bank near Hickory Creek (Keepax 1977). An uncarbonized pine wood fragment likely came from an archeological screen. Archeological plant remains in the flotation samples from site 41DN580 were sparse. The group of samples analyzed in 2022 had only 0.07 g of material sufficiently heavy to register on the scale. The calculated density of archeological plant remains for the 2022 samples is thus 0.0015 g per liter, nearly all of which comes from wood charcoal in Feature 5. Some of this wood charcoal could be provisionally identified as dewberry cane (Rubus sp.). The remainder of the wood charcoal in this and other features was identifiable only as hardwood. Wood charcoal from a typical sample is shown in Figure 12.6. Fragments of chenpod seeds (Chenopodium sp.), apparently carbonized, were recovered from three levels of a soil column taken from Units 1 and 10, near Features 3 and 4. Chenopod seeds are edible, as are the greens. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 332

Of the flotation samples processed in 2024, only three samples from site 41DN580 produced any carbonized plant materials at all: Features 11 and 18 and the 90-100 cm level of Column 2. Many plant fragments could be recognized as wood charcoal, but their small size prevented identification. An indicator of size is provided by the 14 wood charcoal fragments from Feature 18 that together weigh less than 0.01 g. Plant material recovered is consistent with the previous 2022 investigations.

Site 41DN624 Eight flotation samples were examined from site 41DN624, all from feature context (Features 2, 3, 9, and 12) (Table 12.5). Uncarbonized plant remains from this site are interpreted modern due to the preservation conditions (poor) and the weedy nature of the uncarbonized seeds recovered (Keepax 1977; Lopinot and Brussell 1982; Miksicek 1987). Archeological plant remains consisted of wood charcoal, carbonized bark, and indeterminable carbonized botanical fragments. Most of the indeterminable fragments are likely pith from the interior of woody stems. Wood charcoal from a typical sample is shown in Figure 12.7. One category of carbonized plant remains, indeterminable fragments from Feature 3 Lot 78, was heavy enough to register on the scale. The calculated archeological plant density is thus 0.0005 g/l. Even though actual plant density is higher, the calculated density is still only about two percent of the density of archeological plant remains in the Hardeman Midden in southwestern Denton County (0.022 g/l), where wood charcoal and nutshell were recovered from burned rock features along with wild onion and camas bulb fragments (Bush 2020). Fragment size in the Feature 12 samples was also large enough to permit identification of thirteen wood charcoal fragments to the oak genus (Quercus) (Figure 12.8). Oaks would likely have been common in the site area during Middle Archaic times. Figure 121.7.

Figure 11.8. 41DN624 Transverse section of oak wood charcoal from Feature 12 (Lot 371). Plant material recovered in Features 9 and 12 consists of the same types recovered in other areas of the site where oak wood charcoal was recovered along with carbonized bark and indeterminable botanical material from Features 2 and 3. No edible plant parts were recovered, although the presence of oak wood, presumably for fuel, implies the seasonal presence of acorn nuts. Summary Archeological plant remains at Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 were sparse and consisted primarily of wood charcoal. Ash, elm, and walnut wood charcoal were identified at site 41DN580. The two fragments of wood charcoal from macrobotanical samples at site 41DN580 were large enough to identify as ash and walnut, both expected trees for the riparian area along Hickory Creek. Black walnut nutshell and chenopod seed fragments indicate two potential food plants for inhabitants of site 41DN580, and the presence of burned dewberry cane suggests a possible third plant food item. If the dewberry cane reflects dewberry consumption, documented plant food resources for the site are walnuts, dewberry, and chenopod. Interestingly, all three plants are not available at the same time of year. Dewberry today ripens in mid-May to June but is no longer available by the time black walnuts ripen in late September or October (USDA, NRCS 2024). Chenopod plants flower April through September (Diggs et al. 1999), so their edible greens and early seeds are available during dewberry Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 338

season. Only the last of the chenopod seeds would be present when walnuts start to ripen, however. Talalay and colleagues (1984) suggest that walnuts may be more a winter than a fall resource for two reasons. Walnuts continue to be available later in the season than other nuts because squirrels turn to walnuts only after hickories have been exhausted (Talalay et al. 1984:347). In addition, walnut hulls are easier to remove by December when they have started to decay on the ground (Talalay et al. 1984:350). At site 41DN624, wood charcoal was the only identifiable plant material present. Fragments from Features 2 and 12 could be identified as oak. No remains of geophytes such as onion or camas bulbs, arrowhead tubers, or spatterdock rhizomes that would have benefitted from earth oven cooking (Wandsnider 1997) were recovered in the samples.

13. P , P , S A OLLEN HYTOLITH AND TARCH NALYSIS FOR S 41DN580 ITE Linda Scott Cummings, PaleoResearch Institute Site 41DN580, a buried multicomponent site located on Hickory Creek in Denton, Texas, contains evidence of occupation from the middle Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. Four sediment samples collected from two of these periods were submitted for pollen, phytolith, and starch analysis. Methods Pollen and Starch Sediments often present unique challenges for pollen preservation and recovery, meaning that larger samples are required for land sediments than for pollen recovery from lake sediments or peat bogs. A chemical extraction technique based on flotation is the standard preparation technique used in this laboratory for recovering pollen grains from sediments. This particular process was developed for extracting pollen from soils where the ratio of pollen to inorganic material is relatively low. It is important to recognize that it is not the repetition of specific and individual steps in the laboratory, but rather mastery of the concepts of extraction and how the desired result is best achieved, given different sediment matrices, that results in successful recovery of pollen for analysis. Our pollen extraction method retains starch granules when they are present. Starch granules are a plant's mechanism for storing carbohydrates. Starches occur in numerous seeds, as well as in starchy roots and tubers. The primary categories of starches include the following: with or without visible hila, hilum centric or eccentric, hila patterns (dot, cracked, elongated), and shape of starch (angular, ellipse, circular, or lenticular). Some of these starch categories are typical of specific plants, while others are more common and tend to occur in many different types of plants. Hydrochloric acid (10%) was used to remove calcium carbonates in the sediment samples, after which they were screened through 250-micron mesh. Multiple water rinses, employing Stoke’s Law for settling time, were completed to return the sample to a neutral pH. A small quantity of sodium hexametaphosphate was used to suspend clay-sized particles prior to additional rinsing using Stoke’s Law. Finally, the samples were freeze-dried under vacuum. Once dry, the samples were mixed with sodium polytungstate (SPT), at a specific gravity of 1.8 g/ml, and centrifuged to separate the organic material including pollen and starch, which floats, from the inorganic remains and silica, which do not float. The light fraction was recovered and the process was repeated, as many times as necessary. This pollen-rich organic fraction was rinsed, and samples received a 25-minute treatment in hot hydrofluoric acid to remove remaining inorganic particles. The samples were acetylated for 10 minutes to remove extraneous organic matter. Samples were rinsed with RODI water to neutral. Due to the presence of large quantities of minute organic debris, the samples were centrifuged at high speeds for short intervals to remove this debris. Following this, a few drops of potassium hydroxide (KOH) were added to each sample, which was then stained lightly with safranin. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 340

A light microscope was used to count pollen at a magnification of 500x. Pollen preservation in these samples varied from good to poor. An extensive comparative reference housed at PaleoResearch Institute aided pollen identification to the family, genus, and species level, where possible. Phytolith and Starch Extraction from Sediment Extraction to recover both phytoliths and starch grains from the sediment samples is based primarily on our heavy liquid technique for pollen extraction. First, 15 ml of sediment from each sample was placed in a beaker with an oxidant such as bleach, then allowed to sit overnight. The next day the beakers containing samples were filled with water and allowed to settle by gravity (using Stokes Law) for one and one-half hours, after which the supernatant was poured off. This rinse was repeated four times to remove the bleach or oxidizing agent. The next step in organic removal was to introduce a small quantity of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH), which was not allowed to sit long because it may damage the silica bodies. Additional rinses removed dissolved organics. Clays were removed using sodium hexametaphosphate and a repetition of the Stokes law settling. The samples then were freeze-dried using a vacuum system, then mixed with sodium polytungstate (SPT, density 2.1 g/ml) and centrifuged to separate the phytolith and starch grain fraction, which will float, from most of the inorganic silica fraction, which will not. The light fraction of each sample was retained and rinsed to remove the heavy liquid. The phytolith- and starch-rich fraction of each sample was rinsed in alcohol to remove any remaining water. Microscope slides were made by putting a drop of sample on a slide, allowing it to dry, then mixing with optical immersion oil prior to covering with a cover slip for counting with a light microscope at a magnification of 500x. A percentage and/or frequency diagram was produced using Tilia 2.0 and TGView 2.1.1. Results and Discussion Site 41DN580 exhibited evidence of at least three primary periods of occupations representing the Middle Archaic and Late Prehistoric. Samples were collected from the Middle Archaic component that represent a mussel shell feature (F. 18) and an FCR feature (F. 19) (Table 13.1). Middle Archaic component features are generally small, widely scattered clusters of fire-cracked rocks interpreted as hearths. Mussel shell fragments were abundant leading to the interpretation that the Middle Archaic features represent short-term or single use occupations by seasonally mobile groups who returned to this area over millennia, perhaps about 3000 years, to collect aquatic resources from the creek and occasionally process hunted terrestrial remains. Feature 18 is a discrete cluster of complete mussel shells comprising more than 50 valves, many of which were stacked on top of one another. Scattered, small to medium pieces of FCR ring the shell drop area. No bone was present. Soil samples were collected under the shells. The pollen record of sample 70 is co-dominated by Poaceae, High-spine Asteraceae, and Low-spine Asteraceae pollen (Figure 13.1; Table 13.2), representing grasses, various members of the sunflower family, and marshelder or related plants. Moderately small to small quantities of Carya, Juniperus, Maclura, Pinus, and Quercus pollen reflect hickory or pecan, juniper, Osage orange, pine, and oak trees growing in the vicinity or region of this site.

Microscopic charcoal is moderately abundant, which is consistent with the description of this area containing fire-cracked rock. Total pollen concentration is moderately high at more than 1800 pollen/cubic centimeter (cc) of sediment, suggesting relatively good preservation.

Birds, bees, butterflies and other insects are attracted to it. Its seeds are consumed by turkeys and mourning doves and also may be consumed by humans when ripe. Undoubtedly, if these seeds were collected and processed, people would have had special collection methods to avoid the spiny hairs that produce burning, stinging, and an itching rash that lasts for hours. The pain may be alleviated with ammonia, but the tiny spines may be difficult to remove. The phytolith record for this feature is dominated by bulliform and elongate phytoliths, representing grasses in general. Grass short cells were rare in this sample, but included rondels, trapeziforms, and saddle shapes, representing both cool season and short grasses. Trichomes and interstomatal cells are present in all grasses. Parallelepiped forms are found in dicotyledenous plants. The phytoliths exhibited pitting, which is a sign of dissolution, which occurs in alkaline sediments that are moist to wet. This process is probably accelerated by the presence of shells, which add alkalinity to the sediments. This allows the opal silica of the phytoliths and also diatoms and sponge spicules to dissolve in the water that is present, returning the silica to the sediments for uptake again in the future. This is a natural process that insures the bio-availability of silica over time. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 343

Feature 19, a small cluster of FCR and mussel shell fragments, is represented by two samples collected around the FCR at two different levels. The pollen signatures for these two samples are very similar, with differences noted primarily in quantities of Amaranthaceae and High-spine Asteraceae pollen. High-spine Asteraceae pollen is more abundant in sample 150, while Amaranthaceae pollen is more abundant in sample 148. Quantities of Poaceae pollen are similar in these two samples. Small quantities of Carya, Juniperus, Cirsium, Brassicaceae, Lotus, and Solanaceae pollen representing hickory/pecan, juniper, thistle, a member of the mustard family, bird’s foot trefoils, and a member of the nightshade family were observed in sample 148, but not in sample 150. In contrast, a few Sporormiella dung fungal spores were noted in sample 150, but not in sample 148. These samples yielded similar quantities of microscopic charcoal and similar total pollen concentration values between approximately 2550 and 3000 pollen/cc of sediment. If any of these differences represent economic activity it is possible the upper depth is associated with processing goosefoot, while the lower level is associated with processing a member of the sunflower family. However, it must be noted that both families of plants contain many members that are weedy, taking advantage of disturbed sediments. These signatures might be primarily environmental. The phytolith record for these two samples differs. The lower signature contains more grass short cells indicating that most of the grasses growing locally included cool season (Festucoid) and short (Chloridoid) grasses. Few tall (Panicoid) grass phytoliths were observed. Elongates and bulliforms were still present, as are trichomes. Dicots were noted, but did not contribute to understanding the local flora. A few sponge spicules, attesting to soil moisture, were observed. The upper sample contained fewer grass short cells indicating the presence of cool season and short grasses. Elongate phytoliths, typical of both grasses and sedges, were abundant. A few dicot forms were observed. Pennate diatoms and sponges spicules both were noted, indicating soil moisture. Sample 148, the upper sample, suffered more from dissolution, possibly because those sediments were wetter. The Late Prehistoric is represented by a single sample collected from the heart of this area. This component yielded a different archaeological expression including abundant faunal remains, ceramics, lithic tools and tool-making debris, worked shell tools, and macrobotanical remains across the site. Although no formal features were identified, the distribution of these remains across the landscape was labeled Feature 14. This component dates to ca. AD 1200, representing a scatter of cultural material across a defined surface. It is characterized by large FCR, small bits of burned clay, and minute flecks of carbon. Faunal remains from beaver, white tailed deer, turtle, rodents, and various mussel shell species were abundant. The pollen signature for this feature was dominated by Poaceae pollen, reflecting local growth of grasses, perhaps after abandonment of the feature. Moderate quantities of Low-spine Asteraceae and High-spine Asteraceae pollen represent various plants in the sunflower family that include marshelder and related plants and a large number of other plants that produce High-spine Asteraceae pollen. A smaller quantity of Amaranthaceae pollen represents goosefoot and related plants. Trees are represented by Carya, Maclura, Pinus, and Quercus pollen that indicate local or regional growth of hickory or pecan, Osage orange, pine, and oak trees.

of plants in the chicory tribe of the sunflower family, members of the mustard family, Texas bull nettle, geranium, a member of the mint family, wild buckwheat, and a plant in the rose family. The phytolith signature includes primarily bulliform and elongate phytoliths, which are indicative of grasses (Figure 13.2). Grass short cells include rondel, trapeziform, Chloridoid saddles, and Panicoid bilobate forms indicating local grasses include primarily cool season (Festucoid) and short (Chloridoid) grasses. Given the fact that grasses in these two categories also may produce bilobates, it is difficult to ascertain whether or not the bilobates were produced in either cool season or short grasses or if they represent tall (Panicoid) grasses. Trichomes also represent either grasses or sedges. The few dicot phytoliths are not diagnostic. The sponge spicules observed indicate soil moisture. This sample also was affected by dissolution of opal silica, meaning that some of the phytolith population has gone back into solution in the sediments and is available for uptake by plants. Although the samples were scanned in search of starches, none were observed. Figure 13.2. Phytolith diagram for 41DN580. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 346

Summary and Conclusions No evidence of Zea mays or any other cultigens was observed in the pollen samples, even the Late Prehistoric pollen sample. Across all time periods, this location has abundant natural resources including bull nettles, pecans and/or hickory, acorns, goosefoot and/or amaranth, Osage orange or bois d’arc (bow-wood), rose hips, buckwheat, and mussels. The later occupation also provides evidence of harvesting numerous land animals, adding to this list of available resources. The persistent presence of pollen from bull nettles suggests they were relatively abundant on the landscape. Clearing any land that supports bull nettles would be difficult, whereas exploiting this and other natural resources might be viewed as optimal use of this landscape.

14. E S F A XPERIMENTAL TUDIES AND EATURE NALYSIS By Victoria Ingalls Worldwide, FCR represents one of the largest datasets for hunter-forager populations, but it is infrequently analyzed beyond presence/absence and the identification of features. This may be, in part, caused by the locally specific geologic and systemic contexts and by the perception by some that there is little to be learned from these features. Here, we add to the conversation with a discussion FCR from sites 41DN580 and 41DN624, our experimental study of local rock, and discuss feature types and possible behavioral correlates based on our results. Acacia’s 2021-2022 excavations at sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 found that site expression was primarily through the presence of FCR features. Across both sites, archeologists documented a total of 5,283 pieces of FCR (448.3 kg) in 32 features with a comparatively limited assemblage of other artifact classes. FCR represents 85% (n = 1168) of the lithic assemblage at site 41ND580, and 98.3% (n=4115) at site 41DN624. When we break it down by rock type, tabular sandstone rocks are the primary raw material used in FCR features at site 41DN624, constituting 66% of the FCR assemblage. While at site 41DN580, feature materials are split more evenly, with 43% sandstone and 45% limestone. Features ranged from scatters of FCR with little associated material, to more formal hearths and earth ovens (Figure 14.1). Collectively, our data suggest repeated but short-term occupation at both sites during the Middle and Late Archaic periods. Acacia’s preliminary analyses allowed us to group these features into three descriptive categories that relate to function and longevity of use. As described in Chapter 6, Category 1 includes non-patterned scatters of FCR (580 n=7; 624 n=6); these make up about a third to a half of all features at both sites. Category 2 includes tight, well-defined and typically circular clusters of burned rock without a distinct basin shape (580 n=7; 624 n=4). Category 3 includes basin-shaped earth ovens (580 n=2; 624 n=3). FCR making up the larger Type 2 and 3 features is primarily tabular sandstone, while many of the Type 1 features are primarily limestone or breccia. Although local clay soils are extremely deep, sandstone and limestone rocks are readily available from the nearby creek channel. It is also worth noting that chert is not common in the area, including in the creek channel gravels. With this in mind, we wanted to see if some simple experimentation would help refine our understanding of these features. Goals for this preliminary experimentation were to replicate some of the heat-alteration patterns seen in archeological features and investigate the degree of use-alteration and heat fracturing on local rocks. Examining these patterns will give us a better understanding of the temperature, conditions, and duration of heating which would allow us to interpolate behaviors from the archeological assemblage. This, combined with information related to feature type, size, and associated materials will help us contextualize the lifeways of Archaic peoples in the upper Trinity River Basin.

Methods To better understand the observed archeological patterns, we gathered about 30 kg (66 lbs) of local unmodified stone from Hickory Creek at site 41DN580 (Figure 14.2). These were sandstone, breccia, limestone, and two examples of silicified limestone with a thin chert vein. These are all common gravels from the Hickory Creek drainage, and we chose a sample that was similar to the observed archeological assemblage. Figure 14.2.

This experiment sought simply to establish to what degree intense heating would cause the visible alteration of individual rocks. Before the start of heating, we selected a representative sample 40 specimens to track throughout the process. Each was numbered, measured, weighed, photographed, and for each one we recorded a Munsell color for the cortex. Additionally, we noted if there were any existing cracks or other surface characteristics that may affect future fracture patterns. Then, we arranged our 40 rocks along with approximately 20 untracked rocks into a circular pit that was 25-30 cm deep and just over a meter in diameter, dug into the local loamy sand soil (Figure 14.3). These were arranged at random, and a fire was built on top. After the fire was lit, every 20 minutes archeologists took readings of the internal temperature, the temperature of the rocks at the exterior or the fire, as well as ambient air temperature, windspeed, and humidity (Figure 14.4). Fuel used included dry brush for kindling, and oak, pecan, and mesquite wood was added as necessary to raise and maintain internal temperature. Our initial goal was to slowly raise the temperature to a high of 1000˚C (or 1830˚F), allow the fire to burn down and create a coal bed which could be buried and allowed to slowly dry-cool. On the day of our experiment, the weather was a cool 58˚F and blustery, with a slight drizzle occurring off and on throughout the day. The fire was actively tended and stoked for five hours, during which time the average internal temperature was 660˚C, and the average of the exterior rocks was 192˚C. After this period, the hot coals were spread evenly across the feature, which was then covered with soil to approximate conditions in an earth oven. Thermal readings continued to be made at 20 minute intervals for several hours, after which time reading times were spaced out, especially in the overnight hours. In addition to the dry-cooled rocks, both sandstone and limestone rocks were used to observe fracture patterns resulting from stone-boiling (Figure 14.5). Photographs were taken as the process was repeated a total of five times. Temperatures were recorded for both the rock and water prior to emersion – the rock was heated to between 750 and 850˚C, while the water was allowed to cool between emersions to roughly 21˚C (or about 70˚F).

Results While researchers were only able to achieve an internal temperature of to 875˚C (1607˚F) during firing, certain rocks, especially mudstone and sandstone that appear to have higher iron content, began fracturing between approximately 500 and 600˚C. The fire was allowed to cool for a day and a half, at which time temperature readings were equivalent to the surrounding soil at 25 ˚C (77˚F). The feature was then excavated, and each rock was photographed as it was removed (Figure 14.6). Researchers looked at eight heat-alteration patterns following Neubauer (2018), modifying the parameters slightly to fit the sample. The heat-alterations we anticipated are heat fracture, fine crazing, deep surface cracking, exfoliation, discoloration, reddening, sooting or blackening, and iron oxidation. Each of the 40 tracked rocks were examined for these visible changes. Figure 14.6. Experimental oven during excavation. For the dry-cooled rocks from the experimental earth-oven feature, all exhibited some level of discoloration (n = 40), and most showed significant reddening (Figure 14.7). Half of the sample was blackened, especially those near the center of the feature where the heat was highest. Ten had evidence of iron oxidation, while only three examples showed heat fracturing, including one mudstone that completely disintegrated (Figure 14.8). Four rocks showed deep surface cracking, and one showed evidence of crazing. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 352

While researchers anticipated the reddening and discoloration based on the archeological assemblage, we also expected the rate of heat fracturing to be substantially higher. The fact that only three of the dry-cooled rocks fractured suggests that there was some variable we did not account for. It could be that our experiment did not achieve a high enough temperature to cause the expected fracturing, that fracturing was caused by repeated heating episodes, in damp or wet environments, or that the fracturing we documented in the field was not caused by the heat but rather time and taphonomic processes over the intervening millennia. As previous studies have shown (e.g., Neubauer 2018), wet-cooled FCR typically exhibit irregular and jagged fracture patterns with wavy interior surface. This held true for one of the two limestone stone boiling specimens, which fractured into twelve identifiable pieces and created a notable amount of sandy/gravel in the water container used during the experiment. During the first emersion, the stone exhibited a notable discoloration and reddening, and additional repetitions of heating and emersion produced similar reddening and fracturing. The second limestone rock also exhibited some discoloration but did not fracture at all throughout the experiment. Four pieces of sandstone were used for stone boiling. Three of the four rocks fractured on their second emersion, while the fourth did not fracture at all. These fractured in sheets along the rocks’ internal structure. All of the sandstone specimens also exhibited discoloration and a slight reddening. Discussion The results of this preliminary study showed that a thin bed of sandstone rocks with the fire built above (admittedly not the most heat efficient method) retained a temperature of over 200˚C (390˚F) for about seven hours after it was covered with soil, and over 100˚C (212˚F) for approximately 12 hours. This suggests that even a small amount of the local sandstone would be significant enough to create enough thermal longevity with a small fire to roast whatever local foodstuffs were being eaten. During stone-boiling experiments, it was anticipated that limestone would perform better than sandstone, and this generally held true. Both types of stone performed well as far as fracturing, taking on average more than four submersions to fracture in any significant way. There was some discoloration noted immediately, but investigators were again surprised by the lack of cracking or exfoliation. While both types of rock took this repeated drastic thermal stress without major fracturing, our limestone examples did raise the temperature of the water slightly more than the sandstone pieces, in the range of 15-20˚C as opposed to about 10-15˚C per immersion. This allows us to speculate that limestone may have been preferred over sandstone for stone-boiling. To look more closely at rock choice, we identified (where possible) the types of rock in each feature. Most features have a significant proportion of either limestone or sandstone over the other rock type, suggesting there was a preferential rock selection for different activities. Most Category 1 features were primarily limestone, whereas the Category 2 and 3 features tend to be constructed of tabular sandstone. The thermal properties of rocks depend on numerous factors including the mineralogical composition, structure and geometry of pores, grain sizes, shape and depth of cracks, and their concentration, as well as surface area to mass ratio (Neubauer 2018; Rostami et al. 2016; Sun et al. Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 354

2016). While limestone is calcium carbonate, sandstone is primarily composed of quartz with various amounts of hematite/magnetite (giving the sandstone the classic reddish-orange color when heated) and other minerals. Sandstone is more readily available from local sources and tends to be more resistant to thermal shock and can withstand higher temperatures without fracturing or exploding. Sandstone has a lower thermal conductivity than limestone, which means it takes longer to heat up but retains heat for longer periods of time. This property can be advantageous for cooking tasks that require a slow and steady heat source. Limestone, on the other hand, is a denser and finer-grained rock that tends to have a higher thermal conductivity than sandstone. Meaning that it heats up more quickly, but also cools down faster, making it less efficient than sandstone for cooking tasks that require a consistent and sustained heat source. Finally, rock shape is likely reciprocally influenced by feature function. Tabular sandstone is easily stackable and can create dense areas of rock that, heated well, increased heat retention. This could also allow the feature’s creators to have more control over the form and shape of features, which may have been an important aspect of their construction. This is especially true if features are designed for a specific use. Alternately, the locally available limestone is typically chunky and less uniform, adding additional variables to feature construction. Features with more limestone content tend to be more sprawling, less well defined, and also suggest less intense burning episodes and period of use. Combining these data points leads us to suggest that some of our Category 1 features may in fact be the result of stone-boiling activities. Behaviorally, we would not expect FCR resulting from stone-boiling to necessarily be piled or arranged in any pattern, but rather discarded haphazardly as they either fractured or had fulfilled their purpose. Additionally, as noted above, the thermal behavioral characteristics of limestone make it a slightly better candidate for stone-boiling. We acknowledge that this was a preliminary experiment that did not have good control over many variables and was only conducted once. This experiment was also limited in the types of environmental conditions that it tested. For example, researchers did not test rocks for repeated firing, and we did not increase the moisture of the earth oven as would be expected if it was being used to cook. However, this simple experimental study offers a starting point and allows us to refine our preliminary interpretations of the behaviors that created these features.

15. S D YNTHESIS AND ISCUSSION This chapter presents a summary of results and discussion of inter- and intra-site variability among sites 41DN580 and 41DN624. These are multicomponent Prehistoric residential camps on the floodplain of Hickory Creek in Denton, Texas. Acacia identified both sites within the Hickory Creek Interceptor project area during survey, and subsequently tested and mitigated each within the project easements. Stratified deposits at both sites indicate three recognizable periods of occupation. At site 41DN580, these include two Middle Archaic occupations and a third during the Late Prehistoric. Site 41DN624 has two distinct Middle Archaic components, along with a Late Archaic occupation. The assemblages and features documented in the investigated areas of the sites suggest these were temporary camps used periodically over several thousand years. THC recommended that both sites are eligible for SAL and NRHP listing. Acacia’s excavations were limited to the right-of-way for the Hickory Creek Interceptor line, and as such the exposures afforded only partial glimpses of each site. Previous surveys showed that 41DN580 extends outside the current project area to the east, and erosion along the artificial detention basin suggest it would have originally extended towards the north and west as well. Similarly, it would not be surprising if 41DN624 also extended outside the current easement. Overall, Acacia excavated 57.7 m3 of sediment across both sites through feature-focused units and control units placed in areas without visible features. During excavations, 19 features were documented at 41DN580, and 13 at 41DN624. All of the discrete features (i.e., site furniture) identified during this effort date to the Middle (5900-3500 BP) and Late (2900-2700 BP) Archaic. These are principally variously sized concentrations of FCR with some associated cultural material. The Late Prehistoric component at 41DN580, originally labeled Feature 14, was approximately 40 cm thick and while no discrete features were identified within this zone, this component contained more artifacts than all earlier occupations combined, including modified mussel shell implements, a bone needle fragment, ceramic sherds, as well as three arrow points. In addition to chronometric samples collected from each site, recovered Archaic diagnostic artifacts include Godley, Trinity, Darl, Kent, and Marshall dart points; Late Prehistoric diagnostics include Colbert/Hayes, Alba, and Fresno arrow points. Chronology and Context The primary goal of eligibility testing that carried through the data recovery efforts was to understand the chronology of the sites and how they fit into the broader Prehistoric patterns of north- central Texas. Pulling together the data presented here, there are at least three primary periods of occupation at each site (Chapter 7). Although separated by roughly a thousand years, modeled dates at 41DN580 indicate two Middle Archaic occupations (at roughly 5000-4800 cal BP, and 4000-3800 cal BP), while a third period of occupation dates to about 750-700 cal BP. Likewise, at 41DN624 there are two Middle Archaic periods of occupation (dating to about 5900-5600 and 3700-3500 cal BP), and a third Late Archaic (2900-2700 cal BP) occupation. Each of the Archaic period occupations are defined by typically small thermal features that have a limited assemblage of associated artifacts. Moreover, Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 356

the earliest documented occupation at each site is within the Sanger alloformation, while the later occupations are all within the Pilot Point formation (Lawrence and Eyeington, Chapter 7). While these periods of site use do not indicate contemporaneity of all features and activity areas, several interesting patterns emerge when we look at the spatial and temporal data. Features and activity areas at both sites seem to cluster based on period of occupation, although this pattern is much more distinct at 41DN624. 41DN580 Chronological Summary 41DN580 Middle Archaic I (5000-4800 cal BP) Features at 41DN580 that date to the “Middle Archaic I” (5000-4800 cal BP) include Features 5, 8, 15, 16, 17 (see Chapter 7; Table 15.1), and likely 9-13, 19 (based on stratigraphic positioning; Figures 15.1-15.2). These are within the Sanger Formation and are distributed across the entirety of the mitigated site area. There are two notable clusters of features: Features 9-13 at the southern end of the site and Features 15-17 near the center of the site. As for feature type, Features 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, and 19 are all Category 1 features – unconsolidated clusters of FCR that are possibly small hearth remnants or discards from stone boiling. These had very few associated artifacts that mostly consisted of unidentifiable mussel shell fragments, although there were a few identifiable Texas lilliput and yellow sandshell specimens. Feature 19 is stratigraphically the lowest of all the features documented at the site, at an elevation of about 172.72 ft amsl. Although no direct dates were taken from charcoal (there was none) or bulk humate from this feature, it is firmly within the Sanger alloformation and hence it almost certainly exceeds 5,000 years in age.

See Lawrence and Eyeington Chapter 7 for additional discussion. Features 5, 8, 11, and 17 are Category 2 features, tight clusters of FCR that had similar amounts of associated freshwater mussel shell, as well as two Edwards chert flakes found near Feature 5. Paleobotanical remains from Features 11 and 17 were indeterminate carbonized botanical remains. Interestingly, Feature 5 produced wood charcoal identified by Bush (Chapter 11) as dewberry cane and hardwood. Dewberry could signify a possible food source, that activities like basket/fiber making were taking place here, or it could simply be a fuel source for the fire. Bush also identified carbonized material from Feature 8 as hardwood. Feature 16 is the lone Type 3 feature dating to this period, comprised of tabular sandstone with a slight inward cant towards the feature’s center. Rather than the stacked earth ovens from later periods, this feature appears more like a rock-lined pit or griddle and had very few associated artifacts (one Edwards chert bifacial thinning flake and one mussel shell fragment). Features 16 and 15 are extremely close in elevation and only about 4 m apart, possibly suggesting that, if these features are contemporaneous, Feature 16 was for a larger or longer food processing activity supported by smaller outlying hearths.

Feature 18, a tight concentration of opened, whole Texas lilliput valves (Toxolasma texasiense), plus pollen and phytolith data from this period (Feature 19) indicate a broad mosaic environment with many edible species (Chapter 13). The bulk of pollen from analyzed samples comes from low grasses, nightshade, mustard family, sunflowers, and amaranth, with lower quantities of tree pollen, including hickory/pecan and juniper. Notably, grasses ae primarily cool season short varieties, suggesting a fall- early spring occupation. 41DN580 Middle Archaic II (4000-3800 cal BP) 41DN580 features within the Pilot Point formation and with modeled dates between 4000-3800 cal BP (“Middle Archaic II”) include Features 3, 4, 6, and 7, which are all clustered at the northern end of the site. Feature 18, the freshwater mussel shell discard feature may fall in this temporal range as, elevation-wise, it lies right at the cusp between the two Middle Archaic period components. Feature 7 is, as far as we can tell, isolated in the center of the site area with very little associated material. It is a Category 2 feature likely representing the remains of a hearth. Artifacts from the surrounding units include some mussel shell fragments and a heavily used Edwards chert scraper. Paleobotanical remains associated with the feature could only be identified as hardwoods and indeterminable carbonized botanicals (Bush, Chapter 11). At the north end of the site, Features 3, 4, and 6 are at roughly the same elevation only about a meter apart from each other, and we interpret them as contemporaneous. Feature 3 is a Category 3 earth oven with a central depression and preserved organic material, while Feature 6 is a small Category 2 cluster of FCR. Feature 6 was also very circular but had notably less soil discoloration and organic remains, suggesting it may be a small hearth supporting the activities at Feature 3. However, it is also possible Feature 6 is a small rake-out or dump pile from Feature 3 rather than a hearth. Around these features, flotation samples included hardwoods as well as chenopod seeds (Chenopodium sp.). Chenopod seeds and greens are both edible, and they tend to grow in open, sunny areas. Although it is just one piece of evidence, this might suggest there was a local environmental mosaic of open grasslands near the likely wooded areas along the creekbank. Finally, Feature 4 was initially put in Category 2, although it is notably smaller than other features in this category. Given its proximity to Features 3 and 6, and at roughly the same elevation it likely represents a rake-out or discard pile (possibly even from stone boiling) from activities centered on those other features. In this area, Acacia documented a Kent dart point, a heavily used and refurbished Marshall point made of Uvalde chert, as well as flakes of both Edwards and Uvalde cherts. However, the Kent and Marshall points were found on the eroded surface of the detention pond bank and therefore cannot be directly associated with any of the features. Feature 18 was unique within the material assemblage of site 41DN580. Rather than a distinct thermal feature, Feature 18 is a cluster of mussel shell with a single flake tool. While the majority of the 361 shell specimens are not identifiable on their own, of the identifiable examples nearly all are Texas lilliput (n=37) and most of the unidentified remainder appear to be of the same species. The lithic is an Edwards chert scraper with heavy polish and use-wear, possibly even a tool used to open mussels. Feature 18 interpreted as a single food consumption event and could suggest a selective preference for lilliput mussels at that time. A soil sample from this feature revealed pollen and phytoliths from cool season grasses, sunflowers, marshelder, goosefoot/amaranth, buckwheat, mustards, legumes, and a variety of other Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 358

edible species (Chapter 13). There are smaller quantities indicating nearby tree species, including hickory/pecan, juniper, bois d’arc, pine, and oak. Moreover, phytoliths were pitted from alkaline sediments, suggesting a moist to wet environment (Chapter 13). Like the previous Middle Archaic I occupation, this generally indicates a predominantly open mosaic environment with moist soils near the creek. While not designated as a feature, there is a block of units in Trench F (Units 69-80) that are also worth a discussion. This group of units was opened because no features were observed in Trench F during mechanical scraping and were meant to act as a control group. Units 69-80 possibly represent an activity area, as archeologists recovered 343 pieces of mussel shell (most are unidentifiable Unionidae, but several samples were identifiable as threeridge, yellow sandshell, and Texas lilliput), 20 faunal bone fragments (primarily small-medium to medium mammal (fox to deer size), and most had evidence of carnivore modification), three Edwards chert flakes with use-wear, and scattered small pieces of FCR. Artifacts were recovered from the same elevations across all units (173.23-173.03 m). Based on their elevation these artifacts are in the same general range as Features 3, 4, 6, and 7, and may represent a living surface. These materials should therefore date to 41DN580’s Middle Archaic II period. 41DN580 Late Prehistoric (750-700 cal BP) Finally, the 41DN580 Late Prehistoric component (750-700 cal BP) is an area of general refuse within a small, defined space on the north-northeast side of Trench E. There was no site furniture (thermal features, post holes, etc.), however, this component produced more cultural materials than all Archaic occupations combined. This is linked in part to the component’s much younger age, increasing the probability of organic preservation. However, as we will discuss below, the Late Prehistoric represents a distinct change in tool use and technology, and quite possibly entirely new adaptations in resource optimization. The generalized refuse was scattered over an indistinct surface that, in addition to the artifacts described below, also had abundant flecks of carbon, burned clay, and other small inclusions, making this soil distinct from its surroundings. Artifacts recovered included a substantial amount of faunal material, 102 lithics, as well as all the site’s ceramic material. Lithic tools from this component include Alba, Colbert/Hayes, and Fresno points, two prismatic blades, bifacial thinning flakes, and many utilized flakes. Nearly all lithic materials show some amount of use-wear including battering, abrasion, polish, and scraping. The identifiable raw materials represented by these lithics include 35% Uvalde Chert (n=36), 13.7% Edwards chert (n=14), 3% silicified sandstone (n=3), 2% Nova chert (n=2), while a single example is Ogallala quartzite. Material types for the remainder are not identifiable to a source. Because the preservation of Late Prehistoric faunal material was so much greater than earlier components, this occupation accounts for 92% of the vertebrate and 40% of the invertebrate assemblages. This increased sample size also has higher taxonomic richness than earlier occupations, which is expected for larger samples (Lyman 2008). Identified species include white-tailed deer, mule deer, American beaver, and box turtle, as well as many other specimens only identifiable as ‘mammal’ (Ramsey, Jacobson, and Haliburton, Chapter 10). The greater species diversity in the Late Prehistoric assemblage does not necessarily indicate a change in subsistence patterns or environmental conditions compared to the Middle Archaic (though it remains a possibility) but is rather the result of greater Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 359

preservation (Phillips, Chapter 11). Just over half of the vertebrate remains have been burned, and all direct evidence of butchering at the site came from this component. Evidence of butchering includes cut marks identified on a deer (Odocoileus sp.) metapodial, cut and chop marks on an American beaver (Castor canadensis) femur, and percussion marks on an Artiodactyl long bone (Chapter 10). The cut and chop marks on the beaver femur are likely associated with primary disarticulation, while the cut marks on the deer metapodial diaphysis likely resulted from secondary processing/consumption. Moreover, all of the vertebrate remains identifiable as turtle came from this occupation. More than 66% of the turtle remains are burned, suggesting they were processed directly in a fire (Chapter 10). Vertebrate remains from this component also exhibit moderately high rates of carnivore modification (some 20% of Late Prehistoric bone); while this could indicate the presence of domesticated dogs, it could also be from carnivore scavenging. Invertebrate remains from this period of occupation were likewise more numerous than in any other site component. The majority are unidentifiable freshwater mussel shell fragments (n=1124), although like the vertebrate faunal, this component also produced a much wider breadth of identifiable species which include threeridge, yellow sandshell, bankclimber, bleufer, and Texas lilliput. Because of the differences in preservation rates between the Late Prehistoric and Archaic period components, this report cannot draw definitive conclusions concerning changes in subsistence strategies or environmental conditions from previous periods. However, nor can exploration of this question be discarded. The mussel shell data do suggest an intensification in use of that resource in the Late Prehistoric period. Unlike bone, mussel shell remains were preserved—and often well preserved—in the older Archaic period contexts. In fact, an entire intact feature of well-preserved freshwater mussel shells (Feature 18, mostly identified as Texas lilliput) was recorded in the Middle Archaic II component at site 41DN580, which implies conditions were sufficient to allow for preservation in place of a single discard event. Thus, the marked increase in mussel shell counts and weight in the Late Prehistoric component cannot be simply dismissed as preservation bias. Even more intriguing about these bivalves is that 32 of them were intentionally modified. Eighteen have cut and/or smoothed edges, and six show signs of battering, and at least six have use-related polish (Chapter 11). Some were likely expedient tools, and the heavy battering and use suggests they may have been used as hoes/digging implements, as scrapers (possibly for hides or wood), possibly ceramic smoothing tools, or in other ways. This alone suggests that an entirely new technological adaptation was occurring in the Late Prehistoric period, one possibly centered on plant and animal resource harvesting or horticulture, and possibly even related to ceramic production. The increased preservation extended to paleobotanical remains as well. Samples analyzed by Bush (Chapter 11) include ash and elm wood charcoal (Fraxinus sp. and Ulmus sp.), black walnut nutshell (Juglans nigra), walnut wood charcoal (Juglans sp.), and wood charcoal from the Juglandaceae family (likely walnut or pecan). These confirm the presence of tree species expected in the riparian environment, and while wood can be gathered at any time of the year, it does indicate the seasonal presence of walnuts and possibly pecans at the site. The paleobotanical results are discussed in more detail below. Like earlier periods, phytolith and pollen samples from this component are dominated by cool season short grasses (Cummings, Chapter 13). These results again indicate a moist environment Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 360

dominated by open grassland species including sunflowers, mustards, bull nettle, buckwheat, and goosefoot. Nearby tree species include oak, pine, pecan/hickory, and bois d’arc. Along with the walnut wood identified in paleobotanical samples, this suggests a likely fall season occupation that used the broad mosaic environment with abundant seasonally available resources, including a variety of nut species and cool season greens. Late Prehistoric ceramics were also present. These are coarse, shell-tempered sherds from thick-walled Nocona Plain and Nocona Brushed cooking jars (Perttula, Chapter 9). Investigations at Lake Lewisville sites have shown that shell-tempered ceramics are common in the Late Prehistoric period Henrietta phase (Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring and Yates 1998; Krieger 1946), although few of these are securely dated. Nocona ceramics were first defined at the Harrell site (41YN1), where approximately 98% of the ceramic assemblage is shell tempered plainware (Bell and Brooks 2001; Texas Beyond History 2002). Nocona Plain is distinguished by simple, undecorated vessel forms frequently with thick walls and bases. It has been posited that Nocona Plains wares are likely locally made, although there is some debate whether this is the case, or whether they represent external influence from the Southern Plains or possibly Caddo regions (Crook and Houghston 2015). Ceramics appear at sites within the upper Trinity River basin by at least AD 1000 but are not typically abundant (Perttula et al. 1995; Todd 2014). Shell-tempered Nocona Plain ceramics typically do not appear at any sites in Texas until after AD 1250 (Todd 2014). However, most sites in North Texas with components from this period are not well dated or investigated. The Lake Lewisville sites have age ranges with median probabilities of AD 1307 and 1405 (Perttula, Chapter 9). Interestingly, the Late Prehistoric component from 41DN580 has modeled dates of AD 1200-1250, meaning these Nocona sherds are some of the earliest dated examples of shell-tempered pottery in north-central Texas. Together, the data from the Late Prehistoric component at 41DN580 align closely what Alex Krieger called the Henrietta phase of the Late Prehistoric in the Texas Rolling Plains. The Henrietta phase (sometimes called a focus, complex, or phenomenon) was originally defined as a component at the Harrell site (41YN1) along the Upper Brazos River in Young County, excavated by the WPA in the late 1930s, (Krieger 1946). Sites with Henrietta characteristics seem to cluster tightly along major waterways. They are found in the southernmost plains of Oklahoma south and along the Brazos, upper Trinity, and Red River drainages (Koszarek and Morgan 2017; Krieger 1946). These hunter- horticulturalists lived in small, semi-sedentary villages and traded with Caddo groups to the east, Plains peoples to the north, as well as Southwest cultural region groups to the west (Boyd 1997; Koszarek and Morgan 2017; Krieger 1946; Texas Beyond History 2002). Artifacts characteristic of Henrietta sites include bison bone hoes, bone awls, beveled knives, small arrow points (Fresno, Alba, Perdiz, Scallorn, and others), and Nocona ceramics (Boyd 1997; Koszarek and Morgan 2017; Krieger 1946; Texas Beyond History 2002). The Harrell site assemblage also includes mussel shell beads, shell pendants and adornments, as well as unfinished shell blanks for pendants (Krieger 1946). Although far less abundant, freshwater shell tools are also present at several Henrietta phase sites (Krieger 1946). At the Harrell site for example, there are very few bison bone hoes, but more than 30 mussel shells with heavy use-wear and battering (Dial and Black 2002; Krieger 1946). Krieger (1946:101-106, 138) identified the perforated and hafted shells with this substantial use-wear “hoes,” while unperforated Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 361

but battered or polished shells were called “hand hoes.” The differential use-wear on these two types of hoes suggests that locally available mussel shells were used as expedient tools for a variety of tasks. In sum, the Late Prehistoric component at 41DN580 represents an area of general refuse likely created during a fall season occupation. Occupants of the site discarded the remains of their meals, evidenced by butchered and burned faunal remains, expedient or spent tools of both lithic and shell, and discarded broken ceramic vessels. Materials are weathered and vertebrate faunal remains show evidence of carnivore activity, suggesting these materials were exposed for some time before being completely buried. Additionally, although materials were distributed vertically over roughly 40-50 cm, there was a distinct lens of material with slightly darker, more organic soil that likely represents the occupation surface. The vertical spread of these materials could be accounted for by the clayey nature of the soil and the distinct shrink-swell episodes caused by Texas’ famous wet-dry cycles.

41DN624 Chronological Summary Site 41DN624 shows a remarkable clustering of features and activity areas that are roughly contemporaneous (Figure 15.3). Modeled dates for site occupation indicate there are three periods of occupation (Table 15.2). The first is the “Middle Archaic I” (5900-5600 cal BP) within the Sanger formation; features from this period include 2, 6, 7, and 8. The second, Middle Archaic II occupation dates to about 3700-3500 cal BP and is defined by Features 9-13. The third occupation is dated to the Late Archaic, roughly 2900-2700 cal BP, in the Pilot Point formation. This occupation is represented by Features 3, 4, and 5, which cluster at the southern end of the site area. 41DN624 Middle Archaic I (5900-5600 cal BP) When all the site’s features are divided by period, the Middle Archaic I features are the most widely distributed across the site area. Feature 2 is on the north side of US 377 and is a Category 1 cluster of FCR, which by itself is not remarkable. However, in the units surrounding this feature, there are five flakes, an unusually large number of lithics for such a small feature. These included Edwards and Uvalde cherts, as well as silicified sandstone and chalcedony (Chapter 8). Four of these exhibit use-wear, suggesting they were expedient tools. Additionally, there is oak wood (Quercus sp.) in the flotation sample taken from this feature (Chapter 11). South of US 377, Features 6, 7, and 8 date to the Middle Archaic I. Features 7 and 8 are both Category 2 features; however, Feature 8 has a central, circular depression that puts it on the cusp of a Category 3 small earth oven. Mussel shell from Feature 8 included threeridge, pimpleback, Texas lilliput, and 80 unidentifiable mussel shell pieces (Chapter 11). Notably, the tabular sandstone comprising this feature were discolored only on the bottom faces indicating they were on top of the fire/heat. This suggests these flat stones may be a griddle. Other studies have shown thermal energy is retained and high temperatures reached more quickly if rocks are placed within and above the heating element. Thus, this construction method could have sped the rate or increased the temperature at which foods in this feature were cooked. Feature 7 is also unusual in that it is a small cluster of tabular FCR over a 10 cm deep ashy pit with practically no associated artifacts (these only include one unidentifiable mussel shell fragment). As with Feature 8, this could suggest this feature was a griddle, with the flat rocks placed over the fire. Finally, Feature 6 is a large Category 3 feature constructed almost entirely out of large sandstone slabs. These were notably larger than other features, with many FCR over 10 cm in original size (although many were cracked/fractured in place). As is typical, most of the invertebrate remains were unidentifiable mussel shell, although five threeridge specimens are present. Two flakes with use-wear made of Edwards and Uvalde cherts were recovered near this feature. Table 15.2. Major occupational components at 41DN624. Component Age (cal. BP) Approx.

41DN624 Middle Archaic II (3700-3500 cal BP) Moving into the Pilot Point formation, the second period of occupation was during the late Middle Archaic from about 3700-3500 cal BP (“Middle Archaic II”) and is defined by Features 9-13. These five features are all at basically the same elevation and cluster in an area of about 160 m2. These are interpreted as multiple concurrent activity areas on a single living surface. At the southern end of this cluster is Features 12, a very nice little Category 3 earth oven with a distinct central depression. Carbonized material and burned soil were present throughout the feature, which comprised primarily small pieces of stacked tabular sandstone arranged within a shallow depression. The interspersed nature of the carbon and sandstone again gives us a glimpse into the oven’s construction techniques – the rocks were likely added over time as the fire burned down and more fuel was added. Near this earth oven was a heavily used and refurbished Godley or Trinity point made from Ogallala quartzite. No vertebrate faunal remains and few mussel shells were found near this feature. Feature 13 is about 2.5 m northeast of Feature 12 and comprises a very loose scatter of FCR, three lithics, and 31 freshwater mussel shell fragments (unidentifiable Unionidae). Lithic artifacts include a modified Uvalde chert flake with some use-wear, as well as a heavily refurbished Darl point of Edwards chert, and a heavily used projectile point, also made of Edwards chert, that is fragmentary and thus untyped. In the center of this activity area are Features 10 and 11. This area has the largest concentration of lithic material at the site, comprising 54 pieces, 35 of which have signs of use-wear. One point was recovered from this area – a Godley point on made from course-grained Uvalde Gravel chert; use- wear also indicates the point was used as a scraper and is heavily refurbished. Of these 54 lithics, 36 are identifiable as Edwards chert and two are Uvalde chert (Chapter 8). This distribution could suggest a preference for high-quality but distant lithic sources over poorer quality but more readily available local Uvalde chert, and/or could likewise imply high mobility over large territory that includes much of central Texas. Faunal remains are fairly well preserved in this area. Within this context, there are 58 faunal specimens representing medium/medium-large mammals, and 125 mussel shell specimens (13 threeridge, six Texas lilliput, and 106 unidentifiable Unionidae). Additionally, this area produced a single large tabular piece of sandstone that may be a metate. Together, this data may indicate that food-production and associated tasks in support of those happening at Features 9 and 12 took place here. This does not seem to represent the same kind of discard area seen in the Late Prehistoric component at 41DN580. At the northern end of the site and the Middle Archaic I activity area is Feature 9, which is unlike any other feature documented at the site. It does not exhibit the characteristic features of an earth oven, nor does it resemble the small scatters of FCR seen elsewhere at the site. All the stones from Feature 9 are on a single, flat surface, there is little to no soil staining, no carbonized organic matter, and no indication of a pit or depression. The rocks themselves are mostly rounded or angular, instead of tabular, like those in the earth oven features at site 41DN624. Simultaneously, however, this feature is about 130 cm in diameter, broader than other features at the site, with several small clusters (possibly rake-out piles) and a diffuse scatter of FCR extending outward around the feature. Together, the area around Features 9-13 represents multiple activities of the same camp/occupation. Features 9 and 12 were likely used for slow-cooking various foodstuffs, although Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 366

given their differences in form and construction it is possible these features were used for cooking different types of foods. Between these, Features 10 and 11 represent an activity area where additional food preparation and other support activities were taking place. More than any other component at either site explored here, this area gives us a fuller picture of food-related strategies and possibly group size and mobility. 41DN624 Late Archaic (2900-2700 cal BP) Finally, the third and final occupation of 41DN624 occurred during the Late Archaic (roughly 2900-2700 cal BP). This occupation in the Pilot Point formation is represented by Features 3, 4, and 5, which cluster in an area of about 65 m2 near the southern end of the site and are at the same elevation. Feature 5 is a small Category 1 scatter of FCR with no notable associated material. It is about 8 m west of Feature 4, and 10 m west-northwest of Feature 3. Feature 4 is a Category 2 feature associated with unidentifiable mussel shells, large/medium-large mammal bone, and a single heavily used scraper made from Edwards chert. About 8 m to the south is the large Feature 3, a Category 3 earth oven and its associated materials. This is one of the largest features encountered during excavations, and its associated material includes unidentifiable mussel shell fragments, 76 mammal bone fragments scattered in and around it (including deer and Artiodactyl), and a heavily used bifacial tool with indications of battering/crushing activities made of Edwards chert. While unburnt, more than half of the vertebrate remains from this feature exhibit carnivore modification, which may suggest the presence of domesticated dogs (see Chapter 10). Additionally, hardwood was identified in the flotation light fraction samples collected from Feature 3 (Chapter 12). Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 367

Review of Research Questions and Findings The research objectives in the study of sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 were structured around first identifying chronology and major periods of use/occupation. Based on the sites’ chronology, Acacia hoped to compare differences in site content to better understand the context of these sites within the wider north-central Texas region. Acacia also proposed higher order research questions that sought to identify foraging and resource use strategies through the archeological record. If the record did reflect specific behavior adaptations could group size, mobility, and/or territory size be inferred? And how might they have changed over time? Below, we discuss these research questions and our findings in more detail. Research Issue 1: Foraging Strategies, Seasonality, and Site Reuse Acacia postulated that the data from sties 41DN580 and 41DN624 could show how Indigenous peoples of the region were using the landscape and its resources during the periods of site occupation. The presence of thermal features across both sites indicates sporadic, but repeated occupation of the area over roughly five thousand years, suggesting these were, in some respect, persistent places on the landscape. While palaeobotanical data from these sites was not as abundant as we would have hoped, we draw on several lines of evidence to discuss environmental conditions and possible associated foraging strategies. Riparian areas like Hickory Creek tend to promote woodland growth along their margins (i.e., riparian forest buffers) that may encourage a more diverse environmental mosaic. Given how sites in north-central Texas tend to cluster significantly along major drainages, these woodland riparian corridor environments were likely ideal locations for Indigenous groups, as they offered a wider breadth of resources and foraging opportunities than less diverse environments. Presumably, these areas and their resources could also buffer (to some degree) site occupants against climactic and environmental shifts that may have more dramatic impacts outside of riparian buffer zones. Paleobotanical (macrobotanicals, carbonized remains, and flotation samples) and pollen/phytolith data from most analyzed contexts were limited, primarily confirming common species within riparian and woodland areas (Chapters 11 and 12). At 41DN580, Late Prehistoric organic remains include elm, ash, black walnut wood and nutshell, as well as walnut or pecan (Juglandaceae) wood charcoal. Black walnut (Juglans nigra) grows well near waterways, as do related species of pecan and hickory (Juglandaceae). Pecan, hickory, and black walnut nuts become ripe in the fall, and in addition to a food source, the black walnut nutshell can be used to create a dark dye or stain. The black walnut shell could indicate that this occupation took place during the fall months. Ash and elm wood were also found in this component and are common species in woodland areas. As these are wood fragments from trees that do not produce edible resources, the presence of these trees does not add any additional information on seasonality (as wood resources can be gathered and used at any time of the year), although it does confirm these species were present during the Late Prehistoric period along the creek. Pollen from analyzed samples supports the presence of hickory/pecan, bois d’arc, pine, and oak trees in the immediate vicinity (Chapter 13). These samples Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 369

further indicate the presence of short, cool season grasses and other open area forbs and edible plants. Together, these data all point to a fall occupation of the site in the Late Prehistoric period. Moving earlier into the site’s occupational history, 41DN580 Middle Archaic II (4000-3800 cal BP) palaeobotanical remains of chenopod seeds from Features 3 and 6 possibly indicate a late summer or fall occupation (Chapter 11). Goosefoot (Chenopodium sp.) typically emerges in the spring and drops seeds in the late summer to early fall; it is very hearty, spreading easily but preferring nearly full sun, suggesting a relatively open habitat. The leaves can be eaten at any time of the year, although new growth leaves are preferable because of their milder taste. Nonetheless, it is difficult to tell if this was the primary foodstuff being processed in the feature, or if it was possibly part of the packing/wrapping materials for the food load (e.g., McAuliffe et al. 2023). The final identifiable palaeobotanical sample from 41DN580 is dewberry cane Feature 5 (Middle Archaic I, 5000-4800 cal BP). While the berries are typically ripe in late spring to early summer, the cane can be harvested at nearly any time of year for use in fiber crafts. The remaining palaeobotanical specimens from the site were either indeterminate carbonized botanicals, or unidentifiable wood charcoal flecks. Paylonological data from the Middle Archaic I period is dominated by low, cool season grasses as well as members of the sunflower family, and marshelder or related plants (Chapter 13). Tree pollen reflects the presence of oak, hickory/pecan, juniper, bois d’arc, and pine trees. The pollen and phytoliths thus suggest a likely fall or early spring occupation. In either season, there would have been abundant plant life in the riparian corridor. At 41DN624, the paleobotanical remains were much more limited, with only carbonized oak wood (Quercus sp.) being identifiable beyond indeterminate hardwood (Chapter 11). Although no edible plant material was recovered, the presence of oak again tells us these trees were present near the creek during the Middle Archaic and implies the seasonal availability of acorns in the fall. Although more specific data from this site is not available, given the consistency of species appearing in samples from 41DN580 over time and the sites’ proximity to each other, it is very likely that similar plant species are present at 41DN624. Faunal material likewise shows people at the sites were utilizing both riverine and terrestrial resources. Identified species include white-tailed deer, mule deer, American beaver, and box turtle, as well as mussel shells of threeridge, yellow sandshell, bankclimber, bleufer, and Texas lilliput varieties. These species are widely available and not seasonally dependent. This leaves the 41DN580 paleobotanical and pollen/phytolith samples the best evidence we have pertaining seasonality. These data suggest that the 41DN580 Middle Archaic peoples occupied the site in the late summer to fall, while the Late Prehistoric occupation may have taken place in the fall to winter months. As for foraging strategies, inhabitants appear to have been accessing a wide range of riverine and terrestrial resources from the mixed riparian/woodland/grassland environment along Hickory Creek. An interesting datapoint is the lack of faunal remains that can be securely identified as bison. While local scale bison population density would vary considerably over time, at the larger regional scale, evidence indicates that bison populations increase when grasslands expand (e.g., Kemp 2008; Lohse et al. 2014a). This absence could be caused by poor preservation of vertebrate faunal material, especially during the Archaic period occupations. Faunal remains in the “large mammal” category may well be bison bone that is too fragmented or deteriorated to confidently identify. However, Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 370

arguments based on preservation do not hold as well for the Late Prehistoric component at 41DN580. Given the level of good preservation and the species diversity within the Late Prehistoric assemblage, we surmise that bison would appear in the assemblage if they were a focus for site occupants. Therefore, we argue that the faunal assemblage’s absence of bison indicates a broad subsistence strategy focused on the mosaic of arboreal-grassland and riverine resources that did not inlcude not bison hunting. Cook-Stone Technology Paleoenvironmental data show multiple climatic changes between the Middle Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. These climatic changes would have influenced resource availability and therefore foraging strategies over the long term. Regional environmental data suggest that the environment during the Late Pleistocene was a predominantly arboreal environment with an increase in grassland and mixed arboreal and grassland environments through the Holocene (Lawrence and Eyeington, Chapter 7; Bousman 1998; Mandel et al. 2007; Meier et al. 2014; Nordt et al. 2002; Toomey 1993; Waters et al. 2021). As presented by Lawrence and Eyeington (Chapter 7), comparing these data with the Greenland ice core temperature data, site occupation within the Sanger alloformation correspond to periods of warmer global temperatures, as well as the expansion of grasslands. Occupation within the Pilot Point-West Fork alloformation from roughly 4000-2700 BP corresponds to a cooler period globally, when arboreal cover likely increased. The Late Prehistoric occupation took place during the Little Ice Age, when global temperatures cooled, and climactic shifts became unpredictable (Chapter 7). Geoarchaeological data from 41DN580 and 41DN624 mirror the global data, indicating increasing C4 (warmer grassland environment) throughout the Archaic deposits and then increasing C3 (cooler, more arboreal environment) within the last 300–500 years (Chapter 7). These climactic changes would have influenced local environmental conditions as well as some human behaviors. It is possible that earth-oven baking was a regionally specialized technological response that allowed local populations to intensify resource extraction and withstand long-term environmental changes. Although there is comparatively little data on Early Archaic (and earlier) populations in north- central Texas, regional populations are typically assumed to be smaller and ranging over larger territories based on site frequency and material source distribution. Populations likely increased through the Middle Archaic, and by the Late Archaic larger populations were living in smaller, more defined territories than in previous periods. This is supported by the increased number of Middle and especially Late Archaic sites, their typical locations along major waterways, and the increased reliance on local resources and increasing scarcity of nonlocal materials (lithic sources in particular). Additionally, regardless of local environment, earth oven density increases over time (Thoms 2023). Therefore, we can surmise that earth ovens indicate changes in resource use/extraction that reciprocally reinforced established trends in population growth and subsequently more intensive land use (e.g., more intensive site use and increased rates of site reoccupation over time) (Black and Creel 1997:302; Collins 2004; Dering 1999; Koenig and Miller 2023; Mauldin and Nickels 2001, 2003; Miller and Graves 2011; Thoms 2008, 2023; Vierra 2005; Willey and Phillips 1958). In other words, earth ovens allowed Archaic peoples to adapt to changing environmental, demographic, and social/political environments by increasing the breadth of potentially usable resources. In north-central Texas, Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 371

riparian mosaic environments would be ideal locations for this kind of intensification, as the diversity of localized resources would have been greater and, presumably, would more easily support larger social groups and regional populations. Binford (2001) and others (see Freeman et al. 2023; Johnson and Hard 2008) have suggested that hunter-foragers intensify resource use in a given region only if (other things beings equal) their mobility and residential options are constrained. Additionally, a recent study by Freeman et al. (2023) shows that for several Texas regions, social organization and resource extraction methods have more of an impact on a region’s population and carrying capacity than climactic predicters of ecosystem productivity. If these hypotheses hold for north-central Texas, we anticipate both resource and land use intensification at the same time as we see increased population growth. Earth oven plant processing was likely a strategy for resource intensification supporting demographic increases in lieu of the domesticates or horticultural intensification we see in other regions (Black and Creel 1997:302; Dering 1999; Koenig and Miller 2023; Thoms 2008). At the Hickory Creek sites, this pattern may hold true for the Early to Middle Archaic transition, when earth ovens and cook stone technologies appear, but the pattern and intensity of land use appears consistent from the Middle through the Late Archaic periods. It is in the Late Prehistoric period that there are substantive changes in land use and cultural practices. Earth ovens are often interpreted only in the sense of food processing, but if we move away from sole environmental considerations, ethnographic examples indicate the social interactions that necessitate and facilitate the use of these features are more significant in than the thing being processed. Much research of cook-stone technology and associated environmental factors in Texas has focused on the extremely large earth ovens or burned rock middens from central and western regions of the state. Large earth ovens are often associated with feasting activities or large-scale arid environment carbohydrate production (see Fish 2023; Koenig and Miller 2023; Thoms 2023). Similarly, burned rock middens are large-scale group activities repeated over generations that often form large mounds. However, the features documented during this project are substantially smaller, arguably family-size ovens (see McAuliffe et al. 2023; Thoms 2023). Thus, while we may not see the exact type of large communal organization that is present in other regions, the Hickory Creek sites have multiple but comparatively small features during every occupation, as well as several defined activity areas nearby. This suggests there were likely small groups occupying the sites at any given time, having some communal food production and activity areas (e.g., see discussion of 41DN624 Features 9-13). Although sometimes used to roast meats/proteins or occasionally ferment alcoholic beverages, cross-culturally earth ovens are most frequently used to process carbohydrate-rich plant foods (Thoms 2023). Although our evidence suggests many features at 41DN580 and 41DN624 were used for animals and riverine resources (mussels, beavers, turtles), in this region of Texas earth ovens are typically interpreted as facilities to roast onion or camas bulbs, arrowhead tubers, or spatterdock rhizomes, geophytes that would have benefitted from long earth oven cooking. The site furniture (i.e., hearths) typically provides the structure around which other camp activities and facilities are organized (Stevenson 1991:277). Where these earth ovens occur simultaneously with other smaller features and activity areas in the near vicinity, we suggest that these represent the remains of activities that would have taken place during the roasting process. In other words, while the earth oven was Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 372

baking whatever foodstuffs were available, the group in camp would engage in a suite of other activities including meals, resource procurement and processing, tool refurbishing, and other social activities. If we take 41DN624 Features 9-13 as an example, there are two ovens roughly 20 m apart with a smaller FCR feature and substantial activity area in the center. These are at elevations between 172.2 and 171.99 m amsl and could represent a single occupation. If true, this may indicate ovens were constructed on the edge of camps, or at least the edge of defined activity areas, where they could be easily accessed and maintained during their likely long burn times. Interestingly too, these features are of vastly different sizes and constructions, suggesting they were used to cook different types of foodstuffs and would possibly have facilitated different types of social interactions and associated activities. In sum, we believe the data collected from 41DN580 and 41DN624 show the increasing intensity of riparian-woodland resource use over time, and that these mosaic environments created persistent places on the landscape as populations increased and territories shrank. These mosaic environments likewise supported multiple hunter-forager strategies allowed Indigenous peoples to adapt to changing sociopolitical and environmental conditions through time. And while we cannot definitively determine site seasonality based on the current data, palaeobotanical and pollen/phytolith remains possibly suggest fall occupations, although there would certainly be a diversity of resources in these areas year-round. Research Issue 2: Group Size and Mobility Acacia’s second research issue concerned group size, and if sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 represent short-term seasonal camps or longer-duration basecamps. We asked if the data could indicate the size of the groups occupying these sites, and what their possible range of mobility was. This topic was touched on in the previous section as it relates to site reuse and foraging strategies. Overall, it is not clear if features from each major component at 41DN580 and 41DN624 are contemporaneous with each other (i.e., multiple features representing a single occupation), or whether they represent multiple occupation events that occurred over a span of several hundred years (see Tables 15.1-15.2). Even a few centimeters of vertical separation could indicate a temporal separation of a few hundred years based on modeled sedimentation rates by Lawrence and Eyeington (Chapter 7). On the other hand, small natural changes in the ancient topography would also account for some of these smaller differences in elevation between some features. For example, at 41DN580 Features 5 and 8, which are separated by more than 65 m in distance yet are mapped with a 2 cm difference in elevation and returned very similar radiocarbon dates - 4450 ± 30 and 4470 ± 30 BP, respectively. There is a chance that these features were utilized concurrently between 4440 and 4480 BP, or on the outside they could represent occupations separated by 80 years or more (at least two generations). These minute changes in possible timing of individual features could therefore have profound impacts on estimates of group size. There have been numerous studies that estimate group size based on the number of hearths, the calories produced by a particular type of resource cooked in a particular type of earth oven/FCR feature, ethnographic analogies of average hunter-forager group size, etc. However, none of these Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 373

models are quite comparable with the data collected for the two sites described in this study. Furthermore, the current lack of understanding about what foodstuffs were actually being processed in these features (beyond freshwater mussels) precludes use of many previously published models. What we can say is that even if all features from a given period were used contemporaneously, these were small social groups that likely fall at or below the average 20 to 25-person hunter-forager group size. Looking at group mobility, we can say with some certainty that none of the occupations documented at either site represent permanent or long-term settlements. The paucity of artifacts as well as the lack of middens and evidence indicating feature reuse (especially of the larger earth ovens) indicates these were temporary camps, likely occupied only for very short durations. While it is possible such evidence may exist outside the current project area at the site, currently, neither site provides enough evidence to show that they are gathering places for larger social groups or for long durations. Across 41DN580 and 41DN624, the relatively low quantities of cultural materials may be partially attributed to taphonomic processes. While the local scarcity of high-quality lithic raw materials and long-term reuse and curation of tools may largely explain their paucity in the assemblage (Ayala and Pontillo, Chapter 8), the substantial presence of thermal features but lack of organic remains (i.e., faunal bone, carbonized plant material, etc.) could be caused by the slower rates of sediment accumulation (Lawrence and Eyeington, Chapter 7; Colvin 2013; Ferring 1986). Lawrence and Eyeington report in Chapter 7 that, on average, sedimentation rates at both sites are markedly lower than at other documented sites across the region. Slow sedimentation rates would have left site areas exposed for longer periods of time, decreasing the amount of organic preservation. This corresponds well with the results of Ramsey, Jacobson, and Haliburton’s faunal analysis presented in Chapter 10, which showed extremely high rates of weathering and breakage/fragmentation of the vertebrate remains, as well as several instances of notable carnivore gnawing and modification. The activity patterns at both sites examined here support the work Ferring and Yates (1997, 1998) undertook at Lakes Lewisville and Ray Roberts, where they suggested that Archaic period sites comprising multiple small thermal features but limited lithic and faunal assemblages reflect highly mobile groups whose foraging strategies relied on the local diversity of riparian, patchy woodland, and prairie ecozones. Ferring and Yates (1998) also hypothesized that this characteristic site expression was concentrated along major drainages and may indicate short stop-over points on longer seasonal rounds. Data from 41DN580 and 41DN624 corroborate these interpretations and may suggest this area was occupied primarily in the fall months. Moreover, Ferring and Yates (1997, 1998) examined Late Prehistoric components at several sites to suggest that in the later periods of prehistory, the presence/absence of ceramic materials could indicate not only the duration of site occupation, but also gendered economic activities. They suggest it is possible that the presence of ceramics at the two sites could indicate not only larger group sizes, but also potentially suggests that the group was not a male-only hunting party (Ferring and Yates 1998). Non-local lithics provide evidence for the range of group mobility, or at the very least the extent of their trade networks.

south of the project area, and novaculite (Nova chert) is found in Arkansas and parts of Oklahoma, while quartzite is found locally in the Uvalde Gravels washed out in streams and riverbeds. Of the 64 lithics from Middle Archaic components across both sites, 50 were identified as Edwards chert (78%), Late Archaic ratios are similar although the sample is much smaller, five Edwards and only three Uvalde examples (62.5% Edwards). By the Late Prehistoric, however, this ratio had shifted dramatically. In that component, of the 102 lithics recovered, only 14 are Edwards (13.7%) while most of the remainder are sourced from Uvalde gravels. The lithic evidence, combined with other data points (shell tool and ceramic use, for instance), signals a notable change in Indigenous behavior, the resource optimization of, and relationship to the Hickory Creek landscape in the Late Prehistoric period. Research Issue 3: Site Changes Through Time Based on the data and interpretations outlined above, Acacia was interested if and how these cultural patterns changed over time. There was no evidence of Early Archaic occupation at either site, yet throughout the Middle Archaic, a period lasting about 2,000 years, significant and repeated occupations spring up across the floodplains. These sites are occupied sporadically over several thousand years with relatively little cultural or environmental change evidenced in the recovered material record. However, there is a significant shift from the Archaic into the Late Prehistoric period that, aided by better preservation, shows changing technologies but continued use of the riparian- woodland environmental mosaic resources. Additionally, there are several datapoints that stand out and are explored below. First, at site 41DN580 all the roughly datable Category 1 feature scatters of FCR are from the earlier Middle Archaic I (5000-4800 cal BP) occupation. Later occupations at this site and 41DN624 have a more balanced distribution of feature types. If Acacia’s experimental data and interpretations hold, this could suggest more of a focus on stone-boiling in the Middle Archaic shifting to an increased use of earth ovens in later periods. In addition, out of all 29 features examined at both sites, Middle Archaic 41DN580 Feature 16 and 41DN624 Feature 6 (both Category 3) bear striking resemblance to each other and are dissimilar in construction to most later earth ovens. These are relatively shallow pits lined with very large, tabular pieces of sandstone, unlike the later features which are generally made with more densely stacked mounds of rock. These are the only two features excavated whose larger flat stones could be interpreted as griddles, in addition to the central depression that could of course be used to roast other foodstuffs. When combined with the lack of vertebrate faunal remains could also plausibly indicate a different resource-focus of the people occupying the sites in the earlier parts of the Middle Archaic. During the Middle Archaic II periods at either site, Acacia uncovered not just features but also notable activity areas. These are represented by Features 10, 11, and 13 at site 41DN624 and in Units 69-80 at 41DN580. Each of these activity areas comprises a notable number of lithics, scatters of mussel shell, and some faunal material, while thermal features are set away from these areas. Faunal materials recovered from these areas also show more evidence of carnivore modification on faunal bone than other parts of the sties, suggesting these areas were left open to scavengers for longer periods of time, (Ramsey, Jacobson, and Haliburton Chapter 10). Similar activity areas are not present in either earlier Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 375

or later components at either site. This could suggest several possible behavioral changes, including that the groups occupying the sites were at these locations for longer periods of time and so defined activity areas were more necessary, and/or that the types of activities taking place were more intensive and therefore left more of an archeological signature. It could also be that similar activity areas are present in other periods but are outside of our current right-of-way and so remain unidentified. The most dramatic change at either site is between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. Not only does the material record become more abundant, but the types of technologies represented also change. The lithic materials indicate the greatest change. First, the lithic points recovered show the shift in technologies from the larger dart points of earlier period to the smaller arrow points. Moreover, the ratio of local to non-local lithic source material significantly shifted. Across the Archaic period assemblages, nearly 80% of the lithics recovered come from Edwards Plateau chert. This could simultaneously indicate that people during this period had wide ranging exchange networks and likely were highly mobile across the whole region. By the Late Prehistoric, that ratio had shifted to only 14% non-local material, which we interpret to represent a significant decrease in mobility and territory size, while maintaining at least some trade relationships. Additionally, these Late Prehistoric lithic tools exhibit a notable amount of refurbishing and retouching, some have use-wear that suggests their function changed during their use life (Ayala and Pontillo, Chapter 8). The types of faunal materials in the Archaic and Late Prehistoric components are broadly similar, although the preservation rates are drastically different. Beyond being able to better reconstruct the Late Prehistoric environment and identify likely food sources, faunal materials also show a variety of tools used by site occupants. These include a partial bone needle, mussel shells possibly used as hoes or other tools, and ceramics. While possibly a result of preservation bias, this change in the material record could also indicate an intensity of site occupation – in either longevity or group size – and an increase in the types of activities taking place not seen in earlier periods. Additionally, the geoarcheological data generally show consistent, slow rates of deposition at both sites during the periods of known occupation (Lawrence and Eyeington, Chapter 7). At site 41DN580, deposition rates for the oldest Zones VI and V (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons) encompassing Features 5, 8, and possibly Features 15–17 roughly ~5000–4800 BP is between 2.4 and 3.7 cm per 100 years. Zone IV (Bk1 horizon) encompassing Feature 3 and possibly Features 4–6 at roughly ~4000– 3800 BP has a higher deposition rate of 5.2 cm per 100 years. Finally, the most recent prehistoric occupation in the partially truncated Zone II (A horizon) encompassing Feature 14 at roughly ~750– 700 BP has an average sedimentation rate of 4.4 cm per 100 years. Moreover, stable carbon isotope (δ13C) analyses suggest that at the base of the excavations in the Bk2 and Bk3 horizons, the environment for the site was mixed grassland and arboreal. After that, the C4 biomass increased with more dominant grasslands until the upper A horizon. From the A horizon to the surface, the C4 biomass decreased and was returning to a mixed grassland and arboreal environment. Thus, most of the site’s occupation took place during a period of mixed grassland and arboreal environment with moderate deposition rates. Similarly at site 41DN624, occupation in the oldest in Zone IV (Bk2 horizon), encompassing Features 6–8 between ~5900–5600 BP, and Zone IV (Bk1 horizon) encompassed by Feature 12 and possibly Features 9 and 10 between ~3700–3500 BP, deposition rates averaged 1.7 cm per 100 years. In Zone III, Feature 3 and possibly Features 4–6 at roughly ~2900–2700 Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 376

BP, deposition rates averaged 7 cm per 100 years. This is a significant increase from previous periods of occupation. Environmentally, although fluctuating, stable carbon isotope (δ13C) data suggest that the environment for 41DN624 has been predominantly composed of C4 biomass with grasslands. Within the lower Btk horizon and overlying Bk2 horizon, the δ13C values show decreasing C4 biomass and the environment was approaching mixed grassland and arboreal for periods of time. Similar to 41DN580, the uppermost A horizon to the surface had decreasing C4 biomass and was returning to a mixed grassland and arboreal environment. Together, these data broadly suggest a relatively stable and predictable local environment over the long term, potentially leading to the area’s reoccupation over time (Lawrence and Eyeington, Chapter 7). Overall, our data suggest that the broad patterns of Archaic life along Hickory Creek were relatively stable. Despite discrepancies in preservation, the data show relatively small changes over time. While specific resource availability and use may have varied over time, the people occupying the sites through time focused on riparian-woodland mosaic resources, many of which benefit from long cooking in earth ovens, bringing with them heavily utilized tools from high-quality sources mostly from areas farther south. These lifeways persisted until the Late Prehistoric period, when widespread technological changes precipitated changes at the local level as well. Research Issue 4: Regional Interactions and the Henrietta focus This study posits that for much of the Archaic period, Indigenous peoples used the Hickory Creek waterway in their seasonal migration corridor, stopping along its banks for short periods of time to gather mussels, hunt deer and other animals, and possibly collect edible plants before moving on to camps elsewhere. The people who stopped at sites 41DN580, 41DN624, and other sites traveled in small groups, likely not more than 20 people. A preponderance of lithic artifacts on Edwards chert suggests that central Texas was regularly within their seasonal rounds, but it is not entirely clear how far north, west, and east they ranged. This mobile hunting and foraging strategy, based on optimizing the use of resources, was widespread across the Southern Plains and throughout Texas during the period from ca. 5900-3500 BP. What’s more, data from sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 suggest the pattern of land use along Hickory Creek changed very little between ca. 5900 BP and 2700 BP. The Late Prehistoric component at site 51DN580, however, offers a glimpse into a marked shift in behavior, social organization, and regional interactions. This time was one of tremendous social change in North America, reflected by highly visible technological changes, such as the introduction of the bow and arrow, pottery, and incipient horticulture. During the period overlapping the Late Prehistoric component at 41DN580, ca. 700-800 BP, peoples west, north, and east of what is today north-central Texas were already less mobile. Native groups were beginning to settle more permanently in hamlets or small villages and these often articulated with larger regional centers. Pottery was becoming more common, particularly among the Caddo to the east, coastal groups to the south, and the Puebloan/Mogollon peoples to the west. Many of these same peoples had begun to practice some form of farming, or at the very least, horticulture. Social organization was becoming more complex and territorial, evidenced by ceremonial centers and larger cemeteries. All this was happening even as the peoples across much of Texas, particularly north-central, central, and south Texas, still practiced a seasonally mobile hunting and gathering lifestyle and even as ranging Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 377

territories seemingly diminished in size (Figure 15.4). Within this dynamic social landscape, previously established patterns for mobility and regional interactions also began to shift. Figure 15.4. Social spheres surrounding site 41DN580 ca. AD 1200. As already discussed, the 41DN580 Late Prehistoric component assemblage compares favorably to the Henrietta focus component at the Harrell site, located approximately 90 miles west. However, there are important differences. First, it is clear the Harrell Site was much more intensively used, and by larger groups than the people who camped at 41DN580. Not only were features and debris of all types more abundant at the Harrell Site, but that site also has a cemetery, which is not present within the investigated portion of 41DN580. While there is evidence of horticulture and longer-term settlement at the Harrell site, there are none of those elements at 41DN580, again, at least in the portion of it that we investigated. Side notched arrow points, notably Harrell and Washita points, are also absent. What we do have at 41DN580 are abundant faunal remains, shell-tempered Nocona plain ceramics, stemmed arrow points such as Alba and others, a fragment of what appears to be a bone needle or awl, and modified mussel shell and shell tools that were probably used for digging, scraping, polishing, scooping, woodworking, and leatherworking.

is very rarely documented in the archeological literature of north-central Texas. The best comparisons within Texas are found at coastal and mortuary sites, although outside of Texas there is comparative data from similar age Mississippian period sites along the Missouri, Mississippi, and Illinois River basins hundreds of miles north/northeast of site 41DN580 (Lamb 2011; McLeester 2019). With respect to mussel shell tools, the Harrell site offers the best regional comparison to 41DN580. Unfortunately, the Harrell Site is not well-dated, nor is Krieger’s (1948) Henrietta focus well- defined. There are scant other investigated sites attributed to the elusive Henrietta focus. Other sites believed to have Henrietta focus components include 41TR56 (Tarrant County), 41SE300 (Stephens County), 41TH26 (Throckmorton County), 41DY13 (Donley County), 41YN23 (Young County), and a handful of sites in Clay County, nearly all of them recorded in the 1950s and 60s and not revisited in recent years. Most of these sites have human burials and Harrell or Washita points associated with them along with a wide variety of other arrow point styles. Krieger estimated the Henrietta focus spanned from about AD 1200-1400 and believed it to be related to early Plains Villager cultures north of Red River. He based these interpretations on evidence for early horticulture and similarities in assemblages, notably side-notched arrow points and Nocona Plain ceramics, which are abundant on Paoli and Washita River Phase Plains Villager sites of Oklahoma (Drass 1998; Ellis et al. 2015). In terms of geographic extent, Krieger drew the Henrietta focus boundary to include Upper Trinity River Basin, which would include the Hickory Creek watershed. If the upper component at site 41DN580 can be considered within the Henrietta focus tradition, then it is not the type of permanent settlement Krieger and others used as their prototype. Rather, it is more of a short-term encampment at the eastern margin of what we understand to be Henrietta’s extent. Significantly, our dates for site 41DN580 are about 200 years earlier than Krieger estimated the Henrietta focus to be, with about AD 1200 being the upper end of 41DN580’s occupation. So where then does 41DN580 fit in? The site’s shell-tempered Nocona Plain ceramics place it squarely within a shared north Texas/Oklahoma Plains sphere of interaction not shared by the cultures elsewhere in Texas in that same time period. Although Caddo potters east of the Upper Trinity drainage basin already had an advanced ceramic tradition, shell tempering is not common in the Caddo region until after AD 1400 (Drass 1998; Ellis et al. 2015; Perttula, Chapter 9). Meanwhile modified shell tools and adornments can possibly be linked to sites like the Harrell site, sites of the upper Midwest, and possibly sites along the Gulf Coast. Lithic tools also suggest a changing sphere of interaction through time. While Edwards chert from south in central Texas dominates the Middle Archaic assemblages at sites 41DN580 and 41DN624, the Late Prehistoric component reflects a different procurement strategy of local and Red River drainage basin sources. Put simply, whether site 41DN580 can be included in the Henrietta phase paradigm or not, it is evident that the dominant sphere of interaction for its inhabitants derived from regions north, as opposed to regions south in central Texas. This is not too different from what Krieger theorized following excavations at the Harrell Site (Texas Beyond History), although his timing of Henrietta Phase culture expressions may require some rethinking. Data from Site 41DN590 suggest this shift in influence may have begun by AD 1200 and possibly earlier, if dates from 41DN580 are reliable. Ultimately, more data from other sites are needed to better understand shifting spheres of influence in the Texas Late Prehistoric period. However, the preliminary implications from the data Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 379

set at 41DN580 offers tantalizing new directions for understanding origins, regional interactions, trade, and social connections that have eluded researchers for many years, particularly in regard to central and north-central Texas.

16. R R D EASSESSING THE ESEARCH ESIGN Summary of Interpretations Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 are considered eligible for listing as SAL and in the NRHP. Acacia implemented a data recovery plan at both sites. The THC concurred in December 2021 and February of 2022 that these field efforts mitigated the project’s effects within the Hickory Creek Interceptor ROW. Any future projects that could impact either site outside of the current project area warrant further consideration to assess the possibility of additional contributing components. With these considerations, no further fieldwork is recommended or warranted. The testing and data recovery investigations at 41DN580 and 41DN624 sought to address site chronologies and reuse over time, environmental conditions and adaptive strategies, group size, and mobility patterns. These efforts found that both are multicomponent sites. 41DN580 has intact stratified components that date to the Middle Archaic as well as the Late Prehistoric period, while stratified components at site 41DN624 represent occupations from the Middle and Late Archaic periods. One contribution of this work has been to present new archeological data from north-central Texas on the period ranging from 5900-3700 BP, what is generally considered to be the Middle Archaic period. Previously, only two sites with components from this period had been excavated or reported, and the data from those components were neither extensive, nor were they truly separatable from discussions of older and younger components. Until excavations at 41DN580 and 41DN624, the Middle Archaic period was essentially missing from the north-central Texas record. For this reason alone, the data presented here for sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 represent a comparative record not previously available to researchers. Further, the Late Prehistoric component at 41DN580 containing ceramics and shell tools offers new data of another kind. It was found only during data recovery excavations—as a complete surprise to investigators. Consideration of this component was not accounted for in the research design prepared for this project as it was not identified during previous efforts. Nonetheless, this component not only provides key comparative data presented in this report, but also offers a critical launchpad for new avenues of analysis and study. Most notably, the component describes an important and understudied data set – modified mussel shells – and offers new insights into regional spheres of interaction among Late Prehistoric periods in north-central Texas. The variety of features from sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 indicates multiple types of hot-rock cooking activities from stone boiling to long baking in earth ovens. People collected resources for these activities locally from the adjacent creek beds and surrounding mosaic environment. The lithic tool assemblage shows interregional mobility across the state was high during the Archaic period. Further, feature data indicates these groups were likely small and did not stay on these sites very long. During their stays they accessed both riverine and terrestrial resources, possibly during the late summer or fall season. In the aggregate, data from these sites further support existing hypotheses that suggest the Trinity River basin of north-central Texas was a thoroughfare for small bands of highly mobile people who returned seasonally and repeatedly to certain locales that offered a mixed woodland and Testing and Data Recovery of Sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 381

grassland mosaic for hunting and gathering of plant and faunal resources. Notably, data from 41DN580 and 41DN624 reflect that the general pattern of mobility, group size, and resource use likely remained consistent throughout the Archaic period. Although the sites do demonstrate a slightly increased number of features and size of the artifact assemblage through time during the Archaic period, given preservation issues and other site formation processes, it may not be possible to identify clear changes in land use, group mobility, and resource procurement during this period. On the other hand, organic preservation issues aside, there is some clear evidence that a significant change in land and resource use patterns occurred during the Late Prehistoric period, around 800 BP. More locally sourced lithic materials from the Late Prehistoric component at 41DN580 suggest decreasing mobility. This is reinforced by the presence of shell-tempered Nacona Plain and Nacona Brushed pottery, which is found throughout the Trinity, Brazos, and Red River basins. Although shell-tempered Nacona ceramics – when first identified at the Harrell site in Young County – were originally thought to be the product of Southern Plains trade form the north and west, there is recent evidence that strongly suggests these ceramics were manufactured locally (Crook and Houghston 2015). At site 41DN580, shell tools and a single polished bone tool, likely a needle or awl, also suggest the people who encamped here had a broad toolkit. In short, a wider range of activities took place at site 41DN580 in the Late Prehistoric period than during any of the Archaic period occupations. Congregations may have focused less on processing foods and resources in earth ovens and griddles during short-term encampments, and more on processing and/or storing resources in pots, cooking atop a fire, and possibly even ceramic manufacture. This assemblage suggests that people who stopped in the Late Prehistoric engaged in a more generalized provisioning and range of activities while there. Unfortunately, we simply do not currently have enough data from the Late Prehistoric component at site 41DN580 to assess duration of encampment or size of the groups. We hypothesize, however, they may have been operating in a smaller territory, one focused more heavily on the area around the Trinity River basin. Conclusions The research design for data recovery of sites 41DN580 and 41DN624 specified that Acacia would articulate research questions through an iterative process of analysis and reporting first on all of the testing data and then following submittal of a second interim report and research design, on the second phase data recovery materials. However, separating out the analyses into two phases once the material was collected was simply not practical, particularly for lithic, shell, and bone artifacts, if for no other reason than there we so few of them found during the testing phase. Thus, all of the artifacts from testing and data recovery efforts were analyzed together as a single collection. Moreover, we found that by the time we had assembled all the data together to develop new or alternative research questions, we had effectively completed most of the work and written the report documenting both testing and data recovery work. This report presents a complete discussion of all studies and data. All artifacts collected during these efforts will be curated along with project records at the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) in San Marcos.

There appears to be some crushing on the platform from use. The platform is small with a very small lip, likely done from punch work or soft billet. The distal end of the flake comes to a sharp point that looks like it could have been isolated, although it does not appear to have been used as the edges are still in tact and smooth. As seen from the dorsal face under the microscope the left margin has some unidirectional flaking on that extends the entire margin. There is some unidirectional flaking along the right of the point at the distal end. The right margin appears to have a break. It almost looks like a burination, but the wave propagation is not vertical. || 260-01 |  |  | 9 4 5 .4 7 1 |  | 260 |  |  | 14 |  |  | 67 |  |  | 3 |  |  | None |  |  | Very light gray, almost white with a yellow undertone. |  |  | Nova Chert |  |  | None |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Flake |  |  | y ra itre T |  | c iro ts ih e rP e ta L |  | There is no intact platform on this flake.

There is no unidirectional flaking or crushing along any of the margins, however along the intact margin and the smaller of the two breaks there is polish along the edge. There is charred material on or in the surface of this flake, and a possible potlid on one side.

The platform is barely intact, one side is completely broken, crushed with some stepping. The ventral face just at the bulb there is a single flake and polish from use. The distal end is gone from a horizontal break at the midline. There is strong unidirectional flakes on the dorsal face, in particular just under the break on the right margin. There is a unidirectional flake on the dorsal face on the top corner of the left margin right at the break. This piece may have been broken during use. There are some areas in the center of the flake that look like potlids, this may have been exposed to heat. |

July 27, 2021 Mr. Ken Lawrence SWCA 4407 Monterey Oaks Blvd. Suite 110 Austin, TX 78749 United States RE: Radiocarbon Dating Results Dear Mr. Lawrence, Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for nine samples recently sent to us. As usual, the method of analysis is listed on the report with the results and calibration data is provided where applicable. The Conventional Radiocarbon Ages have all been corrected for total fractionation effects and where applicable, calibration was performed using 2020 calibration databases (cited on the graph pages). The web directory containing the table of results and PDF download also contains pictures, a cvs spreadsheet download option and a quality assurance report containing expected vs. measured values for 3-5 working standards analyzed simultaneously with your samples. Reported results are accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2017 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 standards and all chemistry was performed here in our laboratory and counted in our own accelerators here. Since Beta is not a teaching laboratory, only graduates trained to strict protocols of the ISO/IEC 17025:2017 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 program participated in the analyses. As always Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per the conventions of the 1977 International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce sigmas lower than +/- 30 years, a conservative +/- 30 BP is cited for the result unless otherwise requested. The reported d13C values were measured separately in an IRMS (isotope ratio mass spectrometer). They are NOT the AMS d13C which would include fractionation effects from natural, chemistry and AMS induced sources. When interpreting the results, please consider any communications you may have had with us regarding the samples. Thank you for prepaying the analyses. As always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, Chris Patrick Vice President of Laboratory Operations Page 1 of 19

REPORT OF RADIOCARBON DATING ANALYSES Ken Lawrence Report Date: July 27, 2021 SWCA Material Received: July 12, 2021 Conventional Radiocarbon Age (BP) or Laboratory Number Sample Code Number Percent Modern Carbon (pMC) & Stable Isotopes Beta - 597401 624.E02 1580 +/- 30 BP IRMS δ13C: -16.4 o/oo (95.4%) 420 - 556 cal AD (1530 - 1394 cal BP) Submitter Material: Organic sediment Pretreatment: (organic sediment) acid washes Analyzed Material: Organic sediment Analysis Service: AMS-Standard delivery Percent Modern Carbon: 82.14 +/- 0.31 pMC Fraction Modern Carbon: 0.8214 +/- 0.0031 D14C: -178.56 +/- 3.07 o/oo ∆14C: -185.58 +/- 3.07 o/oo (1950:2021) Measured Radiocarbon Age: (without d13C correction): 1440 +/- 30 BP Calibration: BetaCal4.20: HPD method: INTCAL20 Results are ISO/IEC-17025:2017 accredited. No sub-contracting or student labor was used in the analyses. All work was done at Beta in 4 in-house NEC accelerator mass spectrometers and 4 Thermo IRMSs. The "Conventional Radiocarbon Age" was calculated using the Libby half-life (5568 years), is corrected for total isotopic fraction and was used for calendar calibration where applicable. The Age is rounded to the nearest 10 years and is reported as radiocarbon years before present (BP), “present" = AD 1950. Results greater than the modern reference are reported as percent modern carbon (pMC). The modern reference standard was 95% the 14C signature of NIST SRM-4990C (oxalic acid). Quoted errors are 1 sigma counting statistics. Calculated sigmas less than 30 BP on the Conventional Radiocarbon Age are conservatively rounded up to 30. d13C values are on the material itself (not the AMS d13C). d13C and d15N values are relative to VPDB-1. References for calendar calibrations are cited at the bottom of calibration graph pages. Page 2 of 19

No sub-contracting or student labor was used in the analyses. All work was done at Beta in 4 in-house NEC accelerator mass spectrometers and 4 Thermo IRMSs. The "Conventional Radiocarbon Age" was calculated using the Libby half-life (5568 years), is corrected for total isotopic fraction and was used for calendar calibration where applicable. The Age is rounded to the nearest 10 years and is reported as radiocarbon years before present (BP), “present" = AD 1950. Results greater than the modern reference are reported as percent modern carbon (pMC). The modern reference standard was 95% the 14C signature of NIST SRM-4990C (oxalic acid). Quoted errors are 1 sigma counting statistics. Calculated sigmas less than 30 BP on the Conventional Radiocarbon Age are conservatively rounded up to 30. d13C values are on the material itself (not the AMS d13C). d13C and d15N values are relative to VPDB-1. References for calendar calibrations are cited at the bottom of calibration graph pages. Page 3 of 19

Quality Assurance Report This report provides the results of reference materials used to validate radiocarbon analyses prior to reporting. Known-value reference materials were analyzed quasi-simultaneously with the unknowns. Results are reported as expected values vs measured values. Reported values are calculated relative to NISTSRM-1990C and corrected for isotopic fractionation. Results are reported using the direct analytical measure percent modern carbon (pMC) with one relative standard deviation. Agreement between expected and measured values is taken as being within 2 sigma agreement (error x 2) to account for total laboratory error. Report Date: July 27, 2021 Submitter: Mr. Ken Lawrence QA MEASUREMENTS Reference 1 Expected Value: 96.69 +/- 0.50 pMC Measured Value: 96.52 +/- 0.28 pMC Agreement: Accepted Reference 2 Expected Value: 0.44 +/- 0.10 pMC Measured Value: 0.45 +/- 0.03 pMC Agreement: Accepted Reference 3 Expected Value: 129.41 +/- 0.06 pMC Measured Value: 129.48 +/- 0.35 pMC Agreement: Accepted COMMENT: All measurements passed acceptance tests. Validation: Date: July 27, 2021

Procedures for sample processing and single-grain OSL age analysis: All samples were opened and processed under dim amber safelight conditions within the lab. Sample processing for quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating followed standard procedures involving sieving, HCl and bleach treatments, heavy mineral separation at 2.72 g/cm3, and acid treatments with HCl and HF to isolate the quartz component of a narrow grain-size range, 150-250 µm. The purity of the quartz samples was checked by measurement with infra-red stimulation to detect the presence of feldspar. The USU Luminescence Lab follows the latest single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) procedures for single-grain (SG) OSL dating of quartz sand (Duller et al., 1999; Murray and Wintle, 2000, 2003; Wintle and Murray, 2006; Duller, 2008). The SAR protocol includes tests for sensitivity correction and brackets the equivalent dose (D ) the sample received during burial by irradiating the sample at five different E doses (below, at, and above the D , plus a zero dose and a repeated dose to check for recuperation of E the signal and sensitivity correction). The resultant data are fit with a saturating exponential curve or linear regression for young sediments. Cumulative D is calculated on the Central Age Model E (CAM) or the Minimum Age Model (MAM) of Galbraith and Roberts (2012), depending on the distribution of D results and evidence for partial bleaching*. In cases where the samples have E significant positive skew, ages are calculated based on a MAM. The SG-OSL age is reported at 1σ standard error and is calculated by dividing the D (in grays, Gy) by the environmental dose rate E (Gy/kyr) that the sample has been exposed to during burial. More details on OSL analyses and results are available upon request. Dose-rate calculations were determined by chemical analysis of the U, Th, K and Rb content using ICP- MS and ICP-AES techniques and conversion factors from Guérin et al. (2011). The contribution of cosmic radiation to the dose rate was calculated using sample depth, elevation, and latitude/longitude following Prescott and Hutton (1994). Dose rates are calculated based on water content, sediment chemistry, and cosmic contribution (Aitken and Xie, 1990; Aitken, 1998). Under the collaborative agreement to analyze samples at the USU Luminescence Lab, please consider including Dr. Rittenour as a co-author on resultant publications.
