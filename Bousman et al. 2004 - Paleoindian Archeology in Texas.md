This point of view places Early Holocene peoples in the Early Archaic period. Other scholars refer to Pleistocene peoples within the period of ca. 12,000– 10,000b.p.asEarlyPaleoindian,andLate Paleoindian refers to those societies mak- ing lanceolate projectile points during the Early Holocene period of ca. 10,000– 8,000 b.p.(E. Turner and Hester 1993). We adopt the latter usage, but this choice is not without difficulties, as we will dis- cuss below. The classification of projectile points remains one of the more dominant con- cerns of Paleoindian archeologists in Texas. While its importance should not be overstated, it is clear that the entire cultural-historical framework of Paleo- indian archeology is highly dependent on projectile point classifications. When projectile points are absent from a site, even with reliable radiocarbon dates the depth and breadth of the conclusions we can draw from such a site are limited. Fig.2.1.

Similar “Folsom-like” points were found at Dent, Colorado, in 1932 and at Miami, Texas, in 1934 (Fig.2.3). By Sep- tember, 1941, at a symposium held at Santa Fe, New Mexico, it was agreed that generalized Folsom would be called Clo- vis Fluted and true Folsom would be termed Folsom Fluted (E. Howard 1943; Krieger 1947a). The major difference be- tween Clovis Fluted and Folsom Fluted was the longer flutes, finer flaking, and thinner cross sections in Folsom Fluted points. It was also recognized that eastern forms similar to Clovis existed and these were called Ohio Fluted. The relative temporal positions of Clovis as older and Folsom as younger were not well under- stood until Glen Evans’s careful analysis of the stratigraphy at Blackwater Draw (J. Hester etal. 1972). Archeologists have retained the distinctions between Folsom and Clovis and between different forms ofClovissincethemid-twentiethcentury. Fig.2.2. Folsom points from Lipscomb (after Hofman 1995). Numerous Clovis and Folsom points have been discovered in Texas, and they have been recovered from excavated sites such as Miami, Lubbock Lake, Kincaid Shel- ter, Bonfire Shelter, Aubrey, Lipscomb, and Midland. Unfluted Projectile Points and the “Yuma Problem” Unfluted lanceolate projectile point typology presents a more difficult puzzle. E. B. Renaud’s (1931, 1932, 1934) intro- duction of Yuma as a type illustrates this quandary. Based on surface collections from northeastern Colorado near Yuma, Renaud (1931) described Yuma varieties with careful and precise attention to size, shape, and flaking morphology (Fig.2.4). These characteristics are the same basic set of observations used today, but Re- naud’s use of surface collections and his primary reliance on morphology instead of context prematurely led to a series of named types. Furthermore, Renaud (1932, 10) thought that Yuma forms preceded and were coeval with Folsom forms, although Figgins (1935) and Rob- erts (1940) suggested that Yuma points were manufactured after the production of Folsom projectile points had been discontinued.

Krieger amassed an impressive, at least for the time, set of quantitative data regarding metric dimensions, and he compared his results with those from other sites. It is clear that Krieger did not find the Yuma concept useful, and he ob- viously thought that the limited amount of variation he observed among the Plain- view projectile points provided strong evidence that this form was restricted in time and space. By 1954, with the publication ofAn Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology by Dee Ann Suhm etal., the acceptable variation for the Plainview type had stretched well beyond the original defini- tion. The size, flaking pattern, and shape of Plainview points had all been greatly expanded, and the type definition began to be applied indiscriminately. This trend began to be reversed a decade later with the introduction of Plainview Golondrina (golondrina being Spanish for swallow) as a variant of the Plainview type by LeRoy Johnson (1964) to distinguish projectile points he excavated from the Devil’s Mouth site in the Lower Pecos region (Fig.2.6). Johnson used the genus-species concept as a way to highlight the similari- ties and differences between Golondrina and Plainview points. By 1977, however, the genus-species approach had been dropped, and only the term Golondrina Fig.2.4.

This analysis narrowly defines Plainview points morphologically and thus clears away some of the typological confusion that has cluttered the type in the past. But as will be discussed in detail below, the temporal position of Plainview in the Southern Plains has been difficult to pin down. If the older dates, such as the 10,940 b.p.age from the Plainview site and the ca. 11,000 b.p.assays from Wilson-Leonard hold up, then the age of Plainview in the Southern Plains com- pares well with the age of Goshen-Plain- view in the Northern Plains (Frison etal. 1996). St. Mary’s Hall The specimens in clusters 10 and 11 are characterized by thicker stems than on other points, with moderately deep basal concavities (Fig.2.16). These points are from the St. Mary’s Hall site (Hester 1977b, 1978a, 1991a) in San Antonio, Levi Rock Shelter, bone concentration 3 in FA6-11 at Lubbock Lake, and predom- inantly from Unit II at Wilson-Leonard. The point from Levi Rock Shelter was previously called Plainview-Angostura, and the points from St. Mary’s Hall and Lubbock Lake were referred to as Plain- view points. However, now it is clear that these points are morphologically distinct from true Plainview, and with dates from two of the sites in the sample suggesting an age range between 9990 and 8700 b.p. (see a more detailed discussion below), these points have been distinguished ty- pologically as St. Mary’s Hall. It is likely that Kelly’s Miniature Plainview points (1983a) would fit within this class. Scottsbluff Cluster 15, characterized by wide, thick stems and very shallow basal con- cavities, contained three specimens, two of which are considered to be Scotts- bluff (Fig.2.17). Scottsbluff points have slightly formed shoulders that frame wide stems, and all come from Late Paleo- indian contexts at Wilson-Leonard (Bousman 1998a). The sample in this analysis was too small to examine all the variability possible in the Scottsbluff type, and a large sample with type site speci- mens would be more informative. Parallel-Sided Stem Within cluster 14 were four specimens from Wilson-Leonard that appear to have Fig.2.16. St. Mary’s Hall points from St. Mary’s Hall and Wilson-Leonard.

02-A2946 12/17/03 4:39 PM Page 34 34 / TEXAS PREHISTORY Summary The above section discusses the evi- dence for Texas Paleoindian projectile point typology. A number of distinctive morphological forms carry significant cul- tural-historical information. These forms include Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina-Barber, Wilson, St. Mary’s Hall, Dalton, Scottsbluff, Angostura, Berclair, San Patrice, Big Sandy, Lub- bock, and Thrall. With this larger array of more finely tuned point types it is pos- sible to begin the work needed to im- prove the chronological-stratigraphic range of these forms. Then, with greater confidence, researchers will be able to de- velop more anthropologically and behav- iorally focused analyses of Paleoindian archeology in Texas. Geological Stratigraphy and Site Descriptions The geological setting of the great ma- jority of Paleoindian sites can be easily summarized: most are surface occurrences and do not occur in a buried context. However, a few sites have been discovered Fig.2.24. Lubbock Lake map, areas 10 and 14 not shown (after E.

Sellards describes the playa deposits set into “red sandy clay bedrock” (1938, figs.3 and 5). The lowest playa fill was described as a fine silt colored by organic matter. The lower fill was overlain by a “loess stratum about 6 inches thick” (1938, 1002). Above the loess stratum was a silt similar to the lower fill, and the Clovis component and mammoth bone were in the bottom of this silt lens (1938, 1002–1003).

That the water was shallow is indicated by the thin layer of pond sedi- ment with broken and poorly preserved bones in the upper part and by the pres- ence of abundant fresh-water inverte- brates” (Sellards etal. 1947, 934). Sometime after 1945 the original pit was enlarged, and two additional pits were excavated. In the 1970s the original pit was filled with garbage. Holliday (1995d, 1997a) studied profiles that were visible during the 1980s and 1990s, and his descriptions provide a more detailed but, because of the contin- ued destruction and alteration of the site, limited view of the geological context of the Plainview site. Unfortunately, the bone bed was completely destroyed and/or covered over by the time Holliday began to work at the site. He suggests that the bone bed was sitting on a caliche bench formed by two earlier erosion events (Fig.2.33). The oldest and deepest channel that eroded one edge of the bench is filled with Stratum 1, a sand and gravel deposit. This channel is easily cor- related to the Sellards etal. (1947) basal unit. A second erosional event, possibly a later meander, is marked by a smaller channel filled with Stratum 1m deposits. This is an organic-rich, loamy, mud facies of Stratum 1. These deposits could be similar to those described by Sellards etal. as the “thin layer of pond sediment” (1947, 934). Overlying Stratum 1 are very thin, discontinuous, and contorted lenses of organic-rich mud. This is Stra- tum 2. Above Stratum 2 is Stratum 3 with lacustrine carbonate and eolian fa- cies, and it seals all the lower deposits and Fig.2.32. Bonfire Shelter stratigraphy (after Dibble and Lorrain 1968). probably the Plainview occupation. Fur- thermore, Holliday (1997a, 109) ob- served Roberta Speer’s excavated blocks of bone removed by Sellards, and the bone was within a grayish-brown sandy loam above a gravel. Holliday (1999, personal communica- tion) believes that the bone bed is strati- graphically in and above Stratum 2m and above Stratum 1 and that the Stratum 2m radiocarbon assay is too young. Neverthe- less, Holliday illustrates the approximate position of the bone bed as being on the caliche bench and over Stratum 1m, and Fig.2.33. Plainview stratigraphy (after Holliday 1995d).

The stratigraphy was first described by Harrison (Harrison and Smith 1975; Harrison and Killen 1978) but has been re-described by Holliday (E. Johnson etal. 1982; Holliday 1997a). Holliday identified ten stratigraphic units and five soils (Fig.2.38). The basal units are a set of three fining-upward stratigraphic units that are capped by a soil (S1). Unit 1 is fluvial gravels and Fig.2.37. Golondrina hearth at Baker Cave (after Chadderdon 1983). sands. Above, Unit 2 has loams to silty clay loams that probably were deposited as overbank alluvium. The lowest soil correlates to Unit 3, a clay, and two ra- diocarbon dates indicate it is Pleistocene in age. Units 4, 5, and 6 comprise an- other set of fining-upward sediments that are also capped by a soil (S2).

Dates on organic matter in the soil and the bone date to the Early Holocene. Above this soil are three additional sets of sediments, each capped by a soil (S3, S4, and S5). Organic matter in S3 (Ab2 hori- zon) dates to the Middle Holocene, while organic matter in S4 (Ab1) dates to the Late Holocene. In many parts of the site, S4 (Ab1 horizon) and its associated depo- sitional units (Unit 8 and Unit 9) were removed by erosion, and Unit 10 directly overlies S3.

As the following discussion indicates, the most reliable chronologies come from those sites with good stratigraphic con- texts that have been intensively and chronologically sampled. These sites pro- duce a sequence of absolute dates in dif- ferent levels that act to constrain the en- tire sequence through time. No longer can we depend on sites that have only one or a few determinations. Along with tree- ring and coral calibration, stratigraphi- cally constrained assays provide the best method for determining the age and the time spans for events and periods during the Paleoindian stage. The recent extension of calibrated ages into the Paleoindian stage dramatically demonstrates that radiocarbon time is stretched and compressed on a calendrical Fig.2.43.

02-A2946 12/17/03 4:41 PM Page 72 72 / TEXAS PREHISTORY The distribution of Clovis sites is spread throughout the entire state, sug- gesting that the Early Paleoindian groups occupied all regions during this well-rec- ognized period (see Fig.2.46b). Also, the number of Clovis sites is perhaps surpris- ing for this early period, but this distribu- tion is supported by Meltzer and Bever’s (1995) distributional study. Although Folsom/Midland sites ap- pear to be more common in the prairies and grasslands (see Fig.2.46c), they are unexpectedly common in east Texas (Story 1990). Many investigators have suggested that Folsom/Midland hunter- gatherers were specialized bison hunters (e.g., Hofman 1991b), but their occur- rence in east Texas, when the pollen data from east-central Texas indicates that woodlands would have been extensive (Bousman 1998b), suggests a more com- plex adaptation. The distribution of stemmed projectile points associated with Paleoindian occu- pations in the southern portion of the state is also surprising (see Fig.2.46d). Among other sites, these included the Fig.2.45.

These assemblages include Lake Theo, Lipscomb, Lubbock Lake, Lub- bock Landfill, Scharbauer (Midland), and Shifting Sands. Two bone beds were excavated at Lake Theo in the Rolling Plains (Harrison and Smith 1975; Harrison and Killen 1978). The lower bed contained Folsom points in association withBison antiquus, and the upper bone bed is associated with an unfluted parallel-stemmed lanceolate point that was classified as Plainview. The Folsom/Midland component contained 524 bison bones from at least twelve ani- mals, and Harrison and Smith (1975,74) interpreted the site as a butchering station andcampsite,ratherthanakillsite,based on element representation, possible bone stacking, and the lithic assemblage. Age estimation of the bison suggested a late summer or early fall kill. Lipscomb is another key Paleoindian site, and it is cited widely in discussions of Folsom lifeways (Barbour and Schultz 1941; Hofman 1995; Hofman and Todd 1990, 1995; Hofman etal. 1989a, 1991b; Schultz 1943; Todd 1991; Todd Fig.2.48.

There, the articulated bones of an extinct bison were jacketed and removed in block form using paleontological excavation techniques. Upon further excavation in the laboratory, three Milnesand points were recovered from the skeleton. This site was crucial for documenting human associations with extinct faunas and for beginning to address the question of Paleoindian subsistence. While the Lone Wolf Creek projectile points are now classified as Plainview, it was not until two decades later that the Plainview type site itself was excavated. The Plainview site (41HA1) bison bed was discovered in 1933, and caliche quar- rying operations continued to expose more of the bed until 1941, when mining for the road-grade stone ceased (Speer Fig.2.49.

The degree of alveolar resorption between the two groups is roughly the same. The Wilson-Leonard Paleoindian had frequent pits and evidence of moderate to large striations on the teeth. The flattened tooth wear indicates either the consump- tion of hard, gritty foods, or long-term use of the teeth (Powell and Steele 1994), apatternsimilartothatofArchaichunters and gatherers. Overall, Powell and Steele concluded that the Wilson-Leonard fe- male—like other Paleoindians whose skeletons have been studied—had a diet that may not have differed greatly be- tween Paleoindians and later hunter- gatherers of the Archaic. In terms of population affinity, Steele (1998, 1453) noted that Wilson-Leonard II has shoveling of the upper incisors, a common trait in American Indian popu- lations but comparatively rare in Euro- peans. Wilson-Leonard II is similar to other Paleoindian skeletons from other states (such as Gordon Creek, Colorado, and Pelican Rapids, Minnesota) in having Fig.2.50.

Collins and Headrick 1992; Goode and Mallouf 1991;HendersonandGoode1991;Houk etal. 1997; Mallouf 1989; B. Young and Collins 1989), Collins (1999) argues per- suasively that prismatic blade technology was clearly a formal component in the Clovis lithic repertoire. Conical and wedge-shaped blade cores occur, but conical cores are the most common. The platforms on conical blade cores are roughly circular, prepared by the removal of broad but short flakes that often hinge (Fig.2.52). This hinging produces large central knots on the platform. Blade scars on the slides of the blade cores often are missing negative bulbs of percussion, sug- gesting to Collins that core platforms Fig.2.52.
