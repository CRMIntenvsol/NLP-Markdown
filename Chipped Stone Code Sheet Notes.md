I) Taxonomy The artifact taxonomy presented here has been designed as a means to record various levels of analytical data for each specimen, and to move beyond a strict reliance on static artifact names and types. It is hoped that this taxonomy will help identify technological traditions and preferences of technique within and between groups, landscapes, regions, and periods. Taxonomic classification of stone tools will also provide the eventual database with greater analytical potential. 1. Technology Technology, as used here, relates to the suite of techniques used to produce a lithic implement. The primary distinction at this level is between (1) chipped-stone, and (2) groundstone, although minor categories may be considered. This will be used to separate lithic artifacts at the broadest analytical level. TxDOT anticipates the development of a groundstone protocol in 2009. 2. Group At the next lower taxonomic level, lithic objects classified as chipped stone (non-debitage) may be separated into two distinct groups. The first group is Tools and includes objects that represent or were intended for (in the case of performs) direct functionality. The second group is Non-tools, representing objects of indirect functionality (ex. cores), or objects of an instructional, symbolic, or artistic nature (ex. Early Archaic multi-notched lithics). For the purposes of this protocol, only those artifacts grouped as chipped-stone tools are considered. 3. Subgroup Tool subgroup identifies the primary technique of manufacture. Chipped-stone tools are classified into one of three subgroups: (1) simple detachment-based; (2) complex detachment-based; and (3) core-based. Detachment-based tools are derivative of larger cores. Simple detachment-based tools are classified as either blades or flakes and are used with modest to no modification following detachment. Complex detachment-based tools undergo substantial modification prior to use. Such tools most commonly originate as macro-flakes or macro-blades detached from a sizable core. The form is then reduced through bifacial or unifacial percussion and, unlike simple detachment-based tools, proceeds through several identifiable reduction stages prior to use. Core-based tools are constructed from material cores (most often in the form of tabular or nodular cobbles) rather than detachments. Such tools are reduced through bifacial or unifacial percussion and proceed through several identifiable reduction stages prior to use. Differentiating between core- based and complex detachment-based tools may not be possible. Complex detachment-based tools can often only be distinguished from core-based tools when they retain characteristics of their origin. These may include a remnant bulb of percussion, striking platform, or (more typically) identifiable ventral surface. 4. Class A tool class identifies the general form of the tool with implicit information relevant to understanding the techniques of manufacture. For simple detachment-based tools, classes include flakes and blades. For both complex detachment- based tools and core-based tools, classes include bifaces and non-bifaces. 5. Subclass The subclass of a tool provides additional information with respect to its class, often related to the degree to which the producer adhered to a predetermined manufacturing template. A subclass also encodes implicit information relevant to understanding the degree of expediency with which the tool was crafted. Tools classified as either flakes and blades are sub-classified as either modified or unmodified. Such tools are sub-classified as modified when additional stages of manufacture are required following their initial detachment prior to their use. Sequent flake unifaces, end scrapers, drills, and backed blades are a few examples of modified simple detachment-based tools. Tools classified as either bifaces or non-bifaces are sub-classified as either formal or informal. If tools fit within a standardized, pervasive, recognizable morphology, they are considered formal as the producer is presumed to have been following a traditional manufacturing template. Unique tool forms that (typically) appear more expedient in design are considered informal. *Not original Text Page 3 of 24 February 16, 2026

6. Type A tool’s type identifies aspects of its use. Complex detachment-based and core-based tools should be typed according to their function. Function should be determined through use-wear analysis using the methods and observations outlined below. Some examples of biface tool types include projectiles, adzes, choppers, and knives. Examples of non-biface tool types include scrapers, adzes, and gouges. Simple detachment-based tools sub-classified as modified flakes should also be typed according to their function (ex. burin, drill, graver, etc.). Simple detachment-based tools sub-classified as unmodified flakes should only be typed as expedient. Simple detachment-based tools sub-classified as unmodified blades should be typed according to their morphology. Common unmodified blade types include dihedral and polyhedral varieties. Simple detachment-based tools sub-classified as modified blades should be typed according to modification form (ex. backed, stemmed, etc.). 7. Subtype / Identity The identity of a tool form (its subtype) corresponds to how it is commonly identified within the classical typological system. Thus, a projectile may be identified as Angostura, Bell, Clovis, Dalton, Ensor, etc. For tools classified as flakes and blades, the appropriate identity will most often be “not applicable” (an exception would be a Clovis blade). *Not original Text Page 4 of 24 February 16, 2026

12. Edge angle The edge angle of the tool should be recorded as an average measure along the used margin of the form. This should be recorded to the nearest 5° interval. Measurements should be made using a goniometer and recorded directly from the tool. Some extrapolation is acceptable where the edge has been blunted from use and the original angle can be determined. III) Attributes 13. Stage Linear reduction models assist in determining the stage of manufacture an artifact reached within an idealized trajectory. Linear reduction models provide a framework for understanding the functional and behavioral relationships among related sets of artifacts (Collins 1975; Goode 2002; Patterson 1977, Shafer 1983, 1985; Sollberger 1977; Tsirk 1979), and are typically based on theoretical abstractions or on experimental replication (Crabtree 1966). Classifying tools in accordance with a linear reduction scheme allows for a more precise study of manufacturing concerns, and it provides a conceptual model for determining the degree of morphologic variation that finished trajectories may be expected to exhibit. When assessing trait or design variability, it will be most productive to compare finished tool forms that have not been extensively remodeled through recycling efforts. The criteria for determining stage of manufacture used in this work closely follow that of Black et al. (1997). Five stages in the life cycle trajectory of tools are recognized in this protocol: (1) initial package reduction, (2) blank preparation, (3) preform shaping and thinning, (4) final edge trimming and sharpening, and (5) rejuvenated forms. Assessing manufacturing stage is not a wholly objective enterprise (Goode 2002). Lithic reduction is a linear process, and its separation into discrete units of activity is necessarily subjective. Also, the fragmentary nature of some artifacts, the retention of trace amounts of surface cortex on finished forms, and variability in production patterns due to raw material variability and individual skill all contribute to the occasional difficulty in assigning production stage. However, observing this process in stepwise fashion *Not original Text Page 6 of 24 February 16, 2026

provides a useful proxy measure for detecting potentially important variations in the organization of lithic resource exploitation. The first stage of the linear reduction model, initial package reduction, reflects the beginning steps of tool manufacture and includes preliminary reduction efforts such as cortex removal, mass thinning, and initial shaping. At this stage, objective pieces typically retain some cortex on one or both faces and reduction is dominated by hard-hammer percussion. Tool forms in their initial production stage are generally irregular in outline, exhibit unrefined edges, and do not provide an indication of the intended manufacturing trajectory. However, tools may be employed as crude “choppers” even at this early stage (Goode 2002: 36). Most expedient tool forms will be assigned to this reduction stage. The second category, blank preparation, is characterized by the production of a less generalized form with a limited set of possible final trajectories. Tool forms in this stage of manufacture, called “blanks” (Crabtree 1972), typically exhibit little if any cortex, although completed tools may exhibit traces of cortex on occasion. As blanks, tools receive further reduction of mass through thinning, which is accomplished with some hard-hammer, but primarily soft-hammer percussion. Blanks require refinement of lateral margins, which may appear sinuous on bifacial forms. Incipient stems may be initially observed at this stage. The third category, preform shaping and thinning, is characterized by the artisan’s full commitment toward a single or very limited number of morphological forms, producing what is commonly called a “preform” (Crabtree 1972b). Preforms exhibit a significant reduction in thickness when compared to blanks, and soft hammers are used almost exclusively for purposes of reduction. Cortex is rare on these late-stage forms. Artifacts categorized as performs approximate their final design and generally lack only refinement of lateral edges and minor facial thinning. Edges are nearly straight and exhibit minor sinuosity. This is the final stage of production to use direct percussion. The fourth category, final edge trimming and sharpening, includes artifacts that are very near or have reached the end stage of their manufacture. Tools within their final production stage require minor reduction along their margins, which is accomplished exclusively through pressure flaking and indirect percussion. Notching, edge grinding, and final stem preparation are completed at this stage. Artifacts having reached their end stage presumably represent tools that were discarded (often due to breakage), cached, lost, or otherwise abandoned. Finished forms require no additional production efforts, and commonly exhibit use-related edge modification (use-wear). Edges have not been remodeled through refurbishing efforts. The final category, rejuvenated forms, describes artifacts that exhibit pronounced edge retouch or remodeling, a marked reduction in size, or evidence of adaptation to a secondary production trajectory in response to failure or discontinuation of the initial tool form. Tool rejuvenation and other forms of recycling provide important information regarding the perceived value of the resource. *Not original Text Page 7 of 24 February 16, 2026

14. Portion A significant number of tools are recovered in a fragmentary state and it is important to record the portion represented. Identify partial forms as “fragments” when too little of the tool remains to determine what part of the tool is represented. As it is occasionally difficult to determine whether a piece corresponded to a proximal or distal segment, even when it was clear that one or the other is represented, an “indeterminate” category has been included. 15. Failure / Discard Determining the reason why a particular tool form was discarded is seldom a straightforward endeavor. Oftentimes such a determination cannot be made at all. However, where a cause of discard can be determined, valuable insights regarding production specialization and standardization, raw material conservation, use context, and cultural ideology may be gleaned. The context of tool discard can be identified as production-related, use-related, and incidental. Production- related discard occurs when tools are discarded during manufacture as the result of technical mistakes or material deficiencies. Use-related discard can result from stress or impact fractures, excessive dulling, material exhaustion, use- loss, or caching. Tool forms may also be lost unintentionally. Each mode of discard will have distinct implications for the likelihood of artifact recovery. Several factors are also known to complicate determinations of discard cause. Secondary tool modification *Not original Text Page 8 of 24 February 16, 2026

and material recycling may complicate determinations of failure, as can patina development. Excessive thermal alteration can also present an obstacle for assessing the probable cause of original discard as it is often difficult to determine the point at which the object was altered. Artifacts can be subjected to excessive heat following their discard, as when affected by modern or ancient surface fires. The over- firing of raw material blanks or preforms may also have contributed to fire-damage. Production-related Discard Several authors have previously described snap or bending fractures (Crabtree 1972:60; Whittaker 1994:213; and Tsirk 1979:84). This fracture results when the lithic material is subjected to bending forces that exceed the material’s elastic limits. Snap fractures often occur during tool production due to the knapper’s failure to provide the objective piece with adequate support as it is reduced. In so doing, vibrations radiate throughout the tool form with each percussive strike, causing a fracture at the point where the elasticity of the material can no longer absorb the vibrations (Whittaker 1994: 213). Bending fractures can also occur quite commonly as the result of tool use. Use derived bending fractures manifest as lateral truncations that often display a rolled or lipped edge along one side of the termination (Shafer 1985: 283). When a rolled lip is observed, it often indicates that the tool was subjected to excessive torque during use. Snap fractures may also derive from material flaws, such as cavities or crystalline inclusions, which cause disharmony in the radiation of percussion waves through the material, or simply produce areas of weak structural integrity (see discussion of material flaws below). Step and hinge fractures present analogous difficulties for tool production or recycling, and while morphologically distinct, they are formed through similar circumstances. They are treated as a single category of failure in this protocol. A step fracture happens when the outward force is too great causing the flake to bend to the point of breaking. This is typically caused by hitting the core with a motion that is too fast which pulls the flake way faster than the propagation through the core; thus causing the snap to occur (Crabtree 1972: 92; Whittaker 1994: 109). Step fractures are similar to snap fractures with regard to the fracture mechanics of brittle solids in that they result in the truncation of material due to the unchanneled dispersion of percussive force. Hinge fractures occur when inadequate percussive force is applied to reduction efforts, preventing the flake from traveling the desired distance (Whittaker 1994: 109). However, rather than the flake being prematurely truncated as in step fractures, hinge fractures are characterized by the full termination of the flake. This termination occurs earlier than the intended point of egress, producing a rounded or blunt break and a disproportionate distribution of material mass that impedes further reduction efforts (Crabtree 1972: 68). Further reduction efforts often produce stacked step fractures or continued hinging, resulting in the inability to further reduce medial areas or to rejuvenate worn-out tool forms (Whittaker 1994: 109). Although they are morphologically dissimilar, the causes of hinge and step fractures, as well as the ensuing impediments for material reduction, are nearly equivalent (Whittaker 1994: 109). While step and hinge fractures often occur in the production of stone tools, they may also occur through tool use. Flakes may be inadvertently removed when tools come into contact with other materials as they are used in various tasks. Regardless of the trajectory stage, step and hinge fracture present a challenge to future reduction efforts, and may necessarily result in discard. Failure and discard may also occur during reduction and rejuvenation efforts as the result of platform loss. The loss or collapse of a workable striking platform is often the consequence of improper reduction techniques or unanticipated fractures that leave no viable surface on which to strike and remove a desirable flake. Platform loss can occur during efforts to remove excessive mass from the medial areas of cores, preforms, and recycled tools, and may result in the inability to remove a desired mass without compromising the dimensional requirements of the desired trajectory. Material flaws generally manifest as mineral inclusions or cavities that differ compositionally from the package material. Irregular cleavage planes constitute another material obstacle that can impact the success of manufacturing efforts. When encountered, these flaws can produce anomalous fractures that complicate or preclude further reduction efforts. Common material flaws include macrocrystalline quartz, calcite, or fossil inclusions, as well as solution cavities and thermally-induced fractures. Production failures resulting from unanticipated thermally-induced fractures should be classified as “excessive heat” rather than “material flaw.” Cotterell and Kamminga (1979) describe overshot (outrepassé) failures as those that that result from the application of excessive percussion force, and which cause the fracture path to dive into the objective piece *Not original Text Page 9 of 24 February 16, 2026

and remove more than the intended mass. Such fractures often occur during the bifacial thinning of blanks and preforms, or in the removal of blades from prepared cores. While failures of this type are most frequently observed during primary production, they may also occur during rejuvenation efforts. Discard will generally be motivated by excessive medial thinning or unrecoverable compromise of the objects design. Perverse fractures, as defined by Crabtree (1972b: 82), are a spiral or twisting break that initiates at the point of percussion and follows through the object, causing its segmentation. In terms of causation, perverse fractures are the result of a hair-line fracture that resulted from a previous blow. The spiral perverse fracture picks up the old fracture thus resulting in failure. These differ from snap/bending fractures as they are not the result of excessive vibration, but result from a poor choice of striking angle and/or percussion force (as well as a bit of bad luck) that results in the plane of fracture traveling through rather than across the objective piece. When more than one failure trait is expressed by an artifact, record the most significant cause for failure. For example, if a snap fracture resulted during production due to a fossil or crystalline quartz inclusion within the material, record material flaw as the cause of failure. In conjunction with other features of the assemblage, this information may potentially reveal preference patterns in raw material usage vis-à-vis specific tool classes, correlations between tool forms and discard patterning, and idiosyncratic differences in production skill. Use-related Discard Stone tools may be lost in their use-context in myriad ways. Points attached to an errant arrow may be lost or broken; as well they may be carried off embedded in game that was not subsequently subdued. Tools can also be continuously curated and used to the point of material exhaustion. Objects may also be cached in the process of ritual activity, such as when placed in burials. The motives for use-related discard may only be definitively discerned in a limited number of cases. Points with distal spalling, perhaps combined with a *Not original Text Page 10 of 24 February 16, 2026

stress fracture above the hafting element, may be understood to have suffered an impact fracture. Tools recovered within a burial context may be identified as cached. Heavily recycled forms that cannot practically be further reduced through percussion or pressure flaking to yield an acute edge angle may be identified as exhausted tools. However, complete forms with light or no use-wear are commonly recovered at sites in contexts that do not explicitly indicate caching. When a discard motivation is ambiguous, “indeterminate” should be selected among the alternatives provided below. Incidental Discard Incidental discard includes actions that removed objects from their systemic context by means other than manufacturing error, caching, or use (see Schiffer 1972), such as through dropping or misplacing them. However, this category of discard is a theoretical construct, the objective identification of which cannot be systematized. Thus, it is not included as an analytical option for assessing discard. 16. Alteration (choose dominant form) Material alteration addresses the transformation of structural and compositional properties that occurs as the result of natural and cultural processes. Natural processes include chemical and mechanical weathering, often resulting in patina or material decay. Thermal alteration is an example of material alteration through cultural processes. An accurate assessment of thermal alteration is often inhibited by artifact size, patina formation, and unfamiliarity on the part of the researcher with some of the lithological variability expressed by select raw materials. Lithic raw materials typically undergo significant and detectable lithological changes with prolonged exposure to heat. Such changes are often desirable and may be deliberately generated by tool producers through controlled firing. Heat- treated materials may be more easily worked by the artisan as the process renders low-quality materials more knappable (albeit while making them more brittle and decreasing their durability). The identification of heat-treated materials brings culture process and the details of economic activity to the fore. Nonetheless, it is frequently difficult to distinguish purposefully treated materials from those that were incidentally burned. Incidental firing occurred in antiquity through controlled vegetation burns, as well as the occasional burning of middens or other cultural deposits. Historic-age and modern incidental firing may have resulted from burning off surface vegetation when preparing land for cultivation of pasture. Lithic assemblages often exhibit other forms of material alteration that can obscure the study of raw material properties. The most common of these is the development of a weathering rind that is often identified as a white patina. The rind may be semi-translucent to opaque and is typically less than 3mm in thickness. The development of a yellow to reddish brown “stain” may also develop on lithic artifact surfaces in iron-rich soils. The chemical processes that lead to the development of black (often dark blue) patinas is not completely understood. They most often occur in inundated deposits. Carbonate deposits and pigment staining occur rarely, the former being most common in coastal areas and the latter more common in ritual contexts. *Not original Text Page 11 of 24 February 16, 2026

17. Edge morphology (D & L & R) Please indicate the shape of the working edge of the tool. Measuring from a line strung between edge termini, an edge is characterized as very convex if the distance from the cord to the maximum outward projection of the edge is greater than or equal to 5mm. Similarly, an edge is considered convex if the distance from the cord to the maximum outward projection of the edge is between 4.9mm and 2mm. Edges are considered straight if the maximum inward or outward projection of the edge from the cord is no more than 1.9mm. An edge is considered concave if the distance from the cord to the maximum inward projection of the edge is between 4.9mm and 2mm. An edge is characterized as very concave if the distance from the cord to the maximum inward projection of the edge is greater than or equal to 5mm. An edge is considered recurved if the maximum outward projection of the edge from the cord is greater than or equal to 2mm, and the maximum inward projection of the edge from the cord is also greater than or equal to 2mm. 18. Flake scar pattern Flake scars are the impressions that remain on the face of a flaked stone artifact which are produced by the detachment of flakes during tool manufacture. The pattern of flake removal may offer important insights relating to the distribution of design templates and techniques of manufacture, as well as offer a means by which to observe variability in production design at different spatial scales. [Indeterminate] a flaking pattern cannot be determined. [Collateral] a flaking style that is characterized by parallel flakes emanating from opposing edges which meet in the center of the blade, forming a median ridge. [Horizontal transverse] a flaking style that is characterized by horizontal, parallel flake scars emanating along one edge, traveling across the face of the blade, and terminating at the opposing edge. [Oblique transverse] a flaking style that is characterized by long, diagonal, parallel flake scars emanating along one edge, traveling across the face of the blade, and terminating at the opposing edge. [Random] flake removals do not reflect an aesthetic template in their distribution or alignment. [Not applicable] (expedient flake tools are one form of tool that will not exhibit a flake scar pattern). *Not original Text Page 12 of 24 February 16, 2026

19. Edge construction type Edge construction type references the location and form of preparatory edge construction on the objective piece. There are a variety of ways in which an edge may be constructed on a chipped stone object. The most basic choice is between bifacial and unifacial constructions. Such choices carry implications for accurately assigning tools to a subgroup, distinguishing between techniques used during production, assessing the foci of use, and determining the angle of the resulting edge. Variability may also occur among subtypes, potentially alluding to differences in raw material access, tool function, or nuances of social identity. For example, while the lateral margins of some Perdiz points are bifacially constructed, others exhibit unifacially beveled edges. The constructed working edge(s) of a tool may be characterized using the following descriptions: 20. Proximal edge grinding IV) Wear Patterning The following use-wear observations can be made macroscopically using an 18-20X jeweler’s loop, and is considered low-power magnification. Low-power magnification is assumed to imply magnification between 18x-power and 100x-power. This portion of the protocol has not been designed for high-power magnification and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Use-wear characterization using low-power magnification has been shown to successfully identify the range of motion an object was used in, and, to a lesser degree, the hardness of the contact material. High-power magnification is generally needed to accurately identify contact material and detect finer details of object use. The low- power use-wear characterization advocated here will find its greatest utility in quantifying the presence or absence of use, identifying the area of use on a specific piece, and in identifying variability in use among specific artifact types and subtypes. The use-wear categories described below are not mutually exclusive – tools may exhibit more than one form of wear. Edge modification is not always the product of material use. Other natural and cultural processes, such as trampling and archeological excavation, have been shown to produce edge modification similar to that developed through actual use (McBrearty, et al. 1998; Shea and Klenck 1993; Tringham, et al. 1974). Such processes obviously affect the recognition of some patterns of wear more than others, and may be particularly relevant for detecting true use- wear on simple detachment-based tools. Distinguishing use- derived flake terminations along the lateral margins of tools is perhaps the most equivocal functional assessment; although Odell and Odell-Vereecken (1980) state that the patternlessness of such incidental attrition is detectable and, thus, can be distinguished from actual use-wear with a high level of accuracy. Tools may exhibit a form of polish in deflationary zones derived from aeolian processes, and may exhibit battered edges within fluvial deposits. Given the possibility that edge modification derived from trampling or other processes, “attrition” use wear should only be record for artifacts that exhibit both a distinct, clustered pattern of edge alteration and worn or polished facets in the area of proposed use. While this undoubtedly underestimates the actual amount of use-wear exhibited throughout the assemblage, it substantially increases the accuracy with which positive determinations were made. The degree of expedient tool use within an assemblage provides one means by which the level and importance of material conservation may be evaluated. Regions characterized by a scarcity of utilitarian lithic raw materials have been shown to exhibit higher levels of material recycling. Careful attention to and recording of use-wear may also provide important information related to spatial and temporal variability expressed within tool classes, types and subtypes. 21. Flaking attrition Material mass is often removed from the working edge of a tool during the process of use. Much of this attrition is in the form of small flake removals that typically exhibit feathered or stepped terminations. Accurate recording of use-derived attrition requires an analyst to distinguishing these removals from trimming flakes that are detached along a tool’s edge in the final preparation stage prior to use. Use-derived attrition can often be distinguished from preparatory trimming as it creates a more obtuse edge angle in the area of use than is expected based on observing edge characteristics elsewhere on prepared, but unused portions of the tool. Use-derived attrition may also remove areas of polish that have developed along tool margins, which may also produce sharper facets that contrast in the area of use with more polished and rounded facets. *Not original Text Page 13 of 24 February 16, 2026

Data is coded to record the presence and location of flaking attrition as its distribution on a tool form is a significant indication of tool function. Observations shall be recorded as follows: NPR [Not present] Use if flaking attrition is not observed. BFD [Bifacial-distal] Use if the working edge of a tool is located along the distal margin and attrition is observed on each face (dorsal and ventral). BFB [Bifacial-bilateral] Use if both lateral margins exhibit use-derived attrition and the attrition has resulted in removals on both faces. BFU [Bifacial-unilateral] Use if only one lateral margin (left or right) exhibits use-derived attrition and the attrition has resulted in removals on both faces. BDB [Bifacial-distal-bilateral] Use if both lateral margins and the distal margin exhibit use-derived attrition and the attrition has resulted in removals on both faces. This option will be select if one of the lateral margins exhibits unifacial attrition. BDU [Bifacial-distal-unilateral] Use if only one lateral margin (left or right) and the distal margin exhibit use-derived attrition and the attrition has resulted in removals on both faces. BFC [Bifacial-circumferential] Use if the lateral margins along the entire circumference of the tool form exhibit use-derived attrition and the attrition has resulted in removals on both faces. UFD [Unifacial-distal] Use if the distal margin exhibits use-derived attrition and the attrition is observed on only one face. UFB [Unifacial-bilateral] Use if both lateral margins exhibit use-derived attrition and the attrition has resulted in removals on only one face. UFU [Unifacial-unilateral] Use if only one lateral margin (left or right) exhibits use-derived attrition and the attrition has resulted in removals on only one face. UDB [Unifacial-distal-bilateral] Use if both lateral margins and the distal margin exhibit use-derived attrition and the attrition has resulted in removals on only one face. UDU [Unifacial-distal-unilateral] Use if only one lateral margin (left or right) and the distal margin exhibit use-derived attrition and the attrition has resulted in removals on only one face. UFC [Unifacial-circumferential] Use if the lateral margins along the entire circumference of the tool form exhibit use-derived attrition and the attrition has resulted in removals on only one face. UBO [Unifacial-bilateral-oppositional] This form of attrition is most typically found on tools used as drills or awls. Use if both lateral margins exhibit use-derived attrition and the attrition has resulted in removals along the opposing margins of each face. OTH [Other] Use if none of the above apply and enter a description in the text box provided. Figure 13: Examples of lateral edge flaking attrition.

22. Crushing 23. Smoothing Crushing and smoothing describe the form of wear attained through battering, grinding, or polishing. The tool is typically blunted through battering or abrasion against a hard contact material in the process of use. Crushed working surfaces may be a normally achieved trait with little effect of tool utility, such as with hammerstones. Alternatively, crushed surfaces may be an undesired consequence of use and material attrition that necessitates edge resharpening. Smoothing is typically the result of intensive abrasion and is commonly observed on tools used for grinding, polishing, or burnishing (uncommon among chipped-stone tools). Once identified, the distribution of this wear should be recorded using one of the following descriptions: 24. Polish The use-wear category “polish” describes lustrous areas on the tool, typically located at the distal or lateral margins, but occasionally noted on medial surfaces. Record polish as “shallow” when it is restricted to within 5mm of an edge. Define polish as “deep” when it extends beyond 5mm from the edge of its origin. The origin of polish is not well understood despite having been the subject of generous scholarly attention (Odell 2001). Research into the nature of use-polish is generally focused either on the patterns of polish formed on stone tools as the result of a specific set of activities (cf. Aoyama 1999; Keeley 1977, 1980; Semenov 1964), or on the genesis and composition of polish itself (Fullagar 1991; Grace 1996; Odell 2001). In controlled studies where specific tool forms were utilized in a defined set of prescribed behaviors, researchers have had considerable success in correlating patterns of polish distribution and composition with the specific activities that generated its development. However, studies have also shown that a diverse set of activities may produce virtually identical patterns of use-polish (Lewenstein and Walker 1984). Researchers have also found that specific patterns of polish development do not correlate well with isolable tasks on multifunctional tools (Clark 1988). It is perhaps best to consider that the form of the tool, the raw material used in its manufacture, and the patterns of wear (in any form) observed will provide a range of functional possibilities and limitations for how the tool was used in a particular cultural and techno- environmental setting. Three processes other than primary contact during use may cause the development of a lustrous sheen, and they should not be recorded as use-derived polish. The first, hafting polish, develops through secondary, use-associated contact. Hafting polish is formed through the tools contact with a hafting element or fastening material. Hafting polish, when present, will typically manifest on both lateral and medial surfaces nearer the proximal end of a tool. Hafting can also be associated with worn, ground, or otherwise blunted *Not original Text Page 15 of 24 February 16, 2026

lateral margins. Evidence for hafting should be nominally recorded separately from use-wear (see #26 below). The second process that inhibits the detection of use-derived polish is thermal alteration. In extreme cases, lithic material will become vitrified through over-exposure to heat, producing a lustrous sheen that covers the surface of the artifact and resembles use-derived polish. Grinding, the third process, is a specialized manufacturing technique that results in the development of a luster across the ground surface. The luster forms through the extensive abrasion required in the production process rather than from use. 25. Etching / pitting Etching and pitting refer to striations or small cavities produced through abrasive contact (Semenov 1964). As with polish, such markings may occasionally derive from production techniques, although this is generally only a concern for tool forms featuring ground or pecked and ground bits. Etching and pitting are better studied microscopically. The macroscopic techniques used in this study are useful for detecting moderate to deep scarring and abrasion that are characteristic of working soils with a significant sand content, but they may have less utility in detecting wear left from working in clayey soils. Striations (etching) may be located along either the distal or lateral margins of the tool. When located at the distal margin they most often run perpendicular to the edge. The extent to which they proceed from the distal margin across the face of a tool can provide some measure of how far the tool penetrated into a contact material. When located along the lateral margins striations more typically run parallel the edge. Striations may be created through quarrying, soil working, planing, polishing, grinding, or any extended lateral movement across a hard or abrasive surface. 26. Hafting evidence Hafting may be identified through lateral edge dulling toward the proximal end of the tool form, polish along the proximal lateral margins and proximal facial facets, and the residual presence of a masticate such as asphaltum. Note the presence or absence of this evidence. V) Raw Material 27. Lithology The lithologic character of raw materials should be identified to the best, most accurate extent reasonable. The lithic analyst should specifically identify materials only to the extent that they are certain that the information provided is accurate. The most common raw materials have been coded for use. Materials not included in the list provided should be coded as “other” and specifically identified in the text field provided. 28. Source identification The source areas provided below represent those commonly identified in available literature, but the list is by no means exhaustive (see Banks 1990; Turner and Hester 1999). The identification of lithic raw material source is intended to provide a means to address issues of resource mobilization. However, many issues exist in accurately identifying source areas. For example, Uvalde Gravels contain a good amount of Edwards Chert. The raw material source area should be identified to the most accurate level possible without unsupportable speculation. It is expected that raw material source areas will not generally be identifiable. In general, raw material sourcing is assessed using visual identification for chert, chalcedony, and quartzite artifacts as chemical characterization studies have not been reliable in determining source areas. Successful identification of specific resource outcrops is often impossible, but some confidence regarding the general can be gained by matching artifacts (formal tools and debitage) to geological samples taken from individual resource outcrops (ex. Edwards, Alibates, Maravillas, Ogallala). Relevant criteria to consider in matching archaeological materials to geological samples include lithology, material hardness, relative grain size, color, the presence or absence of banding and other irregularities, and the presence and composition of micro-fossils and other inclusions (cf. Morrow 1994). In most instances, determining the area of procurement depends on artifact mass as only large pieces will retain enough compositional character to distinguish between geographically discrete resource areas. *Not original Text Page 16 of 24 February 16, 2026

I) Debitage 3. Completeness Sullivan and Rozen (1985:759) have advocated using the analytical categories “complete flake”, “broken flake”, “flake fragment”, and “debris” for the study of flake assemblages, and have illustrated the tendency for each to be represented in different proportions at various stages of manufacture (see also Baumler and Downum 1987). There are many variables that undermine the utility of this approach. Landscapes used for pasture or cultivation, particularly in near-surface deposits, are highly susceptible to trampling and to disturbance by agricultural machinery. Either agent will distort the ratio of complete to broken flakes in such contexts. The movement of artifacts in vertic soils or within contexts characterized by erosion and re- deposition, root disturbances, and ancient cultural disturbances such as area maintenance (to name only a few) are equally likely to affect this ratio. Interpreting manufacturing stage through the percentage of whole vs. broken flakes requires preservation of integrity, in both individual specimens and the original composition of the assemblage, with little post-depositional alteration. Due to the rarity of such an occurrence, the interpretive worth of the categories advocated by Sullivan and Rozen find their greatest utility when used with experimental assemblages. This protocol does not require that only those flakes within an assemblage that retain a striking platform (whole and proximal flakes) be included for data collection and analysis. While this would reduce spurious data produced through post-depositional processes, distal flake fragments may be excluded from analyses by most statistical packages. 4. Platform The striking platform of a flake is the point of contact where the percussor initiated the flake detachment. The morphology of the platform can yield valuable information pertaining to the stage of manufacture represented by the flake, which in turn reflects the presence, character, and organization of activity areas. Platform morphology can also inform production technology (Andrefsky 1998). Platform types should be recorded as indeterminate, cortical, flat, complex, abraded, faceted, multifaceted, and rejuvenated (cf. Andrefsky 1998:93-96). Cortical platforms are those that retain some amount of unmodified cortex, and are generally attributable of early production stages. Cortical flakes also generally, but do not necessarily, exhibit dorsal cortex beyond the platform. Flat striking platforms exhibit a smooth, un-faceted striking surface. Flakes detached from unidirectional cores generally exhibit flat platforms (Andrefsky 1998:94), although flakes with flat striking platforms may also be produced in the early stages of bifacial core reduction. Faceted striking platforms exhibit one or more facets, reflecting the removal of previous flakes from the same general area. Although researchers have had some success in determining manufacturing stage using facet counts (Mauldin and Amick 1989; McAnany 1988), time constraints and unresolved ambiguity in directly correlating facet count with manufacturing stage in an uncontrolled archeological sample undermine the desirability of including this finer resolution. A simple distinction between single-faceted platforms and multifaceted platforms is advocated in this protocol. Flakes that exhibit bifacial mass removal, often referred to as bifacial thinning flakes, are categorized as having complex platforms. Abraded platforms are those that exhibit attrition caused by purposeful edge preparation procedures. Such platforms are generally rounded or ground in appearance, and often exhibit multiple tiny step fractures. Marginal abrasion is a common practice for preparing a striking platform, and serves as a method of altering the direction of percussor force, which produces a more predictable flake removal (Andrefsky 1998:96; Whittaker 1994). Abraded platforms are produced in all phases of tool manufacture, but are more common in later stages of production. Finally, rejuvenated platforms reflect tool resharpening and often display remnant use wear along a focal margin. Assemblages dominated by rejuvenated platforms indicate tool maintenance rather than tool production. Indeterminate identifications generally result from poorly represented (fractured) or wholly absent platforms, or from poor resolution caused by heavy patina. To be clear, it is not desirable to record platform width and thickness or the number of facets present on the dorsal surface of flakes. These attributes are not efficiently recorded through mass analysis procedures, and the information they provide may be ascertained through other means, such as multivariate analysis incorporating the percentage of dorsal cortex present with flake size and platform type. *Not original Text Page 20 of 24 February 16, 2026

Platform Type Platform Description Illustration missing Flakes are defined as having missing striking platforms if they are flake fragments or shatter that are missing the proximal segment of the flake that includes the point of fracture initiation. cortical Flakes with cortex observed on striking platforms are generally produced in the initial stage of package reduction. flat A single facet, caused by a single previous flake removal, characterizes this type of striking platform. Flat (single faceted) platforms are common in early stages of decortification, and are common to blade manufacture when combined with notably abraded edges. dihedral-faceted A surface having or formed by two intersecting faces. Assemblages dominated by flakes with double faceted platforms are generally produced in early stage blank production. multifaceted Multiple facets are observed on the platform but only along one face of the object. Light abrasion may or not be present. Assemblages dominated by flakes with multifaceted platforms are generally associated with later stages of biface reduction but can also be present in early stage biface reduction. abraded Abraded platform exhibit grinding that may obliterate facet ridges and/or exhibit platform edge smoothing/rounding visible to the naked eye or under low power magnification. Heavily abraded platforms are often “dull” or smooth to the touch. Abraded platforms serve to strengthen a platform edge allowing for the application of greater force loads thus increasing successful flake propagation and decreasing platform failure by crushing or collapse. complex Complex platforms exhibit pressure or light percussion scars on the proximal- dorsal flake surface originating from the platform edge. These scars are typically associated with precision platform preparation (i.e., isolation and orientation) of late stage bifaces where manufacturing failure rates increase proportional to width to thickness ratios. rejuvenated Rejuvenated platforms are indicative of recycling and will typically exhibit worn edges and remnant polish. *Not original Text Page 21 of 24 February 16, 2026

indeterminate In some instances, the platform type will not be determinable even when the striking area is present. This is typically caused by crushing of the platform at the instant of production, or by post-depositional weathering. 5. Orientation 6. Curvature 7. Cortex 8. Size-grade Sort all debitage by size-grade using nested sieves with 1-inch, ¾-inch, ½--inch, and ¼-inch apertures. Size-grade analysis offers an alternative to taking standard metric measurements of maximum flake length, width, thickness (cf. Andrefsky 1998: 96-100) that substantially increases the efficiency with which large samples may be studied (Ahler 1989). When combined with supplementary data, such as the percentage of dorsal cortex present and platform type, size-grade analysis provides researchers with valuable information regarding production trajectory, the method and organization of raw material procurement, technology of production, production efficiency, and the level of material curation (Ahler 1989; Baumler and Downum 1987; Behm 1983; Bradbury and Franklin 2000). 9. Thermal Alteration Thermal alteration is used here to describe the process of purposefully subjecting lithic materials to a heat source as a means to affect raw material properties. Lithic raw materials typically undergo significant and detectable lithological changes with prolonged exposure to heat. Such changes are often desirable and may be deliberately generated by tool producers through controlled firing. Heat-treated materials may be more easily worked by the artisan, thus rendering low-quality materials more useful (albeit while making them more brittle and decreasing their durability). An accurate assessment of thermal alteration is often inhibited by artifact size, patina formation, the production of comparable attributes through incidental fire exposure, and unfamiliarity on the part of the researcher with the lithological variability expressed by select raw materials in their natural state. The identification of heat-treated materials can bring culture process and the details of economic activity to the fore. For example, the presence of thermal alteration in combination with an assessment of platform type *Not original Text Page 22 of 24 February 16, 2026

and cortex representation can indicated the trajectory stage at which the objective piece was heat- treated. Nonetheless, it is frequently difficult to distinguish purposefully treated materials from those that were incidentally burned. Given the inherent difficulty with distinguishing between materials were purposefully heat-treated (cultural process) as opposed to fire-affected (incidental alteration resulting from both natural and cultural processes), debitage should be recorded as thermally altered, not altered, or indeterminate with regard to alteration conservatively and through incorporation of ancillary data. Identifying alteration on pieces with insufficient mass is unreliable, and so all small-sized debitage that is not minimally captured by a ½-inch mesh sieve should be recorded as indeterminate. If a piece has been determined to be altered its context and association should be considered (e.g. if other artifact classes for the same context similarly burned the piece is more likely to have been incidentally fire affected). 10. Type “Flake” was defined as a sharp piece of stone with defined dorsal and ventral surfaces and, if the platform was present, a series of attributes that delineate the striking point that removed the flake from the core. In contrast to flakes, which can be oriented, the term “shatter” was applied to angular blocky chunks of stone, with or without cortex, that do not exhibit ripple marks or other indications that permit orientation of the specimen. Whole and proximal flake portions that retain the striking platforms were subdivided into core or biface thinning flakes. The distinction was not based on a single attribute, but rather on an impression of a cluster of attributes. Core Reduction Flakes tend to be thick, with salient bulbs, steep platform-to-dorsal surface angle, and no ridge crests across their platforms. In contrast, bifacial thinning flakes tend to be thin, with acute platform-to-dorsal surface angle, one or more ridges on the platform surface, and occasionally a lipped surface. The classification of core and biface thinning flakes indicate the range of reduction present onsite. Medial and distal flake fragments lacking a platform were classified as indeterminate. Blades are special kinds of flakes that typically are twice as long as wide, but they also refer to a reduction strategy and the use of specific kinds of cores. Notching flakes are a relatively rare kind of small flake with a concave-convex platform. They are produced during the attempt to add notches to projectile points during initial manufacture. Tool rejuvenation flakes reflect a special kind of knapping in which a flake was struck along the margin of the working blade in order to remove a series of overhanging resharpening flake scars (Shafer 1970). Typically, they are narrow curving flakes that have distinctive flake scars along the dorsal ridge. The distinctive scars along the dorsal ridge can either be unifacial scars, many with step or hinge scars, or bifacial flake removals with comparable damage. 11. Lithology The lithologic character of raw materials should be identified to the best, most accurate extent reasonable. The lithic analyst should specifically identify materials only to the extent that they are certain that the information provided is accurate. The most common raw materials have been coded for use. Materials not included in the list provided should be coded as “other” and specifically identified in the text field provided. 12. Source identification The source areas provided below represent those commonly identified in available literature, but the list is by no means exhaustive (see Banks 1990; Turner and Hester 1999). The identification of lithic raw material source is intended to provide a means to address issues of resource mobilization. However, many issues exist in accurately identifying source areas. For example, Uvalde Gravels contain a good amount of Edwards Chert. The raw material source area should be identified to the most accurate level possible without unsupportable speculation. It is expected that raw material source areas will not generally be identifiable. In general, raw material sourcing is assessed using visual identification for chert, chalcedony, and quartzite artifacts as chemical characterization studies have not been reliable in determining source areas. Successful identification of specific resource outcrops is often impossible, but some confidence regarding the general can be gained by matching artifacts (formal tools and debitage) to geological samples taken from individual resource outcrops (ex. Edwards, Alibates, Maravillas, Ogallala). Relevant criteria to consider in matching archaeological materials to geological samples include lithology, material hardness, relative grain size, *Not original Text Page 23 of 24 February 16, 2026

color, the presence or absence of banding and other irregularities, and the presence and composition of micro-fossils and other inclusions (cf. Morrow 1994). In most instances, determining the area of procurement depends on artifact mass as only large pieces will retain enough compositional character to distinguish between geographically discrete resource areas. *Not original Text Page 24 of 24 February 16, 2026
