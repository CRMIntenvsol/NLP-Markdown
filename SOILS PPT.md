Soils and Sediments

Soils and Sediments

●Soil is NOT a deposit, but a
modification of parent
material (rock or sediment).

●Sediment is a deposit.

●Archaeological
Significance:

●Helps to locate potential

sites

●Provides evidence of

past climate and
environmental conditions

●Archaeological
Significance:

●Covers sites
●Provides evidence of
the past environment

Sediment Deposits

4 types

Lacustrine

• Shoreline
• Center of Lake
• “Humid” lakes
• “Arid” Lakes

Lacustrine

• Shoreline
– Sandy

• Center of Lake

– Laminated clays

• “Humid” lakes
– Clay - sand
• “Arid” Lakes

– Evaporites (salts)

Colluvial

• Upslope erosion
• Transport down the

surface

• Accumulation at base
• Better site

preservation at base

Pyroclastic
(ash)

Ash “blankets” landscape

Can bury sites

Good for dating

Alluvial

●Channels

●Gravel and Sand
●High energy
●Poor site locations

●Floodplains

●Clay and Silt
●Low energy
●Good site locations

Clay

Silt

Sand

High and Low Energy

How soils form…

●MUST have STABILITY/TIME & WEATHERING
●5 factors that affect soil formation

●Cl-O-R-P-T

P = Parent Material (what the soil forms in)
Cl = Climate  -
O = Organics/Organisms
R = Relief (slope)
T = Time

Soil Horizons

● A Horizon-most intense
chemical weathering,
melanization =
darkening of organics

● B Horizon-

Red oxides, clay, salts

● C Horizon-slightly

altered parent material.

Forest Soils

Prairie Soils

Forest Soils

A Horizon:
Thin, light colored

(low organic content)

B Horizon

Thick, red (oxides)
clay-rich
High weathering, poor

bone

preservation

Light colored parent
material

Prairie Soils

●A Horizon
Thick, dark
(Lots of organic matter)

●B Horizon
Clay
White salts
(calcium carbonate)
good bone preservation

Color

Hue- dominant color (red-yellow balance)
Value- darkness or lightness
Chroma- intensity of dominant color

Consistence

• Stickiness- capacity for moist soil to stick to something

(clay)

• Plasticity- capacity for molding (clay)

• Smoothness – ((silt)

• Grittiness - (sand)

Texture
