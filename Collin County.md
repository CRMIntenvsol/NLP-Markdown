1.1.1 Collin County After the Republic of Texas was established in 1836, 180 million acres were opened for settlement. To entice settlers from the United States, large land grants, bounties, headrights, and premiums were issued out to those who qualified. One such landgrant was issued to William S. Peters, an English businessman who immigrated to the United States in 1827. Peters was an empresario (or immigration agent) who received several land grant contracts from the republic. The first of these contracts resulted in the formation of Peter’s colony (Figure 2.2). The terms of the contract required the empresario to recruit settlers from outside the republic at a rate of 200 families within a three-year period. In return, the colonists were to be granted 320 acres per single man and a maximum of 640 acres per family. The empresario was allowed to retain up to one-half of a colonist's grant as payment for services rendered, including land surveys and title applications. The empresario provided powder, shot, and seed and in some cases built settlers' cabins. The empresario also received 10 sections of premium land from the republic for every 100 families they settled (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958).

Although the endeavor of Peter’s colony was riddled with confusion of ownership and other difficulties, Collin County witnessed continued growth and economic stability throughout the early Republic of Texas years, and after Texas was annexed into the United States in December 1845. After Lincoln’s election in 1860, Texas secessionists called for a vote that resulted in a decree of succession. Most Collin County residents opposed the call for Texas to secede from the Union. In fact, Collin County opposed secession by a vote of 948 to 405. However, the people of Texas, as a whole, loyally supported the South. The popular vote was 46,129 to 14,697 in favor of secession and on March 5, 1861 Texas joined the Confederacy (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958). While Collin County was spared the horrors of invading Union troops, the civilian population still suffered. Practically every able-bodied man between the ages of 17 to 50 was in the army. Food was scarce and Union sympathizers, deserters, and criminals were a constant threat to the families left behind. Following the Civil War, hostilities continued during the Reconstruction Period as exemplified by the Lee-Peacock feud. Robert Lee, who was an ex-confederate officer, and Lewis Peacock, who was a Union sympathizer, were involved in one of the most prolific post-Civil War feuds in North-Central Texas. Although it is unclear exactly how the feud began, hostilities arose when Lee was kidnapped and extorted by Peacock and his supporters. Their feud terrorized what was known as the “Five Corners” region (corners of Collin, Grayson, Fannin, and Hunt) for four years (1867-1871) and ended with the death of both men (Hall and Hall 2009, Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958). It was not until the late 19th and early 20th century that the fertile nature of Collin County and North- Central Texas’ was capitalized upon, and became an important regional center for producing and processing cotton, wheat, and corn. Ancillary industries developed in association with these cash crops, including; grain elevators, flour mills, cotton gins, compresses, cotton oil mills, and a textile mill. Cotton developed as the key agricultural product for the region, and increased its stronghold, in 1872, with the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. Cotton producers no longer had to endure the slow overland transportation of their cotton to markets in east Texas, making cotton extremely profitable. Crop production continues in Collin County today, but its significance in the local economy diminished after World War II when cattle production and dairy farming became more common (Hall and Hall 2009, Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958). Collin County saw dramatic changes in the 1980s. The introduction of lighting industry and the sudden growth of the Dallas metropolitan area led to a more diverse economy focused on industry, technology, and services, and less on agriculture. This trend has continued to present day. Stambaugh, J. Lee and Lillian J. Stambaugh 1958 A History of Collin County, Texas. The Texas State Historical Association, Austin. Hall, Capt.
