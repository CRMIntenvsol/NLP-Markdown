SECTION I BACKGROUND TO THE INVESTIGATIONS by C. Reid Ferring Introduction This report describes the results of a multidisciplinary investigation of cultural resources and past environments in the Upper Trinity River Basin. The study has been conducted by the Institute of Applied Sciences, North Texas State University, and as part of a contract between NTSU and Alan Plummer and Associates. Alan Plummer in return is the prime contractor to the Ft. Worth District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and has been charged with preparation of portions of the regional resource environmental impact statement for the Upper Trinity Basin. Purpose As defined by the scope of work for this project, the preparation of the regional EIS for the Trinity River will be accomplished within the present study area through completion of several specific work items. These include preparation of an overview of prehistoric and historic culture resources and lastly, a geomorphological study of the study area. These three tasks and their integration into a unified piece of research represent only part of the overall objective of preparing an environmental impact statement. They provide the necessary database for interpreting the age, character, and paleo-environmental context of the cultural resources within the study area. other components of the environmental impact statement were addressed in different parts of this work. For example, another objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of past, present, and anticipated landuse activities on cultural resources sites in the study area. These objectives were addressed through aerial photograph analyses and onsite investigations of landuse activities. Second, a regional environmental impact statement must contain a summary of the previous investigations in the region, summarizing knowledge of prehistory and history and the level to which previous researchers have brought this region into concert with contemporary methods and theories in archaeology. The significance of specific cultural resources sites may be evaluated relative to the status of archaeological research and the state of knowledge concerning archaeological periods within the project area. Thus, previous researct in the project area and in the region surrounding the project area has been explicitly defined as an objective for this research. 1

Therefore, the principal purpose of the project is to assist in the formulation of a regional EIS. Specific objectives within that overall goal include the review of previous work, the nature of archaeological resources and historical resources within the study area, the relationships of past depositional environments as contexts for the archaeological resources, and an evaluation of landuse activities, both previous and anticipated. Project Area The area of investigation for this study has been defined on the basis of the 500-year flood elevation (Standard Project Flood) of the Trinity River Basin in Dallas, Tarrant, and Denton counties (Figure 1). This land area covers the majority of the floodplain and some of the low terrace exposures of the Elm Fork, West Fork, and main Trinity River. The geographic bounds within this area are best defined by the portions of the Trinity floodplain on the Elm Fork south from Lewisville Dam and on the West Fork east of the Fourth Street Bridge in Ft. Worth, Texas. The lower end of the project area is defined by the crossing of Interstate Highway 635 over the Trinity Valley in southeast Dallas county. The project area includes areas flanking major tributaries to the Trinity. On the Elm Fork and main channel of the Trinity, tributaries include Indian Creek, Denton Creek below Grapevine Dam, Five Mile Creek, and portions of White Rock Creek in the eastern portion of the project area. On the West Fork, principal tributaries considered include Fossil Creek, Village Creek below Lake Arlington Dam, Lower Bear Creek, and Mountain Creek below the Mountain Creek Lake Dam. The project area covers some 327 square kilometers (80,555 acres) and is situated in the midst of one of the most rapidly growing metropolitan areas in the southwest. Later in this report, the native condition of the area will be described as part of the environmental review. In addition, the nature of the impacts of growth on the development of the Trinity floodplain will be considered under landuse analyses (Appendix A). For the majority of this report, however, the project will be considered from a strictly geological and archaeological perspective: that is, as a major portion of the principal drainage of northcentral Texas, and a place where a complex and hitherto poorly studied record of past human activities and past environments is -contained in sediments deposited by the Trinity and its tributaries. 2

Nature of Previous Investigations Previous investigations in the project area have included archaeological, historical, geologic, and paleontologic studies of the natural history and human history of the upper Trinity basin. Each section in this report will illustrate that both avocational and professional researchers have over the years built a record of archaeology and past environments in the Upper Trinity. Yet, the summed character of these investigations has been shaped by a number of important factors, which will be briefly considered here. Foremost is the relatively incomplete literature concerning past environments and archaeology for this study area. In contrast to intensively investigated regions within the state or in other parts of the U.S., this portion of the Trinity Basin is not well described in the archaeological literature. The specific reasons for this are quite diverse. First, most of the reservoirs that exist in the project area were built before federal laws and/or federal funds were available to launch large-scale archaeological salvage projects. Examples such as Grapevine and Garza-Little Elm are testimony to this pattern. Certainly, federal reservoirs under construction today, for example, Joe Pool or Ray Roberts, have received adequate funding to study and mitigate impacts to archaeological and historical resources under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. But, by and large, most of the reservoir construction and highway construction in the area was conducted without adequate attention given to the study and/or preservation of cultural resources. In the absence of large-scale federal or state funded projects, the burden for archaeological studies has fallen largely on the shoulders of avocational archaeologists. As will be developed in detail later, the literature of the Trinity Basin shows a continuous contribution from local avocational archaeologists. Their efforts in finding, reporting, and studying archaeological sites is the principal source of information concerning the prehistory of this area. Only limited professional archaeological investigations have been undertaken. These include excavations at the only site that has been intensively studied (41DL234). This site was part of a field school conducted by University of Texas at Arlington. Numerous smaller surveys have been ~onducted by professional archaeologists, either through their universities or as consultants to fulfill small-scale environmental impact statement preparations. Overall, however, there has been no single project nor a combination of smaller projects, which were unified in method a~d theme, that have built a foundation of archaeological 4

knowledge concerning the age, character, and diversity of archaeological sites within the project area. Historical investigations in the area are, perhaps, equally as diffuse as those in the prehistoric arena. Local historians, both avocational and professonal, have slowly built a scattered literature concerning the nature of early settlements, the history of growth and development within the region, and the identificaton of specific historically important sites or buildings within the project area. Finding material evidence of historical sites has proven to be a challenging task. And again, the absence of large federally. or state funded projects and the absence of a continuous, concerted effort by historians or groups of historians is a causal factor. Therefore, the historical investigations in this region have been uneven if not eclectic. Geologic and paleoenvironmental investigations differ in character to a certain degree from those of the archaeological and historical ones. For the most part, these have been conducted by professional geologists, paleontologists and/or their students. Yet as will be shown later, these investigations also have been episodic and often quite limited. For example, there has been no doctoral dissertation completed on any portion of the project area which pertains to the Quaternary geology and environments of the Trinity. A number of master's theses have been completed that addressed either specific problems relating to geomorphology or paleontology. A number of maters degrees were granted at southern Methodist University based on preparation of quadrangle geologic maps that cover portions of the project area. Considering that within the Dallas/Ft. Worth area there are several major state schools and private universities, each of which contain departments of geology, the amount of work conducted on the Trinity is surprisingly small. From a historical perspective, most of the work was finished before 1955, and only certain paleontological investigations have been launched from a university base since that time. While the focus of geologists' research since the mid-50s turned increasingly to economic- and petroleum-related aspects of geology, the lack of interest in the Quaternary history of the T~inity and its tributaries is perhaps not so curious. Later in the report, the results of these investigations will be summarized and areas for future investigations will be outlined. A significant record of past environments and diverse geologic contexts for prehistoric archaeological sites is evident in the project area. Yet, this research base is disappearing rapidly in the face of continuing development of the Trinity floodplain. 5

Another dimension of p~evious work in the region is the level to which agencies at the federal, state, and local level have acted to fulfill legal obligations to define cultural resources jeopardized by landuse activities. This arena, referred to as cultural Resources Management (CRM), is one of the major considerations in this report in terms of previous investigations. Later, the specific agencies responsible for conducting CRM work in the project area will be identified, and the cumulative result of their surveys and site evaluations will be considered. Unlike a well-defined federal project such as a reservoir or highway construction area, the Trinity is dominated by private lands. Federal law requires environmental impact statements when certain federal monies or federal permits are used for certain activities under the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508). Therefore, it is evident that a diversity of agencies and a diversity of particular kinds of impacts, ranging from pipelines to housing developments, have been the focus for CRM work in the Trinity Basin. These projects, usually small surveys, have been completed by many local archaeologists. What is lacking in these separate efforts is a matrix of common objectives and common methods. Finding out who worked where has been a major obstacle to the completion of this report. In this regard, the present report perhaps represents an opportunity to establish some regional perspectives of the cultural resources in the project area and some regionally relevant questions and methods to guide future investigations. 6

SECTION II PROJECT OVERVIEW by C. Reid Ferring Objectives This project has focussed on the archaeological resources within a major part of The Upper Trinity Basin in Texas. Unlike many cultural resources management (CRM) investigations, this is not the final stage of an intensive archaeological study of a well-defined project area such as a reservoir. Rather, as the scope of work for the project has clearly indicated, this is a review of an area that has received sporadic and uneven archaeological attention over the last four decades. This project differs from other CRM projects in that the potential impacts and the nature of landuse activities in the project area are not guided by a single well-funded federal landuse activity, but rather by the diverse projects launched from the private sector, which continue to emerge along the Trinity River and its major tributaries. This last "central frontier" for commercial development within the Dallas/Ft. Worth metroplex has long been the subject of gravel and sand excavations and limited commercial development. Today, real estate prices in this region have escalated to the point that potential risks from flooding and the necessary costs to reclaim land formerly quarried for construction materials have overtaken the situation, and development now proceeds at a staggering pace. An intensive pedestrian survey of the entire project area would be exorbitantly expensive. The government's strategy in order to identify and potentially mitigate adverse impacts to cultural resources within the project area is to develop a comprehensive environmental impact statement that allows project-by-project evaluation of known and potential cultural resources sites. This report contains the most up-to-date summary of the known archaeological resources within the project area and the information which at present can best be used to predict sites in unsurveyed portions of the project area. Both theoretical and regional perspectives are necessary in order to define the status of archaeological and historical knowledge in the region. They are also necessary in order to evaluate the potential for past and ongoing investigations to make substantial contributions to the current theoretical 7

## Page 15

development of the discipline of archaeology. While theoretical interests, as well as research methods and techniques, evolve according to prevailing interests and even "fads," they do provide some baseline from which to launch research questions in an area such as the Upper Trinity Basin. Many of these questions are fundamental to the discipline of anthropological archaeology. They consider broad issues of human history such as adaptations to changing environments or culture change as a result of diffusion or migration. These kinds of broad issues must be suited to local culture histories and to records of local archaeological research. Theoretical issues at the discipline level, regional issues concerning culture history and the record of regional investigations are of fundamental significance to cultural resources management. The nexus between these archaeological issues on the one hand and the somewhat legal dimensions of cultural resources management on the other is the concept of significance. Difficult to cope with in many specific situations, the issue of significance in cultural resources management revolves around a decision made by both archaeologists and government officials concerning the relative merit of a cultural resources site. Potential impacts to cultural resources as a result of landuse activities subject to federal environmental laws can be quite easy to define'in physical terms; that is, the complete physical destruction of an archaeological site and its contained artifacts and features may be easily defined by reference to the engineers' plans for the project. what is to be done about such an impact is quite another question and hinges upon the consensus of opinion concerning the importance of the site and whether or not such federal regulations as 33 CFR 325 are applicable. Significance as defined by National Register criteria (36 CFR 900) includes the general notions of whether a site or building contains information that can be regarded as important to science or history. As mentioned earlier, what is important to science and what is also important to history are subject to change as an information base is accumulated within a region or as theoretical and methodological changes impact a discipline. It is incumbent on us as participants in the process of formulating an environmental impact statement for the known and predicted cultural resources within the project area to make our statement concerning which theoretical perspectives and what levels of regional archaeological research are pertinent to defining the potential significance of sites within the project area. This can only serve as a working tool for subsequent efforts by cultural resources managers. They will be charged with making site-specific 'and area-specific determinations with regards to specific measures taken to locate, evaluate, and 8

preserve/mitigate cultural resources that are threatened by development activities. A major part of our research strategy therefore is to develop a theoretical framework reflecting both individual research interests and a more objective assessment of comtemporary archaeological theory. This theoretical framework is the source for 'specific research questions that may be used to identify broad research methodologies in the project area as well as specific methodologies and techniques at specific cultural resources sites. Secondly, this report will contain the necessary regional perspectives mentioned above. Regional perspectives address both the apparent records of culture history in the region in terms of the nature of culture groups, their settlement patterns, their activities, and their apparent changes through time. This record of culture history provides a framework from which to evaluate specific sites. It facilitates identifying periods of time or cultural units that are poorly known or poorly documented by research in the project area. Additionally, the regional perspective identifies the kinds of methods and techniques that have been used in the region and evaluates these against contemporary standards for work in archaeology. In essence, the regional perspective establishes the status of archaeological knowledge in a region as a result of the cumulative archaeological efforts by professional and avocational researchers. The combination of a disciplinary perspective expressed in terms of archaeological theory and a regional perspective expressed in terms of archaeological knowledge provide a major portion of the information necessary to evaluate specific sites in terms of their significance. Methods Although each of the major sections of this report provides a more detailed description of the methods used for specific tasks, a general statement concerning our overall methods is warranted here. This project has the character of something between a literature review and an archaeological reconnaissance. No intensive on-the-ground surveys have been conducted. Yet, site-specific visits were formally included in the project. Therefore, our methods of data collection have been largely those of a literature review but were supplemented by some data collection methods that are not typical of literature reviews. These include the site visits just mentioned and more intensive geologic investigations. A geologic reconnaissance of the project area has been conducted, and a number of stratigraphic/soils profiles have been described to supplement available data concerning the geology of the Trinity Basin 9

pertinent to archaeological investigation. An additional difference between this study and a literature review has been a comprehensive analysis of landuse activities based on maps, aerial photographs, and on-the-ground inspections. These efforts have been made in order to identify the kinds of landuse activities in the project area and their potential impacts on known and predicted cultural resources sites. A number of informant interviews have been undertaken as part of this project. People in the region who have knowledge concerning the prehistory and geology of the project area have been contac.ted and interviewed. They have provided a wealth of information concerning locations of previously undocumented archaeological sites. They have provided background information on the kinds of research that have been conducted in this region in the last few decades, and they have provided valuable perspectives on the important issues surrounding the prehistory and history of this area-issues which are important in developing research strategies that may be implemented in the future. All of these tasks have resulted in "data" ranging from a collection of over 90 site survey forms to maps describing landuse activities based on air photo analysis. These forms of data provided the basis for our summary of archaeology and history in the project area and our recommendations concerning the nature of archaeological resources relative to present and future landuse activities. cultural Resources Management Issues As mentioned above, the Trinity River Project is significantly different in character than most cultural resources investigations. The basic difference is that in this case the federal government is charged with assessing the development of some floodplain and wetlands areas by private developers under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, Section 10 of the River and Harbor Act, and other applicable federals laws. Immediately, this scenario invokes differences from projects that are planned and funded by the federal government. First, there is no single comprehensive development plan such as surrounds reservoir construction or highway construction. This normal "plan" involves detailed engineering objectives and relatively clear cut landuse activities. These immediately translate into quite clear impacts or potential impacts on archaeological resources. The Trinity floodplain today is a prime gravel mining area and the subject of urban development including residential, industrial, and commercial building. Given the present status of these developments, it is clear that they will range from small, individually funded projects to projects impacting hundreds of 10

acres. The latter may involve the construction of new lakes, levees, roads, and structures with deep foundations. Many of these potential projects must be accomplished under a permit from the u.s. Army Corps of Engineers when it is determined that one is required. The nature of these developments and the relationship between the developers and the U.S Government is expected to vary with each permit application. Each request for a construction permit on the floodplain will become a new case in which the developer must reckon with the potential impacts of his project on the natural and cultural environment. It is expected that each developer will view his project quite separately from all the others. It is expected, therefore, that it will be difficult to build a sense of cumulative impacts as the Trinity floodplain is developed. It is imperative that each case involving potential impacts or even quite well-defined probable impacts to cultural resources be handled in a way that is fair to the individual developer and at the same time addresses the social, scientific, and educational significance of a specific cultural resources site. Despite the fact that the project area is under intensive development with private monies and that this expansive growth is a vital part of the local economy, the spirit and intent of the laws that cover our environmental and cultural resources must be addressed seriously. In Texas a number of uevelopers have already initiated, at their own expense, exemplary progFams that evaluate and in many cases mitigate the potential impacts of their private developments on private lands to archaeological and geological resources. This "best case" scenario will hopefully be expressed in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. Yet there are practical limits to such a system of voluntary compliance. We fully recognize that a small private developer may find mitigation costs to be incompatible with his planned development budget. How a demonstrably significant site threatened by a small-scale development is to be adequately studied and/or protected is a serious issue that challenges both the government and private sector. We offer no easy solutions to these potential problems in this report. Rather, we offer what we feel we can do best. That is, to provide a reasonable and considered opinion concerning the scientific, historical, educational, and social significance of the cultural resources sites ·that are known or that we can predict as being present in the project area. This in fact is an overview that can assist in formulating a balanced appraisal of significant archaeological sites. Only with such an information base can a program that combines preservation, avoidance, and when clearly necessary, mitigative efforts be formulated. 11

SECTION III THE UPPER TRINITY RIVER BASIN by Bonnie C. Yates and C. Reid Ferring Introduction Located in northcentral Texas, the upper portion of the Trinity River has its headwaters in Grayson, Montague, and Archer counties, forming three major tributaries that conjoin downstream from Dallas. Although other large creeks feed these tributaries (e.g., Clear Fork, Denton Creek, and White Rock Creek), it was the confluence of the Elm Fork and West Fork just above the East Fork that gave the river its name. The Spanish explorer Alonzo de Leon (ca. 1690) named the river La Santisima Trinidad (Most Holy Trinity) after its three major tributaries. From here, the river flows in a northwest to southeast direction, reaching the Gulf of Mexico at Anahuac and draining 17,969 square miles in its total length of 550 river miles. The Upper Trinity Basin is the northernmost portion of the river's watershed (Figure 3.1). The Trinity, between the Brazos and the Red, is a second-class river, developed on upland stretches of plain that separate the stream valleys of the two older rivers [Hill 1901]. It is identified as Zone 1 by the Texas Dept. of Water Resources for planning purposes [TDWR 1983]. In addition to the tributaries mentioned above, Mountain Creek, and Village Creek are included in TDWR's Zone 1, which constitutes more than half of the total area of the watershed and encompasses 23 counties. Elevation at the headwaters (Archer County, TX) is 1200 feet AMSL down to around 420 AMSL in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. Perennial flow is limited to the main channel and parts of the larger tributaries; otherwise, most of the creeks are considered intermittent to ephemeral [USDA-SCS 1979J. Narrow stream channels and rolling topography promote flash flooding during storm events in areas with rapid surface runoff. These flash floods occur frequently during the rainy seasons in the small secondary tributaries and upper reaches of larger tributaries but are generally of short duration. Extensive urbanization has aggravated flooding potential in the metropolitan areas as a result of alteration of drainage patterns [TDWR 1985J. 12

· As part of cultural resources investigation~ in the area, the natural environment is included in reports such as those by Sciscenti et al. [1971], Coster et al. [1972], Lynott [1977], Richner and Bagot [1978], and Bennett et al. [1981]. These comprehensive investigations of archaeological resources in all or large areas of the Trinity watershed likewise contain valuable information on the environmental setting. For example, contributions of J.E. Ubelaker and W.F. Mahler [Sciscenti et al. 1971] cover the zoological and botanical resources, respectively, in great detail for the entire stretch of the Trinity. The survey of environmental and cultural resources directed by J. E. Coster of Stephen F. Austin State University [1972] offers in depth reports on archaeology, geology, biology, ichthyology, ornithology, mammalogy, and forest hydrology for most of the watershed. A section in Mark Lynott's dissertation (SMU) [1977] summarizes the natural environment of most of the river basins in northcentral Texas·. Shaw's environmental overview of the Trinity Basin [in Richner and Bagot 1978] deals with channel variability and lithic resources as well as the major vegetation zones of the entire basin, even though the archaeological reconnaissance concerns primarily sites in the Middle Trinity Basin. The report by Environment Consultants, Inc. [Bennett et al. 1981] is the most recent and provides an abbreviated but adequate description of the natural setting in the Dallas Floodway Extension, which comprises the lower third of the present study area. without replicating their findings in total, the following descriptions have been extracted primarily from these volumes in addition to other sources. Environmental Setting of the Study Area The land between the 96th and 99th meridians in North Texas has been the subject of various environmental assessment. Hill [1887, 1901] discussed the differences of the timbered belts and interspersed prairies of the region as "...unique, without analogy or counterpart. In topographic, economic, and cultural aspects, it is a distinct geographic region" [1901:62]. From a continental view, Fenneman [1938] places the area in his West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province. Dyksterhuis [1946, 1948] considers the vegetation as part of the midcontinental grasslands. Some researchers consider the entire Trinity Basin as part of the physiographic province known as the Coastal Plain [Stephenson 1949a; Mertes et al. 1972; Bennett et al. 1981]; others, however, place the northern reaches in the lowlands of the Great Plains province [Hays et al. 1972; USACE 1978]. In agreement with the latter, we consider the Upper Trinity as part of the southern Plains. 15

In short, the region is an immense ecozone in which the flora, and hence the fauna, are controlled by various edaphic and climatic factors that come together there. As a transitional area, therefore, the Upper Trinity River Basin is difficult to succinctly categorize. The interdigitation of forest belts and grasslands, along with their geologic underpinnings, has been the object of research, if only descriptive, since the mid-1800s [See Hill 1887; Dyksterhuis 1946]. The geology and paleoenvironment and cultural development of the study area are discussed in detail elsewhere in this report; modern climate, vegetation, and fauna are treated in this section. Climate. The project area has hot, humid summers; rainy fall seasons; cool, sometimes icy winters; and windy, rainy springtimes. Officially, temperature records for the area indicate an average mean temperature of 65 F, average maximum daily temperature of 77 F, average minimum daily temperature of 56 F, with maximum record of 114 F (June 1980) and a minimum record of -1 F (January 1985): 1938-77 1931-69 D!FW Denton Annual Avg. Daily Temp. Max. 76.1 F 77.5 F Min. 55.2 F 52.9 F Annual Avg. precip. 32.10 inches 31.99 inches Monthly Avg. 2.60 2.67 Rainy Months Apr. 3.97 Apr. 3.81 May 4.57 May 4.86 Avg. Total Snowfall 2.90 1.90 [Dyksterhuis 1946; Ford and Pauls 1980; Ressel 1981] Precipitation patterns are irregular, trending to a cycle of flood and drought [Brown 1979]. For example, the drought of the early 1950s was broken by 3 months of sporadic heavy rain totalling 28.8 inches; more recently, the record heat wave of 1980 was followed by record flooding (30 inches in 1 month in Pilot Point) the next spring. These incidents of extremes are accompanied by climatological side effects: dry summers are usually the hottest, exceeding 100 F for weeks on end; early spring torrents stimulate budding only to be thwarted by late freezes. 16

This moisture pattern is a general characteristic of the plains area. wedel [1941:6-7; 1961:32] has shown that precipitation on the plains is quite complex, in terms of amounts annually, amounts on a single occasion, occasions annually, and areas of receipt. Moreover, the random, unpredictable periods of debilitating dryness have considerable antiquity. [Marmaduke 1975] Vegetation. The study area consists of three vegetation zones from east to west: the Blackland Prairie, which dictates the soils and plants characteristic of most of Dallas County; the Eastern Cross Timbers, which includes portions of Denton and Tarrant counties in the project area; and the Grand Prairie, upon which some sites in eastern Tarrant County are found. The slightly tilted plain of the Blackland Prairie slopes imperceptibly toward the Gulf Coast and is dotted with low rounded hills. Early European settlers were dependent on cisterns and ponds for water because there are few running waterways in this fertile region [Hill 1901]. The decomposition of grasses produces humic acid that acts upon the underlying marls and chalks and forms the black calcareous clay soils from which the prairie gets its name [Hill 1901]. High fertility of these normally water absorptive soils has attracted increased cultivation and hence erosion has become more pronounced. Urbanovsky [1972:27] states, "... the Blackland Prairie exhibits the highest average rate of erosion in the Trinity River watershed. Severe erosion in cultivated areas is the major source of sediment. In many of the smaller watersheds, sediment deposition on densely vegetated streambanks has increased flood frequencies as much as 50% through reduction of channel capacities." According to Nixon and Willett [1974], the natural condition of the prairie had been dominated by grasses such as little blue stem, big bluestem, sideoats grama, switchgrass, and Indiangrass. Other grasses include hairy grama, Texas grama, buffalograss, switchgrass, dallisgrass, dropseed, smutgrass, and wintergrass. Along the stream courses, overstory species include hackberry, oaks, elms, cottonwood, ash, and willow; underbrush consists of grapes, berries, peppervine, honeysuckle, hawthorne, and trumpetvine; sedges, wildrye, and paspalum are also present in wet areas, whereas, the prairie grasses occupy drier areas [Shaw 1978J. 17

Along the western border of the Blackland Prairie, the soil becomes increasingly sandy as the substructure grades into the Eastern Cross Timbers. The relief is that of a greatly dissected dip plain, which is almost level in the east and broken into low hills in the west [Hill 1901]. Some authorities lump the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers and Grand Prairie into a single vegetative zone called Cross Timbers and Prairies, not wishing to distinguish either type of vegetation as the ultimate climax vegetation [Urbanovsky 1972; Gould 1975]. It is quite possible that the climax is a mixture, with rolling to hilly, deeply dissected terrain having rapid surface drainage and a wide variety of soil types and vegetation cover [Urbanovsky 1972]. Dyksterhuis [1948] argues that the Cross Timbers specifically is a true woodland representing an extension of the East Texas Austroriparian and dependent on the aquiferous Woodbine Sands, which permit greater penetration of moisture than the clayey soils of the surrounding prairies. Early travelers through the area remarked on the striking contrast of the grasslands and almost impenetrable forests that skirt them: Occupying east and west a belt of one hundred miles in width, with about equal quantities of prairie and timber, intersected by numerous clear, fresh streams and countless springs, with a gently undulating surface of prairie and oak openings, the most charming views, as of a country in the highest state of cultivation, and you are startled at the summit of each swell of the prairie with a prospect of groves, parks, and forests, with intervening plains of luxuriant grass. [Pope 1854] Where brush merges into woodlands, the oaks dominate (mainly postoak, blackjack oak, live oak, shinnery oak), and the understory consists of big and little bluestem, lovegrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, and many kinds of forbs and legumes. In the bottoms, floodplain trees in the Cross Timbers consist of elms, ash, pecan, cottonwood, sycamore, black willow, and soapberry; understory vegetation includes coral berry, greenbriar, and various frutescents such as haws, hog plum, and dewberries. The Grand Prairie is located south and west of the Eastern Cross Timbers. It gently slopes into steeply rolling hills farther south of the project area and consists of shallow, 18

stone-laden soils that support medium to tall grass vegetation. Almost half of the original prairie still exists and is scattered as tame pasture or meadow throughout the area [Urbanovsky 1972]. The soil is more shallow, and the decreased rainfall makes the land less suitable for agriculture than the Blackland Prairies. According to Hill [1901:72], The chief difference between the two regions is that the Grand Prairie is established upon firm, persistent bands of limestones, which are harder than the underlying clay substructure of the Black Prairie region, and which, under erosion, result in more extensive stratum plains and more angular cliffs and slopes. The virgin tall and mid grass pra1r1e between the timber belts has been described as luxuriant, lush, and indescribably beautiful, especially in its abundance of wildflowers [Greer 1935]. After 1860, the dominant influence on the vegetation was an increased intensity of grazing cattle, and with the peak stocking rates of 1890, the vegetal composition and productive capacities deteriorated immensely [Dyksterhuis 1946]. In relict areas of the Ft. Worth Prairie, a subsection of the Grand Prairie in our study area, Dyksterhuis [1946] reports that little bluestem (Andropogon scoparius) was the principal climax dominant. other species include sideoats and hairy grama, wintergrass, Indiangrass, dropseed, and perennial three awns. A recapitulation of the data on relict perennial grasses, based upon stature, indicates coverage by mid grasses of 77.37 percent while coverage by tall, and short grasses is 7.52 and 2.50 percent, respectively. [Dyksterhuis 1946:14] To summarize, Tables 3.1 and 3.2 contain data from by the Dallas Museum of Natural History and Texas A&M University, respectively, compiled by Mertes et al. [1972] and reproduced here for reference. Nixon and Willett [1974J intensively sampled various plant communities along the West Fork and main stem below Dallas as well as the rest of the Basin. Shaw's [1978] chapter on the biota of the Trinity River Basin provides and excellent overview of biological research conducted in the area. The final EIS for floodwater retarding structures in the watershed [USDA-SCS 1979J adds information regarding critical habitats and threatened plants, stating that there are no threatened nor 19

endangered plant species or critical habitats in the watershed; however, five plants have been identified as proposed for listing, and at least eight species on the Rare Plant study Center list may have distributions into the project area (Table 3.3). Olin McCormick et al. [1975; Gilmore and McCormick 1982] has compiled a compendium of aboriginal uses for 56 plants collected from the project area; he also reports approximately 30 different types of mushrooms or fungi found in his summer collection. The USDA report also notes the presence of Maximilian sunflower, engelmanndaisy, gayfeather, sundrop, and prairieclover as sources of color and variety to the diets of foraging animals and birds. Fauna. The metroplex lies within Blair's [1950] Texan biotic province (Figure 3.2). Blair's provinces generally consist of discrete geographic areas within which distinct plant and animal communities exist; however, the Texan province is more like a giant ecotone where species reaching their eastern and western extremes overlap. It is a rich and diverse area with 49 species of mammals, 39 species of reptiles, 20 species of amphibians, and 239 species of birds have been listed from the Tennessee Colony study area alone [Coster et al. 1972]. Species diversity is relatively low in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area as a result of habitat reduction and modification. Cosmopolitan bird species, such as sparrows, grackles, blackbirds, starlings, robins, cardinals, and bluejays are fairly abundant. In the floodplains, coyotes, raccoons, squirrels, rabbits, skunks, opossums, and armadillos may still be found. Aquatic faunas are greatly affected by water pollution, and studies reported in the General Design Memo for the Trinity River Project [USACE 1978] cite the presence of pollution-tolerant species only: carp, gar, shad, mosquitofish, red shiner, and bullhead catfish; no game fish were recorded. Some additional fishes currently known in the study area are listed in Table 3.4; a list of fishes from the Clear Fork tributary west of Ft. Worth is included as representative of Trinity fishes from less polluted waters. Invertebrates and zooplankters in the Upper Trinity are likewise pollution-tolerant species: pulmonate gastropods, chironomidae, and tubificidae among others. Terrestrial invertebrates include representatives of most major groups, including the almost ubiquitous presence of the introduced Argentine fire ant (Iridomyrex humilis), a health factor to consider in any hand-excavation activity, and an agent of bioturbation in sediment profiles. Historically, the region' was inhabited by bison, black bear, mountain lion, gray wolf, pronghorn antelope, passenger pigeon, wild turkey, and Carolina parakeet [USACE 1978; Schmidly 1983].

cultivation and unrestricted hunting pressures have pushed these species completely out of northcentral Texas, if not to the verge of extinction. "Like that of the passenger pigeon, the bison's demise was relatively sudden. commercial hunters took such a heavy toll in North Texas that after 1880, except for stragglers, only captive animals remained" [Doughty 1983:64]. Nevertheless, habitat for some species has actually been upgraded by improved pastures and range practices: quail, dove, and rabbits are common small animals still hunted in the area at times. Tables 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 list additional mammals, birds, and herptiles found in the Upper Trinity River Basin. Lynott [1977:37] reports that plant and animal resources were not particularly numerous in the uplands of the native prairie and Cross Timbers; the bottomlands supported a greater variety of resources, including the all-important deer, raccoon, opossum, rabbit, squirrel, and wild turkey. Shaw [1978:30] remarks that in the Blackland Prairie "...most larger food-yielding game species would have concentrated in greater numbers within the bottomland forest zone. This would have been especially true during fall and winter when acorns began to be dispersed and when a number of fruits first ripen." Seasonal resources include migratory birds, especially waterfowl which feed along the margins of ponds, spawning fishes, most amphibians and reptiles, which are more active in warmer seasons, vegetable materials (berries, fruits, and nuts), and insects [Marmaduke 1975; McCormick et al. 1975]. The tall and mid grass prairies probably did not support large herds of bison or pronghorn which prefer short grass prairies found farther west. Hornaday [1887:426] lists several grasses consumed by bison, but the only one cited by Dyksterhuis [1946] as remaining in a sampled relict prairie (Grand Prairie) was Andropogon scoparius, which would have at least supported straggling herds. Neither bison nor pronghorn have been recovered from archaeological sites in the project area in appreciable numbers; deer is by far the staple meat protein source. Because of such sparse and poorly dated evidence for bison here, it is impractical to assess the temporal presence / absence scheme of Dillehay [1974] with regard to the study area. Many of the sites described in the present study report faunal remains (Table 5.3); with the exception of isolated deer, bison, and turtle remains, the vast majority are remains of shellfish. Read [1954] records 30 species of unionids in Dallas County and credits the wide variety of stream bottoms to this diversity. "Shellfish could be collected at low water periods from pools in the creekbeds or streams themselves" [Lynott 1977:36]. The identity of the shellfish remains from archaeological sites is unknown at this time, but mussel 27

SECTION IV LATE QUATERNARY GEOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTS OF THE UPPER TRINITY BASIN by C. Reid Ferring Introduction The scope of work for this project outlined a program of geologic study including literature reviews, informant interviews, as well as field work that would address the last 20,000 years of geologic history for the Upper Trinity Basin. This time frame was established because it is within this range that all probable archaeological occurrences would fit. Sediments containing archaeological sites by their very nature offer the potential to reconstruct the depositional environments that prevailed at the time of occupations. Post-depositional and post-occupational histories of weathering and disturbance can selectively alter archaeological records within and between sites. Additionally, sediments contain other forms of primary evidence concerning past environments including vertebrate faunas, invertebrate faunas, plant macrofossils, and pollen. The purely archaeological reasons for establishing the geologic context of archaeological sites in the Trinity Basin are therefore quite clear. Another compelling reason to conduct this study, however, involves site prediction. In an area that has not been the subject of intensive archaeological surveys, it is important to establish, when possible, the age of sediments and land forms within a project area as part of the site prediction process [Gardner and Donahue 1985]. For the above reasons, a review of previous work concerning the geologic and environmental history of the Upper Trinity Basin has been conducted. In addition, a field reconnaissance of terraces and exposed stratigraphic cuts was implemented during the early stages of the project. Interviews were conducted with several local researchers knowledgeable about the Trinity's geologic history, and subsequently, detailed section descriptions from several terrace exposures in the project area were completed. By any means, this entire effort must be viewed as a reconnaissance study. The Trinity and its terraces clearly contain a rich and important record of past environments and at 32

the same time, constitute the context for archaeological sites in the basin. However, the review of previous work, as well as the results of our own studies, suggests what was perhaps obvious from the onset: this geologic record is complex. It must be studied from an interdisciplinary point of view and with a team of researchers qualified to address each of the several dimensions of this complex geological record. Therefore, while certain contributions to the geologic study of the Trinity's Late Quaternary history have been made by this project, perhaps our most important conclusion has been reached in terms of defining the kinds of work that need to be done in the future in order to resolve the details of stratigraphy, geochronology, and past environments. The contexts for archaeological sites extend beyond the perimeters of artifact distributions themselves. The terraces, sediments, soils, and paleontologic materials contained within these constitute an important resource in themselves, a resource which may be used to reconstruct past environments and past landscapes. From such a vantage point, prehistoric occupations may be best interpreted. This geologic resource, including sediments containing artifacts and those which do not, is disappearing rapidly in the face of floodplain and terrace development. Gravel and sand quarrying activities spanning most of this century have taken their toll on archaeological sites and geologic records. Concurrently, they have provided important exposures and allowed geologists and paleontologists the opportunity to see stratigraphic cuts that would be otherwise unavailable for study. As gravel and sand resources have been depleted, however, we now see that those areas, as well as unquarried portions of the floodplain, are now being used for commercial and residential development. It is almost possible to say that the time to conduct detailed mapping of terrace surfaces is past. It is probably equally safe to predict that within the next decade serious geologic studies within the project area will be impossible. There simply will not be opportunities to investigate surficial or buried deposits. It is therefore important to recognize the sediments and their contained evidence for past environments and past occupations as resources in themselves, resources which need to be preserved and/or studied prior to their perhaps inevitable obliteration. This section of the Trinity Basin report is divided into several sections reflecting the structure of our inquiry. First, the history of investigations is reviewed in order to establish the nature of geologic and paleontologic studies of the Trinity Basin sediments. Secondly, the results of all previous studies will be summarized in terms of fundamental geologic problem areas 33

including geomorphology, stratigraphy, and geochronology. Next, the results of our own study will be described and related to the summed evidence of previous investigations for a geologic history of the last ca. 20,000 years in the Trinity Basin. Lastly, conclusions will be presented that describe the present status of knowledge concerning Trinity's Late Quaternary history and the lines of inquiry that we feel should be followed with respect to future investigations. As stated above, the ultimate objective of these investigations is not purely geologic or environmental in focus, but rather is intertwined with the archaeological objectives of this entire project. The Late Quaternary geology of the Trinity is viewed here as a part of the archaeological record. It is in fact the context for evidence of past occupations and also the context for independent evidence concerning past environments. Within these contexts, archaeological sites may be evaluated and compared in the process of reconstructing the culture history and cultural ecology of the Upper Trinity Basin. History of Previous Investigations In a land with little water and with as intriguing a natural history as the state of Texas presents, it is truly remarkable how little attention has been paid to the geologic investigation of her rivers. The Trinity is no exception in this respect. It has been studied more than some and less than others, but in the final analysis, the geologic history of the Trinity is very poorly known. Perhaps the reason lies in the oil wealth of the state which has attracted geologists away from historical geology and Quaternary geology to more lucrative fields. Regardless, the last 85 years have yielded a scant page full of names indicating research interest in the Upper Trinity's geologic history. The vast majority of these investigations have been conducted by faculty or students from Southern Methodist University. others include the venerable Robert T. Hill, who touched practically every dimension of Texas geology, some nonlocal researchers such as Stovall and McAnulty [1950J, and W.W. Crook and R.K. Harris, local avocationals, who conducted notable investigations. Together this truly small group of individuals over a period of some eight decades have accumulated a literature that is accommodated easily by a small briefcase. This is not a derogatory appraisal, however, for single quadrangle maps [which were produced in abundance by SMU masters students during one period] represent true geologic sweat. These maps are worth numbers of articles or monographs. Nonetheless, this literature betrays a comple~, fascinating and potentially enlightening ~eologic history that can and should serve as a focus for research lnterests in the future. 34

Practically all geologic stories in Texas begin with Robert Hill. One of the products of his efforts in the late nineteenth century was the tome entitled "Geography and Geology of the Black and Grand Prairies and Cross Timbers, Texas" [Hill 1901], with detailed description of the Cretaceous formations and special reference to artesian waters. This work represented the culmination of some 18 years' investigation of the prairies of central and northcentral Texas and Oklahoma by Hill and his students. It is a remarkable document, fully readable and rich with geologic, geographic, and environmental information. The geologic map Hill provides is still one of the most intriguing in the history of Texas geology, particularly his interpretation of structural elements along the Red River Basin. It provides some of the earliest descriptions of the rivers draining Northcentral Texas, relating them to bedrock morphology, climate, soils, and vegetation. Towards the end of World War I, county geologies for this region were being published by the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin. Most of these make scant reference to Quaternary deposits, and most of those references in turn relate primarily to the economic potential of sands and gravel contained in river terraces. The inkling of a more than passing interest in these young sediments is found in Shuler's [1918] geology of Dallas County. After defining the economic significance of gravel and sand deposits in the county, Shuler goes on to indicate, by photographs and descriptions, the interesting sedimentary records of these rivers, commenting on faunas within the sediments and alluding to the potential to define the Cenozoic history of these streams. Shuler was later to continue this interest and to seed his own interests in students. Very shortly after Shuler published his geology of Dallas County, he urged Lull [1921] to publish faunas that had been found in sand pits on the south side of Dallas. Lull's paleontologic description of large vertebrate faunas from that locality is one of the earliest in the state and the first for the Trinity River. This article was to become the first of a continuing series of investigations into the well-preserved vertebrate and invertebrate faunas contained within the terraces overlooking the Trinity Floodplain. Not long after in 1923, Shuler again published an important discovery, the Lagow Sand Pit. This sand quarry, which had been described in his 1918 geology, is located near modern Fair Park in southern Dallas. The discovery of a human skeleton by excavation crews at that locality exceeded great interest in the possibility of finding human remains associated with extinct 35

Pleistocene faunas. Eleven years later shuler [1934] published again on fossil elephants in the Trinity alluvial deposits. This time his audience was archaeological, and Shuler aptly noted the possibility of discovering artifacts in association with probiscidean remains in Dallas County. In this respect, Shuler is one of the first archaeological geologists in the history of Texas archaeology, advising archaeologists on what contexts the finds might occur in and what to do when such finds might arise. In the following year, shuler [1935] provided the first earnest publication concerning the Quaternary geology of the Trinity. Shuler describes the intent of his paper in its abstract as one that "presents the larger facts concerning the terraces of the Trinity River in Dallas County and points out some of the more important problems to be solved in future studies" [Shuler 1935:44]. Shuler indeed began the study of the Trinity with this paper. He describes basic geomorphic processes in terms of terrace deposition and its relationship to headwards cutting by streams. He describes the geomorphology of the principle terraces evident in the vicinity of Dallas, compares them to terraces of other Texas rivers, and summarizes the work of Carter [1924] on the terrace soils. The latter study, incidently, is the last major investigation other than county soil survey preparation of terrace soils along the Trinity. In the same issue of Field and Laboratory [the now out-of-print publication by Southern Methodist University that contains a large portion of the published information on the Trinity], one of Shuler's students, Kelsey, provided a detailed description of the Marsalis terrace in the vicinity of Dallas. The ~ast pre-war effort devoted to the study of Trinity terraces was an important one by Patillo [1940] who described the terraces in the Carrollton area. The next decade and a half of research on the Trinity follows a pattern perhaps typical of most geology programs in the U.S. The war years were dominated by interests focusing on petroleum and mineral exploration to serve the war effort. The post-war years were devoted to offering basic undergraduate educations to returning veterans, and in the succeeding few years, the products of graduate studies in geology are evident. Graduate students in geology, needed in abundance to serve the post-war needs for oil exploration, were apparently graduated in substantial numbers by Southern Methodist University. Between 1948 and 1953, many of the quadrangle maps (Figures 4.1, 4.2) in Dallas County were prepared by graduate students (Table 4.1). Because of the interest in Quaternary geology by some of the faculty, those students assigned to map areas containing Trinity terraces dealt with these in terms of their geomorphology and potential correlations. They were assisted by independent researchers in the region. For instance, Dodge [1952], whose primary objective 36

was to describe Woodbine stratigraphy near Arlington, provided some mapping information concerning West Fork terrace deposits. An important study downstream by Stovall and McAnulty [1950] described three terraces and their Pleistocene faunas. Lastly, Taggart's [1953] synthesis, which resulted in a geologic map of Dallas County, explicitly addressed the terrace system flanking the Trinity and summarized previous work by SMU students and others (Figure 4.3). Taggart's work built upon the cumulative efforts of many others and remains the most comprehensive geomorphological summary of the Trinity River terraces. It has not been succeeded by any detailed geomorphic investigations, the main reason probably being that Taggart concluded that the major problems yet to be resolved concerning the Trinity River's alluvial history required detailed stratigraphic, soils, and geochronological studies. His work was in effect a terminus for geomorphic attempts to resolve the Trinity's depositional history. The next major turn in Trinity studies was the publication in 1957 of the discovery of a Pleistocene fauna at the Lewisville Site [Crook and Harris 1957]. As a result of some 5 years of both avocational and professional collection of vertebrate and invertebrate fossils from the borrow pit located near the juncture of Hickory Creek and the Elm Fork of the Trinity, this investigation·culminated in the discovery of several artifacts including a Clovis spear point and several hearth-like features that were contained in Pleistocene deposits at that locality. This site made contributions not only to the paleontologic study of the Trinity, but also resulted in new stratigraphic descriptions. Not the least of the results of this work was the beginning of a continuing controversy concerning the age and context of the clovis spear point. It should be added, however, that publications by Crook and Harris on Lewisville are part of many contributions this team made to Trinity River archaeology and geology. One subsequent publication by Crook [1961J reviewed again the terrace chronology for the Trinity and described a model concerning the context of archaeological materials in the terrace sequence. Beginning in 1959, the impact of Bob Slaughter's paleontologic investigations dominated the literature on the Trinity for nearly 10 years. Slaughter, his colleagues, and students actively pursued vertebrate and invertebrate fossil localities in the Trinity terraces and published descriptive monographs and interpretive summaries of the Late Pleistocene history of those deposits. These include identification of new taxa [Slaughter 1959, 1960] or first occurrences in Texas. They included relatively exhaustive summaries of faunas recovered from the "Hill-Shuler deposits" in the "T2 terrace" [Slaughter et al. 40

1962; Slaughter and Ritchie 1963; Slaughter 1966]. Interspersed during these "Slaughter" years were contributions from others involving Pleistocene fishes [Uyeno and Miller 1962] and molluscs [Cheatum and Allen 1963]. Slaughter also contributed to studies on the East Fork [Slaughter and Thurmond 1965]. An important work on the East Fork of the Trinity [Thurmond 1967] was one of the first to give balanced attention to the sedimentary and paleontologic data contained in East Fork terrace deposits. Closing the period of relatively active study of Trinity terraces and paleontologic data was a thesis by Willimon [1970; 1972]. This study, like that of Thurmond involved stratigraphic descriptions as well as systematic descriptions of recovered Pleistocene faunas. Willimon's thesis differed from earlier studies in that it provided a number of radiocarbon ages for the sediments containing the Late Pleistocene faunas. The last publication dealing with the Quaternary geology of the Trinity is one of few dealing with the West Fork, and one not produced by an SMU student. Yu [1974] studied the West Fork sediments from a point of view of granulometry, mineralogy, and organic chemistry. In the last 10 years, active research on the Trinity's geologic history has waned considerably. Some studies of terrace sediments and soils have been conducted in conjunction with archaeological projects to the south of the Dallas area [Raab 1982b] and in association with the Lakeview (Joe Pool) project on Mountain Creek [Pheasant 1982]. A renewed investigation of the Lewisville site was conducted in the late 1970s by the Corps of Engineers and the Smithsonian Institution. This team, taking advantage of the lowest levels of that lake since its construction, were charged with defining the age and context of the archaeological features and artifacts at that site. By way of summary, there are several important dimensions of the history of investigations of the Late Quaternary geology of the Trinity River. First, almost all of the work conducted on the Upper Trinity has been restricted to the Elm Fork. Only Dallas County portions of the West Fork have been seriously investigated, and these were done so mainly because they occurred in Dallas County. Therefore, no detailed correlations between terraces or sediments between the Elm Fork and the West Fork have been attempted. Parenthetically, the same condition prevails for archaeological research on the Elm Fork and West Fork. Secondly, the work conducted on Trinity sediments and terraces has been dominated by two major thrusts, one concerning the geomorphology and correlation of the terraces, the second being the paleontologic study of faunas contained primarily within the "T2" terrace. As will be described below, these two major tasks have dominated researchers' interests in the Trinity. 42

Very little attention has been paid to reconstructing sedimentary environments through detailed analysis of sedimentary facies or the geometry of sediment bodies within and between terraces. Little attention has been given to systematic subsurface coring to define bedrock benches and potential bedrock channels. Very scant radiometric evidence is available concerning the ages of the terrace deposits. Virtually no soils work of any serious character has been conducted, save for the recent work in association with archaeological projects mentioned earlier. While these do constitute shortcomings to our abilities to interpret the Trinity's geologic history, it is perhaps somewhat consoling to compare the available literature on the Trinity with that of other rivers in the region. The number of studies published on the Trinity for example vastly outnumbers those for the entire Red River, one which even in Hill's [1901J scheme was a river of much greater antiquity and therefore of perhaps greater historical interest than one of Hill's "class-two" rivers such as the Trinity. With this perspective in mind, the discussion will now turn to a summary of the previous investigations with respect to the major geologic and paleoenvironmental dimensions of the Trinity's history. These discussions will build towards a review of the present study's findings and an overall summary of available information concerning the last 20,000 years of past environments in the Upper Trinity Basin and the relationship these environments have to the preservation, character, and research potential of archaeological sites contained within Trinity sediments. Synthesis of Previous Geologic Investigations The subject of this section of the report is a synthesis of the investigations described above with the aim of identifying the major geologic and paleoenvironmental evidence for conditions that prevailed in the Upper Trinity Basin over the last 20,000 years and at the same time to define the geomorphic, stratigraphic/soils deposits that pertain to that time period. As mentioned above, the time range of this consideration (i.e., the last 20,000 years) is that within which any probable archaeological occupations of the valley are expected. Ideally, this discussion should concentrate on well-dated sediments that encompass this 20,000-year age. The reason why this relatively straightforward approach could not be taken will become clear as the following discussion unfolds. 43

The review of Late Quaternary Trinity geologic history will begin with a brief overview of the studies concerning the entire Quaternary in the study area. Then, the identification of a tentative 20,000 year old "time line" will be undertaken. Following this discussion, younger deposits presumably within the time period of interest will be considered in terms of their geomorphology, stratigraphy, depositional environments, post-depositional weathering, and geochronology. The Trinity Terraces: A Resume Many of the published works cited above have dealt with geologic mapping and/or identification and correlation of Trinity terraces. These investigations, conducted mainly in Dallas County, have spanned a number of decades and have resulted in a significant portion of the literature concerning the Trinity River's history. Any review of these separate publications, including the debates concerning correlations, is bound to leave the reader somewhat confused. This situation has been created by several conditions. First, it is entirely likely that the Trinity's terraces are not perfectly matched. Second, it seems likely that terrace surfaces in many cases grade gently one to the other, making their identification tentative if not somewhat arbitrary. Third, some of the correlations and terrace identifications proposed by various workers have been strictly geomorphic (i.e., based on elevations above present stream grade or present floodplain), whereas others have combined geomorphic and stratigraphic observations in order to establish a terrace nomenclature. No systematic coring programs have been undertaken in order to define the elevations of terrace surfaces, their internal lithology, and the elevation of bedrock benches that underlie the terrace deposits. And last, there are few radiometric dates upon which to base a Late Pleistocene and Holocene geochronology. An additional factor is the near absence of any soil studies that would help give a relative age to land surfaces along the Trinity. Together, these shortcomings have created a problematic situation for the student or independent reader. The names and elevations of terraces along the Trinity provided by a number of workers over the past few decades are provided in Table 4.2. While certain names obviously appear in the schemes of several researchers, comparisons of the elevations and in consideration of their stated correlations, one to the other, make any unification of these schemes difficult if not impossible. Many of these workers appreciated the difficulties in correlation as they describe their terrace sequences. other workers have been confident enough to revise and synthesize. 44

Foremost among these have been Taggart [1953] and Crook and Harris [1957]. The former is significant in that Taggart's study involved the most comprehensive review of all previous mapping exercises within Dallas County. His map is essentially a summary of his own work as well as the combined efforts of those cited above (Table 4.1). Crook and Harris's scheme [1957] is important because it has dominated the archaeological literature for the Trinity over the last 20 years. It is also been adopted in the course of certain paleontologic investigations [Slaughter et al. 1962; Slaughter 1966J. The scheme of Crook and Harris is also important because it contains what is the apparently earliest evidence for human occupation in the Upper Trinity Basin. The Pemberton-Hill Lewisville (T2) terrace remnant situated on the right bank of the Elm Fork at its confluence with Hickory Creek contained a Pleistocene vertebrate and invertebrate fauna and a Clovis spearpoint. Since this discovery, the age and correlation of this terrace with others along the Trinity has been actively pursued [Slaughter et al, 1962; Slaughter and Ritchie 1963; Slaughter 1966]. Because this terrace has been described as that which contains the earliest artifact-bearing alluvial sediments in the Trinity Valley, it is a convenient if not necessary starting point for the subsequent discussions. Therefore, the "Pemberton Hill-Lewisville" terrace, using the terminology of Crook and Harris [1957], will be briefly discussed in terms of its age and potential as an artifact-bearing deposit. The Pemberton Hill-Lewisville Terrace ("T2") The Pemberton Hill-Lewisville Terrace (hereinafter refered to as "T2") received national attention when the discovery a Clovis spear point in deposits contained under this terrace surface was announced. Since that time, there have been several publications describing the faunas from these terrace deposits and correlative faunal materials from other Quaternary deposits along the Trinity and its tributaries [Slaughter et al. 1962; Slaughter and Ritchie ~963; Crook 1961]. Using the Lewisville Site as a reference section, the described stratigraphy of the "T2" terrace as presented by Crook is evident. The several formations in the "T2" deposit were named after important people who had worked on the geology of this region. The basal Hill gravels and the overlying "shuler Formation" were named for the earliest workers on the Trinity. At the top, the "Richards Formation" was also named for a Trinity geologist. This stratigraphic section has served as a reference for all subsequent publications on the "T2" deposits. 46

At the Lewisville Site, the "T2" deposits form a thick section of alluvium that may be traced for a number of miles upstream along Hickory Creek. Today, at least two good exposures of deep deposits that are grossly similar to the inundated Lewisville Site section may be observed upstream from the Hickory Creek arm of Lewisville Lake. These deposits show the alternate input of silicious sediments as well as carbonate-rich sediments derived from Cretaceous rocks farther upstream. The inheritance of calcareous parent materials in the "T2" terrace therefore is one of the dominant aspects of its lithologic character. The possibility that deposits of similar age, but with sediments derived from different source rocks, has not been given serious attention. In fact, a uniform stratigraphic appearance for the "T2" deposits has been presumed for all exposures along the Trinity. Another factor that is important in considering alluvial stratigraphy is the depositional environments of these sediments. The "TZ" section at Lewisville, like most others that have been observed in terrace deposits along the Trinity, fines upwards. In other words, all other factors being equal, the deposits appear to reflect waning energies and sequential deposition of bedload, then coarse-grained traction and suspension deposits, and finally in the upper portion of the terrace, thick suspension deposits. This fining upwards sequence is not at all atypical for sediments deposited on a floodplain. The combination of parent materials and depositional histories must be considered when stratigraphic correlations are made. The faunas recovered from the Lewisville Site suggested a Sangamon age [Slaughter et al. 1962; Slaughter 1966]. Correlations with faunas up and down the Trinity and at at least one tributary (Clear Creek) confirm that the faunas found within the lower Shuler Formation sands were roughly contemporary and were most likely of Sangamon age. At the time, Slaughter and others felt confident that an age of approximately 25,000 to 50,000 years was reasonable for these deposits [Slaughter 1966]. Today, a discrepancy between the accepted age of Sangamon deposits and those age estimates is evident, or the Sangamon-Wisconsin transition would be placed much closer to 80,000 years B.P.. In the older scheme, the two radiocarbon dates obtained for Shuler sands and the overlying Shuler clays were acceptable. The first date of 37,000 years B.P. was obtained on charred materials (which possibly included some lignite) from the Lewisville Site [Crook and Harris 1959]. The second date was obtained from shells located within "upper Shuler clays" from the Clear Creek faunal locality [Slaughter and Ritchie 1963]. This date of 28,840 + 4,740 years B.P. (SM-534) fell within the general range of the Sangamon at that time, although Slaughter and Ritchie were required to propose that the date might reflect an interstadial within the Wisconsin. 47

## Page 53

Together these two radiocarbon dates do not agree well with general interpretations of the faunas from clear Creek, Lewisville, and other localities described farther downstream. Comparisons with other faunas of the plains [Slaughter 1966; Hibbard 1970] suggest that the Hill-Shuler and Moore pit faunas (all of which are correlated within the ""T2"" deposits) are in fact of Late Sangamon or earliest Wisconsin age. A clear problem with this age assignment is the evidence for human activities at the Lewisville site. The clovis spear point and other artifacts (the others of which appear to have been found in less firm contexts than the Clovis spear point) clearly pose problems when Sangamon or Early Wisconsin ages are invoked. The issues surrounding the age and potential archaeological contents of the "T2" deposits will require substantially more information before any clear resolve may be expected. Several issues need to be addressed in any such investigations however. First, a consideration of the "T2" sediments with respect to depositional environments and lateral variability in those depositional environments is imperative. Elevating what are essentially sedimentary facies (i.e., the Hill gravels, the Shuler sands and clays, and the Richards "alluvium") to formational status defies standard stratigraphic principles. Until these depositional facies may be shown to have mapable horizontal extent and well-defined upper and lower stratigraphic limits, they should in fact be looked at as local depositional units, not as lithostratigraphic formations. In conclusion, the "T2" deposits of Crook and Harris are tentatively and tenuously correlated with the Travis School "T3" deposits of Taggart [1953]. These sediments, with diverse lithologic and pedogenic characteristics, occur sporadically along the Elm Fork, West Fork, and some of its principal tributaries. Radiometric and faunal evidence for the age of these terrace deposits are not in good accord, but all of them suggest an age that is well in excess of established ages for Clovis occupations in North America [Stanford 1983]. While the potential for pre-Clovis occupations in the Americas is still hotly debated and new evidence from South America continues to suggest ever more strongly that pre-Clovis occupations are in fact demonstrable with archaeological evidence, it is important to note that the principal artifact recovered from the Lewisville Site is indeed typical of the Clovis spear points that are very well dated elsewhere in North America to approximately 11,000 to 12,000 years B.P. While it is not possible to conclude that some Wisconsin- aged occupations of North America took place, there is no evidence to suggest that the Clovis spear point tradition persisted for more than a few centuries about 11,500 years ago. Therefore, the "T2" deposits of Crook and Harris are best looked at first from a geologic and paleontologic point of view. From 48

this view, they comprise a mid-Wisconsin to Sangamon deposit. Resolving the provenience of the Clovis spear point within these deposits it is not easily accomplished given that geologic interpretation. Turning now to the lower terraces of the Trinity, we will consider younger sediments as potential contexts for archaeological sites. The Lower Terraces of the Trinity The "T2" terrace was abandoned as the Trinity began a phase of major downcutting. The timing of this is naturally related to the age of the "T2" sediments themselves as well as the age of the youngest inset sediments below this abandoned floodplain. The terraces below "T2" have been classified by Taggart [1953] as the Union Terminal or his "T4" at elevations between 20 and 35 feet above the floodplain and the Carrollton or "T5" at elevations from 5 to 20 feet above the floodplain (Fig. 4.3). Tentatively correlated with these terrace classifications are Crook and Harris's [1957] Union Terminal-Carrollton or "Tl" terrace situated approximately 30 feet above the floodplain. Crook and Harris also mention a "Tl rise" approximately 15 feet above the floodplain, but pay scant attention to it in terms of its age or potential archaeological contents. These lower terraces are of increasing interest to archaeologists in that they are clearly younger than the "T2" deposits of Wisconsin or Sangamon age, and also they are of significance because archaeological materials occur on these terraces. The extent of Taggart's Union Terminal terrace (his "T4") is notable. It occurs in somewhat alternating fashion along the Elm Fork and along the main Trinity River in Dallas County. Fairly extensive areas occur along the south side of Denton Creek near Carrollton. Relatively continuous exposures are mapped by Taggart in the Farmers Branch area on the east bank of the Trinity. An extensive exposure of deposits is mapped in the Irving area near the junction of the Elm Fork and West Fork of the Trinity. Deposits occur on the south side of Dallas and then, with some regularity, along the west bank of the river below the confluence of the main fork of the Trinity with White Rock Creek. These distributions may also be seen on quadrangle maps prepared by Winn in the Carrollton area [1953; Fig 4.1] and in the Pleasant Grove area [Overmyer 1953; Fig 4.2]. The recognition of a geomorphic unit lower than Taggart's Union Terminal terrace is evident in Winn's map. His lowest terrace is correlated with Taggart's T5 or Carrollton terrace, 49

though it is less extensive than the Union Terminal terrace. In some places, it is contiguous with the higher Union Terminal terrace deposits and is always situated between those higher deposits and the present channel of the Trinity. In other cases, it occurs as isolated rises in the floodplain recalling the citations of Crook and Harris. Near Farmers Branch, Taggart mapped (following Winn [1953]) small exposures of this lowest terrace that are isolated from Union Terminal terrace deposits by what appear to be abandoned meanders of the Trinity. A similar type of outcrop is evident just south of Farmers Branch near where state Highway 114 crosses the eastern portion of the Trinity terraces. It is perhaps significant that near the confluence of the Elm Fork and the West Fork where the floodplain is broad, only small isolated remnants of Taggart's Carrollton terrace are mapped. In the constricted area near downtown Dallas where the Austin chalk is crossed by the Trinity and where the valley is narrowest in the project area, there are no outcrops of this terrace whatsoever. Farther downstream, Taggart's maps terraces at this elevation only below the second constriction at Dowdy Ferry Road and in fact, according to his map, it is a remnant of this terrace that severely constricts the Trinity valley at Dowdy Ferry. This constriction has potential significance to the Late Quaternary and Holocene history of the Trinity and will be considered later. Taggart's Union Terminal terrace had been recognized earlier by Shuler [1935] and later called the Farmers Branch terrace by Patillo [1940]. Taggart suggests the terrace is relatively undissected, and he considers it to be a distinctive geomorphic feature. The Carrollton terrace, on the other hand, appears to be both geomorphically and lithologically distinct from the Union Terminal according to Taggart. Mapped earlier by Patillo [1940], who named it the Carrollton Terrace, and later by Turner [1951J and Winn [1953J, it was called the Low Terrace. Crook and Harris [1957J apparently group these two terraces together under the Union Terminal-Carrollton Terrace designation ("Tl" by their scheme). While brief mention is made of the "floodplain or Tl rises," no other attention is paid to them in their report. The "typical" stratigraphy of Crook and Harris's "Tl" is described as 5 feet of basal gravels, 5 feet of red sandy clay (the Albritton clay), and 5 feet of unstratified sand (the Patillo sand). A number of deep stratigraphic cuts found in South Dallas County quarries in this locality provided Willimon [1970; 1972] with the opportunity to describe multiple sections of the floodplain deposits (Figure 4.4). At two localities, radiocarbon dates on these deposits were obtained that challenge previous notions concerning the antiquity of the Trinity floodplain. These stratigraphic sections of the faunas and the dates, bear strongly ,on the interpretation of the lower terraces in the area. 50

Willimon describes six sections in the Trinity floodplain which he interprets as being truncated "Tl deposits" (Figure 4.4). Each of these consists of fining upwards sequences of alluvium, each with basal gravels and overlain by crossbedded sands and clays. In one of the sections, the crossbedded sands are not present. In the upper portion of several of the sections are described what appear to be well developed soils. This is probably the "buried paleosol" described by Willimon [1970;1972J that occurs on these truncated deposits and which is covered in some sections by dark gray recent alluvium. The latter is dated to ca. 300 years B.P. [Willimon 1972J although no specific radiocarbon ages are cited. In Willimon's study area, the Trinity floodplain is considerably broader than in our study area farther upstream. These sections, in the vicinity of Bois D'arc Island and the adjacent areas flanking the high "T2" terrace, pose problems in correlation with deposits farther upstream. of particular importance here is the pronounced constriction of the Trinity near Dowdy Ferry Road (Figure 4.3). This constriction, like the one farther upstream near downtown Dallas and the one on the West Fork near the county line, must have been important in terms of past hydrologic regimes. Below the Dowdy Ferry constriction, a marked expansion of the Trinity floodplain is evident, suggesting that given similar supplies of sediment, depositional features below the constriction might have attained an elevation that was somewhat lower relative to the active channel than those in narrower portions of the valley. At the same time, it is possible that broadening of the valley enhanced fall-out of suspended sediments, thereby maintaining relative equilibrium between upstream and downstream localities. Nonetheless, the radiocarbon dates obtained by Willimon on these truncated terrace deposits are challenging. The three dates cluster between 20,000 and 22,000 years B.P. (Figure 4.4). These occur below the soil zone suggested by Willimon's profiles and in association with a Wisconsin-aged fauna of snails and the remains of a Bison antiquus. Willimon's stratigraphic correlation of these deposits with others along the Trinity is encumbered by the fact that he only recognizes three terraces. In this case then, his "Tl" must subsume both the Carrollton and Union Terminal terraces of Taggart. At the same time, his "Tl" should correlate with Crook and Harris' "Tl." This correlation contradicts work that Crook and Harris [1955] conducted very near Taggart's study area. Their archaeological investigation of the Obshner Site revealed early Holocene Scottsbluff spear points in the upper portion of a 52

terrace some 40 feet above the Trinity floodplain. Crook and Harris identified this as the "Union Terminal Carrollton terrace" principally on the basis of the "Albritton and Patillo Formations" in the upper portion of the terrace. The fact that the sloping terrace surface at this point stands some 40 feet above the floodplain is not addressed in their report. Taggart maps the Carrollton and Union Terminal terraces inset below the high sloping remnant of the Travis school terrace, the latter of which correlates with Crook and Harris' "T2." Geomorphologically at least, the higher terrace designation of Taggart and Willimon for the setting of the Obshner site appears most reasonable. Willimon's data suggest that the sediments underlying the floodplain are considerably older than might have been suspected given previous interpretations. The bedrock bench upon which all of Willimon's sections were described must have been cut some time prior to 23,000 years B.P.. This may be taken as a minimum age for the abandonment of the next higher terrace, assuming that the next higher terrace is in fact the "T2" terrace of Crook and Harris [1957]. This indicates that the Trinity's floodplain was incised through at least 35 feet of alluvium and up to 30 feet of bedrock. Because of the magnitude of this down-cutting episode, an age for the uppermost "T2" sediments of Crook and Harris of mid- Wisconsin to perhaps Sangamon may seem reasonable. Trinity Floodplain For many years, it had been assumed that the Trinity's floodplain was an entirely recent feature and was comprised of sediments that were no more than a few hundred years old. As described by Crook and Harris [1957]; the floodplain consisted of approximately 20 feet of channel exposures: the lower ten of which were bedrock, and the upper ten were comprised of alluvium that was deposited "but yesterday." More recently, it has been observed that not only are the Trinity floodplain deposits thicker than had been earlier proposed, but also that they were somewhat older as well. Willimon [1970;1972] described floodplain alluvium obtaining depths of up to 38 feet. From one undesignated locality, a sample of mollusk shells yielded a radiocarbon age of 2,280 +/ 280 years B.P. (W-1689). Willimon [1972:467] further proposes that the Trinity floodplain contains channel fill dating to approximately 10,000 years B.P. Willimon assumes (perhaps correctly but on little geological evidence from the Trinity itself) that some of the sediments on the floodplain must fill the gap between the 2,000-year-old channel fill and his 20,000-year-old truncated "TI" deposits. His correlation with 53

Sulphur River alluvia dated to approximately 10,000 years B.P. [Slaughter and Hoover 1963J is convenient but not demonstrated by stratigraphic observations. Indeed, the geologic record of the Trinity following abandonment of the "Tl" terrace is one of the most pressing issues relevant to the archaeology of the upper Trinity Basin. This issue will be returned to later. Willimon also describes in very general terms a paleosol that occurs on the Trinity floodplain presumably below the Dowdy Ferry crossing in the area of his fieldwork. This paleosol is described as occurring beneath alluvium dated to approximately 300 B.P. (no radiocarbon ages cited). This younger alluvium, which buries the paleosol, varies between 8 inches and 3 feet [Willimon 1972:466-467J. Without clearer definition, it is difficult to assess the potential stratigraphic significance of the soil or to relate it to other areas of the Trinity. Nonetheless, Willimon's study clearly suggests that the Trinity floodplain and its buried alluvia probably represent much more time and accordingly much more potential significance to the Late Quaternary and Holocene history of the upper Trinity Basin. A Reconnaissance of Floodplain and Terrace Deposits Along the Trinity River in Dallas, Tarrant and Denton Counties Introduction As part of this project, a brief reconnaissance was undertaken of the floodplain and terrace sediments and soils of the Elm Fork, West Fork, and Trinity River. The extent of the study area and its obvious geologic complexity limited ours to a very preliminary investigation. Nevertheless, the study was focused on the investigation of deposits within the Trinity Basin that dated to the last 20,000 years. As the summary of previous work has indicated, this is by no means an easy task. This work was facilitated by some of the previously published investigations of the Trinity but was encumbered at the same time by extensive commercial development and alteration of the Trinity floodplain and its terraces in the last 20 years. Methodology The methods used in this study were designed to meet the scheduling constraints of the project as well as some of the other archaeological and cultural resources management objectives of the study. The latter included archaeological site visits that assisted both the geological investigations as well as the archaeological ones and also ground truthing of the remote sensing landuse analyses. The principal activities as undertaken 54

in the course of this study were the following: Reconnaissance. Trips were taken to numerous portions of the study area in order to observe geomorphic features. We examined naturally occurring or previously excavated stratigraphic profiles as possible sites for detailed description and to accomplish above-mentioned archaeological and landuse observations. stratigraphic-soils descriptions. Following reconnaissance work, a number of stratigraphic localities were defined over the study area (Figure 4.5). Most of these were revisited and detailed soils-stratigraphic sections were described. The included sections were measured, described, and sampled for subsequent laboratory analyses. Some sections were simply measured and described without sampling. These sections occurred at localities containing archaeological materials, as well as localities devoid of such materials. Laboratory analyses. Sediment and soil samples collected in the field were analyzed at the Institute of Applied Sciences, NTSU. Analyses included particle size (sieve-hydrometer), organic carbon, and pH. In addition charcoal or soil samples were processed for radiocarbon dating. Map and core analysis. As part of the literature review, all available geologic maps for the study area were acquired. These included the several quadrangle maps sited earlier in this report from Dallas County as well as geologic maps prepared by Taggart [1953] and several geologic maps provided by the Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District. In addition, the geotechnical branch of the Corps of Engineers-Ft. worth generously provided numerous borehole logs. These came from three areas: the Ray Roberts Dam access in northern Denton County, the Lewisville Dam access in southern Denton County, and an extensive series of borehole logs from a previously planned levee project on the Trinity floodplain in the area between downtown Dallas and Dowdy Ferry Road. These borehole logs and the accompanying maps provided the opportunity to construct geologic cross sections at these three portions of the river. Interviews. One objective of this project was to interview persons who had previously worked on the geology of the Trinity River. Several of these people were contacted. Mr. W.W. Crook of Dallas generously provided his ideas information and spent one day taking the writer and Dan Prikryl to a number of localities along the Trinity River. Mr. Larry Banks also joined us for one day in the field examining localities along Hickory Creek and providing us with his knowledge and recommendations for further studies in this area. Mr. Bob Slaughter of Dallas Texas was 55

contacted concerning this ·project. He informed us that he is writing a summary of the Quaternary geology of the Trinity River for the Dallas Geologic Society at this time. We look forward to gaining his impressions concerning past and present ideas on the Trinity when that report is published. Investigations on the Elm Fork of the Trinity The lack of detailed geologic cross sections supplemented by drilled cores has hampered resolution of the stratigraphy of the Trinity River alluvia. A number of cores taken along the Elm Fork of the Trinity have been made by the US Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District as well as private concerns that are developing portions of the floodplain. The Fort Worth District generously provided borehole logs from three areas on the Elm and Main forks on the Trinity. Two of the sections are on the Elm Fork, one at Ray Roberts Dam in northern Denton County, and the other at the site of the Lewisville Dam. The Lewisville Dam Cross Section As part of the construction of Lewisville Dam in the 1950s, the Corps of Engineers drilled a large number of boreholes in the terraces and floodplain of the Elm Fork of the Trinity along the dam axis and in areas of potential borrow pit excavation. Logs of these boreholes and the geomorphic cross sections that may be drawn with these data, provide useful insights into the character of the Trinity River terraces and alluvia at this point. It is important to bear in mind the setting of this dam. It is at one of the narrower portions of the Trinity Valley upstream from Dallas (Figure 4.6). This setting, typical of most dams, creates some problems in terms of correlating data from this locality with those collected from areas where the floodplain is much broader. The hydrologic controls on deposition in narrow or constricted portions of valleys may result in significantly different erosional and depositional regimes when contrasted with broader reaches of the valley [Leopold et al. 1964] Additionally, the dam at Lewisville was constructed just downstream from the confluence of Hickory Creek with the Elm Fork. Following suggestions from Dr. Claude Albritton, many of the students at SMU in the 1950s [e.g., Taggart 1953; Winn 1953; Overmyer 1953] pointed out the potential effects of tributary streams with regard to terrace formation in the trunk valleys, in this case the effects of dumping of sediments from the Hickory 57

Creek drainage on the Elm Fork floodplain. One possible effect noted by those researchers was that "alluvial fans" might possibly form just downstream from such confluences. Such features would compound the lateral and downstream variability of geomorphic features and strqtigraphic sections. In any event, the location of the Lewisville archaeological site must be regarded cautiously with respect to correlations both up and downstream. Geomorphically, the cross section provided by the Lewisville Dam access illustrates several very distinct features. On the west is the well developed "T2" terrace of Crook and Harris. In fact, it is just a few hundred yards north of Borehole #1 that the Lewisville Site is situated (Figure 4.6). This terrace drops off sharply towards the Elm Fork where the floodplain and low terrace remnants describe an irregular surface at about 470 feet elevation. To the east, several small benches rise above the Trinity's floodplain until a terrace surface, approximately the same as that of the "T2" terrace on the opposite bank, is evident. The dam access continues across the incised Stuart's Creek valley and then rises to a still higher surface at the eastern end of the dam access. Fortunately, enough of the boreholes penetrated the bedrock, thereby enabling a fairly accurate reconstruction of the bedrock benches that underlie the alluvia (Figure 4.6). The highest bench is at the eastern end of the dam axis at an elevation of approximately 525 feet. This bench apparently slopes towards the west and then is deeply incised at Stuart's Creek. The next highest bench underlies the "T2" deposits at the western end of the dam axis. This bench, at an elevation of approximately 490 feet, is overlain by approximately 35 feet of alluvium as described by Crook and Harris [1957J. It is significant that the bedrock bench underlying the terrace opposite that containing the Lewisville Site is some 30 feet lower than the bench on the western side of the valley, yet the alluvia overlying the bench in Borehole #5 (Figure 4.6) attains an elevation almost exactly the same as that of the "T2" terrace on the opposite (west) bank of the river. A distinct pair of bedrock benches is exposed under the floodplain and possible low terrace remnants. This bench occurs at a depth of approximately 15 to 30 feet below the level of the floodplain. The channel of the Elm Fork at this point was approximately 25 feet deep. Of great interest is the 60 feet of alluvium that overlie the lowest bedrock exposure in the Elm Fork Valley at this point. This clearly shows an incision of bedrock some 35 to 40 feet below the principal bedrock bench under the floodplain. A 60

similar deeply incised cut to bedrock is illustrated along stuart's Creek, although this cut does not reach the same absolute depth as that of the Trinity. Nonetheless, it suggests a response to the incision of the Elm Fork by its laterals. Overall, the geomorphology of the terrace surfaces and the buried bedrock benches are quite revealing in terms of alluvial sequences of erosion and aggradation. First, while matched terraces appear to be evident on the west and east banks of the Elm Fork at the elevation of the "T2" terrace, it is clear that alluvia within these terraces differ in thickness and lithology and rest on bedrock benches of quite different absolute elevations. "T2" alluvia on the west bank are quite compatible with the general description of Crook and Harris [1957]. It consists of an overall fining upward sequence with basal gravels overlain by sands and finally by fine-grained silts and clays. The "T2" alluvia on the east bank, however, includes a thick section of loamy deposits overlain by alternating gravel, clays, and sands. Differences in lithology and thickness of the alluvial deposits suggest that multiple cycles of erosion and deposition may have culminated in floodplain abandonment and terrace formation at approximately the same elevations. These borehole logs do not permit dating of these events. Detailed studies of the sections, including the recovery of diagnostic faunal materials or samples for radiocarbon dating, would be necessary to fully define the cut and fill sequences here. The alluvium underlying the floodplain and low terrace remnants is of more archaeological concern than the higher terraces. There appear to be two principal units on the basis of the Corps of Engineers' well logs. First are gravels overlain by tan sands. These appear mostly on the west bank overlying the bedrock bench as exposed in Boreholes #2, #16, and #3 (Figure 4.6). They also occur, however, in Borehole #9 on the east bank of the floodplain. These coarse, gravelly, and sandy deposits are perhaps comparable to those found downstream underlying the "Carrollton" and/or "Union Terminal" terraces of Taggart. Unfortunately, there are no soil profiles included in the borehole descriptions that would permit estimation of paleosurface stability and also the possible extent of truncation of alluvia that may have overlain these gravels and sands. In marked contrast to these gravelly and sandy deposits at the flanks of the floodplain are the deep alluvia that infill the incised bedrock channel. In Borehole #17, the alluvia consist of alternating layers of sands and clays. The basal 8 feet of this deposit includes clayey and silty, blue to dark gray sand. This is overlain in turn by layers approximately 2 feet thick of gray and tan sands and clays. The middle portion of this core is dominated by silty brown sands, and the upper 16 feet consist of 61

silty brown to gray clay." Boreholes #14 and #15 have basal deposits of sand overlain by alternating loamy, sandy, or clayey deposits. While more detailed profile descriptions would be necessary to fully define the depositional environments for the sediments underlying the floodplain, some general observations are possible. The sediments on the margins of the floodplain clearly represent higher energy deposits. The gravel and sands therefore may represent the basal portions of now truncated fining upward sequences of channel fills, or they may possibly represent lag deposits overlain by braided stream sands. By contrast, the deeper alluvia filling the bedrock channel incised below the floodplain seem, by their heterogeneous textures and vertical changes in lithology, to represent the lateral and vertical changes in alluvial textures that might characterize an aggrading meandering stream. Overall, the cross section at Lewisville Dam provides important insights into the possible complexity of the alluvial history of the Trinity's floodplain and its terraces. These data clearly indicate that detailed descriptions of sedimentary faces and post-depositional weathering features, including soil profiles, are essential in the task of reconstructing the stratigraphic history of the terrace deposits and reconstructing the sedimentary environments. Except for major changes in the geomorphic relationships of the alluvial deposits (for example, that represented between the "T2" terrace and the sediments overlying the floodplain bedrock bench), it is clear that age controls will be necessary in order to accurately correlate some of these alluvial units. The Ray Roberts Cross section At the time of this writing, the Lake Ray Roberts Dam is under construction and nearly completed. This dam, located approximately 20 miles (35 km) upstream from the Lewisville Dam on the Elm Fork of the Trinity, was studied by Corps of Engineers geologists in preparation for construction activities. As at the Lewisville Dam axis, a series of boreholes were drilled across the valley. The logs of these boreholes and the topographic information provide new insights into variability in the geomorphology and alluvial stratigraphy of the Elm Fork. The major portion of the cross section is shown in Figure 4.7. Clearly evident are several bedrock benches and/or bedrock channels overlain by alluvia which are best described as comprised of one terrace and an irregular series of floodplain deposits forming an irregular surface. The higher alluvial deposits described in the valley occur on the western portion of the cross section. These deposits form an irregular surface approximately 50 feet above the modern 62

floodplain. Boreholes in these higher alluvial deposits indicate massive yellowish or grayish-brown clayey sands and clays with darker (soil??) horizons near the surface in several columns. In the apparent channels in the westernmost part of this high terrace are basal gravels and sands. These massive deposits of light-colored alluvium extend north into the area of the future reservoir. Borrowing activities in this alluvia resulted in the recovery about 3 years ago of mastodon and other Pleistocene megafaunas. The floodplain alluvia are comprised of basal gravels overlain by light-colored clays and sandy clays, with possible soil horizons and/or darker clays in the upper portions of several columns. These attain thicknesses of approximately 40 feet across the floodplain. The possibility of eroded portions of terraces intermediate to the floodplain and the high bench to the west cannot be confirmed from the available information. The eastern portion of the valley at this point consists of a steep bluff exposing Cretaceous bedrock. This is covered by a veneer of colluvium that interfingers with the alluvial deposits near the base of the slope. The striking difference between the Ray Roberts cross section and the Lewisville Dam cross section is the absence of a trenched bedrock bench beneath the floodplain deposits. This difference may be explained by the proximity of a steep bedrock valley wall and the fact that the width of the floodplain at Ray Roberts is only about 3,500 feet compared to approximately 8,000 feet along the Lewisville Dam axis. Quite different sediment loads and erosive potentials are certainly probable between these two areas on the Elm Fork. may in fact be filled alluvium that was deposited roughly at the same time as the alluvium in the shallow portions of that terrace exposure. Sections at Ray Roberts and Lewisville document deep incision of the Elm fork channel into bedrock after abandonment of the "T2" terrace, which stands approximately 50 feet above the floodplain. Subsequently, a bedrock bench was cut that underlies the modern floodplain and, at Lewisville, terrace remnants between the floodplain and "T2." Still later, the Elm Fork incised bedrock to a depth of 60 feet at Lewisville. The White Rock Creek Cross Section The third cross section studied as part of this project is located just south of downtown Dallas. This section was reconstructed -from some of the scores of boreholes drilled in this portion of the Trinity floodplain in anticipation of a levee 64

project that has never gone to construction. The logs of 24 boreholes, defining a transect from the west to the eastern side of the Trinity Valley were plotted. Each of these corings had been described in the field and lab, and their elevations were mapped providing an accurate cross section of the valley at this point. In Figure 4.8, the valley profile on the eastern end of the transect rising to elevations of over 400 feet was inferred from the USGS base map for the borehole locations. The cross section near White Rock Creek is particularly revealing when compared to the Lewisville cross section. First, this cross section does not include the several higher terraces that have been mapped in this area by Taggart [1953]. Rather, it is confined mainly to the floodplain. Focusing on these deposits, it is clear that there are lithologic variations in the vicinities of Boreholes #10, #11, #12, and #13 that suggest possible terrace remnants overlain by younger alluvium. All the rest of the boreholes are dominated by yellowish-brown or light yellowish-brown clays and silts that tend to be much darker gray or dark grayish brown near the surface. Near the Trinity channel, these alluvia are dark gray or dark grayish-brown for depths up to 40 feet below the present floodplain. A number of these boreholes penetrated Austin Chalk bedrock. These define irregular benches at approximate elevation of 375 feet on both sides of the Trinity River and also on the eastern side of the White Rock Creek confluence. Of importance is Borehole #23 which shows that alluvium near white Rock Creek attains depths of at least 60 feet, and as shown in Figure 4.8, bedrock was not penetrated at this depth. While the boreholes along the Trinity on this transect are considerably shallower, the assumption that the grade of white Rock Creek was controlled by the Trinity indicates clearly that the Trinity too must be incised deeply into bedrock at this point. The fact that these deep incisions occur under floodplain deposits strengthens the observation made on the Lewisville Dam data that the floodplain sediments are deeper and therefore probably considerably older than had hitherto been expected. They further provoke consideration of the timing of this deep incision. Willimon's [1970;1972] dates on truncated "Tl" deposits of 23,000 to 20,000 B.P. were obtained on materials in settings similar to the shallow bedrock benches beneath the floodplain described both at Lewisville and in the white Rock Creek area. Although these are described as truncated "Tl" deposits, the upper surfaces of these profiles are nearly at the elevation of the floodplain, and in fact it is implied by Willimon that they are capped by thin veneers of recent alluvium. It is proposed that the most reasonable timing for the incision .of the deep trenches into bedrock below the bedrock 65

--- ------------ benches underlying the floodplain postdates the aggradation phase dated by Willimon: the incision probably is younger than ca. 20,000 years B.P. As proposed by Willimon [1972], abandonment of the "Tl" deposits was followed by erosion of those deposits and subsequently incision of the floodplain. Although Willimon described exposures of deep alluvium along the floodplain in Highway Department cores at the present axis of u.s. 625, he does not emphasize the extent or depth of the deposits beneath the floodplain. The cross sections from Lewisville and white Rock Creek indicate this downcutting episode was one of considerable magnitude. The timing and environmental conditions surrounding this episode, as well as the implications of the floodplain geomorphology and stratigraphy will be discussed at the end of this section. Now we will turn to stratigraphic evidence concerning terrace sediments and soils along the Elm Fork and West Fork of the Trinity. Investigations in the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Area A number of reconnaissance visits to the Carrollton/Farmers Branch area were made, and several sections were described at localities that occur on the Carrollton USGS quandrangle map. This is an area that had been mapped in some detail in the past, which contains good exposures of the principal stratigraphic units of archaeological interest and also contains a high density of recorded archaeological sites. Not incidentally, this is also an area that is slated for intensive development in the future and is the site of active development today. Therefore, studies in this area concerning stratigraphy, soil formation, and the context of archaeological sites were well suited to the objectives of this project. Unfortunately, this area has already been subjected to intensive development of the terraces, as well as major portions of the floodplain. This, to a great degree, will encumber any future geologic investigation in the area. In particular, it will be extremely difficult to construct accurate topographic maps and measured cross sections in the valley, owing to extensive commercial and residential development and filling activities along the floodplain. Taggart's [1953] map indicates the location of the principal geomorphic, units that may be tentatively defined according to his scheme. The units Taggart defined, many of which are based on previous mapping efforts in this area [Patillo 1940; Winn 1953], must be viewed as informal geomorphic-stratigraphic units. This does not deny the efforts of previous investigators, but rather follows their own admissions that detailed stratigraphic 67

studies of these units, as well as soil studies and dating efforts, must be undertaken in order to refine the alluvial stratigraphy and to clarify stratigraphic relationships of geomorphic units. This project represents a reconnaissance effort directed towards these objectives. Regrettably, only a few sections could be described in the course of this study (Figure 4.5). These will be described and discussed below using Taggart's [1953] scheme for convenience. Investigations of the Union Terminal Terrace Taggart's Union Terminal terrace (QT4) is that which probably correlates with the "Union Terminal-Carrollton" terrace ("Tl") of Crook and Harris [1957]. In the Carrollton/Farmers Branch area, Taggart mapped extensive areas as Union Terminal terrace, and a number of archaeological sites have been found in association with this geomorphic unit. It is therefore of archaeological interest as a site setting. We investigated deposits mapped as the Union Terminal terrace in three areas. First, a section was described just west of Denton Tap Road along Denton Creek. A second section was described just north of the now destroyed Wheeler archaeological site [Crook and Harris 1954a], and a third section was described about 2.5 miles west of Farmers Branch and just north of Valley View Lane. These three exposures comprise an admittedly small sample of Taggart's Union Terminal terrace; however, all three of them may be related to nearby archaeological deposits. These represent the first investigations of these terrace deposits since they were originally described over 30 years ago. Geomorphically, the Union Terminal terrace exhibits variations over the areas mapped by Taggart. Elevations range from approximately 10 to over 30 feet above the Trinity floodplain in the vicinity of the confluence of Denton Creek with the Elm Fork. Similarly, in the vicinity of Farmers Branch, the Union Terminal terrace deposit lies from approximately 15 feet above the floodplain near the present Elm Fork channel to perhaps 30 or 35 feet above the floodplain approximately 1.5 to 2 miles to the east near Farmers Branch. Each of the sections we described were located relatively close to either the Elm Fork or Denton Creek and therefore represent the exposed lower elevations of this geomorphic unit. However, in the vicinity of the Wheeler Site (north of sandy Lake Road and west of Denton Creek), the area mapped as the Union Terminal terrace exhibits considerable local relief, and much of this area has been extensively quarried and is presently under construction. Small remnant exposures are present near Denton Creek, about a mile north of Sandy Lake Road. 68

At an elevation of approximately 470 feet along Denton Creek, a sloping cut on the north end of an old quarry area provide exposures of the well-developed soil near the surface. A red argillic horizon is present at the top of yellowish-brown, calcareous clays, which in turn overlie gravels and bedrock. A disturbed, but approximately 1 to 2 foot thick, massive A-horizon occurs over the red argillic horizon of the soil. This is strikingly similar to the "Albritton and Patillo formations" described by Crook and Harris [1954a,b; 1957]. This relict soil appears to follow the surface of the Union Terminal terrace as it slopes off towards the east. Without measured sections in several areas, it is not possible to say whether the soil has formed on a surface that has been progressively or perhaps episodically lowered by erosion, or whether in fact multiple inset alluvial units are present. The section we described just north of the old Wheeler archaeological site is at one of the lower elevations of this terrace exposure. Yet, the soils described in our section may be traced to the west for some 100 to 125 meters, and covering perhaps as much as 10 feet in increasing elevation. The Wheeler Profile. The profile described near the Wheeler site is referred to informally as the Wheeler Pit Profile (Figure 4.9; Table 4.3). This profile is located in a deeply incised gully that drains into Denton Creek some 40 meters to the east of the described section. The 3-meter profile has been divided into three main stratigraphic units, informally designated as units A, B, and C. These informal units actually represent changing depositional facies as much as they might possibly represent quite different depositional episodes. Therefore, these are quite strictly lithologic subdivisions and not necessarily mappable informal units. The basal unit, A, consists of interbedded gravels and sands. The gravels are well-rounded carbonate rock fragments, Creta~eous fossils, and rounded hematite concretions. The sands contain carbonate grains but are dominated by silicious sands. Unit B is comprised of medium crossbeds of quartz-rich sands. Plane laminations occur within each bed. These grade upwards to massive sandy loam deposits in the upper part of Unit B and the lower part of Unit C. These contain small calcareous nodules that appear to be modified carbonate clasts rather than pedogenic carbonates. unit C is a depositional unit upon which a soil has formed. The textural changes within this unit are therefore related both to the depositional environment and also to subsequent pedogenesis. As shown in Figure 4.9 this entire profile, like most we have investigated on the Trinity, fines upwards, a typical pattern for fluvial deposits. Therefore, the investigation of depositional/pedogenic records in alluvial deposits is 69

complicated by textural changes in the parent materials and subsequent downwards translocation of fine particles during soil formation. A principal objective of soil studies in fluvial environments is the recognition of the soil parent material. In this profile, as well as the others, one index or guide to parent material homogeneity is the breakdown of sand textures within the zones of soil formation. The assumption underlying this approach is that homogeneity of sand textures may be used to strengthen an interpretation of "homogeneous parent materials" for the soil. Downward translocation of clays then may be investigated within units that have homogeneous parent materials [Pheasant 1982]. Here at the Wheeler profile, the parent materials in Unit C for the soil all appear to be in the sandy loam textural range. Throughout all of the soil horizons in unit C, the size breakdowns within the sand fraction are not only homogeneous, but they are remarkably homogeneous (Table 4.4). There are probably no statistically significant changes in sand textures from the base of the C-horizon to the upper portion of the A-horizon in this profile. While mineralogic evidence may be used to firm conclusions on soil parent material homogeneity, it is assumed that the profiles we are investigating are not old enough to result in significant differences in weathering of stable versus unstable minerals [Birkeland 1984J. The soil developed on the alluvium at the Wheeler section includes a quite thick A-horizon. This has been divided into several subhorizons based on color and structural differences (Table 4.3). A transition zone, the AB horizon, shows both color and textural changes as a transition to the well developed argillic portion of the B-horizon. A significant increase in clay content is evident in this B-horizon as well as a significant change in colors with hues of 5YR. This B-horizon also exhibits fairly well developed subangular blocky structure and common clay films on ped surfaces. In the lower B-horizon and in the C-horizons of this soil profile, there are a number of faint yellowish-red mottles as well as iron/manganese concretions indicating the effects of groundwater in the profile. Although no artifacts were found in the immeditate vicinity of the described section, they were located eroding from the soil A-horizons approximately 40 meters to the west where the relict soil occurs at progressively higher elevations on the Union Terminal terrace. Denton Creek Profile 2. The section described on the Union Terminal terrace along Denton Creek is located approximately 200 meters south of Denton Creek and 600 meters west of Denton Tap Road. The profile was described on a vertical face of an abandoned gravel quarry. The terrace at this point forms a quite level surface at an approximate elevation of 465 feet. As at the 73

Wheeler profile, this elevation is only slightly above the floodplain at this point. The sediments in this exposure have been divided into two informal units, A and B, which as was the case for the Wheeler Profile, are of more depositional significance than any mappable geologic units. Unit A consists of the basal gravels of which only the upper portions were exposed in this profile. These gravels are similar to those at the Wheeler Profile consisting of moderately sorted subrounded to rounded limestone, fossil, and hematite clasts. Unit B overlies these gravels and attains a thickness of approximately 2.3 meters. These sediments are sandy loam in texture for the most part and exhibit a fining upwards character for about the lower two-thirds of the unit. A well-developed soil occurs on these sediments. A disturbed zone at the top, the result of gravelling activities, overlies a plow zone and relatively thin A-horizon. The red argillic B-horizon has hues in the 5YR range. There is a possibility that a change in the depositional character occurs between the B2t horizon and the B3-horizon (Figure 4.10;Table 4.5) . While there is an adequate increase in clay for the argillic designation, it is also clear that the parent materials below the B2t horizon appear to fine upwards. Therefore, the increase in clay and silt in the B3-horizon may be the result of depositional environments rather than subsequent soil formation. Analysis of the sand fractions from this profile indicates remarkably homogeneous particle size distributions from the A-horizon well down into the C-horizon, suggesting homogeneous parent materials (Table 4.4). Overall, the lithologic and pedogenic character of this profile is very similar to that described at the Wheeler Profile. Valley View Section The third section described in the Union Terminal terrace is located approximately 500 meters north of Valley View Lane and 400 meters east of the Elm Fork channel. This locality is situated about 2 miles west of downtown Farmers Branch. The profile described is situated on a long remnant of the original terrace surface, which is bounded to the north and south by large gravel pits. The profile described occurs at an elevation of approximately 437 feet. As at the Wheeler and Denton Creek profiles, this elevation is only slightly above the floodplain in this vicinity. An archaeological site (4IDL240) is present in the upper portion of the terrace deposits. Although no artifacts ~ere exposed in the section described, artifacts, features, and fairly dense accumulations of artifacts occur just to the west of the described profile over a fairly extensive area of the remaining portion of the terrace. The section . described at the Valley View locality is just 75

over 4 meters deep (Figure 4.11; Table 4.6). It consists of several informally designated units of alluvium that overlie the Eagle Ford shale. The basal gravels (unit A) consist of fairly well-sorted limestone and hematite pebbles and cobbles, with interbedded lenses of coarse sand. These are overlain unit B sands. The basal sands exhibit well preserved primary structures, while the upper portion of unit B is bioturbated and massive. The basal part of unit B consists of medium to thickly bedded, tabular cross-stratified sands with thin pebble lags at the bases of some of the beds. These in turn are overlain by trough cross-stratified sands and these in turn by another unit of more thinly bedded plane or very grossly trough cross-stratified sands. The zone of bioturbation in the upper part of Unit B is quite marked by burrows. The massive character of the sands, as well as the evident burrows, suggests that there may have been a period of surface stability at this point, and therefore, at the 2-meter depth of this profile, a break is designated between Units Band C. Unit C consists of sandy loam to sandy clay loam sediments. These are surmounted by a thin clay loam deposit, which is either a very recent flood deposit or perhaps the result of disturbance associated with the sand and gravel quarrying activities. A soil has formed on the unit C parent materials. This includes a relatively thin and possibly truncated sandy loam A-horizon with a well developed argillic horizon below. The colors in the B-horizon are in the 5YR hues; the pronounced increase in clay content between the AB and BIt horizons (approximately 10%) at first suggested a change in parent materials. Examination of the particle size distribution within the sand fraction (Table 4.4) indicates there is no change in the composition of sands between these horizons. However, farther down in the B-horizon, the fining of the sands is evident. The maximum amount of clay occurs in the lower portion of the B-horizon (B3t). This pattern is typical of B-horizons formed in Ultisols [Soil Taxonomy 1975]. Ultisols, which are common on Quaternary deposits in the southeastern United states, are also characterized by heavily leached A-horizons and argillic B-horizons that have abrupt upper surfaces and a tendency for maximum elluviated clay to occur in the lower portions of these horizons. It is entirely possible, therefore, that the A- and B-horizons for this soil have formed on the same parent material and that the textural variations in these horizons is in part the result of the upwards fining character of the alluvium, but is dominated by the post-depositional effects of pedogenesis. 78

Summary: The Union Terminal Terrace The reconnaissance investigations and profile descriptions of the Union Terminal terrace of Taggart has indicated three strikingly similar profiles. Each contains basal gravels and cross-stratified sands overlain by fining upwards alluvium. A well-developed soil occurs in each of the terrace deposits investigated. The red argillic horizons vary in character to a certain degree, yet these differences are certainly expected among soils that have formed on alluvium. Lateral variations in the depositional environments associated with rivers is inevitably going to result in different parent materials for soils that have formed under similar environmental conditions and over comparable periods of time. While considerably more work is clearly needed in investigating these terrace deposits, the homogeneity of the character of these three profiles is striking. The remaining questions revolve about the age of the alluvial deposits and the period of time during which the soil has formed after deposition on this terrace ceased. The occurrence of archaeological materials near the Wheeler profile and near the Valley View profile are restricted to the A-horizon. This position is probably identical to that described for the Wheeler site [Crook and Harris 1953] in which artifacts ascribed to the ·Carrollton Focus· were found in the "Patillo Formation" sands that occurred above the red "Albritton Formation" clays. The three terrace profiles investigated here strongly suggest that the "Albritton/Patillo" formations are one in the same with the A- and B-horizons of the soil described here. The fact that artifacts found in the "Patillo sands" range from late Paleoindian or Early Archaic in age to those of Late Archaic age at site 4lDL240 [Lorrain, personal communication] suggest that this surface has been stable for as much as 10,000 years, if not more. Over this period of time, weathering effects have resulted in the formation of a leached A-horizon typical of many Ultisols. The A-horizon then may be the result simply of pedogenic modification of the original parent material after this floodplain was abandoned. The possiblity that some deposition of younger materials on top of this terrace has taken place must clearly be entertained. It is indeed possible that some younger alluvium occurs on top of the "Union Terminal" terrace. Additionally, it is possible that eolian sands may have been deposited on truncated B-horizons. The data collected from the three profiles on this study, however, do .not clearly point towards separate depositional episodes for the A- and B-horizons respectively of these soils profiles. Admittedly, this is one of the most challenging areas of soils/stratigraphic investigations. 82

Fluvial environments are prone to generate laterally and vertically differentiated parent materials for soils that may have formed over the same intervals of time. An additional area that requires further investigation concerning these terrace deposits is the age and depositional environments of the basal gravels and sands. Whether these represent deposits that were laid down just prior to the overlying fine-grained alluvium or whether they are perhaps truncated basal portions of considerably older terraces is a matter of both stratigraphic and archaeological significance. The profiles just described can be interpreted as vertical changes in facies with subsequent pedogenic modification of the sediments. In other words, the breaks between the sands with primary structures and the overlying fine-grained alluvia may be looked at as minor erosional boundaries or simply gradations between depositional faces. On the other hand, the Valley View profile exhibited bioturbation of the upper sands, suggesting a period of some surface stability and/or possible truncation of older deposits prior to deposition of the fine-grained sediments comprising the upper part of this terrace. It has been noted earlier that with the exception of Willimon's study [1970; 1972] no datable faunal materials have been found in the ~Union Terminal" or "Carrollton" terraces. If a tentative and cautious correlation is made between the Union Terminal terrace of Taggart and the "Tl" of Willimon, then these basal sands and gravels may be approximately 20,000 years old. Independent evidence for the age of the terraces in the Carrollton/Farmers Branch area is clearly needed owing to downstream changes in the composition and geomorphology of terraces, as well as the important expansions and constrictions in the floodplain which were noted earlier. These latter effects may significantly alter the character of aggradation and downcutting phases within and between portions of the valley that vary markedly in width. At present, it must be concluded that the upper surface of the Union Terminal terrace is at least 10,000 years old and possibly 20,000 years old based on Willimon's dates. Investigation of the Carrollton Terrace Taggart [1953] stated that the Carrollton terrace in his scheme was both geomorphically and lithologically distinct from the higher Union Terminal terrace. Our brief investigations of this geomorphic/stratigraphic unit bears out his description. The Carrollton terrace in the Carrollton/Farmers Branch area is barely discernable from the floodplain in terms of elevation. At 83

most it rises 5 or 6 feet above the floodplain in the areas in which we investigated. However, on topographic maps a rise to somewhat higher elevations is indicated in areas we did not investigate. A section was described in the Carrollton terrace just below Sandy Lake Road on the west bank of the Elm Fork (Figure 4.12; Table 4.7). This is the locality of archaeological site 41DL12, which was recorded in the 1940s in the walls of the gravel pit that are still present [Kirkland et al. 1949] The section has been divided into three informal units that overlie the Eagle Ford shale. unit A consists of basal gravels. unit B consists of massive or cross-laminated sands, and Unit C consists of loamy sands and sandy loams. A very thick A-horizon has formed on the upper portion of this terrace. It is likely that some deposition took place concurrent with the formation of this soil making this a cumulic A-horizon. Artifacts occurring in this profile range in the age from Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric. These archaeological data, and a radiocarbon age of 820 +/- 80 B.P. (Beta-14907) from the upper portion of the soil A-horizon indicate deposition between ca. 2500 and 800 B.P. An increase in clay, a change in structure and color led to the designation of the upper part of Unit B as a buried argillic soil horizon (IIBltb). This designation implies a relatively stable surface for some time prior to the deposition of Unit C sands. The possibility that some change in parent material characterizes this IIBltb horizon must be entertained, however, for abrupt changes in clay content are noted below this horizon. The character of this profile is considerably different from that of the Union Terminal profiles just described. The examination of other sections of the Carrollton terrace confirm that this general lithologic and soils sequence appears to be more widespread in this area. Sand and gravel pits located along Interstate Highway 35 near the point where the Elm Fork crosses that highway are a number of sections exposed in the pits exhibit stratigraphic/soils profiles which are quite comparable to that at 4lDL12. Each of these exposures consists of 4 to 5 meters of alluvium above the eroded Eagle Ford shale. A section described at one pit just east of Interstate 35 exhibits approximately 3.5 meters of alluvium (Figure 4.13). Basal gravels are overlain by yellowish-red calcareous silts and clays, and these in turn are overlain by thick black clays. At this section, bovid bones and flakes are eroding from the lower portion of the A Holocene age for the clays, then, is strongly suggested. On the opposite side of the borrow pit, a relatively continuous horizon of firecracked rock, lithic debitage and several tools are exposed at a depth of approximately 2.5 to 3 meters below the surface. A thick buried 84

soil A-horizon is present in the upper part of these upper sediments, which are underlain by pale, massive sandy clays. This section appears to be the stratigraphically thickened equivalent of the dark clays exposed on the previously described portion of this borrow pit. These two exposures suggest, but certainly do not confirm that Late Holocene-aged alluvia are inset within and to some degree overlap older alluvium which comprises the major portion of the Carrollton terrace fill. As suggested by Taggart's map (Figure 4.3), the contact between the Carrollton terrace and the modern floodplain is very subtle topographically. The Carrollton terrace appears to be a unit that is lithologically distinct from the floodplain sediments. Considerably more work is required on these exposures, however, and every effort should be made to acquire datable materials from these alluvial deposits. Investigations of the Elm Fork Floodplain Our reconnaissance efforts were, in the main, unsuccessful in providing us with exposures of the floodplain sediments. A reconnaissance of the Elm Fork channel by boat certainly seems to be one of the most promising means to find such sections for description. Perhaps the most important evidence recovered concerning the character of the sediments underlying the Elm Fork floodplain was that described earlier in the context of the borehole logs from the Lewisville Darn and the White Rock Creek area. These clearly indicate that floodplain sediments attain thicknesses of 60 to 70 feet, and therefore even vertical cut banks in the moderate channel will only expose the upper half of these deposits. Indeed, determining the age of the sediments underlying the floodplain stands as perhaps one of the most compelling problems facing archaeological investigations along the Trinity. The great depth of these alluvial sediments alone suggests that they may be of considerable age and may contain very deeply stratified archaeological materials. At site 4lDL12, floodplain clays are inset against the Carrollton terrace deposits described above. These dark black massive clays contain an archaeological horizon buried approximately 3 meters below the surface. This contains sparse artifacts but also several hearths and very well-preserved mammal bones and clam shells. Charcoal from this horizon yielded a radiocarbon age of 1140 +/- 70 B.P. (Beta-14906). Somewhat farther up Denton Creek from this locality is an archaeological site (41DLll) situated on the floodplain just east of Denton Tap Road. This site has been the subject of avocational investigation for some time [Lorrain, personal communication] and 89

contains a deeply buried sequence of archaeological materials. The upper portion of the site exhibits thick organic rich clays at a depth of approximately 2.5 to 3 meters. These organic rich clays grade downwards into yellowish-gray clays. Bison bones and artifacts are eroding from the upper portion of the site, while at greater depths down to the upper portion of the yellowish-gray clays abundant hearths, mussel shells, and mammal bones along with artifacts dated to the Late Archaic have been recovered. The proximity of this locality relative to the Elm Fork indicates that aggradation of Denton Creek was controlled at this point by the Elm Fork master stream. Therefore, the accumulation of up to 3 or 4 meters alluvium in the last 2,000 to 4,000 years is indicated. A profile in this archaeological site will be described pending permission from' the landowners. However, a section was briefly described in the deposits closer to the Denton Creek channel (Figure 4.14). This section of just over 4 meters of alluvium contains no archaeological materials. The AIC soil profile at the top is perhaps indicative of the young age of these sediments, while relatively unweathered silts and sands beneath the modern soil suggest levee type depositional environments. These appear to grade laterally away from the modern channel into fine-textured silty clays, suggestive of a floodbasin environment. . The levee-like deposits may represent either a relatively fixed channel position over the last 2 or 3 millennia, or they may represent much younger inset fill within the floodplain. The former situation would suggest a stability of channel positioning, while the latter would indicate meandering of Denton Creek in recent times. Both scenarios are entirely feasible and radiometric dating would be needed to correlate these deposits with those in the nearby archaeological site. It is perhaps significant, however, that in this vicinity the Denton Creek channel is quite straight with no well developed meander loops. Thus, it is possible that depositional environments have not shifted laterally over the last several millenia during which time the floodplains of Denton Creek and Elm Fork were actively aggrading. Investigation of several archaeological sites in the Farmers Branch area along the Elm Fork also confirm that aggradation was actively proceeding during Late Archaic times. A number of Late Archaic sites occur at depths of 1 to 2 meters below the surface of the floodplain, and in some cases later prehistoric materials occur stratigraphically above these. A particular concentration of archaeological materials is tentatively suggested by survey results in the area of NB Houston Golf Course [Hays et al. 1972]. This may possibly signify some change in deposition rates near Late Archaic times, yet adequate dating of these deposits has not 90

been accomplished. The surface of the floodplain has been relatively stable, with the exception of meandering, for the last few hundred years as indicated by radiocarbon dated Late Prehistoric materials that are shallowly buried on the floodplain. Archaeologically, however, it is important to point out that this was only relative stability, and that overbank deposition of clays still is ongoing, and therefore many sites even of Late Prehistoric age have a high probability of being buried in these contexts. Investigations on the West Fork of the Trinity More limited reconnaissance investigations were undertaken on the West Fork of the Trinity. These revealed some apparent similarities and differences from the terrace and floodplain deposits on the Elm Fork. A schematic section drawn across the West Fork of the Trinity near Highway 157 appears to be representative of much of the West Fork. A high terrace, standing some 50 feet above the floodplain, contains deeply stratified, crossbedded sands and gravels overlain by fining upwards alluvial deposits. At the top of these deposits is a well-developed soil with a thick red argillic horizon overlain by a massive fine sandy A-horizon. This terrace has been mapped as "T2" by Taggart. At elevations of approximately 10 feet above the modern floodplain are exposures of a terrace mapped as either the Carrollton or the Union Terminal by Taggart [1953]. This lower terrace (or terraces) have not been adequately studied on the West Fork, and correlation with Taggart's geomorphic units is neither possible nor perhaps advisable at this time. An overall similarity with the Union Terminal or Carrollton terraces of Taggart is suggested however by the limited exposures seen on this reconnaissance. Near Hwy. 157, gravel pit exposures of this terrace indicate a thick red argillic horizon overlain by massive grayish sands remarkably similar to the soils developed on the Union Terminal terrace along the Elm Fork. Numerous exposures of the West Fork floodplain deposits are provided in gravel pits and channel cuts in the middle reaches of the reconnaissance area. These all indicate the presence of a buried soil between one half and as much as 2 meters below the present surface of the floodplain. This soil was not seen in all sections of the cutbank during a helicopter flyover, but it nonetheless appears more or less continuously from at least Ft. Worth to near Grand Prairie. The section described below provides a documentation of this soil. 92

The Gateway Park Profile A section of approximately 9 meters of alluvium is exposed in Trinity River channels near the proposed site of Gateway Park. The section described is located on a meander cutbank of the West Fork of the Trinity approximately 450 meters south of the First street bridge. The profile is located on the east bank of the river. The thick sequence of alluvium exposed in this cutbank has been divided into four stratigraphic units (Figure 4.15; Table 4.8). The basal unit, A, is comprised of medium to thickly bedded sands and loamy deposits, rich in mollusks, including gastropods and' unionids. A charcoal sample was collected from a depth of approximately 8 meters and has been submitted for accelerator radiocarbon dating. Overlying these coarser deposits of unit A is a 5-meter thick unit that varies little in texture and color. It is predominantly silty clay loams fining upwards slightly to clay loams. These fine-grained deposits are also rich in gastropods although no clams were seen in this section. The upper part of unit B is the C-horizon for the overlying soil. The buried soil here is informally named the West Fork paleosol. These silty clays and silty clay loams are very dark, organic rich and exhibit well-developed prismatic structure. While there is more clay in the lower portion of this soil A-horizon, this is interpreted at present as a change in parent material rather than illuviation of clays. The parent materials are calcareous silts and clays. Downward translocation of carbonates is evident and a Cca-horizon occurs below the A-horizon. A radiocarbon age of 1510 +/- 100 B.P. (Beta-14904) was obtained on humates from the upper 10 cm of the West Fork paleosol. The age confirms the late Holocene age for soil formation, and indicates the soil was buried by renewed alluviation in late Prehistoric times. The upper surface of the soil is truncated and is capped by the loamy deposits shown in Figure 4.15. These contain abundant mollusks, bovid bones, and one well-defined hearth that appears to be of cultural origin, although no artifacts have been found in this section. Formation of a Cca horizon associated with the modern soil has taken place; these deposits may well be of late Prehistoric age. The informally named West Fork paleosol described in this section is the same soil that occurs in many outcrops downstream from this locality. Its presence upstream has not been investigated. This buried soil is probably contemporaneous with the thick A-horizon soil described in the Carrollton area of the 93

Elm Fork; however, in the Carrollton area that soil is at the surface and therefore is not a paleosol, but rather a relict soil. Recent investigations along the upper Elm Fork of the Trinity have documented the widespread occurrence of a buried paleosol on the floodplain. At one section, a radiocarbon age of 1370 +/- 60 B.P. (Beta-14908) was obtained. This evidence confirms the regional significance of the West Fork paleosol a an environmental and stratigraphic marker horizon. That late Holocene alluvial deposits are buried by Late Prehistoric sediments has profound implications for site surveys and settlement pattern studies as well. Late Quaternary Geology of the Upper Trinity Basin: Synthesis Based on a review of previous investigations as well as the results of the current study, the following interpretive summary of the Late Quaternary history of the Upper Trinity Basin is offered (Figure 4.16). There are certainly numerous shortcomings to such a synthesis, most of which may only be resolved by additional detailed geologic investigations. Among the most outstanding problems facing such summaries are the lack of available radiometric dates on alluvial units, the lack of multiple stratigraphic sections and soil profile analyses within the basin, and the the lack of independent evidence concerning paleo-climates and paleoenvironments necessary in order to interpret the depositional history of the Trinity during Later Quaternary times. The following summary of events and conclusions is restricted to the deposits that occur below the "T2" terrace of Crook and Harris [1957J. This decision has been made following earlier discussions concerning the probable mid-Wisconsin to possibly Sangamon age for the "T2" alluvial deposits. Abandonment of the "T2" Terrace Sometime after Sangamon or some younger Wisconsin time, the "T2" terrace was abandoned. Incision of the floodplain to bedrock followed. Genesis of the "Union Terminal Terrace Complex" During and/or following incision to bedrock, the "Union Terminal" terrace complex formed. Given the apparent variations 97

( in the elevation of surfaces above the modern floodplain, two possible scenarios (among other alternatives) are envisioned for the genesis of this terrace complex: A. The "Union Terminal Terrace Complex" may have accumulated as a result of alluviation contemporaneous with gradual incision of the valley. This is analogous to Brackenridge's [1984J ingrown meadering river process. By such a mechanism alluvium is laterally inset against older alluvium resulting in a sloping terrace profile with progressively younger deposits and a progressively younger surface with decreasing elevation. This mechanism may explain the sloped expression of the Union Terminal terrace and the observations made on this project of increasingly mature soil profiles at higher elevations on this terrace surface. B. The "Union Terminal Terrace Complex" may be the result of a single event of abandonment of a relatively level floodplain followed by sheet" erosion and a resulting sloped terrace profile. In either event, the maturity of soil profiles on the Union Terminal terrace deposits suggests considerable antiquity for these sediments. Other than Taggart's dates (discussed below), no reliable evidence concerning the age of the· Union Terminal terrace deposits has been acquired. Artifacts approximately 10,000 years old occur on this terrace, but at this time may not be considered in situ in these alluvial deposits. The Carrollton Terrace The Carrollton Terrace is interpreted as either (1) younger continuation of the "ingrown meandering" deposition of the Union Terminal terrace or (2) an alluvial unit inset against the older Union Terminal deposits. On the basis of lithology, it is not possible to distinguish between these two possiblities, nor are there known sections where the contact between these two units may be described. The dates acquired by Willimon [1970, 1972] from the "Tl" deposits are ambiguously related to the Union Terminal-Carrollton deposits of Taggart [1953]. In terms of elevation with respect to the modern floodplain, Willimon's stratigraphic descriptions imply a closer correlation with the lower (Carrollton) deposits. Accordingly, it is tentatively concluded that either the lowest and youngest of the Union Terminal deposits and/or some of the Carrollton deposits were aggrading approximately 23,000 to 20,000 years ago. 99

Abandonment of the Lower Trinity Terraces The lower portions of the Union Terminal terrace and the Carrollton terrace were abandoned, and deep incision of the Trinity into bedrock ensued. The best estimate for when this deep incision of the Trinity took place must be provided by Willimon's dates on alluvium that stands approximately 15 to 30 feet above the bedrock bench that was incised some 30 to 40 feet during this erosional episode. Cross sections at the Lewisville Dam and below Dallas indicate that the lower terraces of the Trinity appear to be restricted to the areas underlain by the shallow bedrock bench. All of the fill of the deeply incised trench in the Trinity valley appears to be younger alluvium. The young dates for this erosional event are only available in the form of quite deeply buried, Late Archaic materials on the floodplain of Denton Creek near its confluence with the Elm Fork (see discussion below). The most plausible explanation, given available evidence, is that this deep incision of the Trinity took place sometime after 20,000 years BP. Additionally, it may be concluded that the erosional event was complete and the deeply incised bedrock valley had been filled with alluvium, with Elm Fork floodplains within 3 to 4 meters of their present elevations by Late Holocene times. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that abandonment of the lower Trinity terraces and incision of the Trinity into bedrock corresponds with the maximum depression of sea levels during late Wisconsin (full glacial) "times. Terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocene Aggradation Although no radiocarbon ages nor any full stratigraphic sections are available for this time period, it is suggested that alluviation within the deeply incised bedrock channel of the Trinity took place during terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocene times. If this scenario is later corroborated by borehole data and radiometric ages, then it is evident that the only sediments and surfaces amenable to easy field inspection, which date to the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene periods, are those stable surfaces of the lower Union Terminal and/or Carrollton terraces that were exposed during the entire downcutting phase and during the earlier phases of subsequent aggradation. Middle and Late Holocene Alluvial Events other than stable surfaces on the lower terraces, continued aggradation during Middle and Late Holocene times implied by the available evidence. Archaic sites on the Elm Fork and nearby Denton Creek provide tentative evidence that active alluviation was in progress during Late Holocene times. Floodplain stability 100

was attained after these sites were formed as implied by the buried West Fork paleosol on the West Fork of the Trinity and by the seemingly common occurrence of Late Archaic materials at 1 to 1.5 meters depth on the Elm Fork floodplain (see later sections in this report). Additionally, Late Holocene alluvium containing Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric materials appears as a thin veneer over apparently truncated portions of the Carrollton (=truncated Union Terminal?) terrace. Discussion The preceding summary of the Late Quaternary history of the Trinity has been made with hopefully clear recognition of its limitations. These limitations define the need for further work on the Trinity. This will inevitably entail consideration of geologic and paleoenvironmental data in the Trinity Basin as a resource base pertinent to the archaeological history of this area. Both as contexts for archaeolgical sites and as primary evidence for past environments to which native populations adapted, these data are jeopardized along with the archaeological sites themselves. In particular, the following kinds of information are necessary in order to develop a chronology of events and past environments in the Upper Trinity Basin: (1) detailed borehole transects in areas of deep alluvium in order to define possible Late Pleistocene and Holocene erosional/depositional events; (2) description of multiple sections including sediments and soils on the lower terraces (lower Union Terminal and Carrollton) in order to assist in reconstructing paleosurface histories as well as providing age controls on' the aggradation of these alluvial units; (3) recovery and study of paleontologic data from both low terrace and floodplain alluvium. Geoarchaeological Considerations Late Quaternary sediments and soils of the Upper Trinity Basin are the context for archaeological materials deposited by prehistoric populations that inhabited this area over the past 12,000 years. It is necessary and appropriate to consider these geologic contexts with respect to archaeological research strategies focussed on the late Pleistocene and Holocene cultural ecology of this area. It is not the purpose of this section to elaborate on the efficacy pf geoarchaeological research strategies per se [see Butzer 1982]. Rather, brief consideration of the ways in which these contexts are significant is presented, followed by evaluation of the main geomorphic-stratigraphic units in the study area as known and potential site contexts. Additional discussions in section 7 101

consider site formation processes as they relate to the detection and evaluation of sites. The geologic contexts of prehistoric sites in the study area are critical dimensions of the archaeological record of this area. Explicit consideration of these contexts is required in formulating a broad research strategy concerned with variability and change in the adaptive strategies of the prehistoric populations that inhabited the Trinity Basin. Both primary data and also logistical-epistemological concerns are involved. Sediments and soils are the matrix not only for archaeological sites, but also for entrained fossils (bone, shell, plant macrofossils, pollen, etc.) . The package of sediments and other data comprise the primary evidence for past environments in this region; it is evident that a paleoenvironmental record is essential for studying the adaptive strategies and evolution of cultural systems in this area. At the same time our ability to generate a record of serial events and environmental contexts requires that a sound chronological framework emerge through dating of stratigraphic units, episodes of soils formation and erosional episodes. The prospects for building such a chronology lie in the continued geologic study of this area. Appraisals of past adaptive systems will be conditioned not only by primary data (relevant to both archaeological and paleoenvironmental dimensions) but also in terms of our ability to monitor differential modification of the archaeological record and differential exposure of archaeological sites within the study area. These logistical-epistemological issues are not insignificant with regard to archaeological research; quite the contrary, variability in both intersite and intrasite data may be more strongly conditioned by differential modification and exposure (detectability) than by the 'unmodified' archaeological evidence itself. The following discussions present geoarchaeological appraisals of each of the principal geomorphic-stratigraphic units defined for the Upper Trinity Basin. Of particular concern are site formation histories, site detectability and preservation potentials, and resultant implications in terms of research strategies that can improve site evaluations as well as contribute to regional research objectives. "T2" Terrace The great antiquity of these terrace deposits indicate that this terrace is a landform that had been in place long before settlement of this regions by Paleoindian populations. As a site forming context, the surface of this terrace offered potential locations .for occupations throughout the late Pleistocene and Holocene. During that interval, artifacts and features could have been deposited on the surface of the terrace, or along gullies cut into the "T2" sediments. The Lewisville cross-section (Figure 102


---

## Page 107

4.6 ) indicates perched water tables associated with this terrace. Seep springs along the terrace may have provided a focus for hunter-gatherer groups throughout prehistoric times. That these deposits have been stable or eroding over the last 12,000 years indicates generally poor site formation contexts. Sites should exhibit high potentials for erosion, mixing of artifacts of different ages and in situ deposits only along gullies or creek channels incised into the "T2" alluvium during late Pleistocene and Holocene times. Calcareous silts and clays in the upper portion of the "T2" terrace may provide locally favorable settings for bone preservation. Site visibility should be high yet strongly conditioned by local vegetation and colluvium depth. Union Terminal-Carrollton Terraces Numerous archaeological sites occur on these terraces along the Elm Fork and Trinity Rivers, and a few have been reported from these settings along the West Fork. Preceding discussions have concluded that these terraces are Pleistocene features, and therefore have little if any potential for archaeological materials buried in situ in alluvium. Nonetheless, buried materials have been found on these terraces, provoking the notion that alluviation of these terraces took place in the last 12,000 years. of concern therefore are the mechanisms that may account for burial of Holocene artifacts on Pleistocene surfaces. Two kinds of mechanisms will be discussed here: exogenetic deposition and bioturbation. In fluvial basins, exogenetic deposition refers to the introduction of sediment to the basin by non-fluvial mechanisms. These include eolian transport, slopewash (colluvium) and mudflows [Gladfelter 1977 Lewin 1978]. With respect to archaeological site construction, local redeposition of sediment may be significant. Sites on the Union Terminal-Carrollton terraces are subject to non-alluvial burial by these exogenetic mechanisms. On portions of these terraces adjacent to higher terrace or bedrock slopes, sites may be buried by colluvium. Land clearing and farming in the last 150 years may have hastened local slopewash, enhancing burial of sites. These activities have also promoted eolian redeposition on these terraces in historic times. Holocene eolian deposits have not been defined in the project area, but may be present. Such deposits would suggest considerable removal of vegetation from terrace surfaces, exposing sands and silts to deflation. Bioturbation agents also may account for buried archaeological materials on the Union Terminal-Carrollton Terraces. Rodents, other small animals, earthworms and especially insects are capable of bringing substantial amounts of subsoil to the surface each year [Wood and Johnson 1978; Stein 1983]. To the extent that small particles are transported selectively, larger 103

artifacts will gradually become buried through this vertical cycling of sediment. Features such as rock lined hearths can remain physically intact during sediment cycling. As a result, the site appears to be 'in situ' yet no allochthonous deposition has taken place. For relatively young, single component sites, this scenario has interesting connotations for geologic and archaeological studies. Well preserved assemblages, features and faunas may occur that exhibit little horizontal displacement of artifacts. Geologically, these settings only pose problems if the sediments covering the artifacts are interpreted as alluvium. This can result in erroneous alluvial chronologies to say the least. Given repeated occupations, these site formation scenarios are prone to generate 'in situ' yet badly mixed assemblages. Such sites probably account for common mistakes in projectile point 'chronologies' . ultisols on the Union Terminal-Carrollton terraces, described earlier in this section, have provided settings for bioturbated sites to form along the Trinity. These soil profiles, characterised by leached, sand-textured A-horizons over red argillic B-horizons, frequently exhibited insect burrows in the profiles. Since these soils formed over 10,000 years or more, the terrace surfaces have been potential occupation surfaces over the same interval. Bioturbation subsequent to site occupations could therefore account for the 'burial' of artifacts and features on these old terrace deposits. Overall, the Union Terminal-Carrollton terraces constitute stable surface settings for archaeological site formation. As proposed earlier, these surfaces have been the loci for occupations from Paleoindian through historic times. Individual site histories differ according to the number of occupation episodes as well as the local history of erosion, bioturbation and exogenetic deposition. Potentials for mixed archaeological deposits are high. The sand A-horizons of the soils are very porous and acid, promoting rapid bone deterioration and probably inhibiting preservation of charcoal as well. Mixing of artifacts into the underlying clay-rich B-horizons through bioturbation is likely to occur, especially for older sites. Marked declines in artifact densities at the A-B soil horizon contacts should betray this. Sites which have been occupied episodically over long intervals of time may exhibit .serial bioturbation', that is the progressive burial of artifacts over time, with apparent superpositioning of younger assemblages over older ones. While archaeological successions in such sites may be in correct relative order, the potential to establish absolute chronologies for these sites through radiometric dating is low. Overall, the archaeological research potential of sites on these terraces should be proportional to their age, when preservation of spatial patterning, faunas and datable materials are considered. However, late Pleistocene through middle Holocene alluvia are probably deeply buried under the Trinity floodplain, and the potential to 104

recover Paleoindian through middle Archaic assemblages in those contexts is minimal; accordingly, the surfaces of the Union Terminal-Carrollton terraces remain the most likely settings to recover materials from those time periods. Of necessity, these terraces must continue to be studied archaeologically. The Trinity Floodplain The floodplain of the Trinity River (encompassing the West Fork and Elm Fork as well) constitutes the most important geomorphic-stratigraphic unit with respect to archaeological contexts in the study area. Earlier discussions have stressed that the great depth of alluvium underlying the floodplain will encumber geoarchaeological investigation of sites within floodplain sediments. Nonetheless, available evidence suggests that floodplain deposits have been aggrading since the end of the Pleistocene and many if not most occupation sites in the Trinity Valley were probably located along the floodplain. At this time it is not possible to reconstruct the exact 'nature and tempo of floodplain aggradation over this interval of time. The depth of deposits will make such reconstruction difficult. Possible episodes of floodplain stability or incision will be difficult to document unless the stratigraphic-soils evidence of these events is exposed in the upper portions of the floodplain sediments (ie. in modern channel cuts that attain maximum depths of about 35 feet). While dating and paleoenvironmental study of the deeply buried sediments under the floodplain are pressing issues, both paleoenvironmental and archaeological studies are most feasible in the upper sections of the floodplain. Site formation settings on the Trinity floodplain contrast markedly with those of the terraces. Lower apparent stream energies supplied fine-grained calcareous clays and silts to the floodplain. Net rates of sedimentation may be grossly estimated for these deposits, that attain thicknesses of ca. 20 m near Dallas and Lewisville. Assuming that the floodplain aggraded from the maximum incision of the valley within the last 15,000 to 10,000 years, a net rate of sedimentation is estimated to be ca. 0.13 - 0.10 cm/yr. This moderate rate of sedimentation (cf. Ferring in prep) is ideal for the superpositioning of archaeological materials, but not too rapid to promote frequent erosion of the floodplain surface. While these estimates clearly do not consider periods of relative stability or periods of floodplain incisiQn, they suggest favorable site formation environments were common, particularly in late Holocene times. Coupled with calcareous sediments offering excellent preservation environments, the Trinity floodplain constitutes an ideal setting to study archaeological sites. The 'rub' here is that this setting constitutes a poor place to discover archaeological sites because of burial depth. That the Trinity floodplain has not aggraded with the same 105

tempo during the Holocene is evident for the upper (late Holocene) portion of this record. The West Fork paleosol provides evidence for a period of floodplain stability beginning in late Archaic times and ending sometime just after about 1500-1350 B.P. At that time, the floodplain soil was buried, and renewed alluviation commenced. The geoarchaeological implications of this history are clear. Sites of late Archaic and older age are buried beneath younger alluvium over a great portion of the Trinity floodplain. Relative paleosurface stability during late Archaic times will have promoted the potential for more common archaeological sites in assciation with that buried surface, holding population sizes and occupational intensities constant (the latter are major assumptions, with little if any empirical basis at this time). Though difficult to detect, most archaeological sites along the Trinity floodplain have a high probability of significant records of subsistence, intrasite patterning, and activities. Geomorphic Settings of Prehistoric Sites The geomorphic settings of prehistoric sites in the Upper Trinity Basin study area have been summarized by estimated archaeological components (Table 4.9). Not all of these sites have been visited, and the settings for many have been defined through the use of site survey forms and Taggart's (1953) map (Figure 4.3). Given the tentative nature of evidence in support of the archaeological components, the high number of unclassified prehistoric sites, and the quite difficult task of estimating geologic contexts, this summary of site settings is highly prone to error. Nonetheless, it provides a needed focus for brief discussion of the geoarchaeological record that is present in the study area. This discussion is relevant to later site prediction and cultural resources management sections of this report. The sample of 73 prehistoric sites is characterized by an inverse relationship between site frequency and site age (Table 4.9), excluding the unclassified group. Does this mean that the Upper Trinity Basin was inhabited by larger populations in Late Prehistoric times than in earlier periods? Reference to the geoarchaeological discussion makes clear that (a) this question cannot be answered without adjusting site frequency for geologic context, and (b) the potential exposures of sediments containing earlier sites are too limited to enable 'weighted' comparisons. Late Prehistoric sites are expected to occur in floodplain settings, above the West Fork paleosol, and also on any of the terraces. Their detectability should be higher in these settings, compared to older sites. While the detectability 'factor' cannot be estimated, it could conceivably be large enough to thwart population estimates via site frequencies (see Section VIr for discussion of population estimates using inter 106

and intrasite data). An additional factor is chronological duration of the component periods. The "Archaic" period is several millennia long, while the Late Prehistoric period in all is shorter by an order of magnitude. The issue of 'how many sites per year' (a much better population estimator) is conditioned as strongly by geologic context as is the detectability (what percentage of the sites that exist have we found?) factor. If steady-state populations are assumed, the apparent frequencies of sites meet the geologic expectations in terms of burial and exposure of sites. Young sites are more common on the floodplain, while sites of all ages are found on the terraces (Paleoindian components are notably absent from the sample). In this context, it is important to note that each of the six Late Prehistoric sites in "T4" settings occur in the area of the Irving Quadrangle map. This area, encompassing the confluence of the West Fork and Elm Fork, as well as extremely intensive development, may be subject to complicating geologic-preservation factors. In order to reconstruct population dynamics, a much more detailed chronostratigraphy must be established, and the intrasite correlates of increasing or decreasing populations must be vigorously studied (see section VII). The settings of prehistoric sites in the study area also suggest overall parameters of site condition, given predicted site formation settings associated with the geomorphic units. Well over half of the sites occur on terraces, suggesting poor contexts. Yet a fair number of these are either Late Prehistoric or Late Prehistoric-Archaic in age. Since site condition is expected to be in part proportional to site age, terrace sites may well exhibit well preserved features and spatial patterning. At the same ti~e, Late Prehistoric sites on the floodplain may have been more vulnerable to plowing and other forms of disturbance. Sites with better preservation potentials are those in floodplain settings that occur at or below the West Fork paleosol. Several examples of these kinds of sites have been found in the central portion of the Elm Fork valley in the project area. As is mentioned in Section I of this report, there are very few archaeological sites known along the West Fork of the Trinity. This pattern contrasts dramatically with site 'densities' on the Elm Fork as well as tributaries to the Elm Fork. The low frequencies of West Fork sites is of potential significance to settlement pattern stUdies. Initially our review suggested that the West Fork's recent depositional history may be quite different from that of the Elm Fork. Now, however, it is clear that the West Fork paleosol has a lateral equivalent along the Elm Fork, and that late Holocene deposition following formation of this soil characterizes both drainages. Either low site numbers on the West Fork simply represent less survey (both avocational and associated with landuse impact assessment) or there are as yet unidentified environmental-geologic factors that 108

account for the observed pattern. The common exposures of the West Fork paleosol along the West Fork channel and in gravel pit walls will serve as a marker horizon for future surveys. Paleoenvironmental Considerations The late Pleistocene and Holocene paleoenvironments of the Upper Trinity Basin are of critical importance for interpreting geologic data and for assessing possible adaptive changes by prehistoric populations. As indicated by a recent comprehensive review of paleoenvironments in Texas [Bryant and Holloway 1985], the North Texas Region has one of the poorest data bases in terms of past environments in the state and broader region. Virtually no pollen data have been recovered from this area, save for records that are poorly dated or have posed analytical problems [Raab and Woosley 1982; Bryant and Holloway 1985: 64-65]. Paleontologic data permitting climatic-environmental reconstructions are notably absent. Willimon's [1972] vertebrate and invertebrate data are the youngest Pleistocene faunas published, and they date to ca. 20,000 - 23,000 B.P., making them of diminished relevance to archaeological considerations. Using paleoenvironmental data from localities quite distant from the project area, the following brief review of late Quaternary paleoenvironments outlines apparent patterns of climatic and environmental change in the North Texas region. Such considerations highlight the need for local data and the significance of these data with respect to archaeological records in this area. Full glacial (ca.20,000-15,000 B.P.) environments are not well known in this region, but are nonetheless clearly distinct from Holocene settings. Cool if not cold climates, increased precipitation and disjunct communities of plants and animals are characteristic. Conifer parklands, including spruce and pine among deciduous elements were present from Kansas to central Texas, and extended eastwards into the western portions of the Mississippi Valley [Bryant and Holloway 1985; Gruger 1973; Hafsten 1961; King 1973]. It is virtually certain that these parklands were present in the Upper Trinity Basin. Extinct megafaunas of this period, and smaller vertebrates that today occupy allopatric territories, suggest biotic associations having no modern counterpart [Lundelius 1976]. Increased precipitation, possibly coupled with decreased evaporation rates are significant with respect to fluvial regimes; the latter must have been characterized by greater stream energies, given the evidence in the Upper Trinity Valley for incision during this interval. Detailed analysis of new borings will be necessary to document those fluvial environments. 109

The late glacial period (ca. 15,000 - 10,000 B.P.) witnessed the demise of the moist climates of the full glacial, significant changes in vegetation, and the extinction of megafaunas. Towards the end of this period, warmer grasslands with only relict members of the conifer woodlands are evident in central Texas [Bryant 1977], southwestern Oklahoma [Wilson 1966] and southeastern Oklahoma [Bryant and Holloway 1985]. The pollen record from Ferndale Bog, in southeastern Oklahoma (Figure 4.17) documents the replacement of the late glacial parkland by a grass and forb-dominated steppe shortly after 12,000 B.P.. A corresponding increase in grasses is recorded somewhat later than this in central Texas at Boriack Bog (Figure 4.17). Together, these records suggest that the Upper Trinity Valley must have undergone similar vegetational changes. The distance of pollen records from the study area nonetheless encumbers reconstruction of the timing and character of such changes. Overall, however, the shift towards warmer climates and significantly more open grasslands is important with respect to Paleoindian adaptations. Holocene environmental conditions appear to have been characterized both by successional changes in vegetation, and by responses to climatic change in the last 10,000 years by plant and animal communities. Today, older concepts and preconceptions concerning Holocene paleoenvironments are being challenged. New evidence suggests that arid mid-Holocene climates are difficult to document for the Texas region [Bryant and Holloway 1985]. Rather, this interval may be seen as one of transition from drier early Holocene environments to a late Holocene characterised by increasing moisture. Expansion of the oak-hickory forests of eastern Oklahoma after ca.6,000 B.P. may have implications with respect to the Upper Trinity Basin. A possible local response to this interval of gradual climatic change is expansion of the ·Cross Timbers at the expense of prairies. This would imply a potential increase in forest plant and animal resources. Such changes would have significant impacts on occupation potentials, which are presumed to have been relatively low during drier early Holocene times. A gradual trend of increasing moisture may also signify the potential for greater runoff and exhanced rates of sedimentation. Preceding discussions have indicated that Holocene aggradation of the Trinity Valley resulted in deposition of very thick alluvial deposits along the West and Elm Forks of the Trinity. Shifts towards moister climates are elsewhere correlated with periods of active alluviation [Knox 1983]. Late Holocene climates and environments have been studied with the benefit of better data in the southern Plains. Hall [1982] has indicated that the first millennium A.D. was characterized by moister climates than prevail today, while the last 1,000 years have been dominated by essentially modern climates. This record was clearly suggested by data from Delaware 110

Canyon in southwestern Oklahoma [Ferring 1982]. Locally, formation of the West Fork paleosol appears to have culminated during the middle of the first millennium A.D.. Whether this soil formed in response to climatic change, or was also part of a gradual attainment of graded streams remains to be documented. Pollen data from Ferndale Bog suggest that the trend towards increasing forest cover in southeastern Oklahoma was long-term. Better records from other portions of the southern Plains, in particular for the interval between 5,000 and 2,000 B.P. are needed to evaluate the relative change in climates during the late Holocene. Overall, there is regional evidence for major, long-term changes in climates and environments during the late Quaternary in this region. For the last 12,000 years, these have had important implications with respect to possible adaptive changes by prehistoric populations inhabiting the Upper Trinity Basin. Following introduction of Paleoindian populations into the area, resource bases changed, perhaps quantitatively as well as qualitatively. Extinction of Pleistocene megafaunas, coupled with expansion of grasslands under warmer and drier climates undoubtedly forced new adaptive strategies on the part of Early and Middle Archaic populations. Unfortunately, the alluvial history of the Trinity proposed earlier suggests that sites of this age will be extremely difficult to detect, encumbering archaeological studies of this period. Long-term increases in occupation potentials are suggested for the late Holocene, as a result of gradually increasing moisture regimes, which would have increased vegetation cover, in particular the forest curnrnunities of the Cross Timbers. It is tempting to suggest that these conditions were even more ideal during the period of ca. 2500 to 1200 years B.P. That climates were moister then is evident in contrast to modern climates; how they compare with climates during the preceding two millenia are less well known. Overall, however, the study of past environments and associated records of human adaptations in the study area remains a challenging and significant area for continued research. The paucity of well-documented records pertaining to both environments and cultures in this region signify the need to manage these resources in a manner that will ensure advances in our ability to reconstruct the events and their implications for both regional and theoretical issues. 112

SECTION V PREHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY by Cheri L. Douglass, Daniel J. Prikryl, C. Reid Ferring Introduction One of the principal aims of this investigation was a documentation and review of the prehistoric archaeological sites in the Upper Trinity Basin. Prior work suggested that prehistoric sites were far more numerous in the documented literature than were historic sites in the project area. Our investigations have confirmed this general observation. As described below, the long-term avocational interest in prehistoric sites, to a large degree, explains their more common documentation in the project area in deference to the historical sites. Nonetheless, our objectives here included documentation and evaluation of the prehistoric sites in the study area. Some 90 sites are known to occur in the Upper Trinity Basin project area. Given the status of prehistoric archaeological investigations in the Northcentral Texas region, this must be considered a substantial resource base for the reconstruction of past lifeways, the definition of adaptive strategies, and the multidisciplinary study of culture change throughout the terminal Pleistocene and Holocene Periods. This section of the report describes the archaeological sites, indicates the nature of previous investigations of these sites, and provides a theoretical and methodological rationale for evaluating the sites individually and collectively with respect to their research significance. These criteria are necessary for evaluation of archaeological sites and implementation of a cultural resources management program. Methods of Investigation As defined in the Scope of Work, a variety of methods have been used in order to document, describe, and evaluate the archaeological sites in the project area and to develop a framework from which their significance may be evaluated. First, an information search was conducted th~~ included investigation of site files at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, the Texas Historical Commission, and local universities. Published reports concerning prehistoric archaeological investigations were reviewed, and local avocational and professional archaeologists who have worked in or near the project area were interviewed. 113

An additional aspect of our investigations included site visits. Numerous sites in the project area were visited in the field both as strictly archaeological visits and also when possible in order to accommodate archaeological and geologic objectives. The results of these site visits are included in the updated site files as well as the recommendations concerning possible future work at specific sites. One dimension of site evaluation is the aerial photograph analysis described in Appendix A. This analysis provided assistance in identifying the condition of archaeological sites that were not visited during the course. of this project, as well as the assessment of potential site preservation for areas that have not been previously inspected for site presence. Summary of Previous Investigations The organized study of archaeology in the Upper Trinity Basin began in the 1940's with the founding of the Dallas Archaeological Society (DAS). Much of our understanding of archaeology in this area stems from the efforts of this group. Over half of the sites in the project area were recorded in the early 1940s by the members of the DAS including Harris, Kirkland, Hatzenbuehler, McElroy and others. Reports on their archaeological investigations were published regularly in the DAS newsletter, The Record [for the list of publications concerning previous investigations, see Table 5.1J. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, the DAS participated in salvage work being conducted in area reservoirs, such as Lake Lavon and Lake Dallas, One result of avocational work along the East Fork was the discovery of large circular depressions in certaip sites [Wilson 1946J, which later became a diagnostic feature of the Wylie Focus [Stephenson 1952J. Also well-known in the 1950s was Crook and Harris' [1957, 1958, 1968] work at the Lewisville Site, 41DN72. Although members of the DAS continued to be active in the region, investigations of sites in the project area declined during the 1950s. No new sites were reportted in the project area during this time; however, Crook and Harris were publishing the results of their investigations of project area sites, particularly the Wheeler site (41DL30), the Wood Site (41DL76), and the Milton site (41DL259). The Carrollton and Elam foci were defined as a result of their work at these and other sites [Crook and Harris 1952, 1954a]. 114

The DAS continues to be active in our area, with several new sites reported by members beginning in the 1960s and continuing on into the 1980s. In all, over half the sites in the project area have been recorded by this group. Professional investigations began regionally in the late 1940s with surveys sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution at Grapevine [Stephenson 1948J, and Lavon and Garza-Little Elm [Stephenson 1949aJ and Benbrook [Stephenson 1949cJ reservoirs. No professional investigations on the Trinity and its tributaries in the project area occurred until the 19705. Since 1970, several surveys have been conducted by professional archaeologists as contract work. Some of these surveys have led to the discovery of new sites and allowed for continuing investigations of previously reported sites. other surveys have covered only small areas, and often no sites were discovered. A listing of surveys conducted within or bordering our project area is available in Table 5.2. The results of these surveys should be on file with the sponsoring agency, and all survey areas are plotted on topographical quadrangles on file with the Ft. worth Corps of Engineers. Despite the combined efforts of professionals and amateurs, much work remains to be done on this area of the Trinity. Almost all our information is from scattered surface finds or from artifacts found eroding from the walls of gravel pits. Very few sites have even been tested, and almost all testing that has been done was performed by members of the DAS. Only one site within the project area has been professionally excavated, Northlake Site (41DL234) [Morgan 1975J. One other site in this immediate region was professionally excavated, 41DN260 [McCormick et al. 1975J, but this site was not included in the project area. The need for more controlled investigations with defined research goals becomes clear when the nature of the previous investigations are considered. Culture History Four stages which have both developmental and temporal connotations have been defined for the North Central area of Texas [Suhm et al. 1954, Lynott 1977J. These stages are: Paleoindian ? to 8GOO B.P. Archaic 8000 B.P. to A.D. 500 Late Prehistoric A.D. 500 to 1600 Historic A.D. 1600 to present 121

The associated dates follow the generally accepted chronological framework; however, some overlapping of stages probably occurred. This section of the report deals only with the prehistoric stages. Paleoindian The Paleoindian period is characterized by small nomadic bands adapted to conditions that existed at the end of the Pleistocene. Although the Paleoindian economy has traditionally been characterized as primarily based on the exploitation of now extinct Pleistocene megafauna, solid evidence of a reliance on big game hunting is lacking in many areas of North America including North central Texas [Bryant and Shafer 1977, Johnson 1977]. The diagnostic artifacts for this period are the distinctive, finely worked lanceolate projectile points which are sometimes fluted (Figure 5.1). Within the immediate project area, our knowledge of Paleoindian occupations is based entirely on occasional surface finds of projectile points. Pemberton Hill Site is a possible Paleoindian site, located east of White Rock Creek near its confluence with the Trinity it was reported to contain biface fragments, a scraper and flakes in association with the bones of Pleistocene age bison, mammoth, and camel [Crook and Harris 1957; Archaeology Resource Consultants 1978]. The Lagow Sand Pit Site, west of White Rock Creek, contained a partially fossilized human skeleton associated with extinct Pleistocene fauna [Shuler 1923]. This was originally believed to provide evidence for a Paleoindian occupation, but later analysis showed that the faunal remains were older than the human skeleton [Oakley and Howells 1961]. Although the impression has been given that Crook considered this to be a Paleoindian site, his 1961 article actually stated that this skeleton was probably Early Archaic in age [cf. Archaeology Resource Consultants 1978; Bennett et al. 1981]. The Lewisville Site (41DN72), immediately north of our project area, is one of the more famous of the Paleoindian sites. At this site, a clovis point was found within one of twenty-two burned clay features that were interpreted as hearths [Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1968]. Pleistocene faunal materials occurred within and adjacent to these features. The site was originally dated at greater than 37,000 B.P., but more recent investigations have demonstrated that the presence of lignite in the features is responsible for these dates [Stanford 1981; Schiley et al. 1985]. 124

The Field Ranch site in Cooke County provides other evidence of the presence of Paleoindian hunters along the Elm Fork. This site is located north of the present project area. Seven projectile points, including Clovis, Folsom, Midland, Plainview, and Hell Gap types, were found by avocational archaeologists. Later, archaeologists from SMU exposed two hearths but did not find any associated diagnostic artifacts. Also recovered at the site were hammerstones, denticulates, a graver, a side-scraper, a gouge, and flakes [Jensen 1968]. Overall, we have very limited data on the presence of Paleoindian groups in our area. These few isolated finds do not provide evidence of how these people utilized their environment or what their patterns of movement were. The discovery and controlled excavation of good in situ sites~ would greatly increase our understanding of this period. Archaic Small bands of hunters and gatherers are also characteristic of the Archaic, but the movement of these bands is considered more restricted than in the Paleoindian period. Rather than following the migrations of large herd animals, movement followed a seasonal pattern so that locally available food could be harvested. A wider variety of plant and animal resources were exploited. Deer and smaller mammals were hunted, riverine resources were utilized, and the collections of plants was intensified. Stemmed dart points dominate the artifact assemblages, and the appearance of other artifacts, such as grinding stones, reflected changes in subsistence strategies. Other diagnostic artifacts for this period include pitted stones, Waco "Sinkers," and gouges (Figures 5.2 - 5.5). In his paper, The Archaic of Northcentral Texas, Olin McCormick [1976a] proposed that the-Archaic people of this area were migratory hunters and gatherers, moving along the Prairie/Cross Timbers ecotone. From their seasonal base camps, the resources of the prairies and the Woodlands could be exploited. Smaller activity-specific camps, such as hunting/fishing sites, lithic manufacturing stations, and transitory camps, were located well into either major ecosystem so that those resources could also be utilized. He speculated that these people were moving from the southern Plains area in the fall and then back north again in the early spring. Our knowledge of Archaic occupations in this area is somewhat more complete than for the Paleoindian period, but, as previously noted, it is based almost entirely on traits defined by lithic surface finds and artifacts eroded out of gravel and sand pits. 126

Only a few isolated lithic artifacts indicate the presence of Early Archaic groups in this area. The Middle and Late Archaic is somewhat better known due to the efforts of Crook and Harris [1952, 1954a,bJ who published several articles on the Carrollton and Elam foci. Based on stratigraphic relationships and comparative data from better known adjacent geographical areas, the Carrollton Focus is considered to the Middle Archaic, while the Elam Focus is considered to be Late Archaic [Crook and Harris 1952; Lynott 1977J. Middle Archaic assemblages include large triangular-bladed dart points with square-based stems, usually ground, such as Carrollton and Trinity type points. Also included are Carrollton axes, Waco Sinkers, Clear Fork-like gouges and burned clay blobs [Crook and Harris 1952J. Late Archaic sites were characterized by an increased use of local quartzites and smaller points, with the Elam, Ellis, Darl, Gary and Yarbrough points common [Crook and Harris 1952; McCormick 1976a; Lynott 1977J. The only date for the Archaic in the project area was 5,945 + 200 B.P. at the base of the Carrollton component at the Wood site (41DL76) [Crook and Harris 1959J. The date is not considered reliable because it is based on mussel shell rather than charcoal. Late Prehistoric Technologically, the Late Prehistoric is marked by the appearance of ceramics and the introduction of the bow and arrow. However, use of dart points may continue into the Late Prehistoric (Figure 5.6). A shift in settlement patterns from seasonally occupied camps to more permanently settled villages associated with temporary hunting camps is expected. In many areas this period is associated with agriculture; however, no evidence of agriculture has been found within the project area. The Late Prehistoric of the Upper Trinity is best known on the East Fork through the investigation of Wylie Focus sites [Wilson 1946; Stephenson 1952; Ross 1966; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975aJ. Sites which may be permanent camps or villages with the diagnostic feature of large circular pits have been recorded. The function of these pits is unknown, but hypotheses include ritual or dance areas or large house sites. Burials, sometimes with multiple interments and occasionally with grave goods, numerous hearths, a few 'animal burials, trash pits and shell concentrations have been associated with large pits. Radiocarbon dates indicate these pits were in use from 900 to 1600 A.D. A few houses, trash pits, hearths, and burials have been found in the habitation areas of these sites. Ceramics have been recovered and appear to be a mix of Caddoan types and Nocona Plain of the Henrietta Focus. . 131

Small amounts of charred corn were recovered from the Butler Hole, Campbell's Hole, and Hogge Bridge sites [Stephenson 1952], but pollen analysis from the sister Grove Site does not yield any evidence of prehistoric agriculture [Lynott 1974]. As with earlier stages, our knowledge of Late Prehistoric occupations within the project area is insufficient. Two phases, early and late, have been noted, but these often occur together in mixed context [Lynott 1977]. The early phase is characterized by sand or grog-tempered ceramics associated with the Caddoan Gibson Aspect of East Texas. Diagnostic arrow point types include Alba, Scallorn and Rockwall and show resemblances to Gibson Aspect and the central Texas Austin Phase. An early phase Late Prehistoric date of AD 950 100 was obtained at Northlake Site (41DL234) [Morgan 1975; Lynott 1977]. The late phase partially correlates with the Henrietta Focus which was originally defined by Krieger [1946] based on excavations at the M.D. Harrell Site, located in Young County at the confluence of the Clear Fork and the Brazos River. Diagnostic artifacts include plain, shell-tempered Nocona Plain pottery and Fresno, Harrell, Washita, and Perdiz type arrow points. Dates for the late phase of the Late Prehistoric are 1575 + 145 from the West Wheeler Site (41DL30) [Harris 1959] and 1310-+ 120 from the Golf Course Site (4lDL35) [Harris, personal corom. in Lynott 1977]. The Northlake site provides the best evidence of a Late Prehistoric occupation in the project area. The lower levels appear to be a Late Archaic occupation, and an early phase Late Prehistoric occupation was present in the upper levels [Lynott 1977]. A total of twelve pottery sherds were recovered from levels two and three; six were decorated with incised single or parallel lines, and the rest were of a punctate design. The radiocarbon date 950 + 100 A.D. was obtained from charcoal in level three where the first appearance of pottery and worked bone artifacts were found and where an increase in ground stone was noted [Morgan 1975]. No pollen or artifactual evidence was found that would indicate horticulture was practiced. The ground stone artifacts were probably being used to process non-domesticated vegetal matter. Hunting and the gathering of aquatic fauna appeared to be the major subsistence activities throughout the occupation of this site [Morgan 1975]. Balsam Gourd Site (4lDL260) near Lewisville also seems to represent a late phase occupation [Lynott 1977]. One Harrell type point and 116 pottery sherds were recovered. It appeared to have been revisited periodically by small groups [McCormick et al. 1975] 133 •

While it is difficult to classify many Late Prehistoric sites into types due to lack of data, bison kill sites are more common in the Late Prehistoric. The presence of these sites has led Lynott's [1979] to theorize that bison may have been more plentiful in Northcentral Texas during the late phase of the Late Prehistoric period (1200-1600 A.D.). These sites are usually found along secondary drainages of the Trinity, perhaps since in these locations bison could be driven off bluffs into the creek valley [Skinner et al. 1978]. An example of this type site occurs in our project area near Denton Creek. Morris and Morris [1970] excavated a bison kill there that contained a small triangular point embedded between two of the ribs of the bison (Figure 5.7). Two vertebrae of the bison were deformed, and these were examined by Dr. George Race of Baylor Hospital. He concluded that some time before the animal's death it had been pierced, probably by the shaft of a spear, which had broken off, leaving part embedded between the two bones. Another kill site was reported on Dixon's Branch of White Rock Creek. Three small triangular points were found inside the rib cage of a bison [Harris and Harris 1970]. All of the information discussed so far has been for the Elm Fork and main Trinity Channel. The lack of data for the West Fork is overwhelming. Only six of our sites for the entire project area were from the West Fork, and five of these were of undetermined prehistoric age. Obviously, this area needs much more work. For all stages of the prehistoric period within our project area more research is needed to clear up the chronology. Most important, systematic excavations need to be performed, and more ·radiocarbon dates will have to be obtained before the chronology will become clear. Summary Although many sites are known in the Upper Trinity Basin, interpretations have been limited by the nature of the previous investigations. A comment in Skinner et al. 1978:23a that in this region Archaic culture groups have been defined primarily by artifact traits and not on the adaptive strategies utilized in their time period, applies to the whole of prehistory in this area. For this reason, as stated, a great deal of research will be needed before the chronology of this area will be understood, and only a few conclusions can be made generally about subsistence strategies, settlement patterns, and intrasite activities. 134

One aspect of the subsistence strategy is clear, during both the Archaic and Late Prehistoric stages, riverine resources were being exploited. Over half the site reports noted the presence of mussel shell; however, Parmalee and Klippel [1974] have shown that these have a low caloric and protein value and should be viewed only as a dietary supplement. Very few sites contain other faunal materials, and in most cases the bone is too fragmentary to be identified. Species that have been identified include deer and small game, turtle and fish. Bison kills occur in Late Prehistoric stages and may indicate either a change in exploitative strategies or a more plentiful supply of bison. 41DL252 does contain bison size bone, but no analysis has been performed to determine the species. No direct evidence for horticulture or agriculture has been found within the project area. The pollen analysis of samples from Northlake Site did not indicate the presence of corn. As stated, Morgan[1975] concluded that the hunting of small game and the gathering of aquatic resources constituted the major subsistence activities throughout the site's occupation. Among the native floral resources that could have been exploited in the project area are the acorn, pecan, and hickory nut crops of the Eastern Cross Timbers and river bottomland forests. McCormick et al. [1975] presented a list of other edible plants in the vicinity of the Balsam Gourd Site and which would be found within or near the project area. Research is also still needed to understand the settlement patterns within this area. A few specific activities sites have been recognized. These include quarry sites such as 41DL25 and the twelve sites recorded between Prairie Creek and White Rock Creek [Hatzenbuehler 1942a]. Broken cobbles and cqres are reported from these sites, but no finished tools were found. Bison kill sites, such as excavated by Morris and Morris [1970], have alre,ady been discussed. Many sites appear to have been large camps that were occasionally reoccupied throughout much of the prehistoric period. These include Wood site (41DL76), 41DL69, and 41TR70. Small camp sites, generally located on the floodplain near the Trinity or Elm Fork, have also been recorded. These are primarily composed of mussel shell, burned rock, and few tools and seem to represent single occupations. Procurement and processing of freshwater mussel may have been a cornmon subsistence activity at these sites [Hays et al. 1972]. X41DL01 is an example of this type of site. 136

Although more permanent camps or villages may be expected during the Late Prehistoric stages, no direct evidence for villages has been found within our project area. However, the Wylie Focus sites on the nearby East Fork could be interpreted as villages. Evidence of burials has been reported from several sites within and near the project area. Upstream from the project area, at least seven burials have been reported from site 41DL83, which is located below the White Rock Lake Spillway [Kirkland and Harris 1941; Hatzenbuehler and Harris 1949; Harris 1949b]. Grave goods associated with the burials at 41DL83 include several turtle shell beads and stone beads, which were found arranged in a way that suggested they had been used as a necklace. Within the project area burials have been reported at 41DL35 which is situated on the Elm Fork Golf Course [Hays et al. 1972; skinner et al. 1978]. Additionally, a human skull was recovered at the Wheeler Site [Crook 1952] and an isolated human skeleton was discovered by Albritton and Patillo [1940] at 41DL27 about 0.3 miles south of the Wheeler site. Fragments of human bone that showed indications of cremation were recovered at 41DL234. Considering the nature of the data, it is not surprising that little is known about intrasite activities within our project area. With few sites tested and only one excavated, hearths and burials are almost the only features even recorded. In conclusion, the need for more research for all stages of prehistory in the Upper Trinity Basin is apparent. Due to the nature of the previous investigations, our understanding of the region is based almost entirely on lithic and ceramic artifacts. "The occurrence of out-of-context artifacts or the size of archaeological sites is not a useful measure of archaeological significance" [Skinner et al. 1978:29]. Systematic investigations, accurate recording of finds, and defined research goals are needed. Although without doubt more sites will be found along the Trinity and its tributaries, sites are rapidly being destroyed. It is disturbing to note the number of known sites that are either destroyed or highly disturbed by construction or quarrying. So much remains to be learned that we must try to recover what data we can using controlled methods before these resources are lost forever. Descriptions of all the known prehistoric sites in our project area are available in Appendix B. Historic sites and historic components of sites will be dealt with in a later section. Locations of these sites are shown in Figure 5.8a,b,c. Table 5.3 summarizes site information. 137

cultural Ecology of the Upper Trinity Basin Perspectives for cultural Resources Management Archaeological research in the Upper Trinity Basin will undoubtedly take a different course than that associated with most large-scale projects. The permit area-by-permit area consideration of known and predicted archaeological sites will challenge cultural resources managers to implement consistent methodologies for site evaluation and if necessary site study. These must be linked by methods and theoretical perspectives that will in the long run ensure that the collective efforts in the project area can make long-term contributions to regional history. The long-term case-by-case nature of anticipated efforts in the area highlights the importance of assessing intrasite characteristics as they relate to intersite and regional characteristics of theoretical and regional concern. A perspective that defines research objectives suitable for determining archaeological site significance is provided by cultural ecology and the study of culture change. The fundamentally diachronic aspects of archaeology [Plog 1977] highlight the opportunities that prehistoric archaeology may contribute to an explanation of long-term culture change, and in particular culture change in respon"se to environmental change. Additionally, perspectives provided by geoarchaeology [Butzer 1982] indicate the importance of ascertaining individual site histories within a project area as they relate to the fundamental character of archaeological variability. Therefore, site formation processes, including depositional and post-depositional geologic histories are integral in the determination of site significance and in the subsequent analysis of archaeological variability within and between sites. cultural ecology is the broad sub-discipline within anthropology that investigates the relationships between cultures and their biotic-cultural-physical environment. . Key objectives of cultural ecology include the definition of rates and kinds of change over time under conditions ranging from stable resource availabilities to dramatically changing resource availabilities. certain kinds of change must be addressed in the course of cultural ecologic studies. These include changing populations sizes and structures, changing demographic arrangements, differences in the division of labor or the scheduling of resource procurement activities, changing procurement and processing technologies, etc. All of these are areas of potential archaeological investigation, and all must be addressed in terms of "culture change" as a generic umbrella to these specific inquiries. An evolutionary perspective is necessary in 147

such studies because diachronic patterns of variability in cultures are fundamental to synchronic adaptive strategies. The appeal to evolutionary principles for investigating cultural ecological change is therefore a natural theoretical direction for archaeology to take. It is important to point out that much culture history remains to be accomplished in the North Texas region. Much previous work has focused on culture history with efforts directed towards identifying the "cultures" that are represented by the assemblages at specific sites. The methods of cultural ecology do not avoid the goals of culture history. On the contrary, by studying culture change it is virtually essential that detailed descriptions of technological and stylistic variation within and between assemblages be accumulated in the course of investigations. Culture ecology therefore provides a framework that places culture history in perspective and within a much broader theoretical vantage point. The analysis of culture change under stable environmental conditions provides one focus for cultural ecologic studies. Another is the study of systems under changing environmental conditions. The analysis of change under either case entails consideration of key dimensions of cultural systems, which should be investigated with respect to environmental conditions (Table 5.4). Population size, differentiation and integration within and between population units, and energy are the key dimensions defined by Plog [1977]. These have distinct behavioral correlates [Ferring and Peter 1982] and distinct archaeological . correlates with respect to intersite and intrasite variability. These archaeological correlates, then, are used to ultimately comment on the target analytical dimensions that link the cultural ecologic perspectives to cultural resources management, because these correlates define characteristics. For example, any cultural evolutionary study must consider population size and demographic arrangements as fundamental variables in the system. Both intersite and intrasite archaeological correlates have been defined. On an intersite level, the number of sites is the primary correlate. Archaeologists have realized for years that ascertaining the "number of sites" pertaining to any given period or to any given cultural unit is among our most elusive objectives. On the other hand, intrasite correlates for population are more manageable. Site size, artifact densities, and spatial patterning all comment on the patterns with which the archaeological site was used. In a diachronic setting, changing sizes of sites, changing artifact densities, changing spatial relationships among the clusters comment not only on the estimated population size of the group usi~~ the sites, but also the apparent intensity and periodicity with which the site was occupied. 148

When complemented with evidence of functional differentiation and social integration, intrasite analysis, which comments on population size and demographic arrangements, may be realized. These archaeological correlates, therefore, define criteria that may be used in the ascertainment of individual site significance. Later, the link between the systems analysis and geoarchaeology will be well illustrated by using artifact densities and spatial patterning as characteristics of prehistoric sites, which are created within the archaeological record, only through the interplay between cultural and natural (geologic) factors. other analytical dimensions such as functional differentiation and social integration have archaeological correlates at the intersite and intrasite level. Functional differentiation and energy use, for instance, have as intrasite correlates evidence for spatial associations among tools and features and the floral and faunal remains for occupation units. In a cultural resources management scenario, the significance of a specific site may then be better evaluated in terms of the degree to which evidence for functional differentiation and .energy are preserved within a site. It should be clear that archaeologists have assessed "significance" with many of these archaeological correlates in mind. .The presentation here simply puts these correlates in a structure that is formally linked to behavioral correlates and the primary analytical dimensions indicated (Table 5.4). 150

SECTION VI HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY by Nancy G. Reese, Cecily A. Pegues and Bonnie C. Yates Introduction This research has met several objectives. First, it provides a list of previously documented historical cultural resources sites in the study area. It further assesses the kind and number of such sites, as well as the potential for locating them via archaeological survey in the future. Lastly, substantive recommendations to the study of history and historical archaeology in the project area are given. The project area is characterized by minimal research in historical archaeology. Most cultural resources sites in the study area have been identified during sponsored (academic or governmental) surveys, and their condition has not been verified by physical inspection in recent years. Others surmised locations derived from archival sources (e.g., Sam Street's maps). Exceptions to this situation include a survey of the Dallas Floodway Extension [Bennett et al. 1981] and ongoing archaeological investigations at Ray Roberts and Joe Pool reservoirs, each of which has added substantially to our knowledge of historic archaeological sites. Numerous sites at Ray Roberts show promise of providing important data concerning nineteenth and early twentieth century patterns of land use, economic-trade development, and social patterns in a largely rural setting [Skinner et al. 1982b]. Archaeological survey [Skinner and Conners 1979] and test excavations [Raab et al. 1982b] at Joe Pool Reservoir documented a series of sites ranging in age from the 1850s to the first quarter of this century. These sites exhibit a range of ethnic sources of occupants, functional diversity based on site setting as well as economic orientation of the owners-tenants; evidence of internal structural-artifactual variation exemplifying differential patterns of land tenureshir economir change and response to local socio-econOML~ eVolution has also been documented. These studies offer guides for developing longer-range plans concerning the significance of as yet undefined cultural resources sites in the project area and methods for locatinq ~nd evaluating potential resource sites. 152

Methods During the course of collecting data for the Trinity River Project, research was conducted at the following institutions: the Texas state Archives, Austin; the Barker Texas History Center at The University of Texas at Austin; the General Land Office in Austin; the Austin Public Library; the collections of the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin; the Willis Library at North Texas state University in Denton; the Texas History Collection at the Dallas Public Library; the Texas Collection at southern Methodist University; the Archives of the Dallas County Historical Society at the Hall of State, Fair Park in Dallas; and the library of Texas Womens University in Denton. The collections of these institutions were scanned for relevant data pertaining to the three-county region (Dallas, Denton, and Tarrant), and more particularly for information relating to the Trinity River Floodplain in these counties. This information was recorded and is presented in various forms throughout this report. In addition to extensive library search, informal interviews were conducted with the following individuals: Marty Craddock of the Tarrant County Historic Preservation Council; Duane Gage of Tarrant County Historical Commission; John Crain of the Dallas County Historical Society; A.C. Greene, Dallas historian; Yvonne Jenkins, Director of the Museum on the Square, Denton County Historical Society; and Bullitt Lowry and Dale Odom, History Faculty, North Texas State University, Denton. All these individuals shared generously of their time and expertise. After these data were compiled, historic archaeological sites (identified by the trinomial system of TARL, e.g., 41DL234) and potential historic localities were plotted on maps, and a survey crew attempted to ground check a number of locations. Although a great many of the potential localities are currently under Interstate-35, downtown Dallas, or commercial parks, the crew managed to locate a few, and where possible, notes were made and photographs were taken. The crew also made note of those locations that appeared to be relatively undisturbed, where the potential integrity of sites might be intact. Historic Overview "Called Daycoa by some Indians, Arkikosa by others, in 1690 Alonso de Leon, a Mexican-born officer of the Spanish crown, bestowed its modern name: La Santisima Trinidad. The Most Holy Trinity." [Greene 1973:3] 153

The region around the three forks of the Trinity River can be considered historically to be a relative newcomer as it does not have the long historical record that some portions of Texas do. The first European to visit the area might have been Luis de Moscoso, leading the survivors of Hernando De Soto's expedition. They were attempting to reach Mexico after De Soto's death on the Mississippi River in 1541 and may have crossed the Upper Trinity [Richardson 1963]. There is some indication that trading activities took place between the French, Spanish, Americans, and the Indian groups in the area. But other than this, scant notice was taken of the area, and little documentary material is available. Indian groups in the area around 1800 consisted of the Caddo, Kickapoo, Kichai, Shawnee, and Wichita. Several groups including the Wichitas had entered the region from other parts of the United States in the l700s [Newcomb 1961]. Around the l830s, skirmishes began to take place between the Indian groups in the region and Anglo settlers from other parts of the state. One of these incidents took place at the Indian village on Village Creek in present day Tarrant County. In 1838, the village, then occupied by members of the Caddo tribe, was attacked by Thomas J. Rusk leading a troop of volunteer rangers. The village was destroyed, but the same site was later reoccupied by a group of Cherokee Indians who had moved into the area from present day Cherokee County. After a period of quiet, the Indians began raiding, and a force led by General Tarrant attacked the village in 1841. At the time of the attack, the village was reported as being large, with about 225 lodges with extensive areas under cultivation [Strickland 1937]. Shortly after the raid on Village Creek, efforts were made to disband all the Indians in the Upper Trinity at which time they were forced to leave permanently. The area of the three forks, variously under the dominion of France or Spain became part of the Republic of Mexico in 1821. Americans were encouraged to settle in Texas because of both Stephen F. Austin's success at colonization, and the relaxing of immigration and land policies by the new Mexican government. The first American exploration of the Upper Trinity took place after the Republic of Texas was born, when the trader Dr. Henry Connelly went through the area on his way to present day Clarksville in 1839. Shortly thereafter, Bird's Fort was established and is commonly considered the first settlement in the area. Bird's Fort was established in 1840 by Colonel Jonathan Bird and a company of volunteer rangers. According to Webb [1952], the outpost consisted of a "blockhouse fort and several houses, three of which were within a stockade." While Colonel Bird and the rangers were relieved of their duties soon after the outpost 154

was completed, others moved in to replace them and the fort was not abandoned for about 10 years. other settlements were beginning to take place in what was to become Dallas County. Sometime around 1839, John Neely Bryan began exploring the region around the three forks. Bryan, gifted with a kind of insight, was the first to realize the potential of the location he had selected. He returned to Fort Smith, Arkansas and came back 2 years later prepared to stay [Greene 1973]. Bryan was helped in his endeavor by the Texas Land and Emigration Company, who initiated what was to become known as the Peters Colony. The young Republic of Texas was at that time eager to encourage immigration into its territories. The Texas government entered into a number of contracts with companies who were pledged to settle a certain number of families in specific areas. The companies would in turn receive compensation, often in the form of a percentage of land, for their troubles. Peters Company was one such organization and in four separate contracts, between 1841 and 1843, agreed to colonize a very large portion of north central Texas (including the entire project area) [Connor 1959]. The agreement specified that all heads of colony families would receive 640 acres and all single men would receive 320. Many problems arose between the company agents and the colonists, but the Peters Colony had an undeniably profound effect on the Upper Trinity. By 1850, when the Company had discharged its contractual obligations it had settled a total of 1388 families [Connor 1959]. Although John Neely Bryan had come to the area independently, he did receive land under the colony contract. And it was from this land that the city of Dallas was born. It is generally accepted that the county, when created in 1846, was named after the then vice-president of the United State George M. Dallas [Webb 1952]. Bryan was joined in his settlement by the Beemans and other families. Additional settlements began to grow up around Cedar springs, Farmers Branch, and Hord's Ridge (which would become oak Cliff), and in 1850 Dallas was elected the county seat. Tarrant County, named for General E. H. Tarrant who led the battle against the Cherokees at Village Creek, was created in 1849. Up to that time, very little settlement had taken place in the area. Birdville, named in honor of Captain Bird, was the largest settlement and was made county seat in 1850. Fort worth was established in 1849 as a military post. It was, however, abandoned by the military in 1853 because of the decrease in hostilities with the local Indians. A settlement had grown up around it, and by 1860 the county seat had been transferred 155

there. Denton County was also created around this same period. Named in honor of John B. Denton, the county was initially surveyed in 1849 [Webb 1952]. Pickneyville, southeast of present day Denton, was named the county seat. The county seat changed several times before Denton was decided upon in 1856. Lewisville, the closest town in the county to the project area, is located on the headright grants of John and Augustus King who came to the area in 1844. The settlement was first called Holfords Prairie. Sold in 1855 to Basdeal Lewis, the town was laid out and called Lewisville that same year. The 1850s were a time of great change throughout the entire Upper Trinity region. What had recently been wilderness was quickly becoming civilization. Transportation networks were improved, rough trails were being shaped into roads. Many of the ferrys listed as historic localities date to this period, including Keenan Crossing, California Crossing, Record and Cedar Springs crossings [Cochran 1928]. In 1854, Alexander Cockrell built the first bridge spanning the Trinity and connecting east and west Dallas. The Ft. Worth to Yuma stageline began operations in 1856, and by 1858 several more were in business. Trinity City (41DLI05) reportedly dates from the 1850s; however, no record of a plat for the town exists. Some have speculated that this was a city in name only and that it was created as a promotional gimmick by the Peters Colony representative to encourage settlement in the area [Bennett et al. 1981]. "In 1856, the city was reported as having six stores, one hotel, a wagon yard, two blacksmiths, several houses, and the Tellico Manufacturing Company which consisted of a cotton gin, wool works, lumber and grist mills" [Bennett et al. 1981:41]. It is indeed surprising, if all this did exist, to find no trace of it. Commercial enterprise improved. Mills and gins were installed up and down the Trinity at places such as Eagle Ford, Trinity Mills, Record Crossing, and Randol Mill. of all these, Randol Mill is the only one for which archaeological traces have been confirmed. Randol Mill was initially known as Leonard's Mill when it was erected in 1856. It soon became the center of a small community. Burned in 1860, the mill was rebuilt by 1862 and became the commercial center of Tarrant County during the Civil War [Dunnett 1979]. After changing hands several times, the mill came into the possession of R. A. "Bob" Randol in 1872. The mill was in operation from that time until the death of Bob Randol in 1922. The mill structure itself burned in 1933, and the community 156

disappeared [Dunnett 1979].' All that is visible today are the foundation walls (Figure 6.1) of the mill and some pieces of abandoned equipment (Figure 6.2). Another venture that was initiated during the l850s was the French socialist community of La Reunion, founded by victor Considerant and Francois Cantagrel. Considerant purchased land along the bluffs of the Trinity in the vicinity of present day Oak Cliff for the colony (Figure 6.3). Shortly afterward, colonists began to arrive; in all about 300 would come [Webb 1952]. Almost from the beginning, they started having problems. The soil was poor and unsuited for farming. Very few of the colonists were farmers and disputes erupted about labor allocations. Considerant, enthralled with the idea of making La Reunion the center of a large network of colonies, purchased property in other locations throughout the state. This put a financial strain on the mother colony that was already floundering [Hammond 1936]. By 1857, the colony was essentially defunct. Some of the colonists returned to Europe, some went to New Orleans, and some went to Dallas, where "the French people of La Reunion, urbane and cosmopolitan, were influential in neutralizing the rough edges of the rugged frontier town" [Urbanovsky 1972:22]. This might in part account for the great change in occupations as listed in the 1850 and 1860 Census records (Tables 6.1 and 6.2). The l850s also saw the first large-scale attempt to navigate the Trinity. Many thought the Trinity the most navigable stream in Texas. There had been some success with flatboats on the river, but in 1852 the "Dallas" became the first of a long line of ships to sink in the Trinity. The "Dallas," enroute to the coast, took 3 months to reach Porter's Bluff near present day Corsicana, where it was forced to turn around due to low water. It hit a snag and sank on the return trip [Greene 1973]. By studying population statistics, the steady growth of the project area becomes apparent (Table 6.3). Many of the incoming immigrants were from southern states, and it is not surprising that there was much support for the Confederacy during the Civil War. Dallas County became a supply center for southern armies, supplying flour and clothing to the Confederate cause. In general, however, there was much less impact from both the War and reconstruction than might have been expected. After the war, interest was once again revived in the Navigation issue. Part of the reason was that there was no competition for wagon freight rates [Bennett et al. 1981], still the chief means of transporting goods to market. Both the "Job 157

Boat #1" and the "Sallie Haynes," a wide sternwheeler, attempted the river in the late 1860s and achieved moderate success. The "Sallie Haynes" later sank somewhere just south of Dallas. The 1870s brought a new era of increased prosperity into the Upper Trinity region. A steady stream of settlers entered the area. Both Dallas and Ft. Worth began taking on something of the character they have today. Dallas was quickly becoming a mercantile center. Buffalo were being rapidly destroyed for their hides, and Dallas became the chief distributing center for this product [Bennett et al. 1981]. Cotton production was also on the increase, with Dallas acting as a marketing center. In Ft. Worth and Tarrant County, however, things were heading in a different direction. The Chisholm Trail, famous for its cattle drives since 1867, came through Ft. Worth heading north to Kansas slaughterhouses. Ft. Worth quickly became an outfitting point for the drovers. Merchants located there provided the cowboys with both supplies and entertainment. "At Ft. Worth, where hogs still roamed the streets, cowboys primed with firewater could shoot up the town on Saturday night without much fear of penalty" [Gard 1956]. This was a situation the townspeople soon found intolerable. They petitioned for and passed new laws prohibiting this kind of activity. These early laws were the start of civic groups and clubs that would eventually come to turn Ft. worth into one of the cultural centers of the region. Ft. Worth, however, would never lose it label of "Cowtown." One factor that was destined to have a tremendous impact on the region was the advent of the railroads. The state needed more people, and a source of better communication, transportation, and product conveyances. There was not enough private enterprise to finance the building of railroads, and the state could not afford to provide monetary aid. Texas had an abundance of land that was difficult to sell. Land grants to railroad companies, seemed to be the answer. In 1852, the legislature offered eight sections of land per mile of track laid [Branda 1976]. No great results came from this policy. A general law was enacted in 1854 to double the land grant and to lower the requirements. The law was changed many times until it ~as finally repealed in 1882 [Reed 1946]. Railroad lines in East Texas tripled between 1870 and 1880 (Figure 6.4). The Houston and Texas Central came through Dallas in 1872 [Acheson 1977] and by 1877 was part of a completed track from Galveston to Chicago. To ensure the east-west line of the Texas and Pacific, Dallas secured state legislation and also offered land and bonds. "The effect would jump the population from 1500 to more than 7000 in a matter of months" [Acheson 1977]. 164

Fort Worth grew in anticipation of the arrival of the Texas and Pacific but was to have an unexpectedly long wait. The Texas and Pacific had worked its way west from Dallas to Eagle Ford when the New York stock Exchange closed for 10 days in 1873. Railroad construction was halted. Eagle Ford became a thriving terminus town, but the ambitions of Fort Worth pressed for a different outcome. "A plan was devised and the town was plunged into the most dramatic concerted effort of its history" [Sanders 1973]. citizens literally built the last few miles of track as the state's land grant agreement with the railroad was about to be voided in 1876. Towns in the project area which developed between Dallas and Denton along the Dallas Wichita Railroad are Letot, Farmers Branch, Carrollton, Trinity Mills, and Lewisville. Hutchins lies on the Houston and Texas Central line south from Dallas. Towns between Dallas and Fort Worth along the Texas and Pacific line are Eagle Ford and Grand Prairie. The development of this area is graphically depicted on a series of archival maps annotated in Appendix C. During the 1880s, tenant farming became a common practice throughout the project area. The principle cash crop was still cotton, with corn and wheat being secondary crops. The tenant usually provided the landowner with one-third of the grain and one-fourth of the cotton grown during the season. The frequency of tenant farms can be graphically seen on the Sam Street maps for Dallas and Tarrant counties (Figures 6.5 and 6.6). This situation was amplified during the l890s by a depression. Many former landowners faced ruin and were themselves forced into tenancy. This situation also forced many into the cities, and Dallas soon became the largest one in Texas. Interest in navigation, which had taken a backseat after the arrival of the railroads, increased. The Steamboat "H.A. Harvey" arrived in Dallas in 1893. The ship shuttled freight and became an excursion boat. The populace soon became disenchanted, however, and the "Harvey" was sold in 1898 [Bennett et al. 1981]. The last all out effort for Trinity River navigation came after the turn of the century, when the Corps of Engineers began building the system of locks and dams on the river. One of these, Lock and Dam Number 1, is in the project area. Construction began on Lock and Dam Number 1 in 1905. The Lock and Dam became a popular gathering point for Dallas residents [Bennett et al. 1981]. According to photo records (Figure 6.7), a number of buildings were constructed at the site to accommodate the workers. A major flood, however, occured in 166

material dating from the late nineteenth century through the present. This area is located in the Las Colinas corporate center and was not examined by the survey crew because it is currently fenced off. 7. California Crossing. This crossing was given its name because of the many people who crossed the Trinity here on the way to California during the gold rush of 1849. It was not visited by the survey crew, but according to Greene [1985] is located where Lombardy Lane crosses the Trinity. 8. possible Ferry Location. This is the possible location of the Cedar Springs Crossing described by Cochran [1928]. The survey crew attempted to locate this site; but because of the massive amount of build-up in the area, the location on the project map must be considered tentative. 9. possible Ferry Location. This is the tentative location of Record's Crossing [Cochran 1928]. According to Greene [1985], Col. Record also owned a water mill that was located at the same ford. (Both 8 and 9 are no longer on the main channel of the river. ) 10. La Reunion. This location borders the project area on the south side of the West Fork. The crew conducted a "wind shield survey" through the area of this early settlement and noted numerous shot gun-type houses from a later period, but primarily light and heavy industries now dominate the area. See discussion in Historic Overview. 11. 41DL220. This is an area of packed clay with what appears to be a well dug into it. There were no artifacts associated with this location. This site was not visited by the survey crew. 12. Miller's Bridge. Sources indicated that there was originally a ferry crossing in this location, established by Wm. B. Miller [Cochran 1928; Greene 1985]. At some later date, a bridge was located here. The survey crew did not attempt to locate this site. 13. 41DL207. This site located on the first terrace above the Trinity river consists of a mixed scatter of prehistoric and historic material. The historic artifacts appear to date from the mid to late nineteenth century. There was no structure associated with this debris. The survey crew did not look for this site. 14. 41DL206. This site located on the edge of a gravel pit consisted of a very light scatter of late nineteenth century 173

artifacts. The site was originally located in 1981; when an attempt was made to relocate it sometime later, artifacts were no longer visible. The Trinity Project survey crew did not attempt to locate this site. 15. 41DL208. This site is a board and batten house that was converted into a barn, the foundation is made of logs. This structure was listed as being very deteriorated in 1981 when it was originally located. A light scatter of clear glass was associated with the building. No attempt was made to relocate this site. 16. 41DL223. This is the site of a double-pen house that has been moved from its original location. According to the survey form, the structure has been placed on concrete blocks. There were no artifacts associated with this structure. No attempt was made by the survey crew to visit this site. 17. Lock and Dam Number 1. This is the location of Lock and Dam Number 1 constructed in 1905. It was greatly damaged by the flood of 1908, and rebuilt in 1909. Archival photographs of the site were examined by the crew at the Hall of state. A number of structures in the immediate vicinity were apparent from the photographs (Figure 6.9). 18. 41DLI05. This is the assumed location of Trinity City. There is some speculation on the part of scholars that this is a city in name only, that never actually existed (see discussion of Trinity City in Historic Overview). The site, however, if it ever existed, was reported as being destroyed when revisited by a crew from SMU in 1978. 19. 41DL92. This site has both historic and prehistoric components. The historic component includes the structural remains of a government checking station for boats leaving Ennis and traveling upstream. If this information is correct, Lock and Dam Number 1, located to the north, is undoubtedly connected with 41DL92 in some respect. The prehistoric crew relocated this expansive site area; there appears to be some potential for further investigation since the large area is relatively undeveloped private property. 20. 41DL216. Both 41DL216 and 41DL217 are house structures. According to the owner, O. L. Alexander of Dallas, both houses are log structures that were built sometime around 1919. He also indicated that both of the houses were sheathed in stone about 1930. These houses were built by Mr. Bradley, who according to the informant was one of the first boat wrights in the county. The sites were photographed by the survey crew (Figure 6.10). Mr. Alexander, born in 1898, is a long-time resident of the area 174

and appears to have a great deal of information, he should be considered a potential candidate for an oral history interview. 21. 41DL217. See discussion of 41DL216. 22. 41DL218. This site is a mixed scatter of historic and prehistoric material. The historic material appears to date from the turn of the century. There were no structural remains associated with this scatter. The survey crew did not revisit this site. 23. 41DL219. This is a historic house site that was in fair condition when it was located in 1981. There was also an associated scatter of historic artifacts, dating to the turn of the century. This site was not visited by the survey crew. On West Fork of the Trinity River from west to east (Figure 6.8c): 24. 1900s Dump. The crew made a fortuitous discovery while searching for Randol Millon the Randol Mill Road between High Woods and Woodhaven roads. The site is in an area that appears to have been recently graded. This dump, about 100 meters in diameter, contains tremendous amounts of broken glass and pottery suggesting dates from around the 1920s. 25. Randol Mill. This is the remains of what was at one time a small but thriving community surrounding the mill. The mill was originally built in the 1850s. All that remains of the mill are the retaining wall, iron shaft, and the circular turbine wheel. A state historic marker is located at this site. Unfortunately, landfill operations have been taking place there for some time, and any remnants of the community surrounding the mill are likely destroyed. The debris from the land fill comes up to the base of the Historical Marker. The crew prepared an official state archaeological survey form at this site, and photographed the features (Figures 6.1, 6.2, and 6.11). 26. 41TR64. This site consists of a thin layer of artifacts surrounding a pecan tree, with no structural evidence present. At the time it was located in 1983, no further work there was recommended. The survey crew did not revisit this site. 27. Village creek Indian Village. This is the location of the Village Creek Indian village occupied by first the Caddo and then the Cherokee. (See discussion in Historic Overview.) It is believed that this area has been disturbed by gravel mining. The survey crew did not attempt to find this locality. 28. Bird's Fort. This is the location of what was probably the 177

first Euro-american settlement in this region of the state. It was established in 1840 and occupied for about 10 years. Although an historical marker exists, there may be some buried structural remains elsewhere in the vicinity. The survey crew did not visit this site. Children at the Treetop School (Euless) have generated interest in the historical significance of the locality and have petitioned the landowner (Armentrout) to have the site investigated. However, an on-site insepction of the Bird's Fort locality by the Corps in 1985 indicated that the site has probably been destroyed by gravel mining. 29. 41DL225. This is the site of a bridge possibly built during the 1930s. The bridge is made of concrete, covering iron reinforcing rods. The bridge was relocated one-half block north of Singleton Road bordering the project area in Dallas. The survey crew photographed the site and corrected the misplot. 30. 41DL224. This site is the remains of a bridge. The site consists of two cement piers on the north side of the river. There is some indication that this site was not correctly plotted on the topo sheets when originally located in 1983. This site and 41DL225 were apparently both incorrectly plotted on the topographical maps when originally located in 1983, and appear to be out of the project area as relocated by the survey crew. In addition to the above-enumerated sites and localities, there are a number of cemeteries in the project area. More information can be gleaned about these from Darnell [1982], Cushman [1981], Denton's Museum on the Square Cemetery Census Records, and the Sam Street's maps (Figures 6.5 and 6.6). Nine other previously known historic localities were examined; development has obliterated all remains of six of these structures identified from Sam Street's 1900 map of Dallas, and three historic properties in Ft. worth were determined to be out of the study area when located during the survey. Table 6:4 summarizes the temporal affiliations of the historic sites and localities mentioned in this section. Research Suggestions The preceding Historical Overview is perforce brief since it was intended to be a guide to further work and not an extensive history of the area. The bibliography provides some excellent sources that are more complete and scholarly. It is strongly recommended that these sources be studied for detailed information on specific areas when the need arises. It should be further stated that in terms of the historical localities only the more noteworthy ones were discussed. Future researchers are 180

directed to the Sam Street maps in the Historical Overview (Figures 6.5 and 6.6) to see the abundance of landowner and tenant houses in the project area. The nature of this project did not allow time for a complete study of each of these properties and so guidelines for further work are herein included. If it becomes necessary to investigate a particular piece of property, the first item to be reviewed should be the Sam Street maps for Dallas and Tarrant counties (unfortunately, a map comparable to these does not exist for Denton County). If potential sites are located on the Sam Street maps, they can be more easily placed on topographic sheets if they are first transferred to county plat or abstract maps (these can generally be obtained from the county planning division). Once the sites have been correctly plotted on USGS topographical quadrangles, they can be ground checked. If it becomes necessary, a deed search can be undertaken. Brief instructions on deed searches are included in Appendix D. 182

·SECTION VII CULTURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT by C. Reid Ferring Objectives The overall purpose of this project was to assist in the preparation of an environmental impact statement for the archaeological and historical resources within the project area. Towards this end, we have identified known sites and have provided information in several sections of this report that may be used in order to predict the potential for archaeological site occurrence in areas for which no sites are known at present. An additional charge in this task was to provide the rationale for assessing the significance of individual sites with respect to the status of regional investigations and with respect to contemporary methods and theories in archaeology. This section of the report will describe the known prehistoric and historic sites in terms of their estimated age and character. Included are recommendations for specific sites with regards to future work, given the potential for adverse impacts to the sites in the course of project implementations. Prehistoric Sites in the Project Area In the previous section of this report some 90 prehistoric sites were described as known in the project area. These exhibit a remarkable diversity of character, probable ages and cultural affiliation and degree of preservation (Table 5.2). A number of these sites are known to have been destroyed by landuse activities or natural causes and are therefore not amenable to future archaeological investigations. This only enhances the potential significance of the remaining sites for which further work may be entertained in the future. Overall, our appraisal of the character and condition of these archaeological sites has been remarkably conditioned by the near absence of systematic archaeological investigations at these sites. Only one site has been "excavated," and that study was of quite limited character. A small number of sites have received minimal test excavations, the results of which are only scantily evident in publications. The condition of many of the archaeological sites may be partly inferred by the methods and conditions under which the sites were discovered (Table 5.2). A large number of sites were found in the 1940s and 1950s by avocational archaeologists in situations that describe relatively minimal disturbance to these 183

## Page 182

sites. These include what appear to be quite natural contexts with no evidence of landuse activities or minimal impacts as a result of agricultural activities. A significant number of sites however have been found as a result of sand and gravel quarrying operations or other excavation activities resulting in deep disturbance to the geologic deposits containing the sites. Our investigations at a number of these localities have made it quite clear that while the deep subsurface disturbances, which revealed the archaeological site, have certainly removed portions of that site, the remaining intact areas of archaeological occurrence are in many cases amenable to controlled investigation. We wish to emphasize that even though a very small portion of an archaeological site may be preserved at the edge of a sand or gravel pit, this small but nonetheless intact portion of the archaeological site in many cases appears to be of greatly enhanced potential significance. At stratified sites or very well preserved single component sites, even a small excavation block or series of controlled test pit units can provide invaluable information on the content and character of the archaeological site. Therefore, the fact that what appears to have been a near complete "destruction" of a site by past landuse activities cannot be taken as evidence that no further work at a site would be productive and that the information recovered could not make significant contributions to regional archaeological investigations. An essential criterion, which must be sought in evaluating sites that have been partially impacted by landuse activities, is whether or not the context of the site may be established. A vertical section in the wall of a sand pit exposing stratigraphy and preserving an intact portion of the archaeological site offers the opportunity to place the site into a stratigraphic, paleoenvironmental, and chronologie framework. Even a small excavation block in some situations can result in the recovery of adequate samples of artifacts and faunas, permitting the assessment of on site activities and subsistence practices. Therefore, careful attention must be given to such small, but nonetheless intact, portions of sites in the project area. The presence of a sand or gravel pit therefore cannot be taken as evidence that all archaeological potentials in that area are lost. Quite the contrary, these may signify some of the more potentially significant archaeological localities in the project area. This perspective is implicit in the recommendations made on a site by site basis (Table 5.2). 184

Site Prediction The prediction of archaeological sites within the project area is a necessary component of the cultural resources management strategy proposed herein. In the future, cultural resources managers will be required to make decisions concerning necessary actions in areas of permit applications. In many cases, no known archaeological sites will be recorded in these areas, and decisions will have to be made concerning whether or not archaeological surveys for sites are necessary. As described later, this decision making process will involve consideration not only of the potential for archaeological site occurrence, but also for the potential for archaeological site preservation and detectability. Towards this end, the considerations surrounding the prediction of prehistoric and historic sites are considered here. Prehistoric Site Prediction The management of cultural resources within the Trinity Basin will require prediction of hitherto undiscovered archaeological sites. This task is a multifaceted one and perhaps one of the most difficult within cultural resources management. For our purposes, a multidimensional approach is proposed in order to assist in site prediction. This approach is guided by the recognition of three basic processes involved in the genesis of an archaeological record. These include site formation, site preservation, and site detectability. These three processes are in turn controlled by three sets of factors: natural, cultural, and landuse factors. A matrix of these processes and factors (Table 7.1) helps illustrate the relationships among these dimensions. Before discussing this approach, it should be stated that our site prediction methods are not overly quantitative. This represents a hopefully realistic appraisal of the complexities involved in predicting sites that have not been discovered. It may be tempting and perhaps self-fulfilling to apply overly quantitative methods to archaeological data. Yet the interactions of geologic factors in the construction and modification of sites and the importance of both natural factors and present landuse variables in terms of differential site preservation/detectability are such that quantification of site prediction is perhaps attractive but in our opinion not necessarily realistic. The approach that we embrace, therefore, represents our opinion concerning how the potential for the presence and condition of an archaeological site may be best evaluated using available information concerning regional patterns of archaeological site occurrence, the geologic 185

variables involved in site formation and site preservation, and the different factors involved in our ability to detect an archaeological site, if indeed it were present. For this project, our method is oriented towards the evaluation of a specific piece of land, in this case, a piece of land for which permit application has been made. By consulting the available information concerning known sites and then by consulting the available information concerning the geologic history of the permit area, and the present and past landuse of the permit area, a reasonable decision may be made at that point concerning the potential for an archaeological site being preserved there and the potential for the archaeological site being detectable by surface or subsurface methods. Implicit in this approach is encouragement for decision-making in this process of predicting archaeological sites. To have generated a map showing differential probabilities for archaeological site occurrences would, in our opinion, have resulted in a high potential for misguided efforts as cultural resources managers make determinations concerning the necessity of archaeological investigations in a permit area. On a case-by-case basis, we feel that the general approach and the specific methodology outlined in this report will prove to be the most economical and the most accurate means to plan and implement archaeological investigations in permit areas. site Formation The first and most obvious event that must take place for an archaeological site to be created is the concentration of past human activities in a specific location. These activities must result in the deposition of artifacts and/or features that may later be detectable by archaeologists. The issue of site formations processes has become increasingly evident in the archaeological literature [Butzer 1982; Schiffer 1978, 1983; Wood and Johnson 1978]. Much of this literature focuses on the geologic environments in which archaeological sites form and the ways in which specific sedimentary environments are related to the character and preservation potential of archaeological sites [Stein and Farrand 1985]. other efforts in site formation studies focus on the impacts of humans themselves during site formation [Schiffer 1978, 1983]. These studies have identified cultural processes that in effect modify archaeological sites as they are being constructed. These include trampling and reuse of artifacts, cleaning up of site refuse with redeposition of artifacts and debris in certain portions of sites and the introduction of sediment into archaeological sites by its inhabitants. Additional perspectives are provided by considering the natural agents of site disturbance and modification [Wood and 187

Johnson 1978; stein 1983J. Together these investigations identify the importance of recognizing archaeological materials in primary context within a site as opposed to those that have suffered differential modification within and between archaeological sites [Ferring in prepJ. From a cultural resources management point of view, the factor that is initially important is whether or not a site was indeed formed at sometime in the past in a particular location. However, in terms of ascertaining the significance of an archaeological site, concerns quickly shift to the character and relative detail of behavioral records contained within an archaeological site. In this sense, site formation processes are clearly germane to cultural resource management. Archaeological site formation has been divided into two separate domains: site construction and site modification [Ferring in prep]. Site construction involves the primary events that shaped the deposition of artifacts and features in a natural sedimentary matrix. While in certain cases human alteration of the landscape is the dominant geological factor during site construction (for example, within a Pueblo occupation), most prehistoric sites form in settings in which the addition of noncultural matrix to the site is accomplished by natural depositional factors. These commonly include alluviation from streams, deposition of sediments by slopewash (colluvium,) or eolian deposition. The importance of the noncultural site matrix may be appreciated by considering stratigraphic principles in relation to archaeological formation. Given a series of repeated occupations of the same locality, the density and modification potentials of the serially deposited artifacts and features would be conditioned almost entirely by the rate at which the naturally deposited site matrix accumulated (Figure 7.1). The more rapid the sedimentation rate, the more quickly artifacts and features are buried. With rapid sedimentation, therefore, the same sequence of occupations will result in sites with lower artifacts densities, better preservation of artifacts, better preservation of spatial patterning, and more stratigraphic superpositioning of the serial occupation debris. Rapid burial enhances the removal of artifacts and features from the zone of intense weathering, which in most environments is at the surface or shallow subsurface. Therefore, sites which formed in environments with rapid sedimentation rates not only exhibit more important archaeological records related to their con$tructional histories, but they also suffer less modifications effects from weathering, bioturbation, and erosion. 188

Hypothetical sequence of occupations is contrasted between depositional environments with rapid and slow rates of sedimentation. Note differential stratification and differential preservation. With slow sedimentation, serial occupation clusters and features are juxtaposed on same surface and are prone to be interpreted as 'activity areas' within single occupation unit. With same occupation events and rapid sedimentation, these records are stratigraphically superimposed; this record is clearer, albeit with lower artifact densities. (from Ferring in prep)

To the degree that it is possible to geologically identify areas that have relatively rapid sedimentation rates as opposed to areas that were characterized by paleosurface stability, the archaeologist's ability to predict the characteristics of archaeological sites is enhanced [Ferring in prep]. For example, the sedimentary record of relatively rapid accumulation of alluvium in a levee or crevasse splay environment [Allen 1965] may be significantly different than for sites that formed contemporaneously in different parts of the same river basin that were characterized by slow alluviation rates (for example, floodbasin settings). In this regard, it is important to note that fluvial sedimentary environments are characterized by both spatial and temporal variations in sedimentary environments [Bridge and Leeder 1978; Allen 1965]. Within a fluvial basin therefore, the different sedimentary environments that are significant with respect to archaeolgoical site formation are expected to show spatial distributions and temporal variations such that any given location within that basin must be evaluated independently with respect to its potential site formation histories. From a cultural resources management point of view, the entire issue of site formation is related to the presence and character of specific archaeological sites. Only with reference to differential site modification and differential site construction histories, resulting in qualitatively different archaeological information, can the difficult task of ascertaining site significance be accomplished. In other words, an explicit geoarchaeological approach to the study of site formation processes is complementary to the goals of determining site significance and therefore to the goals of cultural resources management. The above discussion indicates the rationale for identifying natural factors and cultural factors in site formation (Table 7.1). The natural factors include the specific sedimentary environment, the sedimentation rate, as well as modification factors including bioturbation and weathering. On a project-wide scale, long-term change in these factors should be carefully considered. For instance, during particular climatic regimes, weathering rates may be enhanced regardless of sedimentation rate. Also quite distinct changes in fluvial sedimentary environments may characterize a region. For example, a shift from braided to meandering streams is documented for the Mississippi and Ouachita Rivers at the close of the Pleistocene [Fisk 1944; Saucier 1974]. Such changes in broad sedimentary regimes have clear implications for archaeological site construction and modification [Butzer 1977, 1982]. 190

cultural factors in site formation must also be considered in such an approach. The occupational intensity (the period of time during which a site was continuously occupied by a group), as well as the periodicity of site use (the interval of time between occupation episodes), and of course the total number of occupation episodes at a site, all will impact the archaeological record. Their occupation parameters condition the resultant density of artifacts and features, the potential for subsequent occupations to disturb the remains of prior occupations, and so on. By explicitly recognizing natural factors and cultural factors in site formation with respect to the construction and modification of archaeological sites, a better appraisal of variability within sites and between sites may be acquired. A better understanding of archaeological variability within a project area is certainly complimentary to the process of establishing site significance; for the latter is certainly a relative dimension of the archaeological record. site Preservation site preservation is in some ways related to site modification. For the present purposes, however, site preservation is taken as modification ranging from minimal disturbance/weathering to the virtual destruction of archaeological sites. Both natural factors and modern landuse factors are involved in site preservation (Table 7.1). The natural factors include such processes as meandering of streams with total removal of the archaeological matrix or slope erosion which may redeposit artifacts into entirely secondary spatial and geologic contexts. Landuse factors are well recognized as potential agents of site preservation. Some that are especially germane to the Trinity Basin study include sand and gravel quarrying, road construction, river channel modification, or excavations for building foundations. Incidentally, it should be pointed out that certain landuse activities may actually enhance site preservation. For example, filling activities that raise the floodplain 8 to 10 feet may actually provide a deeper burial position for an archaeological site that was shallowly buried prior to the landuse activity. Several cases where this may have happened are identified in the description of known sites in the project area. 191

site Detectability It is evident that the third and last component in an archaeological investigation involves the detectability of an archaeological site. Site formation and site preservation may result in well preserved important archaeological sites. These must be detectable for them to become part of the archaeological record. In the process of defining potential site detectability, it is necessary to consider natural, cultural, and landuse factors. Natural factors include the burial depth or the availability of cutbank exposures, or the nature of vegetation in an area of concern. cultural factors link detectability to site formation processes. It is clear that sites with higher artifact densities are more likely to be found in alluvial environments. Therefore, the nature of occupations and the nature of post-occupational modification of sites are related to their detectability in the archaeological record. Lastly, landuse factors play an important role in site detectability. As for natural factors, landuse may in fact provide the means by which archaeological sites are found. Many sites in the Trinity Basin have been found only after they were partially destroyed by natural factors such as cutbank erosion or landuse factors including sand and gravel quarrying, road construction, or agricultural activities. The basic fact that sites must be partially destroyed before they may be discovered is evident when site detectability is considered. Therefore, certain landuse activities and certain potentially destructive natural factors are in other cases the very mechanisms which bring an archaeological site to our attention. Overall, consideration of site formation, preservation, and detectability and allusion to the natural, cultural, and landuse factors that control these processes can assist in the identification of archaeolgical site potentials in a specified permit area. These perspectives are used later in terms of a recommended program for evaluating the potential for archaeological site presence. This in effect is a "site prediction model." It is not overly quantified nor does it rank all of the land in the project area in terms of relative site potentials. Rather, it identifies and simplifies the factors that must be considered on a case-by-case basis to assess the need for archaeological investigations in a permit area. Historic Site Prediction The factors surrounding historic site prediction are radically different than those pertinent to prediction of prehistoric sites. The obvious differences between these periods 192

## Page 191

in terms of economic systems, land ownership, communications, and transportation networks, as well as age of sites, signify that site presence, site character, and site detectability should be treated in wholly different ways for historic period sites. Results of research at Joe Pool and Ray Roberts reservoirs suggest certain patterns of site presence and methods of site detection that can assist in evaluating (i.e., predicting) potential sites within a defined permit request area. As for prehistoric sites, there is a general relationship between site age and site preservation potentials. Older sites at Joe Pool and Ray Roberts were difficult to find even when tract histories or other archival data indicated their presence. In particular, Antebellum sites are rare in this area, despite the knowledge that settlements became increasingly common after the Peters Colony was established. Both site characteristics (common log structures with poor preservation potential) as well as site histories (i.e., adaptive reuse of sites settled early in the Antebellum period over subsequent periods) are involved in this pattern. It is clear that older historic sites will be more difficult to locate, yet they exhibit higher potential significance than the more common sites of later periods. For younger sites, dating to the post-Civil War through early twentieth century, Sam Street's maps are invaluable aids in Dallas and Tarrant Counties. At Joe Pool, the Dallas map proved to be extremely reliable, even in locating sites that had not been detected by initial ground survey. These maps clearly indicate a large number of primary residences, tenant houses as well as commercial- and transportation- related localities within the project area. Tract searching for areas on Street's maps showing sites can assist in determining the potential age and character of sites. In particular, tract records for Tarrant County carry detailed descriptions of the number and kind of structures present on a given tract, and when additions of structures were made. Ground checking should follow these inquiries when site potential is demonstrated. Landuse and Potential Impacts Site prediction and the distribution of known archaeological sites, which have not been visited as a part of this project, require that landuse activities be considered in terms of potential impacts to known and predicted archaeological sites. In Appendix A, landuse activities in the project area are described following the results of air photo analysis and ground truthing. The character of these impacts is diverse. They range from activities that would almost inevitably result in total site 193

destruction, such as deep lake excavation or deep foundation excavations. They also include activities that may cause surficial damage to sites, including paving or landscaping activities associated with development. Another type of landuse entails fill activities, such as levee construction or the raising of the floodplain, as seen in many parts of the project area. These latter activities may do no physical damage to archaeological sites, rather they would result in a change in sites accessibility. This must be considered an impact on the archaeological resources, insomuch as the deep burial of sites by land fill activities effectively will remove them from the area of possible archaeological investigation. On a case-by-case basis, the engineers' plans for project implementation will have to be evaluated with respect to potential impacts to the archaeological sites that are known or are predicted in the project area. All available evidence suggests that the project area will be the location of increasingly intensive development in the coming years. A major challenge to cultural resources managers will be to find the balance point between the impacts of an individual development in a context of cumulative impacts to archaeological resources in the project area. Assessment of Necessary Action in Permit Areas The following steps are recommended in order to make initial determinations with respect to archaeological actions in a specified permit area. This general methodology incorporates information from the documentations of known sites, the assessment of archaeological potentials for site presence, and the landuse analyses conducted as part of this project. The steps recommended in terms of initial decision making upon receipt of a permit application and definition of the nature of landuse activities in the permit area are as follows: 1. Define permit area on project base maps 2. Define the nature and extent of landuse activities in the permit area with respect to subsurface disturbance, depth of disturbance, fill activities 3. Consult list of known archaeological sites and make determinations following recommendations provided herein. 4. Consult geologic map of project area and define the geomorphic units present in the permit area. Consult geologic synthesis in terms of site potential . 194

SECTION VIII SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS The Trinity Basin Project has resulted in a comprehensive review of known archaeological sites within the study area. This has been accomplished as a result of literature reviews, informant interviews, searching of site files at state and local institutions, and field inspection. In addition, the geologic context for these sites have been appraised by a reconnaissance study of the Late Quaternary deposits of the Upper Trinity Basin. Together these provide a framework for interpreting the potential significance of these archaeological resources, as well as those resources that are at present undocumented but are predicted to occur in the study area. While many of the archaeological sites described in this report have already been so severely impacted by landuse activities or in fact have been completely destroyed by those activities, a great number of sites both known and predicted occur in the study area. The significance of these sites must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, yet collectively, they comprise an extremely important aspect of the archaeological record of the North Texas area. It has only been in recent times that major archaeological efforts in this region have been made part of large-scale federal landuse activities. As a result, the archaeological record from this region is comprised mainly from limited investigations at a dispersed array of archaeological sites. A review of the past work in this region similarly indicates that from a point of view of culture history, and past environments, our framework for interpreting these sites is feeble. Therefore, the archaeological data and the contextual data contained at sites in the project area must be regarded as potentially significant for regional investigations. Recommendations Site-specific recommendations are contained in a previous section of this report. These identify sites for which no further work is deemed necessary owing to site destruction, and recommendations concerning necessary site visits in cases where no recent information for sites is available. On the basis of the present investigation, other sites have been recommended for testing. These test excavations are deemed necessary for evaluation of the sites with respect to state and national designations as landmarks or National Register sites, respectively. A small number of sites have been identified as 196

## Page 194

those which should be avoided or intensively investigated. Implicit in this category of recommended sites is the conclusion that adequate information is present to warrant nomination for state archaeological landmark and/or National Register of Historic Places designation. A general recommendation is inherent in this report with respect to the continued search for archaeological sites within the project area. Site prediction for the floodplain and lower terrace settings in the project area must be done on a location-specific basis, yet all available information presented in this report suggests that the general probabilities for additional sites within the project area are extremely high. Site detection at the same time is expected in many cases to be very difficult owing to recent patterns of alluviation. Careful consideration of .possible subsurface site detection techniques must be given to permit areas. These efforts may be facilitated by a more comprehensive geologic investigation, particularly of the Trinity floodplain. An additional area for which further work is recommended concerns the geologic and paleoenvironmental context for the archaeological sites in the Trinity Basin. With a more sound stratigraphic and chronologie framework for the Late Quaternary and Holocene deposits along the Trinity, a much better appraisal of site preservation potentials may be gained. This framework will assist both archaeological research goals and cultural resources management activities. The geologic and paleoenvironmental data contained within the project area are viewed here as a resource in themselves. without such a contextual framework, interpretation of archaeological variability and change within the project area will by definition be deficient. At some point, therefore, geologic and paleoenvironmental data within the project must be considered as resources to which adverse impacts must be addressed and if necessary, mitigated. It is recommended, therefore, that when major portions of the project area are to be impacted by construction activities that geologic and paleoenvironment data contained in the area be considered as resources and that impacts to these data be considered with respect to strategies of avoidance or mitigation. 197
