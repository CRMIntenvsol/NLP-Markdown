1.1.1 City of McKinney The City of McKinney was name after an influential land surveyor, merchant, and politician who was an early pioneer of Northeastern and North-Central Texas. On 16 March 1849, the McKinney townsite was established, and subsequently designated as the county seat of Collin County. During the late 1800s McKinney was the primary source for ginning, pressing, and transporting agricultural goods, as well as, entertainment, news, and religion within the county. In 1872, the Houston and Texas Central Railroad was the first railroad to reach the town, connecting McKinney to Greenville, Texas (Hall and Hall 2013, Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958). By the early 1900s, multiple rail lines linked McKinney to Denison, Houston, and Missouri Kansas. As more people continued to move into Collin County and McKinney, the economies within the region strengthened. In the mid-1900s, as transportation became more efficient, farmers were able to transport their product from the fields to markets quicker and with less trouble than ever before. As transportation routes continued to improve, the late 1990s witnessed McKinney become a population destination for commuter residents, working in the more congested towns closer to Dallas. Within the last ten years, McKinney has undergone a population explosion, nearly tripling in size from around 50,000 to approximately 140,000 residents. Hall, Capt.
