Texas Clovis Fluted Point Survey, 4th Update: Additional Results Processed After Submission of Main Draft Alan M. Slade Abstract th After the deadline for submission of the 4 edition of the Texas Clovis Fluted Point Survey (TCFPS), there were still nearly 200 Clovis records that still required recording. The primary author of the 2023 survey felt it was more appropriate to include the additional count in this publication, th rather than author a separate, essentially, a 5 edition, in the 2024 journal. The Clovis point count has now reached 1002, with a further 10 previously unaccounted for counties. With the most recent results being processed, there were a few more anomalies that are corrected in this article. To the best of my knowledge this is the most accurate regional representation of Clovis fluted points in Texas to date. Introduction in the Panhandle / Plains region by W. E. ‘Uncle Bill’ Baker in the 1930s, and another in the East region by When the deadline for the submission of the an avocational archeologist, George H. Russell. And th 4 edition of the Texas Clovis Fluted Point Survey there were over 50 points from two private collectors, arrived (Slade and Meltzer, this volume), there were Winston Elliston from Boerne, Texas, and more from 198 Clovis point records that needed processing, Dana Harper in Houston, Texas, both providing new bringing the grand total to 1002 Clovis points from data from several regions. With these new records Texas (Table 1). As expected, the greater majority the grand total of Clovis fluted points in Texas, is of these points came from private collections (e.g., 1003. That is an impressive increase since the first Slade n.d.a.). Through the encouragement and advice survey back in 1986 when David J. Meltzer initiated of well-respected professional archeologists such as the original survey (Meltzer 1986), which yielded Prof. Thomas R. Hester, and Dr. Timothy K. Perttula, 204 records, and almost double the number from the contact was made with avocational archeologists and last survey in 2007 that had a total of 539 (Bever and private collectors who were willing to share their Meltzer 2007; Slade and Meltzer, this volume). collections with the survey.
