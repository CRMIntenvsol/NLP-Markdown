ABSTRACT Archaeological investigations were conducted at 15 prehistoric sites located within the Richland/Chambers Reservoir. This work was performed by the Archaeology Research Program, Southern Methodist University over the course of four field seasons between June 1982 and December 1984. The reservoir is located in Navarro and Freestone Counties, Texas, about 100 km southeast of Dallas. It is being constructed by the Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement District Number One, and will inundate 44,750 acres along Richland and Chambers Creeks. Part One of this volume presents the archaeological investigations at 13 of the prehistoric sites. Major excavations at two additional sites (Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch) are the subject of Volume II in the Richland Creek Technical Series. The investigations reported here record the remains of prehistoric occupations dating from the Late Paleo-Indian period (ca. 8000 B.C. - 6000 B.C.) through the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 700 - 1650), although evidence dating earlier than the Middle Archaic period (3000 B.C. - 1000 B.C.) is very limited. Artifact assemblages, habitation features, intrasite patterning, and subsistence remains document the activities of hunter-gatherer groups that occupied the reservoir area at various times during the past 5,000 years. In Part Two, the results of the prehistoric site investigations are utilized to present a series of topical and synthetic statements concerning the prehistory of the Richland/ Chambers Reservoir area. Artifact assemblage data derived from stratified contexts and intersite comparisons, dated by a series of 48 radiocarbon determinations, allow the construction of a more detailed cultural chronology for the Middle Trinity River Basin. An analysis of lithic raw material utilization provides evidence of changes through time in hunter-gatherer group mobility and the size of exploitive territories. A technological analysis of lithic assemblages, integrated with the results of a lithic tool replication experiment, represents a continuing effort to define assemblage-specific lithic reduction strategies for the purpose of investigating intersite functional variability. Finally, the results of archaeological and paleoenvironmental investigations are used to develop a diachronic model of hunter- gatherer adaptations to the changing physical and cultural environments of the Richland/ Chambers Reservoir area.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The successful completion of any complex project is dependent upon the dedication and assistance of many persons. In this respect, the Richland Creek Archaeological Project (RCAP) is no different. In fact, the highly interdisciplinary and multi-seasonal nature of the Project has involved a myriad of field personnel, analyists, writers, consultants, and support staff. We owe a large debt of gratitude to all these individuals, and in this section we recognize their contributions. First, and foremost, we thank Mr. Woody Frossard of the Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement District Number One (hereafter referred to as the Water District), Mr. Frossard was the representative from the Water District who was assigned ‘the responsibility of selecting an archaeological contractor and insuring that the work was completed in a manner consistent with the Water District's needs for completion of the Richland/ Chambers Dam and Reservoir. Mr. Frossard performed these duties admirably, providing direction, encouragement, and constructive criticism in all phases of the archaeological work. Without Mr. Frossard's support, the Richland Creek Archaeolog- ical Project would not have achieved the success it has. Second, special thanks go to the members of the Memorandum of Agreement Committee, a project review council established by an agreement between the Water District, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USCE), the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the National Park Service (NPS). The members of this committee, aside from Mr. Frossard, consisted of one person from each of the agencies involved: Ms. Daphne Derven (USCE), Dr. LaVerne Herrington (THC), and Dr. Stephanie Rodeffer (NPS), who was later followed by Dr. Ann Johnson. The MOA Committee members provided valuable comments and support while attending field meetings during some of the coldest and hottest temperature extremes experienced in this part of the State. The ultimate success of this Project is due in large measure to their collective effort. We also wish to thank Mr. Robert Burton, archaeologist with the USCE, for his assistance in developing the Memorandum of Agreement that made the mitigation phase of the RCAP a reality. Mr. Burton was particularly instrumental in negotiating the mag- nitude of mitigation activities within the reservoir. vit A great deal of appreciation goes to the field and laboratory crews who worked during the four seasons of the RCAP. Despite the physical discomfort imposed by summer's heat and winter's chill, the field crews worked steadily and often put in long hours to make sure the job was completed properly. Likewise, laboratory workers put in long, tedious hours washing, identifying, and cataloging artifacts from both prehistoric and historic sites. Crew chiefs of prehistoric crews included: Jeffery Bohlin, Marilee Irvine, Thomas Guderjan, Daniel McGregor, Allan McIntyre, Donald Manchester, and William Martin. In addition Debra Desarmeaux and Esther Read served as assistant crew chiefs. Crew chiefs of historic crews included: David Jumey, Susan Lebo, Debbie Marcaurelle, and Abigayle Robbins. During Season I, Marilee Irvine served as lab director. Susan Lebo directed the lab during Season II through IV, with the assistance of Debbie Marcaurelle dur:ng Season II, Dana Curtin during Seasons III and IV, and Melissa Green during Season IV. Many thanks are extended to these supervisory personnel who put in many hours of their own time to complete maps, forms, and computer processing so that the project could run smoothly. Likewise, thanks are due the following people who served as crew members in the field and/or lab: Gail Anderson, Dupleix Awah, David Babson, Bryan Bogle, Bridget Bosshart, Loma Brann, Eric Brill, Stephen Butler, Deborah Campbell, Deborah Casselberry, Pamella Carmichael Diane Carpenter, Shirley Crittenden, Scott Detwiler, Dianna Doucette, Patricia Easley, Nancy Engle, John Fueger, George Raymond Frye, Jr., Dana Geldon, Sue Guderjan, John Hart, Daniel Haines, Paulara Hawkins, Elizabeth Holstein, Julie Humphries, Steven Hunt, George Isbell, Kim Jones, Arlan Kalina, Syivia Kooren, Keith Landreth, Sue Linder-Linsley, Gene Longcrier, Jr., Craig Lukezic, Kevin McConnell, Steven McCrum, Gary McDariel, Peggy McKean, Mary Jane .

viii James Tomassini, Lisa Van Eysden, Mary Walsh, Debbie Wallsmith, Janna Wetherington, Frank Winchell, and Richard Young. The Richland Creek Archaeological Project could not have been successful were it not for the development of a coherent research design. The original research design was developed by Dr. L. Mark Raab (prehistoric portion) and Randall Moir (historic portion), with the assistance of James Bruseth, David Jurney, Daniel McGregor, and Joe Saunders. In addition, several professionals provided theoretical and methodological advice and constructive criticism on various phases of the RCAP. Specifically, we wish to thank Mr. Larry Banks, Dr. Michael Collins, Dr. Glenna Williams-Dean, Ms. Nancy Kenmotsu, Mr. Robert Mallouf, Ms. Patience Patterson, Dr. Dee Ann Story, and Dr. Fred Wendorf. The friendliness and interest expressed in our work by the residents of Navarro and Freestone Counties is greatly appreciated. Several local people made significant contributions to the outcome of the RCAP. Mr. Bill Young, who is an avid participant in Texas’ Stewardship Program for archaeological resources, led us to what turned out to be the most significant prehistoric sites in the reservoir area. In.addition, he and his wife Bobbie Jean, allowed us to study their collections from these sites. The Youngs’ extensive knowledge of North Central Texas archaeology aided us on numerous occasions. Mr. Ed Quals, a resident within the Project area, provided useful historical information about several historic sites, as did Mr. W. D. and Ms. Mozelle Burleson Pillans, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Gregory, Mr. and Mrs. Norton Cloud, Ms. Wyvonne Putnam, Ms. Verna Ann Bonner, Mr. Isaiah Kelly, Mr. Clint and Mrs. Mary Frances Robinson, Ms. Lizzie Bolden Jackson, Ms. Lillian Florine Bennett, Mr. James F. Bell and the J. A. Breithaupt Family. The memories and stories shared by these and numerous other people provided information useful for our interpretations. The Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement District Number One provided heavy equipment for use at creek bank sites and permitted us to use their facilities for the operation of our flotation devices. Special thanks are extended to Mr. Mike Williams of the TCWCID#1 for flying over several of the sites and taking photographs. Thanks are extended to those people who donated their time, equipment, and expertise to help in our study of the Project area. _ Edward F. Janak Jr., soil scientist with the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service, mapped soils at the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch sites and answered our questions about soils at several other prehistoric sites. Without his assistance, many of our conclusions about site stratigraphy and the deposition of feature fill might have missed the mark. Dr. Gil King, of the University of Texas at Dallas Health Sciences Center, provided the use of energy dispersive x-ray equipment to allow us to conduct trace element studies on human skeletal material. Other specialists also made important contributions to the research effort. Dr. David Pheasant conducted geomorphological analysis of the terraces and floodplain. Dr. Richard G. Holloway and Mr. Michael Pendleton conducted palynological analysis of samples recovered from bogs surrounding the Project area. Dr. Holloway also assisted us in separating fact from fiction concerning previous pollen analysis. Ms. Gayle Fritz conducted analysis of carbonized plant remains with advice from Dr. Richard Yarnell of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and in consultation with Dr. William Mahler and Mr. Barney Lipscomb of the Southern Methodist University Herbarium. Dr. Gary Rutenberg conducted the human osteological analysis; Dr. Phillip Murry conducted the vertebrate faunal analysis, and Dr. Richard Volume HI Fullington conducted the molluscan analysis. Mr. Robert Huggins of Spectrum Geophysics Inc. conducted the magnetic and eletromagnetic conductivity surveys. Mr. David Stahle provided valuable advice on dendrochronolgy and checked the chronologies developed by David Jurney. Dr. Harold Hietala offered advice on statistical analysis. Ms. Greer provided information on the Texas Stoneware Industries and Mr. Bill Westbury provided valuable assistance in the classification of historic artifacts. Duane Peter designed and supervised the technological analysis of prehistoric lithic artifacts. Mr. Peter also designed the lithic replication experiment and analyzed the resulting materials. Mr. J. B. Sollberger provided the necessary flintknapping skills and many hours of his time to produce the artifacts used in this replication study. Those who assisted in the report preparation worked just as hard as did those who collected and analyzed the data. Without their dedication and relentless efforts, these volumes could never have been completed. We wish to thank Sue Linder-Linsley for completing the bulk of the typing. Assisting her in this task were Melissa Green and Debra Mallouf. We also wish to thank Shelia Jones and Marilyn Westbury for typing some of the very early drafts. We are grateful to Eric Brill, Susan Burton, Pamella Carmichael, Maynard Cliff, David Jurney, William Martin, and Karim Sadr for completing the drafting. Although some copy editing for the prehistoric volumes was conducted by Maynard Cliff and William Martin, the majority of copy editing was conducted on a voluntary basis by Toni Turner. We thank her for her untiring devotion to the production of a quality report by reading and correcting the myriad drafts of the manuscripts. The quality of the reports has been measurably enhanced by her efforts. Thanks are also extended to Laurel Sloat who assisted in editing the manuscripts. Editing of the historic volumes was aided by Maynard Cliff, David Jurney, and Susan Lebo. We are grateful to professionals who reviewed the drafts of these manuscripts and provided constructive criticism used to refine the text. Dr. Ann Johnson, Dr. LaVerne Herrington, Dr. Mark Lynott, Dr. Stephanie Rodeffer, Ms. Anne Fox, Ms. Daphne Dervin, and Mr. Elton Prewitt all offered suggestions which improved the quality of the reports. Lastly, we could not have completed this Project on time and within budget without the assistance of several individuals at Southern Methodist University. We are indebted to Ms. Mildred Haenel, Director of Research Administration, for her untiring support of the Project. She assisted in much of the contract negotiations and provided administrative guidance during all phases of the Project. Dr. James Brooks, President of the Institute for the Study of Earth and Man, offered guidance and direction for the overall progress of the Project. Dr. Brooks also helped secure additional funds for publication of the Richland Creek reports in an effort to insure that the Project's high quality research was matched by equally high quality finished reports. Lanelle Thompson and Jo Featherston provided incalculable assistance in terms of keeping the Project's computerized accounting system from becoming a tangle of uninterpretable — numbers. Finally, many thanks are extended to those who authored and produced these volumes. These people deserve special recognition for their professionalism and willingness to undertake and complete difficult tasks under tight deadlines. James E. Bruseth, Director Randall W. Moir, Associate Director Archaeology Research Program | H t } i i i i i

INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME III by James E. Bruseth PROJECT BACKGROUND The Richland Creek Archaeological Project began in 1980 as an interdisciplinary program by Southern Methodist University to investigate cultural resources in the Richland/Chambers Dam and Reservoir (see Figure I-1). The reservoir is located about 100 km south of Dallas in Freestone and Navarro Counties, Texas. Construction of the dam and reservoir was started in 1982 and was completed in 1986. The archaeological work carried out in the reservoir consisted of three major phases. The first phase, begun in September 1980, involved the survey of the 44,750 acres to be impacted by the reservoir and the identification of 911 archaeological properties (Raab et al. 1980; Archaeology Research Program 1981). The second phase consisted of site testing and evaluation of 272 properties in order to determine their eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places (Raab et al. 1981). Testing procedures involved an interdisciplinary program of archaeological excavations, geological and geomorphological fieldwork, architectural studies, informant interviews, and archival research. The results identified 106 archaeological sites and historic Structures containing important information, which were considered eligible for the National Register (Archaeology Research Program 1981, 1982). The first and second phases were complete by August 1981. Data from the testing program were used to formulate a plan for the third phase: mitigation of the loss of significant archaeological properties in the reservoir. Any of the 106 significant archaeological properties identified during testing which were located below an elevation of 325 ft msl, under the dam, or inside of highway relocation corridors were recommended for intensive study. A program of archaeological mitigation was begun in June 1982, and carried out in four field seasons, each about three months in duration, with the last field season finished in December 1984. The intensive data collection was undertaken for 80 properties, while it was possible to avoid 26 properties with changes in the design of the dam or in the location of roads. The type of work conducted for each significant property during phase 3 varied from intensive excavation at all prehistoric and many historic sites to architectural documentation, dendrochronology, geomorph- ology, informant interviews, and archival research. THE RICHLAND CREEK TECHNICAL SERIES The present volume is the third in the Richland Creek Technical Series, a five volume set devoted to reporting the prehistoric and historic archaeological mitigation program conducted in the Richland/Chambers Reservoir by Southern Methodist University. The series presents all major data, interpretations, and conclusions for the research conducted at historic and prehistoric sites. More detail on the contents of each volume is presented below. ; Volume I provides background information on the Project. The first half of this volume summarizes management issues, including agency review and monitoring, in-house quality control and task management, and construction and maintenance of a computerized data base management system, The second half of Volume I presents environmental information for the Richland Creek area and reviews the results of pollen, soil, and geological studies. The data are used to model environmental change during the Holocene for the Richland Creek area. The next two volumes in the Technical Series are devoted to reporting the results of investigations at 15 prehistoric sites. Specifically, Volume II reports on excavations conducted at the Bird Point Island (41FT201) and the Adams Ranch (41NV177) sites, Both sites contained large, man-made depressions known as Wylie focus pits; because of these unique features, the sites are combined into a single volume.

It should be noted, however, that during investigations at these two sites, substantial deposits unrelated to the large depressions were found also. In particular, village deposits with important information pertaining to local and regional patterns of human adaptation to the environment of North Central Texas were recovered from the Bird Point Island site. Consequently, a substantial part of Volume II is devoted to reporting data on these occupations as well. Volume III, the present volume, is composed of two parts. The first presents basic data on the excavations conducted at 13 prehistoric sites. The presentations for each site are relatively straightforward and serve primarily as a means of communicating the information to other researchers. Brief interpretations on the temporal placement and functional uses of each site are made. However, most synthetic statements are reserved for the second part of Volume III. In this part, syntheses of the overall prehistoric research are presented. This includes chapters on cultural chronology, lithic technology, and raw materials utilization, The final chapter of Volume III presents an overview of the prehistoric archaeology of the Richland Creek area and relates this information into a behavioral perspective of human adaptation to the Prairie Margin of Texas. The last two volumes provide information on the results of archaeological and architectural studies of historic sites in the Richland Creek Archaeological Project area. Volume IV provides information on the research design, field methods, and major data collected from 64 historical properties. Thirty-seven historical properties received archaeological investigations as a primary emphasis, while 27 properties received architectural studies as a primary focus. Site descriptions for each property are given in Volume IV. Volume V, the final Volume in the Richland Creek Technical Series, reviews the results of specialized historic artifact analyses and synthetic studies of historic sites. The Richland Creek historic artifact classification is presented, and specific chapters are devoted to reviewing major artifact classes for sociocultural information. The remainder of the volume reviews categories of data at various synthetic levels and provides insight into the rich traditional lifeways once practiced on the farmsteads in this region. Three sets of microfiche complete the Richland Creek Technica! Series. The first set, located in the back of Volume I, includes the original reports on pollen analysis and geomorphological studies provided by our consultants. The second set, located in the backs of Volumes II and III, contains the information retrieved from all prehistoric sites. The third set, located in the back of Volume V, contains all historic information. In addition to the data provided in the microfiche and the five Technical Volumes, other information, such as original field notes, artifacts, computer data, and site maps are curated at the Institute for the Study of Earth and Man at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas.

wisi RESEARCH DESIGN AND INVESTIGATIVE STRATEGIES by Daniel E. McGregor and James E. Bruseth This part of Volume III contains the reports of mitigation phase excavations at 13 prehistoric sites. The field work at these sites was conducted over the course of four field seasons between June 1982, and December 1984 (Table 1-1). The site reports are presented as individual chapters (Chapters 2 through 14). The purpose of the present chapter is to provide a brief review of the Project research design and the criteria used in selecting sites for mitigation work. This is followed by a discussion of the format and contents of the site reports, RESEARCH DESIGN AND SITE SELECTION The basic framework for archaeological research at Richland/Chambers Reservoir has been the study of long-term human adaptation to the prairie margin environment. After completion of the testing phase of the Richland Creek Archaeological Project, a research design was developed to guide the mitigation phase investigations (Raab and Moir 1982). With respect to the prehistoric research, two major concerns influenced the selection of sites for further work. The first of these was the need for sites which dated to a number of different temporal periods, since possible diachronic changes in adaptive strategies were of primary interest. Many of the selected sites were multicomponent, but test excavations had suggested that cultural stratification was present. Secondly, it was thought that sites in a variety of physiographic locations should be excavated in order to sample as wide a range of settlement diversity as possible. Therefore, smaller sites indicative of creekside occupations (41FT193 and 41NV139) and sites associated with minor tributary drainages (41NV173 and 41NV203) were selected in addition to the larger, more intensively occupied sites located on the Pleistocene terraces of Richland and Chambers Creeks. The research design recommended 10 specific hypotheses for testing during future work at prehistoric sites (Raab and Moir 1982:203-207; see also Chapter 3, Volume I). Six of these hypotheses were directly relevant to the sites reported in this volume. These six hypotheses and their test implications are presented below. H1. Archaic stage sites in the Project area can be subsumed taxonomically within the Carrollton and Elam foci of the Trinity aspect, and the Neo-American stage sites within the Wylie focus of North Central Texas. 11: Stylistic similarity and dissimilarity of artifact styles between the Project area and surrounding regions (culture- historical synthesis). 12: Demonstration of contemporaneity of similar assemblages (at least chronological overlap). HS. The hamlet at site 41NV173 is a prehistoric Caddo habitation site. Il: Demonstration of Caddo ceramics, and other diagnostic cultural traits of early Caddo sites (features, house forms, burials). 12: At least partial reliance upon agriculture, as reflected in the presence of cultigen macrofossils or pollen. H6. The lithic assemblages produced by bifacial flaking can be analyzed by site or component to yield effective indicators of differing site functions within settlement systems. Il: Bivariate graphs of prehistoric debitage dimensions (Raab et al. 1979) will reflect the placement of the site or site component in the manufacturing trajectory and the similarity of such a trajectory to replicated debitage. I2: Systemic ratios of the components of bifacial assemblages will differentiate sites and site components by the degree to which bifacial manufacturing has occurred and the degree to which use of biface tools has occurred (House and Ballenger 1976). H7. Classes of use-related artifacts can be shown to have significant differences in frequency of occurrence between sites. 11: Site size and number of artifacts per unit volume of site matrix will be more variable from site to site than the range of

The former is indicated for any given site by the number of artifacts per cubic meter of site matrix, and the latter is reflected in the number of artifact classes (e.g., ground stone, hammerstones, drills, projectile points) found at a particular site divided by the total number of artifact classes recorded for all comparable sites (Fish et al. 1978:44-45). 12: The number of stone flakes with edge damage resulting from use and/or retouch will not vary in direct proportion to total quantity (weight, count) of chipped stone artifacts in a given site. 13: The quantity (weight, count) of imported lithic raw material will not vary in direct proportion to total quantity (weight, count) of chipped stone artifacts in samples of artifacts from a given site. H8. The frequency (weight, count, artifact size) of Pisgah Ridge chert artifacts will vary inversely with the distance to the Ridge (less material with increasing distance). 11: Correlation of other statistical measures will show a significant drop in frequency of material with distance from the source. 12: Test implication 11 will be shown to hold with straight line distance from the Ridge to sites, and to an even greater degree by distance along tributary creeks to Richland and Chambers Creeks. The amount of the highly distinctive Pisgah Ridge chert in sites in the Project area appears to be inversely related to distance from the Ridge, especially as measured by distance to sites along creeks. This information is of great potential value. There is a suggestion in these data that (a) Pisgah Ridge chert is not being curated in the sense of being carried great distances for use in sites, and (b) the chert frequencies seem to mark a pattern of settlement oriented to travel along streams. This material is an invaluable marker related to settlement and site function. H9. Significant paleoenvironmental changes have affected the Project area, and these changes have influenced the form and distribution of prehistoric settlement. Sometime after A.D. 420, and probably after A.D. 800, the Project area experienced a severe drought of undetermined length. Prior to this drought, the pollen evidence suggests a period of relatively greater effective moisture. During periods of relatively greater effective moisture, settlement expanded to occupy many physiographic settings away from sources of water in streams. During periods of drought, settlement was discontinued or restricted largely to stream channel settings. The faunal assemblages of sites will reflect the plant and animal communities that were exploited, with a more diverse fauna appearing during periods of greater effective moisture, and a larger proportion of small game and aquatic species appearing during periods of scarce moisture. Il: The fundamental depositional units, with their apparent palynological characteristics, will be replicated even when Volume HI, Part One stratigraphic samples of pollen are taken from microhabitats other than stream floodplains. In other words, control of localized conditions on pollen deposition (¢.g., comparison of samples from terraces and floodplains, accounting for the effects of the habitats) will not substantially alter the reconstruction. 12: The number, size, and complexity (see H6 and H7) of sites will increase with evidence of greater effective moisture. Evaluations of these specific hypotheses are not attempted within the individual site reports. Instead, each hypothesis is taken up in the appropriate synthetic chapter in Part Two of this volume. CHANGING PERSPECTIVES ON SITE INVESTIGATION STRATEGIES Because the mitigation phase of the Richland Creek Archaeological Project was conducted over four field seasons, time was available between field work phases to review and propose improvements in excavation strategies. This segmentation of the field work was employed to allow field results from previous seasons to be used to refine investigations during subsequent seasons and to improve the overall quality of the recovered data. This self-correcting capability is all too often difficult to operationalize in large CRM projects where field work is undertaken in a single, massive effort or where different phases of field work are conducted by different contractors. The resulting improvements in field work for the Richland Creek Archaeological Project affected two areas. First, the basic criteria used to select a site for intensive data recovery have changed. All sites in the Project mitigation plan cannot be investigated at the same level of intensity, and the relative emphasis of investigation must be geared to the types and quality of data potentially recoverable from each site. Second, the field methods employed for each site evolved substantially, permitting more realistic data collection. This evolution resulted largely from an awareness of the inherent weaknesses in the archaeological record of the Project area and an abandonment of the naive assumption that all parts of an extinct cultural system are knowable (Binford 1964). Some parts of the cultural system are irretrievably lost, and other parts may be retrievable only at too great a cost. Careful management of the data recovery process is essential, and this is most feasible in a multiphased data recovery program. As noted in the previous section, sites were selected for further investigation based on their ability to address specific research hypotheses. (Archaeology Research Program 1981). These hypotheses concentrated on several culture-historical and processual themes. Consequently, sites were selected from a variety of time periods and geographic locations. In addition, sites that s¢emed to have deep deposits with cultural stratigraphy were selected, siace these contexts would presumably provide vertical provenience control on cultural developments. Although testing had shown that visible stratigraphy did not occur at most sites, there appeared to be temporally relevant vertical separation of artifacts at many sites. This was revealed in test units by the occurrence of "older" artifacts, such as dart points at a greater depth, in comparison to “younger” artifacts, such as ceramics and arrow points. ; _ During the first season of mitigation, excavations were undertaken at four sites. Two of these were selected for their possible association with Wylie focus pits (Bird Point Island {41FT201] and Adams Ranch [41NV177], both reported in Volume II); and two others were chosen since they occurred within the dam construction area and would soon be impacted by heavy equipment (41FT158 and 41FT161B). These latter two sites also had deep deposits with apparent cultural stratigraphy. As part of larger, ongoing geological research within the reservoir, the Project geomorphologist investigated one of these sites (41FT158) to understand the geological processes behind the cultural stratigraphy. This work, outlined in Pheasant (1982b), indicated that the profile of the site showed a normal soil development, with Lie FRORCLABDED ERCOBESES CREGRAREE

One other alized } from itats) f sites upted taken lume, Research Design a fine loamy sandy A horizon over a well-developed, clayey B horizon. The site landform also was identified as a T2 terrace; the soils of which were deposited during the Pleistocene. The implications of these findings in terms of site interpretation were substantial. The evidence pointed to the site surface having been stable during much of the prehistoric period, excepting small-scale erosion. Importantly, artifacts would have been deposited on a surface very close to that present today and presumably would have been worked into the soil by some type of pedoturbation. Thus, the cultural stratigraphy was not real; older artifacts were deeper simply because more time had been available for them to move vertically into the soil. A detailed study of this problem was subsequently undertaken, and the impacts to the recovery of archaeological data were assessed (McIntyre and Janak 1982). These findings caused a re-evaluation of all other sites scheduled for mitigation in terms of the potential for non- aggrading surfaces and the pedoturbation of deposits. The results of this evaluation indicated that the only likely areas of appreciable soil aggradation were in the floodplain (e.g., the Perry site [41FT193]), and that the Tl and T2 terraces and the uplands were considerably older than the period represented by human occupation in the reservoir. Therefore, sites on the terraces or uplands could be expected to have stable surfaces, unless of course localized conditions such as erosion or colluviation had taken place. Consequently, culturally relevant vertical separation of artifacts would have to be demonstrated for each site and not simply assumed. As a result of this Season I work, the relative emphasis of field work shifted to sites with shallow A horizons and lower densities of artifacts (e.g., Litthe Cedar Creek [41NV173] and Irvine {41NV182]). Although sites with deep deposits and/or large quantities of artifacts were still investigated, the quality of the retrievable information was reviewed against data from other, geologically better contexts. More specifically, characteristics of a shallow A horizon and a lower density of artifacts were chosen in order to minimize the disturbance factors at the sites. The pedoturbation that vertically mixes artifacts in the A horizon also destroys the visible traces of features, important contexts for archaeological interpretation. On the other hand, the higher clay content of the B horizon discourages much of the pedoturbation activity due to a greater compactness (Edward Janak, personal communication 1983). Consequently, features which are still preserved often occur at the point at which they contacted the B horizon. Furthermore, the shallower the depth to the B horizon, the more of the feature will be intact. Additionally, sites with lower artifact densities were chosen over high-density sites, The reason behind this was the assumption that the fewer the artifacts, the fewer the occupations represented at the site, and the less the chance of several components being mixed by pedoturbation. A few exceptions to this selection criterion were made. Sites with large quantities of artifacts that covered several acres continued to be investigated, since there was a good possibility that reoccupation of the site did not occur in the same locations. Analysis of horizontally distinct clusters at such sites might identify debris associated with individual components. In addition to shifting emphasis away from sites with deep and potentially mixed deposits to shallower, lower density sites, the investigative methods for the sites changed as well. Since vertical provenience of artifacts at many of the sites was not due to cultural activity, techniques to recover data from broad horizontal areas, where the effects of bioturbation would be lessened, were stressed. Large site areas were sampled so that adequate data on overall artifact and feature patterning could be collected and used to examine intrasite activity distributions. Certain techniques, such as the excavation of smail sized test units (50 x 50 cm) on a systematic basis and the input of this information into a computerized contouring program (SYMAP), were found to be highly useful in identifying activity areas and in the horizontal separation of components (see, for example, 41FT200, 41NV173, 41NV182, 41NV206). Initially, this technique was pioneered on the historic phase of the Project with equal success (see Chapter 6, Volume IV). In addition, noninvasive remote sensing devices were used (41NV173), again covering large areas. Information was retrieved that otherwise was not apparent from the excavations. Finally, large parts of several sites (41FT200, 41NV173, and 41NV182) were scraped to the underlying B horizon to expose features and to delineate their patterning relative to the A horizon artifact distributions. All of these techniques have allowed data to be collected to test the Project research hypotheses, and importantly, - have permitted new levels of interpretation to be made concerning the regional prehistory of North Central Texas. SITE REPORT FORMAT AND CONTENT The subsequent site report chapters follow a standard format that includes the following major topical headings: @ Environmental Setting @ Summary of Previous Investigations ® Excavation Strategy © Results of Investigations ® Interpretations The first two sections provide background information on physiographic location and what was known about each site prior to the mitigation phase investigations. The excavation strategy section discusses site specific methods of data collection. The amount of work conducted and the techniques employed varied among the 13 reported sites, and specific details are presented for each of these. Froth flotation was conducted for soil samples from six of these sites. A detailed description of this procedure is presented in Appendix D, but is not repeated in the individual site reports. The results of investigations section includes the presentation of basic data. The content of this section differs somewhat depending upon the kinds of data that were recovered from each site. The descriptions of lithic tools and ceramics are included in this section, but the tool categories and the attributes of the ceramic artifacts are defined in greater detail in Appendices A and B, respectively. Attributes of the lithic debris are not described im the individual site reports. Instead, an analysis of the lithic debris from selected sites is presented in Chapter 17 of this volume. The objective of this analysis is to define assemblage-specific reduction strategies and to compare these between sites of different time periods. This is accomplished with a detailed attribute analysis of both the unmodified lithic debris and the secondarily modified chipped stone artifacts. One requirement for this analysis was that the assemblages had to be assignable to a particular period of occupation. For this reason, only assemblages from predominately single component sites or from essentially unmixed contexts within multicomponent sites were used. The results of investigation section also includes discussions of site stratigraphy and both the vertical and horizontal distributions of the recovered artifacts. Descriptions of cultural features and discussions of the faunal and macrobotanical remains are provided for the sites where these were present. Interpretations are included at the end of each site report. However, these essentially are site-specific interpretations. More synthetic interpretations based on comparisons between all sites are presented in the various chapters that make up Part Two of this volume. Evaluations of the specific research hypotheses are also found in the appropriate chapters of Part Two.

EXCAVATIONS AT 41FT158 by William A. Martin and Daniel E. McGregor, with a contribution by James E. Bruseth ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Site 41FT158 is situated along the top and slopes of an eroded T2 terrace of Pleistocene origin (David Pheasant, personal communication 1983), This terrace is a long, narrow formation rising approximately 30 ft (9.1 m) above the floodplains of Richland Creek to the west and the Trinity River to the east. Alligator Creek, a tributary of Richland Creek, flows paratlel to the terrace along the base of its northeast slope. Vegetational cover is variable across the site, with pasture covering the northwest part of the terrace and wild grasses, herbs, and some trees covering the terrace east and south of the fence lines (Figure 2-1). Most of the original forest cover has been removed and replaced by secondary growth. Disturbances to the site, aside from the removal of vegetation, include erosion, especially along the slopes, and excavation of modern trash pits with a backhoe. Within the pasture at the northwest end of the site, a trailer and shed used by deer hunters are present. South of the fence line, near Units 25 and 26, the remains of an historic house site are present. These historic period occupations have caused some disturbance to the site, but their effects have been minimal. SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS Test excavations conducted at site 41FT158 in 1980 included 17 shovel tests and one backhoe trench. Shovel tests measured 40 x 40 cm, and the backhoe trench measured about 10 m by 0.5 m. The backhoe trench and all but three of the shovel tests were dug along the northeast slope of the terrace. The other three shovel tests were | placed along the top of the terrace, west of the fence line | (McGregor et al. 1982:28). The results of the testing program revealed that the northeast slope was greatly disturbed by erosion and recently excavated trash pits. Across the site, two natural strata were recognized: a loamy sand A horizon and a sandy clay B horizon. The depth of the loamy sand varied from 1.7 m at the top of the terrace to about 30- 40 cm further down the slope. Artifacts diagnostic of Early and Middle Archaic occupations were discovered throughout the A horizon, These artifacts included Waco Sinkers and a Bulverde dart point. Artifacts at 41FT158 suggested that important archaeological data from the Archaic period might be recovered at the site. Therefore, the site was included in the mitigation phase of the Richland Creek Archaeological Project. Limited excavations designed to examine the top of the terrace were recommended because this area appeared to be the most productive in terms of archaeological data recovery and the least disturbed. EXCAVATION STRATEGY The excavation strategy was a continuation of the earlier testing procedures, with units placed across the top of the terrace to search for cultural features, burials, and other evidence of occupation. Since the archaeological content of the top of the terrace was known only through limited testing, this strategy of systematic excavation units was believed to be the most efficient method for assessing the nature of the site. The 1982 mitigation work consisted of 16 hand excavated units and two backhoe trenches. Excavation units were staked out using metric tapes and a compass to orient them to magnetic north. This method allowed the units to be laid out quickly, with only a small loss in accuracy of alignment. All units were mapped with a transit at the conclusion of the field work to produce a plot of the entire site. ; The top of the terrace was examined most intensively because testing phase results suggested that this area would be the most productive portion of the site. A series of 1 x 1 m excavation units, numbered 18 through 23, was dug along north-south and east-west axes on the top of the terrace (see Figure 2-1). Next, the southern slope of the terrace was examined by digging a series of 40 x 40

Finally, Units 29 through 32 were excavated. Unit 29 was a 2 x 2 m unit adjacent and immediately to the south of Unit 19. It was dug in order to expose 4 broad surface area, thereby increasing the likelihood of uncovering features and artifacts. This excavation strategy was also designed to expose a large profile for examination and resulted in a 3 m long east profile. Unit 30 was a 1 x 1 m unit adjoining Unit 18 on the west. This unit was dug to expose an unusual rectangular soil stain found at a depth of 30 cm below surface in the southwest corner of Unit 18. However, once the unit was excavated it became apparent that the stain was the result of recent fence building activity, since it was aligned with other rectangular fence posts still standing near the present fence line. Unit 31 was a2 x 2 m unit excavated between shovel test Units 24 and 25. In Units 24, 25, and 28, artifacts were found in the upper 30 cm and below 55 cm, separated by what appeared to be sterile soil. Unit 31 was excavated to open an area large and deep enough to determine whether or not two distinct occupations were represented. Unit 32, a1 x 1 m unit, was excavated in an effort to assess the nature of a slight depression in the ground surface. Excavation in Unit 32 provided data similar to those obtained from other units. No prehistoric features were found and the depression appeared to be the result of erosion stemming from modern disturbance. Excavation of Units 18 and 19 was in 10 cm levels from ground surface to culturally sterile soil. A plow zone, approximately 20 cm thick, was observed in both of these units. Consequently, the first level in each subsequent unit, with the exception of the shovel

Shovel test units were screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh, but were not excavated 10 cm levels. Horizontal control was maintained within 2 x 2 m units by assigning a separate provenience for each of the four 1 m2 quadrants within the unit. The northwest quadrant of each 2 x 2 m unit was designated as A and the remaining quadrants were designated B, C, and D in aclockwise direction. The last units excavated were two backhoe trenches placed along the top of the terrace. Unit 35 was 5 m long, 0.75 m wide at its east end and 1.5 m wide at its west end, and reached a depth of 2.3 m. Unit 34 was 5 m long, 0.75 m wide, and 2.5 m deep. These trenches were dug to examine the natural stratigraphy of the terrace. A total of 40.5 person-days was expended at site 41FT158. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS SITE STRATIGRAPHY The east profile of Units 19 and 29 is a typical stratigraphic profile from 41FT158 (Figure 2-2). Little cultural stratigraphy was found in this site. No midden or features were present, and the observed strata are the result of natural soil formation processes. Four soil zones were observed. Zones | and 2 are the upper and lower portions of the plow zone, respectively. Zone 1 is slightly darker than Zone 2 due to the accumulation of organic matter in recent years. Both Zones | and 2 are comprised of loamy sand. Zone 3 is a dark yellow-brown loamy sand with inclusions of hematite and petrified wood; this zone together with the plow zone makes up the A horizon. Artifacts were found throughout Zones 1-3, but their frequency of occurrence dropped sharply once Zone 4 was reached. Zone 4 has a much higher clay content than the other zones, marking the formation of an argillic, or B, horizon. ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS Table F-1 in Appendix F presents the counts for all artifact classes by unit and level provenience. The lithic tools and ceramic artifacts are described below. LITHIC TOOLS Dart Points Bulverde (i specimen, Figure 2-3a). This specimen has a large, rectangular stem with a slightly concave base. The stem edges are lightly ground. The triangular blade is broad, with prominent shoulders. The shoulders were apparently barbed, but have been broken. Material: Edwards chert. Provenience: 16.1.

East profile of Units 19 and 29. ro Gary (6 specimens, Figure 2-3b), These specimens are characterized by their triangular blades, contracting stems, and rounded bases. Two are somewhat larger than the others and have rather broad blades with slightly barbed shoulders. The other four are somewhat smaller with overall narrow outlines (Figure 2-3b). The shoulders are fairly prominent, but lack barbs. These four specimens are very similar to the Gary, kemp variety defined by Johnson (1962:164). The illustrated specimen differs from the other three in having a slightly longer stem with light grinding along its lateral edges. Materials: all are quartzite. Proveniences: 19.4, 22.7, 29.4, 29.5, 31.3(2). Lanceolate (reworked) (1 specimen, Figure 2-3c). The distal portion of this specimen has been subjected to beveled resharpening. Evidence of grinding is present on the lower lateral _ edges, slightly concave base, and on both faces of the proximal portion of the specimen. It appears that, prior to reworking, the blade was considerably wider at its midsection than at its base. This feature is more characteristic of the Angostura point type than it is of Plainview. Material: chert. Provenience: 29.7. San Patrice (1 specimen, Figure 2-3d). This specimen has a beveled, triangular blade, low side notches, and a concave base. The base has been fluted on both faces. Material: silicified wood. Provenience: 29.5. Side-notched (1 specimen, Figure 2-3e). The distal tip and one shoulder of this specimen are missing. It has low side notches and a slightly concave base that is as wide as the maximum body width. Material: chert. Provenience: 29.6, Yarbrough (1 specimen). This specimen has a triangular blade, prominent shoulders, straight stem and base. Material: chert. Provenience: 31.2. Untyped, Straight Stem (3 specimens, Figure 2-3f). These three specimens are grouped together because of their straight Sided, rectangular stems. The illustrated specimen has a long triangular blade and rather short stem. The shoulders are broken and the blade edges are deeply serrated along the lower 3/4 of their length. The blade also exhibits slight beveling of the right edges. This specimen is most similar to Prewitt's (1974:67) Neches River, oletha variety. A second specimen has a similar stem configuration, but a broader, non-serrated blade. The third specimen consists of only the straight based, broad rectangular stem from a dart point that may have been similar to the Bulverde specimen described above. Materials: quartzite(2), chert(1). Proveniences: 29.1, 29.7(2). Untyped, Expanding Stem (2 specimens, Figure 2-3g). The illustrated specimen has prominent, barbed shoulders and a rather long expanding stem with a concave base. The lateral stem edges and part of the base have been lightly ground. The second specimen has a small, narrow triangular blade with weakly developed shoulders and a short expanding stem with a straight base. The stem edges and base of this specimen also exhibit light gtinding. Materials: both are chert. Proveniences: 20.4, 29.7, Finished Bifaces Bristol Biface (1 specimen). This specimen is made of quartzite and retains a small amount of cortex on one face. Its edges are less regular than those of other specimens in this category, from sites 41FT201 and 41FT161B. Provenience: 31.3. Knife (1 specimen). This chert specimen has an outline which is similar to some forms of Gary points. However, the distal tip is only slightly pointed, and the base is poorly thinned. The blade edges are very straight (nonsinuous) and were formed by fine secondary retouch. Provenience: 29.6.

Bruseth) Four sherds were recovered from site 41FT158. Table 2-1 lists the proveniences and selected attributes for these ceramics. More detail on the attributes can be found in Appendix B. All are undecorated sherds from separate vessels; three are body sherds while one is a rim sherd. Three of the sherds are tempered with a combination of grog and grit, while paste textures are fine to medium. A single sherd is tempered with what we are terming “possible” shell, since the temper inclusions have leached out. The laminated and vesicular structure of the paste and the pitted surface of the sherd suggest that shell may have been the additive. Similar pottery has been found at other sites in the reservoir with the shell inclusions still intact (see Part Two, Volume II). Thickness of the grog and grit tempered sherds ranges from 4.0 to 7.5 mm, with an average of 5.0 mm. The single shell tempered sherd has a thickness of 4.7 mm. Colors for the grog and grit tempered sherds are as follows: the exterior is light brownish gray (10YR6/2); the interior is very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2); and the core is very dark grayish brown. The shell tempered sherd is light brown (7.5YR6/4) on the exterior, interior, and the core. It is difficult to make interpretations on the basis of such a small sample of sherds. However, we are able to state that some degree of occupation of the site occurred by people using two ceramic traditions: a shell temper tradition, and a grog and grit temper tradition. As outlined in Chapter 15, a time frame prior to A.D. 700 is proposed for the shell temper tradition; while a span of A.D. 700 to 1650 is suggested for the grog and grit temper tradition. On this basis, limited but repeated occupation of site 41FT158 during the Late Prehistoric period is suggested.

Projectile points diagnostic of both the Early and Late Archaic periods were recovered from these units. The recovery of three sherds from these same units, and a fourth from Unit 28, suggests some use of the site during the Late Prehistoric period as well. The only other temporally diagnostic artifacts, three Late Archaic period dart points (2 Gary and 1 Yarbrough), were from Unit 31, located downslope to the southeast. Even though the sample of diagnostic artifacts is relatively small, its vertical distribution demonstrates the mixed nature of the site deposit. Level 5 of Unit 29 contained both an Early Archaic San Patrice point and a Late Prehistoric ceramic sherd. In Unit 20, two sherds were recovered from 20 cm below a Late Archaic Untyped, expanding stem point. Lacking good vertical separation of temporal components, it is not possible to assign any artifacts except the projectile points and ceramics to a specific period of occupation. INTERPRETATIONS Interpretations of site 41FT158 are limited by the mixed nature of the deposit, as well as a total lack of features and subsistence remains. However, the question of site chronology can be addressed. The temporally diagnostic projectile points suggest at least intermittent occupation from Early through Late Archaic times. Certain of these projectile point styles are among the earliest recovered in the Project area. The four sherds indicate use of the site during the Late Prehistoric period as well. Volume UI, Part One The lanceolate point is difficult to assign to a recognized type because of the extensive rechipping of its distal end. However, its lanceolate outline, ground base, and lateral edges are characteristic of a variety of unfluted, late Paleo-Indian/Early Archaic point styles. The San Patrice point is generally considered to be diagnostic of the Early Archaic period in East Texas. However, the temporal span of this type is not well documented. At the Wood Pit site (on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River near Dallas), San Patrice points were found in a mixed deposit that also contained Plainview points and artifacts diagnostic of the Early Archaic Carrollton focus (Webb et al. 1971:45). A radiocarbon date of 3980 + 200 B.C. (Campbell 1959) was obtained from mussel shell found near the base of this deposit. Some researchers (¢.g., Shafer 1973:20; Webb et al. 1971:46) have suggested that San Patrice may be a western variant of the more widespread Dalton type, which has been dated to between 8000 and 6000 B.C. in the midwestern and southeastern United States. The single side-notched point recovered from 41FT158 is identical to specimens from two sites which also yielded San Patrice assemblages: Wolfshead in East Texas (Duffield 19636) and John Pearce in northwest Louisiana (Webb et al. 1971). Duffield (1963b:139) assigned these side-notched points to an Early Archaic occupation, but asserted that this occurred later in time than the occupation which produced the San Patrice points. However, Webb et al. (1971:47) suggested that better stratigraphic context at the John Pearce site demonstrated contemporaneity of the side-notched and San Patrice point types. The contention that these types were contemporary was based, at least in part, on the apparent association of side-notched and Dalton point forms at various caves and rockshelters in the midwestern and southeastern United States (Webb et al. 1971:46). More recently, Goodyear's (1982) detailed review of these associations led him to conclude that they are the result of postdepositional mixing of deposits, and that sites with better context show Dalton points as dating slightly earlier than the side- notched forms. A single Bulverde point was recovered during the 1980-81 test excavations at the site (see Figure 2-3a). Bulverde is the diagnostic point style of the Middle Archaic, Marshall Ford phase in Prewitt’s Central Texas chronology, with an estimated age of 2050 B.C. to 1450 B.C. (Prewitt 1981:79). The remaining typable projectile points recovered from 41FT158, Gary (6), and Yarbrough (1), are all assignable to the Late Archaic period. In summary, it appears that most of the site assemblage can be assigned to the Archaic period, but that it represents the remains of a number of short-term occupations that occurred over several thousand years. The relatively low density of artifacts and the absence of definable midden deposits and features, suggest that 41FT158 was occupied by mobile groups of hunter-gatherers. Although little else can be inferred about the nature of individual occupations, the site assemblage itself has been useful for other studies. In Chapters 16 and 17, the lithic assemblage from 41FT158 is one of three primarily Archaic period samples that are used to identify chronological changes in lithic tool assemblages and raw material utilization.

Martin and Daniel E. McGregor, with contributions by James E. Bruseth, Gary Rutenberg, Phillip Murry, and Gayle J. Fritz ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING The same terrace ridge upon which 41FT158 is situated also contains sites 41FT161 and 41FT161B along its eroded southern slope. Sites 41FT161 and 41FT161B are portions of a single site that has been bisected by the road cut for Highway 287. Site 41FT161 was found within 20 m of the road cut along the eroded slope to the north. Site 41FT161B extended along the lower slope of the terrace south of Highway 287, with prehistoric artifacts scattered from the road cut down to the floodplain. Greenbriar, bull nettle, poison oak, and other shrub species common to cleared fields blanketed most of the terrace. A cluster of trees bordered the road cut at the northern end of the site; but for the most part, the site was cleared of trees. A strip of woodland paralleling Alligator Creek was adjacent to the site on the eastern and southeastern edges, at the junction of the terrace and the floodplain. Disturbances to the site, aside from the road cut made during the construction of Highway 287, included plowing, rodent activity, and unscientific excavation by amateur collectors. Plowing had disturbed the upper stratum of the site to a depth of about 20 cm. Burrowing animals in the Project area appear to be more attracted to terraces than to clayey soils of the floodplain. As a result, rodent and root disturbances at site 41FT161B were extensive. Finally, several "potholes" were present in the eastern portion of the site, the result of activity by artifact collectors (Figure 3-1). , SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS During the 1980-81 testing program, seven shovel tests were excavated. These shovel tests measured 40 x 40 cm and were approximately 1 m or more in depth. Most of these shovel tests were placed in the central and eastern portions of the terrace (Figure 3-1), 15 The results of these limited test excavations showed that the stratigraphy at 41FT161B was similar to that at 41FT158 higher on the terrace, consisting of an A horizon of loamy sand overlying a sandy clay B horizon. Although no features were found, artifacts were recovered throughout the A horizon, which extended as deep as 1 m near the upper part of the site. Projectile points identified with the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods were recovered, suggesting the presence of a long term occupation at the site. In addition to this, local informants reported that burials had been recovered during the construction of Highway 287 (McGregor et al. 1982:30). The presence of artifacts up to 1 m in depth, coupled with the reports of human burials, suggested that this site might contain important information about the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. As a result, the site was scheduled for excavation during the mitigation phase of the Richland Creek Archaeological Project. EXCAVATION STRATEGY A four-step data recovery strategy was implemented at 41FT161B to examine the archaeological context of the site. First, the terrace was explored by excavating a series of 1 x 1 m units (Units 8-14, 18-21, 24, 25, 29, 31, and 32) (see Figure 3-1). Depth of units varied according to the nature of the deposit, with excavation ceasing when artifact recovery dropped to an insignificant level (1 or 2 flakes per m3). Second, larger areas were opened to expose fully intact deposits found in the 1 x 1m units (Units 15-17, 22, 23, 26-28, 30, and 33). Third, two hand excavated trenches and a series of contiguous 2 x 2 m units were excavated rapidly to search for undisturbed features and burials (Units 34-51). Fourth and finally, mechanized excavation was undertaken to strip selected portions of the site area to look for features that might only be visible at the contact between the A and B horizons. Units 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 were excavated first to sample the terrace in both the east-west and north-south directions. These

Map of site 41FT161B showing testing phase excavation units (gray) and Season I excavation units (black). units were placed systematically at 10 m intervals. Feature 1 was found in Unit 10. Accordingly, Unit 15 was excavated adjacent to Unit 10 to expose that feature. Likewise, a soil anomaly was observed in Unit 8; Units 16 and 17 were excavated to further examine the nature of the anomaly which proved to be a natural root or rodent disturbance. Few artifacts were recovered from the other units. Several 1 x 1 m units were scattered about the site in areas thought to have potential for containing intact deposits. Units 18, 19, and 21 were excavated in the vicinity of the potholes dug by collectors. Examination of the profiles of these potholes did not reveal any evidence of features or burials, but the area surrounding the holes was examined because the intensive activity of the collectors suggested that this might be a productive portion of the site. Units 20, 24, 25, 29, 31, and 32 were dispersed across the terrace to provide uniform coverage of the site (Figure 3-1). Unit 18 contained a small concentration of deer bone and fire eracked rock, labeled Feature 2, but little else. On the other hand, Unit 19 contained the highest concentration of lithics found on the site, including the only hammerstone recovered. Contiguous Units 22, 23, 26, and 28 were excavated adjacent to Unit 19 to open up a broader area in an attempt to search for additional evidence of a specialized activity area. These units also contained high frequencies of lithic debitage, which suggest that this eastern portion of the site may have functioned as a lithic workshop area. Unit 21 contained human bone (Burial 1) so Units 27 and 33 were excavated adjacent to it to fully expose the burial. Similarly, Unit 24 contained a human skull; consequently it was expanded from a 1x1 m unit to a 2 x 2 m unit in order to expose Burial 2. Unit 25 also contained human cranial fragments (Burial 3), and Unit 30 was excavated to search for additional bones. However, none were found. The widely dispersed nature of the burials prompted the shift in excavation strategy to the third step; i.e., rapid excavation of large areas in search of features and burials. Large excavation blocks were opened near the areas where the burials were found in order to determine whether a cemetery existed or whether a few individuals were buried randomly across the site. To facilitate the rapid examination of the site area, the standard excavation procedures described earlier in this chapter were abandoned during the excavation of Units 34 and 35. Units 36, 37, and 38 were excavated in 10 cm levels and screened, but so little diagnostic material (less than one artifact per m3) was recovered that all subsequent units were dug like Units 34 and 35. Thus, intensive excavation techniques, such as screening and removal of soil in arbitrary 10 cm levels, were not used to excavate Units 34, 35, and 39 through 51. These units were dug rapidly to a depth of 50 cm, the approximate depth of Burials 1 and 2, and then were excavated more carefully to greater depths. Few data important for the interpretation of site 41FT161B were lost because of this shift in methodology. Examination of the artifact tabulations from Units 8 through 33 clearly demonstrates that: (1) the stratigraphy was mixed, probably by bioturbational processes; (2) few diagnostic artifacts were present; and (3) most of the artifact collection consisted of lithic flakes, chips, and shatter with no apparent spatial patterning (except that previously noted in Units 19, 22, 23, 26, and 28). Under these circumstances, additional controlled collection of artifacts would not have added significantly to the site interpretation. The only classes of data which appeared to possess any reasonable potential for addressing Juit.

As a result, the work focused on rapid but careful hand excavation of large areas. Unit 34 was a hand excavated trench measuring 18 m long, 1 m wide, and 60 cm deep. Burial 4, a semiflexed, partial human skeleton, was found within Feature 8, an oval grave pit, near the center of Unit 34. Unit 35 was another hand excavated trench measuring 18 m long, 1 m wide, and 60 cm deep; only three dart points were recovered from this unit. Units 36, 40, 48, 49, and 50 were contiguous 2 x 2 m units which formed an excavation block measuring 4 x 6 m intersecting Unit 34. Little was found in Units 36 and 40; but Feature 4, a small concentration of bone and fire cracked rock, and Feature 5, a shallow soil stain, were found in Unit 49. Part of Feature 6, a large circular pit, was found in Unit 48; so Unit 50 was excavated to expose it completely. Units 37, 38, 41, and 42 formed a block excavation measuring | 4x 4m. No features were found in this area, The only artifact recovered from this block was a grinding slab found in Unit 37. Units 39, 43, 44, and 51 formed another 4 x 4 m block | excavation. Feature 7, a circular pit, was discovered in the west | profile of Unit 39, Unit 51 was opened to expose the remaining | portion of this feature. No other features were found in this } excavation block. Unit 45 was opened to the northwest of Unit 44 to search for additional burials in the area between Units 24 and | 44, but no burials or features were discovered. Mechanized stripping of the topsoil was postponed until } archaeologists had a chance to assess more fully the occurrence of features and burials. This assessment was accomplished by hand excavation of large blocks. Once it became clear that burials and features were rare, mechanized excavation was initiated as a more | cost-effective technique. A front end loader was used to scrape seven, parallel north- | south paths across the site (Figure 3-1). The scraped paths } measured approximately 20 m long, 2 m wide, and 50 cm deep. The target depth of 50 cm marked the division between the A and | B horizons, the level where features and burials were first } Observed during hand excavation. Soil was scooped up in the bucket of the front end loader, | transported downslope, and dumped. During this operation, a ; erew member was positioned adjacent to the working end of the bucket to monitor the work. In the event that features or burials were uncovered, the monitor was there to inform the operator ) before irreparable damage could result from additional scraping. Feature 9, a charcoal lined pit, was uncovered during this | Operation. The area surrounding the stain was shovel scraped to elarify the boundaries of the feature. This shovel scraped area appears as Unit 46 in Figure 3-1, measuring roughly 1 x 5 m. No | other features or burials were found in any of the other scraped One backhoe trench, Unit 47, was excavated to allow the Project geomorphologist to observe the natural terrace | stratigraphy. This trench was approximately 6 m long, 0.75 m wide, and about 2.5 m deep. No archaeological features were uncovered during the excavation of this trench. A total of 131.5 person-days was spent on archaeological work at 41FT161B. Hand excavation of units in 10 cm levels with screening was accomplished in 79.5 person-days. Hand excavation without screening was completed in an additional 50 person-days. Finally, mechanized excavation was conducted in 2 person-days. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS SITE STRATIGRAPHY Three zones were recognized in all of the units at 41FT161B: a plow zone, a midden, and a submidden (Figure 3-2). Soil in all zones consisted of sandy loam, and artifacts were present in all zones. The plow zone was 20-25 cm deep, with the upper 10 cm Tepresenting colluvial deposition (Edward Janak, personal 17 West Profile | Unit 39 | A horizon fre] Dark Brown pavers Dark Gray Sandy Loam Feature Fill pe Very Dark Dark Yellowish Grayish Brown Brown Sandy 30 Sandy Loam Loam Figure 3-2. West profile of Unit 39 showing Feature 7. communication 1982). A dark brown layer 30-40 cm thick was observed beneath the plow zone and is believed to represent a midden due to the sudden drop in artifact density below this layer. The presence of arrow points and ceramics within this layer and in Burial 4, beneath this layer, suggests that the midden is the result of a Late Prehistoric occupation. The light brown soil beneath the midden contained artifacts to a depth of at least 1 m, but the artifact density was so low that it became inefficient to excavate all units to sterile soil. FEATURES Nine feature numbers were assigned during the excavations at site 41FT161B. Subsequent investigation showed that one of these (Feature 3) was a natural disturbance (a rodent burrow). Feature 8 proved to be a grave pit containing Burial 4. The remains of three additional individuals were discovered to the east and southeast, and were designated Burials 1, 2, and 3. The eight cultural features are described below. The burials are also described briefly, although a more detailed discussion of them is presented in a separate section of this site report. The locations of features and burials (excluding Burial 3) are shown in Figure 3-3. FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS Feature 1 This feature consisted of a concentration of deer bone, fire cracked rock, charcoal fragments, and a Gary dart point located within an area measuring 75 cm by 30 cm. The depth of these materials was between 71 and 80 cm below the surface. Most of Feature 1 was contained in Unit 10, although some fire cracked rock extended north into Unit 15. The feature appears to represent discarded trash. Feature 2 Feature 2 consisted of a small concentration of flakes, deer bone, and a piece of burned clay. This feature was smaller than Feature 1, measuring 30 cm by 25 cm. It was found in Unit 18 at a depth of 45-50 cm below surface. This concentration also appears to represent discarded refuse. Feature 4 Feature 4, like Features 1 and 2, consisted of a small concentration of fire cracked rock and deer bone. The

It was found at a depth of 60-64 cm below the surface, and appears to represent discarded trash. Feature 5 Feature 5 consisted of a black (10YR2/1), oval stain, measuring 50 cm north-south by 35 cm east-west, in Unit 49. Within this dark, organic stain, an irregular, yellowish brown (10YR5/4) clay inclusion measuring roughly 15 x 15 cm was present, The entire stain disappeared 2-3 cm below the level at which it was uncovered. Only two flakes were associated with this feature. It is unclear whether this feature was the result of natural or cultural processes. Feature 6 Feature 6 was a nearly circular pit, measuring 100 cm north-south by 96 cm east-west, found in Units 48 and 50. A distinct pit was not observed until excavators reached a depth of 50 cm below the surface. The pit fill was very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) in color at this level, surrounded by dark brown to brown (10YR4/3) soil. The pit was basin-shaped in profile and bottomed out 7i cm below the surface. Two sandy paste ceramic sherds were recovered from the pit fill, along with some flakes. The original function of the feature is unknown, Feature 7 Feature 7 was also a circular pit, measuring 56 cm in diameter and approximately 40 cm deep. The feature was discovered in the west profile of Unit 39 at a depth of about 25 cm, with the bottom extending down to about 65 cm below the surface (see Figure 3-2). Excavators did not notice the feature while digging Unit 39 because of the slight soil color difference between the very dark gray (10YR3/1) pit fill and the surrounding very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) soil. Therefore, nearly half of the feature was removed before it was observed. The remaining half of the feature was carefully excavated, yielding bumed bone and charcoal 46 cm below ground surface. The original function of this feature is unknown. . Feature 8 Feature 8 was the grave pit in which Burial 4 was discovered. The pit was found approximately 60 cm below ground surface and appeared as a very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) stain measuring 65 cm north-south by 114 cm east-west. The pit bottomed out at a depth of 79 cm below the surface. One arrow point was recovered from the vicinity of the spinal cord, although this does not imply an association in vivo. Feature 9 Feature 9 was a pit which may have contained cooking remains, since the bottom was covered with a layer of charcoal. The pit was th thei le Gi weet bhe BEE ue

It appeared as a circular stain, nearly 140 cm in diameter and approximately 40 cm below ground surface, in Unit 46. The bottom of the pit was visible in profile at a depth of 125 cm below the surface. This feature was not completely excavated, but flotation samples were recovered from three different zones within the feature. Sample A was taken from the black (LOYR2/1) layer at the bottom of the pit, sample B came from the very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) layer above the bottom, and sample C came from a mottled layer overlying the very dark grayish brown layer. Because no oxidation of the soil was observed, it seems likely that the charcoal was dumped into the pit as refuse, rather than having burned in situ. BURIAL DESCRIPTIONS Burial 1 Burial 1 was a greatly disturbed burial found in three contiguous 1 x 1 m units (Units 21, 27, and 33) between 50 and 60 em below the surface. The remains of this individual were completely disarticulated and were scattered randomly throughout the units. Some teeth (incisors), the left half of the mandible, and a radius were found in Unit 21. Most of the remains, including part of the right mandible, most of an ulna, part of the ilium, ribs, and unidenifiable bone fragments, were spread across the south half of the unit. The only portion of the individual present in Unit 33 was the distal end of a femur. No grave goods were found in association with this burial. A Gary point was found at a depth of 54 cm below the surface in Unit 27, but it may not have been associated with the burial. Due to the disturbed nature of the burial, it was impossible to determine whether or not the projectile point was part of the interment. Factors responsible for the disturbed context of Burial 1 include rodent activity, and perhaps erosion. Several large rodent burrows were observed within the matrix containing the burial. Rodents probably moved most of the bones, but colluvial movement through erosion also may have affected the burial. Another possible source of disturbance is uncontrolled excavation by amateur collectors. Several potholes were found across the site, and one local collector who visited the site admitted that he had dug on the site for years. It is possible that Burial 1 was disturbed by this collector or others who frequent the site. Burial 2 Burial 2 was discovered in Unit 24, at a depth of 45 cm, when the top of the skull was exposed. No grave pit was visible, so excavators dug an arbitrary pit as they attempted to expose all of the remains. The base of this arbitrary pit was 60 cm below the surface. Burial 2 consisted of the incomplete skeleton of a partially flexed, aduit female which was lying on its right side. The skeleton was oriented in a north-south direction with the skull at the north end, facing west. Most of the bone between the skull and the legs was missing. Only the skull, a fragment of the right radius, the humeri, femurs, tibias, fibulas, and a fragment of the left scapula were present. The tibias exhibited pronounced thickening as the result of infectious pathology. Although only a partial skeleton was present, the orientation of the skull, arms, and legs clearly indicates that Burial 2 represents a primary interment rather than a secondary burial, The presence of rodent burrows throughout Unit 24 suggests that rodent disturbance may have been responsible for the removal of the bones between the skull and the legs. Extensive damage to profiles was caused by cotton rats while the 1982 excavations were being conducted. If the modern pattern of disturbance has been prevalent since the burials were interred (ca. 1000 years ago), then it is quite conceivable that the missing bones from Burial 2 could have been removed by rodents. 19 Burial 3 Burial 3 was a small concentration of cranial fragments found at a depth of only 30 cm below the surface in Unit 25. Fragments of a frontal bone were found in an area measuring 14 cm north- south by 10 cm east-west. It seems certain that these bones were disturbed by plowing and were redeposited downslope by erasion. Burial 4 Burial 4 was found in Unit 34, a hand dug trench, at a depth of 60 cm below the surface. A very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) oval stain was observed at this level with the right half of the skull visible in the western one-quarter of the stain. The grave pit measured 65 cm north-south by 140 cm east-west and was 14 cm deep. All of the fill was saved for flotation except for soil samples collected for pollen analysis. Burial 4 was comprised of the incomplete skeleton of a partially flexed, adult female(?). The skeleton was oriented in an east-west direction with the skull at the west end, facing north. Like Burial 2, many of the bones between the skull and the legs were missing. The bones present in the grave included the cranium, mandible, left and right humerus fragments, right scapula fragment, a few rib fragments, part of the pelvis, femurs, tibias, and fibulas. No grave goods were associated with Burial 4, but a Steiner arrow point was found within the area where the spinal column would have been. The tip of the arrow point was oriented toward the northeast, suggesting that it may have entered the thoracic cavity or vertebrae from the rear. This interpretation is speculative since the arrow point was not imbedded within any bones. It is possible that the point represents the remains of a arrow placed in the grave as an offering. However, no conclusions can be reached due to the deteriorated condition of Burial 4. HUMAN OSTEOLOGY (by Gary Rutenberg) Four human burials were identified at site 41FT161B. Bone preservation was poor in all cases, and the skeletal remains were very fragmentary. Burials 2 and 4 were complete enough to determine burial position, but Burials 1 and 3 consisted of only one or a few skeletal elements. The burials are described individually below. This is followed by a presentation of anthropometrics and a discussion of evidences of pathology. BURIAL DESCRIPTIONS Burial 1 Adult, female(?). This burial was badly disturbed and consisted of fragmentary remains. The gracile nature of the humerus and the other fragmentary long bones suggested the remains were those of a female. Burial 2 Female, 50-60 years. Burial 2 consisted of a poorly preserved individual, semiflexed on the right side, with the head oriented to the north. Considerable inflammation and bone remodeling of cortical and endosteal bone were noted on the right tibia, fibula, and humerus. This suggests osteitis, and possibly osteomyelitis. Burial 3 Adult, female(?7). These remains consisted only of a frontal bone located downslope from Burial 1, The presence of a single parietal fragment in Burial 1 which is of a similar thickness to that of Burial 3, as well as the location of Burial 3 downslope, suggests

Burial 4 Female, 30-40 years. These remains were semiflexed on the left side with hands clasped and placed beneath the head at burial. The head was oriented to the west. The long bones were poorly preserved, but skull preservation was fair. ANTHROPOMETRICS Individual cranial and postcranial anthropometrics were taken where possible (Tabie 3-1). None of the long bones were complete enough to allow stature to be calculated. Nor could cranial indices be calculated for any of the burials. No cranial measurements could be taken for Burial 3 because it was represented by only a frontal bone. Burial 4 had only the right hemisphere of the skull remaining, making cranial metrics impossible. .PATHOLOGY Skeletal Evidence of pathological lesions was infrequent, minor, and probably related to mechanical stress or infection, Progressive osteoarthritis was noted only as minor lesions circumscribing articular surfaces. Burial 2, a 50+ year old woman, exhibited slight lipping on the right mandibular condyle, but no changes in the temperomandibular joint could be found. Burial 2 also showed evidence of periostitis. This consisted of cortical changes (osteitis) in the right tibia, right fibula, femora, and possibly the right humerus. Neoplastic activity on the right tibia occurred largely on its lateral aspect where bone activity was characterized by areas of inferiorly enfolded bone with generalized endostitis occurring throughout the medullary canal. A small circular node (1.2 cm diameter) which may have been active at the time of death occurred several centimeters below the large concentration and enfolded bone. The fibula presented a similar swollen appearance with a possible cloacal opening 0.7 cm wide by 1.3 cm long on the lateral surface of the bone. Volume III, Part One Radiographs showed that the lesion had not penetrated the medullary cavity, but rather that this fossa and the immediate area surrounding it was composed of a slightly less dense bone than the adjacent cortex. Areas of biparietal thinning were found on Burial 2. This was evidenced by a scalloped area towards the posterior portion of both parietals (Brothwell 1965; Ubelaker 1978). The occurrence of this phenomenon is rarely found on individuals younger than age 50; and therefore, when it is present, it is useful as an aid for determining age at death. Dental A moderate degree of dental calculus was found on Burial 2. Burial 4 exhibited a moderate degree of hypoplasia as well as dental calculus. Caries were observed as small defects in the posterior dentition of Burial 4. ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS A tabulation of all artifact classes by their provenience is presented in Appendix F (Table F-2).

Stone tools from site 41FT161B: (a) Alba, (b) Friley, (c) Steiner, (d) Gary, (e) Yarbrough, (f) drill, (g) Bristol biface, (h) aborted biface, late stage. Gary, Regular Variety (20 specimens, Figure 3-6d). These specimens exhibit a rather wide range of morphological variability, but all have triangular blades, contracting stems, and rounded bases. Blade shoulders vary from weakly developed to prominent. Materials: quartzite (17), chert (1), silicified wood (1), Pisgah Ridge chert (1). Proveniences: Surface (2), 8.8, 10.7, 11.5, 14.5, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 15.8 (2), 18.3, 19.5, 22.2, 24.3, 27.3, 29.3, 35.1 (2), 41.1. Gary, Serrated Blade (3 specimens).These are similar to the regular variety of Gary, except that their blade edges are serrated. The blade is distinctly beveled on only one of these specimens. They are somewhat similar to the Neches River, oletha variety as _ defined by Prewitt (1974:67). Materials: quartzite (2), chert (1). Proveniences: 27.5, 28.2, 35.1. Gary, Smatl Variety (1 specimen).This small contracting stemmed point is identical to the regular variety of Gary, except that it is only 2.5 cm in length. Material: chert. Provenience: 15.8. Yarbrough (2 specimens, Figure 3-6e). These specimens exhibit triangular blades, with prominent shoulders. The stem edges expand slightly and the bases are slightly convex. Materials: both are chert. Proveniences: 21.4, 37.3. Untyped, Straight Stem (3 specimens). Two of these specimens have narrow, straight sided stems with convex bases. The distal portion of the blade is missing from one specimen, but the edges that remain are deeply serrated. The third specimen has a broader rectangular stem, and most of its blade is missing. Materials: chert (1), Edwards chert (1), silicified wood (1). Proveniences: 13.4, 15.4, 35.1. Finished Bifaces Drill (1 specimen, Figure 3-6f). This biface is classified as a drill because of its long, narrow blade, the distal tip of which is missing. The lower blade edges and the base are concave in outline. The artifact is made of black Edwards chert, and the workmanship is excellent. It is virtually identical to a specimen recovered from the Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir, and classified by Sorrow (1966:Figure 17a) as a knife. Provenience: 34.1. . Bristal Biface (1 specimen, Figure 3-6g). This specimen is made of quartzite and is broken along one edge. It was originally circular in outline with relatively straight (non-sinuous) edges. Provenience: 19.4. Aborted Bifaces Early Stage (8 specimens). Five specimens are complete; three are broken. Two specimens retain a small amount of cortex on both faces, and appear to have been reduced from relatively flat cobbles. The remaining six may have been reduced from large, thick flakes. Materials: quartzite (6), chert (1), silicified wood (1). Proveniences: 11.5, 15.8, 31.3, 35.1 (3), 42.1, 44.1. Late Stage (6 specimens, Figure 3-6h). Three specimens are complete; one is oval in outline; and two have irregular shapes. One of the broken specimens has a pointed distal tip and convex blade edges. The other is approximately oval, but is missing a portion of one end. Materials: chert (5), silicified wood (1). Proveniences: 10.4, 15.3, 23.4, 24.2, 35.1, 38.2.

22 Arrow Point Preforms (2 specimens). A specimen made of silicified wood is missing its distal tip, and is notched on one side of its base. The other is made on a small quartzite flake that retains its original striking platform. Proveniences: 37.1, 40.1. Biface Fragments Possible Projectile Point Tip Fragments (16 specimens). These are pointed distal fragments of bifacially worked artifacts whose size and configuration indicate that they may have been the broken tips of projectile points. Ten are of dart point size. Materials: quartzite (7), silicified wood (2), chert (1). Proveniences: 15.4, 15.5, 15.8, 19.1, 20.1, 24.4, 27.2, 29.1, 29.1, 31.1, 44.1. Six are of arrow point size. Materials: quartzite (4), chert (2)2. Proveniences: 9.1, 25.2, 29.1, 30.2, 36.1, 36.3. Possible Projectile Point Base Fragments (1 specimen).

Materials: quartzite (13), chert (2). Proveniences: 12.4, 13.1, 15.1, 15.3, 15.4, 15.7, 17.2, 20.1, 20.5, 22.2, 23.3, 24.4 (2), 25.1, 36.3. Steeply Chipped Unifaces End Scraper (1 specimen). This specimen was made on a thick quartzite flake. Only the distal end has been retouched, and the remainder of the flake's dorsal surface retains cortex. The steep, stepped flake scars along the specimen’s distal end form a straight working edge. Provenience: 22.1. Side Scrapers (7 specimens). Only one of these specimens is complete. The other six are proximal, medial, or distal fragments of flakes with steep, stepped retouch along one or more lateral edges. The complete specimen appears to have been reworked from a projectile point and may have been hafted at one time. Although a part of the base is broken, the specimen was side notched, with a slightly concave base. The base and notches have been ground, but this grinding is not present along the reworked blade. One blade edge has been steeply retouched. This complete artifact is made of black Edwards chert. Materials: chert (3), quartzite (2), Edwards chert (2). Proveniences: 15.7, 15.8, 19.1 (2), 20.1, 24.4, 27.2. Scraper on Tabular Piece of Silicified Wood (2 specimens). Each of these specimens has a straight working edge formed by steep unifacial retouch. Proveniences: 15.7, 51.1. Scraper with Graver Spur (1 specimen). This specimen is on the distal end of a broken chert flake. Two flake edges have been steeply retouched, and converge to form a pointed tip, or graver. Provenience: 11.3. Spokeshave with Graver Spur (1 specimen). This specimen is made on a chert flake. Each of its lateral edges possesses a concave notch formed by steep retouch. The graver was formed on the flake's distal end. Provenience: 18.2.

Proveniences: 11.4 (2), 11.5, 15.2, 15.4, 15.8, 19.1, 34.1. Burins (2 specimens). One specimen is made on a quartzite flake. The burin tip was formed by the removal! of part of the original flake edge, the blow having been struck from the flake platform. The second specimen appears to be a burin rejuvenation spall. The burin tip has been worn quite smooth. This specimen is made of black Edwards chert. Proveniences: 29.1, 37.2. Concave Working Edge or Notch (3 specimens). These specimens are smail flakes on which retouch has formed a concave working edge along one lateral margin. Materials: quartzite (2), chert (1). Proveniences: 21.1, 24.2, 24.4.

A small (3 cm in diameter) depression is present in the center of this ground face. : Provenience: 19.1. CERAMICS (by James E. Bruseth) A total of 29 sherds was recovered from excavations at site 41FT161B. Table 3-2 lists proveniences and selected attributes for these sherds (descriptions of the ceramic attributes can be found in Appendix B). The sherds form three categories based on temper. The first category consists of 23 specimens which have a combination of grog, grit, or bone temper and are similar to the utility wares frequently found at most sites within the reservoir. Grog is the most common additive, with grit and bone being less frequent. The paste is generally well mixed, medium to coarse in texture, and slightly porous. Sherd thickness ranges from 4 to 8 mm, with an average of 7.6 mm. Sherd colors for both the interiors and exteriors are shades of brown (10YR5/3, 10YR4/2, 10YR3/2) and gray (1OYR5/1, 10YR4/1). Core colors are generally darker (lOYR3/1, 10YR2/1). Four of the sherds are decorated with fingernail punctations. A petrographic analysis of thin-sectioned samples from three sherds of this group was undertaken to determine if they were manufactured locally or were imported. The results, presented in Appendix C, indicate that all the sherds sampled were made from local clay sources. The second category consists of sandy paste sherds. Four specimens make up this group, all of which are undecorated. These sherds are a very dark gray (10YR3/1), exterior and interior, with a darker core color (10YR2/1). The thickness of the sherds ranges between 5.9 and 7.4 mm, with an average of 6.6 mm. A petrographic analysis of a thin section from one specimen of this category indicates that these sherds are substantially different from the previously discussed temper category. The differences are in the relative amounts of quartz and quartzite clasts, the larger average grain size, and lower percentage of clay matrix as Provenience 3.1 3.2 8.3 9.2 11.5 15.5 19.1 19.2 19.4 22.1 22.2 22.3 22.4 23.1 23.3 24.1244 25.3 28.2 25.1 Fea6 compared with the thin-sectioned specimens from the grog, grit, and bone temper group. A nonlocal origin may account for this difference, as suggested in Appendix C. The third and final category consists of only a single sherd, identified as having “possible” shell temper. If our assessment on this temper type is correct, the shell has leached out and caused the surface to be eroded and pitted. The sherd is 5 mm in thickness and has an interior, exterior, and core color of 1OYR7/2. In conclusion, examples of three separate ceramic traditions are represented at the site. The most abundantly represented tradition is one consisting of grog, grit, and bone tempered sherds. In Chapter 15 we estimate a time frame of A.D. 700 to 1650 for this type. The sand tempered tradition, represented by a fewer number of sherds, is thought to encompass a time span of A.D. 700 to 900. And finally, the possible shell tempered sherd is associated with a time span prior to A.D. 700. Thus, the ceramics suggest several periods of reoccupation of the site during the Late Prehistoric period. Chapter 15 discusses the significance of these traditions with respect to the local archaeology. FAUNAL REMAINS (by Phillip Murry) A substantial amount of faunal material was recovered from site 41FT161B, The highest density of bone was recovered from the southeastern portion of the site, with very little recovered from the northern or western excavation units (Table 3-3). The fauna was dominated by whitetail deer and, to a lesser extent, cottontail rabbit. Other animals occurring less frequently included turtle, fish, snake, bird, and either dog or coyote. Species represented by a single element were raccoon, beaver, opossum, and skunk. Numerous cotton rat and vole elements were recovered, but this does not necessarily indicate that they were part of the prehistoric diet. Rodent disturbance was extensive at the site, and a complete lack of burned elements suggests that their presence may be the result of natural deaths. In summary, site 41FT161B contained a relatively diverse faunal assemblage, with terrestrial, aquatic and avian species represented. Whitetail deer appears to have been the most important species economically, with cottontail rabbit also well represented. All portions of the deer skeleton were present, suggesting transport of entire animals to the site for butchering. Faunal remains were far more frequent in the southeastern portion

MACROBOTANICAL REMAINS (by Gayle J. Fritz) Carbonized plant remains from site 41FT161B were analyzed at the Ethnobotanical Laboratory of the Research Laboratories of Anthropology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The assemblage consisted of eight flotation samples (five light fractions and three heavy fractions) from three features (Features 6 and 7, and Burial 4). The methods of analysis are described below. This is followed by a description of the sample contents. METHODS OF ANALYSIS The contents of each sample were passed through a series of 10 graduated, standard geological sieves, with mesh sizes ranging from 6.4 to 0.2 mm, in order to facilitate sorting. The size groups were examined under a low power (7x to 30x) binocular microscope, and fragments larger than 2.0 mm were sorted and weighed according to category. The weights are recorded in Table 3-4. The smaller size groups were examined for seeds and types of materials not present in the larger fractions. They were not completely sorted, since many fragments smaller than 2.0 mm cannot be identified with enough certainty to justify the time expenditure necessary for such separation. A standard laboratory procedure developed by Yarnell (1974:113-114) involves using the weights of the sorted categories Unit 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 i 1 1 3 59.3 121.2 99.4 67.6 (38 47.7 91 12 62 21.3 112 23 4.2 1.8 larger than 2.0 mm in order to calculate the weight of each type of carbonized material larger than 0.7 mm. This method was not applied to the 41FT161B samples due to the large number of rootlet fragments. The weight of the combined carbonized remains smaller than 2.0 mm but larger than 0.7 mm was not determined, since they could not be efficiently sorted from the uncarbonized matter in the time available. The ratio of carbonized to uncarbonized remains appeared to vary considerably from feature to feature and from size group to size group, making highly questionable the assumption that types of materials were represented in the 0.7 to 2.0 mm fractions in the same proportions as they occurred in the larger sized part of the sample. Five of the samples were analyzed entirely. The other three samples were partially subsampled due to time limitations. These latter were the light fraction samples from Feature 7 and Burial 4. All fragments larger than 1.41 mm were examined, but all materials dropping through the screen with that mesh size were passed through a geological sample splitter in order to obtain two equal subsamples of the smaller size groups. Therefore, only 50% of the smaller sized fragments from these three samples were examined. CONTENTS OF FLOTATION SAMPLES Wood Wood charcoal contributed most of the weight of the carbonized portion of the larger than 2.0 mm fractions, totaling 5.46 g. A much higher proportion of the wood from this site occurred in the heavy fractions (see Table 3-4), probably due to the nature of the soil matrix. a ee

Each of the three features (Burial 4, Feature 6, and Feature 7) contained some pecan and acorn shell fragments. Multiplication of the acorn shell weight by 20 in order to adjust for differential preservation would give acom a higher value than that of hickory. Psoralea Tuber This tuberous material is thought to be Psoralea (prairie turnip). It occurred in all three features from 41FT161B. Psoralea was especially frequent in Feature 6, which contained 0.37 g of the total 0.53 g found in the larger sized part of the 41FT161B samples. Unknowns Unidentified carbonized fragments occurred in all samples, totalling 0.40 g in weight. Pitch The Feature 7 samples included burned bubbly fragments identified as pitch.

Carbonized Seeds One fragment of a large, carbonized seed weighing 0.03 g was present in Feature 6. The specimen somewhat resembles the inner portion of a cucurbit seed. It could possibly have come from a wild Texas gourd (Cucurbita texana) or from a domesticated squash or pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo). Given the tentative status of the identification at this time, however, owing to the absence of the seed coat and the otherwise incomplete nature of the specimen, further discussion would seem unduly speculative. The only other seed which could be identified is a fragmentary trigonous Polygonum sp. from Burial 4. Two entire seeds and six fragments were placed in the “Unidentified Seed" category. Uncarbonized Plant Remains and Nonplant Materials Most of the numerous fresh seeds were smaller than 2.0 mm, and their identification was not part of the present analysis. Genera recognized included Amaranthus, Cassia, Cyperus, Mollugo, and Rudbeckia. Grasses were also represented. DISCUSSION The Psoralea identification, although based on a current consensus among investigators, may be subject to revision as larger collections are recovered or as increased ecological

The Psoralea species with tuberous roots most likely to be present in the Project area based on modem distribution is P. latestipulata Shinners, formally described in 1958 (Shinners 1958:22-23). This endemic species is similar to P. esculenta Pursh, and probably would have been identified as the latter before Shinner's 1951 publication. Since the two species are’ distinguished on the basis of stem, leaf, peduncle, and stipule characters, a species level designation for the archaeological specimens cannot be proposed. The picture of prehistoric plant exploitation at site 41FT161B seems to be one of concentration on nuts (hickory, pecan, and acorn) and roots (Psoralea). No evidence for plant domestication was found. These remains reflect utilization of stream valley taxa (hickory and pecan), as well as upland savannah and prairie plants (acorns and tubers). The samples give no indication of the harvest of starchy seeds from annuals such as goosefoot and knotweed, which are known to have become economically important during the Woodland and Mississippian periods in areas of the Eastern Woodlands. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS The higher densities of faunal remains in the southeastern portion of site 41FT161B have been noted previously. This same general area also contained significantly greater amounts of lithic debris, especially from Units 19, 22, 23, and 28. The temporally diagnostic artifacts (projectile points and ceramics) recovered from units in this area contrast with those from the rest of the site (Table 3-5). Although the sample is small, arrow points actually outnumber dart points in the southeastern units. Within the rest of the site, there were three times as many dart points as arrow points. Even though only eight 1 x 1 m units were excavated in the far southeastern area, more ceramics were recovered from these units than from the remainder of the site excavations, The four sandy Table 3-5 D1AGNostic ARTIFACT COUNTS FOR TWO AREAS OF SITE 41FT161B en Artifact Southeastern Units!

These differences suggest that the higher densities of lithic debris and faunal remains in the southeastern part of the site may be related to a somewhat later period of occupation. No consistent patterning could be demonstrated in regard to the vertical distribution of temporally diagnostic artifacts. Vertical mixing of the site deposit is suggested by the distribution of arrow points, dart points, and ceramics in almost all excavation units. Only within the adjacent Units 10 and 15 did arrow points and ceramics tend to occur above dart points, although there was some overlap in their distributions (Table 3-6). Arrow points and ceramics were the only temporal diagnostics recovered from the upper 40 cm of these units. A mixture of dart points, arrow points, and ceramics was found in the 40-60 cm levels. Below 60 cm, dart points were the only diagnostics recovered. Unfortunately, this was the only instance in which even a partial vertical separation of these artifacts could be defined. INTERPRETATIONS The diagnostic artifacts recovered from the 1981 test excavations had suggested occupations during both the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. It was hoped that the approximately 1 m deep deposit might exhibit vertical separation between these temporal components. Instead, vertical mixing of the site deposit was indicated by the distribution of arrow points, dart points, and ceramics in almost all of the excavation units.

STIC 41 FTI1I6IB The identification of a Late Archaic component was based on the assumption that Gary dart points date to that period. However, the results of investigations at sites 41NV182 (Chapter 12) and 41FT201 (Volume II) have provided good evidence for the continued use of Gary dart points well into the Late Prehistoric period. Considering this, it may be that the vast majority of material recovered from site 41FT161B actually dates to the Late Prehistoric period, although the Yarbrough and possibly the Dawson specimens still suggest some Late Archaic activity. In fact, the overall assemblage from site 41FT161B resembles most closely that from 41NV182. Radiocarbon dates from the latter site indicate that the major occupation there occurred between A.D. 600 and A.D. 900. Assemblage similarities include the apparent association of dart points (primarily Gary) and arrow points, and relatively low densities of ceramics. One similar aspect of the ceramic assemblages from both sites is the occurrence of coarse-grained, sandy paste pottery. Sandy paste ceramics are thought to predate Caddoan style ceramics over much of the central and southern portions of East Texas (Shafer 1975; Story 1981), and presumably in the Project area as well. Sandy paste sherds accounted for a higher percentage of the ceramic assemblages from sites 41FT161B (13%) and 41NV182 (11%) than from any of the other excavated sites in the Project area. The spatial distribution of diagnostic artifacts suggests that the higher densities of faunal remains and lithic debris in the / southeastern portion of the site may relate to a somewhat later occupation than that which produced the features and materials in the north central area, What may be represented at the site is a number of individual occupations during the period from A.D. 27 600-900, and perhaps even later. Shifts in the locational focus of occupation through time could explain the relatively greater representation of ceramics and arrow points, and proportionately fewer dart points, in the southeastern area. The fact that Perdiz arrow points and engraved ceramics, which were present in contexts postdating A.D. 1200 at sites 41FT201 and 41NV173 were not recovered from 41FT161B suggests a lack of occupation after A.D. 1200. The subsistence economy at site 41FT161B was based on the exploitation of a variety of wild plant and animal species. Plant exploitation seems to have concentrated on nuts (hickory, pecan, and acorn) and roots (Psoralea), No evidence for plant domestication was found. A variety of animals was also exploited, with terrestrial, aquatic, and avian species being represented in the faunal assemblage. Whitetail deer appears to have been the most important, with cottontail rabbit also well represented. The presence of pit features and burials suggests that 41FT161B functioned as a habitation site. However, the lack of evidence for permanent structures suggests that the inhabitants were not sedentary. In comparison to site 41NV182, which is thought to have been occupied contemporaneously, site 41FT161B contained both relatively fewer and relatively smaller features. Although both sites contained burials, 41FT161B lacked the large pits filled with fire cracked rock which were found at 41NV182. Of the two sites, it would seem that 41FT161B was occupied less intensively. However, because road construction had destroyed an unknown portion of site 41FT161B prior to investigation, the true extent and nature of occupation at that site may not be represented fully.

EXCAVATIONS AT 41FT193, THE PERRY SITE by Daniel E. McGregor and Jeffery Bohlin, with contributions by James E. Bruseth, Gayle J. Fritz, Richard Fullington, Holly Hathaway, Phillip Murry, and David R. Pheasant ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Site 41FT193 is located within the alluvial floodplain deposits that form the south bank of the present channel of Richland Creek. The floodplain surrounding the site was heavily forested prior to recent clearing associated with reservoir construction. The steep bank of the present channel exposes approximately six vertical meters of floodplain stratigraphy. A general series of depositional zones has been identified for the floodplains of both Richland and Chambers Creeks (Pheasant 1982a), the most outstanding feature of which is a layer of dense black vertic clay sandwiched between a brown clay layer below and a sandy clay layer above. Although this basic stratigraphy is present at 41FT193, it is somewhat more complex with three additional dark clay strata present below the dense black clay layer. SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS Site 41FT193 was discovered during the 1980 survey. Test excavations were conducted at the site during the 1980-81 field season (McGregor et al. 1982:32). Three small hearths associated with the lower, dark clay stratum were exposed and excavated. At the same vertical level as these hearths, and in the same stratum, a discontinuous lens of mussel shell was exposed in the creek bank over a distance of approximately 40 m. A contracting stem dart point (Gary type) was recovered from this shell lens. Carbonized nutshell samples from two of the excavated hearths yielded radiocarbon dates of A.D. 170 + 70 and A.D. 320 + 150 (McGregor et al. 1982:32). A backhoe trench excavated into the creek bank exposed limited amounts of mussel shell and animal bone within the dense black clay zone as well. Although no diagnostic artifacts were observed in the trench profiles, these faunal materials were thought to indicate human occupation at the site during the time period when the dense black clay zone was deposited. 29 Based upon the testing results, site 41FT193 appeared to be a creekside locale which had been occupied occasionally Over a considerable period of time. The relatively frequent flooding of this locale and the aggrading nature of the site deposit suggested that vertically stratified remains of short term occupations would be preserved. The intact features and associated artifacts encountered during testing indicated that further excavation would be useful for constructing a well-dated artifact chronology for the Project area. In addition, the recovery of datable materials from the dense black clay zone was considered to be essential for studies of floodplain geology and paleoenvironmental reconstruction (Raab et al. 1982:206-207), For these reasons, additional work at site 41FT193 was recommended. EXCAVATION STRATEGY When site 41FT193 was revisited in October 1983, it was apparent that further erosion of the creek bank had occurred since the test excavations. Four additional hearths were observed in the bank. Two of these were within the lower dark clay stratum, and two were below it. Of greater importance, however, was the fact that additional material was now visible in the dense black clay zone. This included mussel shell, animal bone, and a few pieces of lithic debris. - To aid in planning the excavations, 10 stratigraphic profiles were exposed by shovel scraping the vertical face of the creek bank from the top of the bank to the creek level. These profiles were about 50 cm wide and were placed at 5 m intervals. The four hearths and several small lenses of mussel shell located between these profiles also were exposed. A permanent datum was established on the surface, some 15 m south of the bank. A transit was used to determine the relative elevations of the exposed geological strata, hearths, and lenses of occupational debris. Evidences of occupation were all located between 2.3 m and 4.4 m below datum. It was decided that the upper 2 m of overburden could be removed mechanically. This 2 m deposit included all soils above

This is the area located between Trenches | and 3 in Figure 4-1. It was planned originally to remove 2 m of overburden from an area west of Trench 1 as well. Bulldozer work in that part of the site was stopped when a concentration of mussel shell was encountered at a depth of 1.3 m below datum. The location of this mussel shell concentration is shown in Figure 4-1 as the area labeled Occupation Level 1 (O.L. 1). These materials were further exposed by hand excavations, and no additional stripping was conducted in that portion of the site. A site grid oriented 9°30' west of magnetic North was established, conforming to the orientation of the creek bank. Three backhoe trenches were excavated into the site deposit from the scraped surface 2 m below datum, and the trench walls were cleaned and profiled. On the basis of these profiles it was decided to concentrate the excavations in the area between Trenches 1 and 2, since Trench 3 revealed no evidence of occupation. However, the later deepening of Trench 3 to provide a section for soil description exposed a large hearth area (Feature 401) in association with the lower dark clay stratum. In the area between Trenches 1 and 2 the final 30 cm of overburden was removed using a small tractor equipped with backhoe and loader bucket. A series of 50 x 50 cm units was laid out and excavation began at 230 cm below site datum. The first level of excavation was 20 cm thick (230-250 cm below datum), while all subsequent levels were 10 cm. A sample of fill (10 1) was collected from each level of every unit and water-screened through 1/16 in (1.4 mm) mesh. The remaining fill was water- screened through 1/4 in (6.4 mm) mesh. Forty-five 50 x 50 cm units were excavated to a depth of 260 cm below site datum (Figure 4-2).When these were completed, the unexcavated area between the units was mechanically stripped to the 260 cm surface. Levels 3 through 6 (260-300 cm below datum) were excavated in only 19 of the 50 x 50 cm units (Figure 4-2), The site was revisited during Season IV, and this same area was mechanically stripped to 300 cm below datum. Levels 7 through 10 (300-340 cm below datum) were then excavated in 17 of the 50 x 50 cm units (see Figure 4-2). In most of these units, level 10 corresponded to the top of the lower dark clay stratum and contained large amounts of mussel shell. Because the elevation of this stratum was slightly lower in Units 2016, 2104, and 2192, an eleventh level (340-350 cm below datum) was excavated in each of these units. ; It had been planned to continue excavations to at least 400 cm below datum in these 17 units, and in Unit 2452 as well. However, frequent inundation of the site made it inaccessible during much of Season 1V, Levels 7 through 10 were never excavated for Unit 2452, and none of the units were extended below 350 cm. In order to obtain additional dates from the dense black clay zone, mechanical excavations were conducted in the area between Trenches 2 and 3. A backhoe was used to strip the black clay deposit from an area measuring 8 x 10 m, When a feature was encountered, machine excavation was halted. The feature and surrounding area were exposed by hand excavation. A plan sketch was drawn, and the elevation of the feature was taken using a transit and stadia rod. The feature was cross-sectioned, and a sample of the fill was collected for flotation. Six features were discovered and excavated in this manner (Figure 4-3). During September, 1985 the Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement District No. 1 provided a dragline and operator, allowing a final phase of investigation at Site 41FT193. An area measuring about 4 x 8 m was excavated between Trenches 2 and 3 (Figure 4-1) to a maximum depth of 615 cm below datum. Five additional stratigraphic/soil zones were identified in the north wall profile of this dragline cut, and soil samples were collected from each of these. One additional feature was discovered during this operation, and a datable charcoal sample was collected from it. All phases of field work at site 41FT193 required a total of 137 person-days to complete. ee ee om QSeeree FRGTEE

Pheasant) Two stratigraphic/soil sections were recorded at site 41FT193. A third section was exposed by the dragline excavation, and is described in a later section of this site report. Section One extends from the surface to a depth of 253 cm, The surface at this location was 10 cm below site datum. The description for Section One was taken from the south wall of the bulldozed area. Its location is shown in Figure 4-1. Section Two was several meters away from Section One, and the description was taken from the east wall of Backhoe Trench 3. The description of Section Two starts at 225 cm below datum and has a depth of 202 cm. Unit V is at the base of Section One but at the top of Section Two. The top of Unit V at Section Two is 10 cm lower than it is at Section One. A composite profile of these sections is shown in Figure 4-4. The full field descriptions are given below.

It is labeled as if it were continuous with that horizon and describes the same stratigraphic/soil unit as VA1b. The top of Section Two was measured to be 10 cm below the top of VAIb in Section One. VAlb 0-109 cm Black (10YR3/1) clay; very coarse angular block peds when dry; slickensides; very sticky and very plastic when wet; occasional stones and granules; few calcareous nodules (less than 3 mm in diameter); common fine, faint, yellowish red (SYR5/8) mottles; clear and wavy boundary. VICIb 109-176cm Dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) silty clay; tendency for coarse angular block peds to form on drying; slickensides; few stones, occasional granule; few calcareous shell fragments (less than 2 cm in diameter) near the top of the horizon; common fine calcareous nodules (less than 5 mm in diameter); common fine, faint, reddish yellow (SYR6/8) mottles; clear and smooth boundary. VIC2b 176-202cm Dark gray (10YR4/1) and dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) silty clay; very fine . subangular blocky peds; sticky and plastic when wet; there is a gritty feel to the matrix due to charcoal and shell fragments; common coarse calcareous shell fragments (less than 2 cm in diameter); abundant black charcoal fragments (less than 2 cm in diameter); horizon is a prehistoric hearth zone and the charcoal and shell fragments are associated with the hearth; boundary at the base is the floor of the trench. STRATIGRAPHY Five disconformities were recognized in the parent material which separate six stratigraphic units. From oldest to youngest the units consist of silty clay (VI), clay (V), clay (IV), very fine sandy clay loam (11), silty clay (I), and sandy clay loam (I). The uppermost unit retains its original alluvial structure and is known to have formed during historic times. Units IV and V both consist of clay, although Unit V is blacker and denser with well-developed slickensides. Unit V is 109 cm thick in Section Two and is bounded top and base by clear boundaries (i.e., less than 5 cm wide). The underlying silty clay Unit VI is easily distinguished; the basal part of Unit VI contains a prehistoric hearth. Volume III, Part One SOILS The present floodplain soil is 77 cm deep and lies within the historic alluvial material of Unit I. There are A and C horizons. An upper buried soil, the Chambers paleosol, extends from the top of Unit II to the base of Unit IV encompassing three stratigraphic units. It is possible that Unit IV is a separate paleosol. Calcareous shell fragments occur throughout the upper portion of this paleosol, and smal! calcareous nodules occur in the [IC1b horizon and below. The nodules and iron mottles indicate groundwater modifications of the paleosol. A lower buried soil, the Navarro paleosol, starts with the top of Unit V, 2 m below the floodplain surface. The upper meter of this paleosol is the dense black clay; it is vertic, with slickensides, but there is no obvious descent of overlying material into the cracks. Because it was so clayey (estimated 60-70% clay), it was impossible to make a field judgment as to whether significant clay alluviation had taken place. Thus, it is difficult to estimate the length of time that this soil took to form. The lower part of this paleosol coincides with Unit VI; this horizon is highly calcareous and very mottled, suggesting that it has been modified by groundwater action. A prehistoric hearth was found in horizon VIC2b, suggesting that the alluvial material that forms these lower horizons aggraded slowly. PROFILE EXTENSION Section Three Section Three represents a continuation of the site's stratigraphic/soil profile. It was taken from the north wall of the dragline cut, and was located approximately 4 m west of Section Two. At this location Horizon VIC2b measured 27 cm in thickness, and the remainder of the section below this horizon was designated Stratigraphic Unit VU. Unit VI was divided into five soil horizons on the basis of changes in texture and color (Figure 4-4). Three of these (Horizons VIIC3b, VIICSb, and VIIC7b) were very similar to Horizon VIC1b, being composed of dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) silty clay. Interdigitated between these were two noticeably darker zones (Horizons VIIC4b and VIIC6b) composed of dark gray (LOYR4/1) clay. Horizons VIIC4b and VIIC6b were 29 cm and 30 cm thick, respectively, and were quite similar to Horizon VIC2b. STRATIGRAPHIC CORRELATIONS The profiles of the three backhoe trenches (Figures 4-5, 4-6, and 4-7) were recorded following the removal of the upper 2 m of deposit. The description of Section Two was taken from the east wall of Trench 3 (see Figure 4-7). Although the stratigraphy is essentially the same for all three trenches, some variability does exist. In Trench 3, the dense black clay zone (Unit V in the profile description) begins at a slightly lower elevation (225 cm below datum) and is considerably thicker (109 cm) than is the case for the other two trenches. This difference must be considered in relating the radiocarbon date from Feature 401 in Trench 3 to those that were obtained from excavations in the western part of the site. DATING THE DEPOSIT A series of 12 radiocarbon dates from site 41FT193 has provided good temporal control for the upper 5 m of the site deposit (Figure 4-8). The dates range from ca. 170 B.C. to the nineteenth century A.D. Prior to the Season III excavations, it had been thought that the approximately 2 m of deposits overlying the dense black clay zone (stratigraphic Unit V) were quite recent, dating to the historic period. The discovery of apparently

The lithic debris and mussel shells from Occupation Level (O.L.) 1 appear to be in situ and not the result of redeposition. If the date of A.D. 1820 + 50 (Beta 8493) from a hearth (Feature 201) in the underlying black clay is accepted, then O.L. 1 must date later than this. Just how much later is uncertain, but it seems likely that the upper 2 m of deposit at site 41FT193 date to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries A.D. _Six radiocarbon dates have been obtained on materials recovered from the dense black clay zone (Unit V). Two of these were from near the top of this unit and were quite recent. The A.D. 1820 + 50 date has been mentioned already. It was from Feature 201, a small hearth that was visible on the scraped 230 cm below datum surface prior to the beginning of the 50 x 50 cm unit excavations. The feature was not seen at the 200 cm below datum surface, so it could have originated from anywhere between 200 cm and 230 cm below datum. A date of A.D. 1720 + 80 (Beta 11184) was from another hearth (Feature 203) which had an upper elevation of 230 cm below datum. The top of Unit V was about 10 cm lower in elevation in this part of the site, and Feature 203 was therefore only 20 cm beneath the top of this zone. A third hearth (Feature 202) was only slightly lower in elevation than Features 201 and 203, but dated some 550-650 years earlier. Charcoal from Feature 202 yielded a date of A.D. 1170 + 150 (Beta 8301). The top of this hearth was measured at 233 cm below datum. It would appear that very little alluviation occurred during the intervening 550-650 years. Three dates were recovered from the lower half of Unit V. Feature 208 was a large concentration of charred nutshell located at the very bottom of this zone, and 284 cm below datum.

D. 670 + 60 (Beta 11186). The second date was on charcoal from a hearth (Feature 204) that dated to A.D. 800 + 100 (Beta 11185). The top of Feature 204 was 258 cm below datum, and was between 20 cm and 25 cm above the bottom of Unit V. The third date was A.D. 590 + 90 (Beta 9065), and it seems to be out of sequence with the previous two. It was obtained on carbonized nutshell recovered from a 50 x 50 cm unit (Unit 2012) at a depth of 245-250 cm below datum. The provenience of this sample was approximately 25 cm to 30 cm above the bottom of Unit V in this part of the site. This sample dated earlier than both Feature 204 and Feature 208, even though it was recovered from above them stratigraphically. The A.D. 590 +90 date is considered less reliable because the dated material was not recovered from a definable feature. As will be discussed in a later section of this report, this date is also earlier than the accepted time range of the diagnostic artifacts that were recovered from the same stratigraphic context. Two radiocarbon dates were obtained from the upper horizon of Stratigraphic Unit VI (Soil Horizon VICIb), the grayish brown silty clay located immediately below Unit V. Charcoal from a depth of 287 cm in a 50 x 50 cm unit (Unit 2096) was dated at A.D. 320 + 110 (Beta 9066). This was approximately 10-15 cm below the bottom of Unit V in this part of the site. The second date from this horizon was A.D. 300 + 60 (Beta 10830). This sample was from Feature 301, a concentration of charred nutshell that was located between 315 and 320 cm below datum. The lower horizon of Stratigraphic Unit VI (Soil Horizon VIC2b) has been termed the lower dark clay stratum in this site report. Three features located in this stratum have been dated. Carbonized nutshell collected from a large hearth (Feature 401) exposed in Trench 3 yielded a date of A.D. 190 + 70 (Beta 8839). The top of this feature was 401 cm below datum, and 67 below the bottom of Unit V (see Figure 4-7). As was noted previously, Unit V begins at a lower elevation (225 cm below datum) and is considerably thicker (109 cm) in Trench 3 than was the case for the western part of the site. Although the upper surface of Soil Horizon VIC2b was encountered between 330 cm and 340 cm in the 50 x 50 cm units, this was equivalent stratigraphically to the 401 cm below datum depth in Trench 3. Two additional radiocarbon dates were obtained from hearths associated with this lower dark clay stratum during the test excavations at site 41FT193. These dates were A.D. 170 + 70 and A.D. 320 + 150 (McGregor et al. 1982:32). The earliest radiocarbon date from site 41FT193 was on charcoal from a small hearth (Feature 501) associated with Soil Horizon VIIC4b. This hearth was located 501 cm below datum and was dated at 170 + 120 B.C. (Beta 14080). The radiocarbon dates indicate that the upper 5 m of alluvial deposits at site 41FT193 aggraded between approximately 170 B.C. and the present. With one exception, the 12 dates are internally consistent and provide the basis for the following conclusions: (1) Archaeological remains associated with the lower dark clay stratum (horizon VIC2b) date to around A.D. 200. (2) Deposition of the dense black clay zone (Unit V) seems to have begun around A.D. 600, and to have continued until after A.D. 1820 + 50. The rate of deposition appears to have slowed significantly after about A.D. 1170 + 150. (3) The 2 m of deposit located above the dense black clay zone were laid down fairly recently, most likely during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries A.D.

38 ARCHAEOMAGNETIC SAMPLING In addition to radiocarbon dating, samples for archaeomagnetic dating also were collected. It was anticipated that this technique might allow the dating of hearths that lacked sufficient charcoal for radiocarbon assay. In addition, the collection of samples would contribute towards establishing an archaeomagnetism curve for the Souther Plains. Presently curves from other areas are used to extrapolate for much of Texas (Holly Hathaway, personal communication 1983). Feature 201, a hearth, was sampled first, since it had sufficient charcoal for a radiocarbon date and this date would serve as a corroboration to the archaecomagnetic determination. Twelve samples were collected with nonmagnetic, one inch cubes in accordance with the methods prescribed by the Archaeomagnetic Laboratory, Colorado State University (Eighmy 1980). The field collection was undertaken by James Bruseth, who had received training in field extraction techniques by Holly Hathaway of the Archaeomagnetic Laboratory. Samples were collected from the oxidized clay in and around the hearth, whenever suitably fired soils could be found. The sampling was undertaken in two episodes. Eight cubes were initially collected, and approximately one month later four additional cubes were collected. Results (by Holly Hathaway) The individual archacomagnetic laboratory report on Sample 1 is provided in Appendix E. The reported paleopole position is based on 6 of 12 specimens recovered in the field. A distinct difference was noted between the remanent directions of the specimens collected during the first session (December 12 and 13, 1983) and those recovered approximately one month later (January 1984); the difference in NRM specimen directions is presented in Table 4-1. Based on these differences, it is possible that movement of the matrix occurred some time in the past (possibly during the hiatus between collection sessions). Intense weather conditions (e.g., heavy rains) could have caused slumpage in the material, or if very soggy when collected, this may have resulted in an instability of the matrix. It is feasible that the difference in remanent directions is real, and the two groups represent different firing occurrences. This possibility, however, should be backed with archaeological evidence and no difference is noted in the field report for the sample. The intensities recorded for each of the 12 specimens were also quite variable for being from a single feature; differences up to two magnitudes were noted between some specimens. This would seem to indicate either different mineralogy among spatially close material (unlikely) or uneven heating of the matrix resulting in “hot spots" about the feature(s). The paleopole plot of Sample 1 does not fall near known portions of the Southwest Master Curve (A.D. 700 to A.D. 1425). Although samples from Arkansas (Wolfman 1979) generally are consistent with the Southwest Curve, the inconsistency of the plot of Sample 1 with the expected archaeological date may represent regional differences in the past, apparent, geomagnetic pole position. Interpretations (by James E. Bruseth) The poor results of the archaeomagnetic dating of Feature 201 necessitated a review of plans for collecting samples from other hearths at the site. The most probable cause of the unusual plot of Sample 1 is the vertisolic nature of the clay soils along Richland Creek. These soils have a very high shrink-swell potential, and soil cracking undoubtedly has occurred in the past.

Since other features at the site were in the same soil and would have this potential disturbance also, plans were discontinued for archaeomagnetic sampling of other hearths. FEATURES Twelve features were investigated during the excavation of site 41FT193. Their numerical designations reflect, in part, their depth below datum. The features located between 200 cm and 299 cm below datum were assigned numbers 201 through 208. Two features (Features 301 and 302) were located between 300 cm and 399 cm below datum. Feature 401 was the only excavated feature between 400 cm and 499 cm below datum, and Feature 501 was the only feature found lower than 500 cm. Three different types of features were recognized. Seven of these were small areas of burned clay and charcoal that appear to be the remains of short term hearths. Four other features consisted of concentrations of carbonized nutshell. The lack of oxidized clay within these concentrations indicates that they were not bumed in situ. Feature 401 was the only example of a third feature type. This was a large hearth containing ash, charcoal, carbonized nutshell, and both burned and unburned faunal remains. The features are described individually below. FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS Feature 201 This feature was first observed in the scraped 230 cm surface. Stripping of the final 30 cm of overburden had removed an undetermined amount of the upper portion of the feature. The profile of Feature 201 is shown in Figure 4-9. The feature appeared as an area of slightly lighter soil with orange, oxidized (burned) clay inclusions against the surrounding black clay matrix. The feature was roughly circular in plan, measuring 20 cm long by 17 cm wide. The profile had an irregular basin shape and a maximum depth of 12 cm below the 230 cm surface. The charcoal sample from this feature was dated to A.D. 1820 + 50. Twelve samples of the oxidized clay were collected for archaeomagnetic dating, and the results are discussed in the preceding section of this chapter. aan ® wm a

The profile was woughly basin-shaped. Maximum dimensions were 70 cm long, 65 @m wide, and 20 cm deep. Charcoal from this feature yielded a date of A.D. 1170+ 150. Feature 203 This was a roughly circular area of bumed clay and charcoal fthat measured approximately 50 cm in diameter. It had an Mregular, basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 23 cm. ; The top of this feature was 230 cm below datum. Charcoal from } this feature dated to A.D. 1720 + 80. Feature 204 This was an area of burned clay and charcoal that was roughly oval in outline, measuring 70 cm long and 55 cm wide. The profile was basin-shaped with a maximum depth of 15 cm. The top of this feature was 258 cm below datum. A sample of the charcoal collected from the feature fill yielded a date of A.D. 800 + 100. Feature 205 This feature consisted of a concentration of carbonized nutshell | within an area measuring approximately 75 cm in diameter and ‘ fess than 5 cm deep. The top of this feature was 259 cm below t datum. The fact that the clay matrix in and around this feature was not oxidized suggests that burning of the nutshell did not occur at this location. This also was true for the three other charred nutshell concentrations (Features 208, 301, and 302), Feature 206 This area of burned clay and charcoal was circular in plan and | measured 35 cm in diameter. It had a relatively deep, basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 23 cm. The top of this feature was 268 cm below datum. Feature 207 This was a small, circular area of burned clay with limited amounts of charcoal. It was about 20 cm in diameter and had a 39 maximum depth of 7 cm. The entire contents of this small feature were collected for flotation, but were not processed. The top of this feature was 291 cm below datum. Feature 208 This was a very dense concentration of carbonized nutshell contained within an area measuring about 1 m in diameter and 5 cm deep. The top of this feature was 284 cm below datum. The clay matrix in and around this feature showed no evidence of in situ burning. A sample of carbonized nutshell yielded a date of A.D. 670 + 60. Feature 301 This feature was only partially exposed at a depth of 315 cm below datum in Unit 2368. Carbonized nutshell was present throughout this 50 x 50 cm unit at that depth and extended to 320 cm. The areal extent of this concentration of carbonized nutshell is not known. A sample of this material was dated to A. D. 300 + 60. Feature 302 This concentration of carbonized nutshell was present throughout all but the southeastern comer of Unit 2456 at a depth of between 310 and 325 cm below datum. The nutshell was confined to a3 cm thick band that sloped downward from south to north. Unlike-the other carbonized nutshell concentrations at site 41FT193, Feature 302 did contain a small amount of burned clay within its fill. However, the limited amount of burned clay and the lack of oxidation of the surrounding silty clay matrix indicate that the nutshell was not burned at this location. This and the other carbonized nutshell concentrations at site 41FT193 appear to be refuse deposits. Feature 401 This feature was observed only in partial cross section, so its description is necessarily incomplete. It was defined as an area containing large amounts of ash and charcoal. Although a complete cross section was not exposed, the feature appears to have had a basin-shaped profile (see Figure 4-7). The exposed portion was over 1 m long and had a maximum depth of about 15 cm. The top of this feature was 401 cm below datum. This apparent hearth area contained both burned and unburned bone, mussel shell, wood charcoal, and carbonized nutshell. A 24 1 sample of the fill was collected for flotation.

It had been partially destroyed prior to investigation. The undisturbed portion measured about 30 cm across where it was exposed in profile, and was 18 cm in maximum thickness. The top of this feature was 501 cm below datum and the massive amount of overburden prevented its exposure in plan view. A charcoal sample collected from the feature fill was dated to 170 + 120 B.C. (Beta 14080). FEATURE CONTENTS Flotation samples were processed and analyzed for 10 of the 12 excavated features, excluding Features 207 and 501. The faunal and macrobotanical remains from these features are discussed in greater detail in later sections of this site report. The samples contained very few artifacts aside from lithic debris and plant and animal remains (Table 4-2). The only tools consisted of four, marginally modified unifaces: two from Feature 206 and one each from Features 202 and 204. The amount of soil floated varied considerably between features. To facilitate comparisons, the data in Table 4-2 were converted to frequencies and weights per 100 | of feature fill (Table 4-3). The most obvious differences relate to the criteria used in defining the feature types. The weights of nutshell fragments are consistently high for the carbonized nutshell concentrations. Similarly, burned clay was most common in the fill of the small hearths, since these were defined by the presence of burned clay and charcoal. Feature 401, the large hearth, contained the widest variety of material, with significant amounts of mussel shell, carbonized nutshell, and animal bone. Much of the mussel shell and all of the bone in this flotation sample was bumed. Three species of bivalves were identified, along with elements of fish and turtle. The carbonized nutshell concentrations contained no animal bone, and of these four features, only Feature 302 contained a significant amount of shell, although none of it was identifiable. Faunal remains were relatively more common in the small hearths, but their density varied considerably. In general, feature contents were quite limited. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered from any of the features. The most informative materials were the macrobotanical remains, which are discussed in detail in a later section of this report. ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS A complete tabulation of all artifact classes and their provenience is presented in Appendix F (Table F-3). The lithic Volume Ill, Part One tools, ceramics, and bone tools are described below. The provenience designations that follow the descriptions present the unit number first, followed by the level number (e.g., 2364.1). The locations of these units are shown in Figure 4-2. The level numbers represent the following depths below datum: level 1 (230-250 cm), level 2 (250-260 cm), level 3 (260-270 cm), level 4 (270-280 cm), level 5 (280-290 cm), level 6 (290-300 cm), level 7 (300-310 cm), level 8 (310-320 cm), level 9 (320-330 cm), level 10 (330-340 cm), level 11 (340-350 cm). The specimens whose proveniences consist of North and East coordinates and depth below datum (e.g., 107.5N, 94E, 285 cm) were discovered and mapped in situ during the mechanized excavations. LITHIC TOOLS Arrow Points Cliffton (1 specimen, Figure 4-11a). Much of the broad blade of this chert specimen is missing. The shoulders are prominent but not barbed. The short contracting stem has a pointed base. Provenience: 2364.1. Perdiz (3 specimens, Figure 4-11b,c). These chert specimens all have triangular blades with well-barbed shoulders. The base is missing on one specimen. The other two have contracting stems with slightly rounded bases. These same two specimens are missing their distal tips. Proveniences: 2142.2, 2277.1, 2456.2. Scallorn (1 specimen, Figure 4-114). This well made specimen is comer notched with a rather broad, expanding stem and straight base. The triangular blade has straight edges, and one of the barbed shoulders is missing. Material: chert. Provenience: 2104.3. Steiner (1 specimen, Figure 4-11e). This quartzite specimen was typed on the basis of its narrow, serrated blade. The stem is poorly developed and retains an area of cortex. Provenience: 2450.1. Untyped, Fragmentary (3 specimens). These specimens are the blade portions of arrow points, but are missing their stems. Two have serrated blades and may be assignable to the Steiner type. The third cannot be typed.

41FTI93 cm Figure 4-11. Artifacts from site 41FT193: (a) Cliffton, (b,c) Perdiz, (d) Scallorn, (e) Steiner, (f) Gary, small variety, (g) Gary, serrated blade, (h,i) untyped, straight stem, (j) Gary, regular variety, (k) drill/awl, (l,m) knives, (n) ceramic sherd with punctations. Dart Points Gary, Regular Variety (1 specimen, Figure 4-11j). This quartzite specimen has a triangular blade with prominent shoulders, and a contracting stem with rounded base. It was Tecovered during test excavations from a shell lens associated with the lower dark clay stratum (Horizon VIC2b), Gary, Serrated Blade (2 specimens, Figure 4-11g). These specimens are similar to the regular variety except that the blade edges are serrated. One specimen has been broken longitudinally, but the other is complete. The blades of both specimens are beveled on the right hand side. The stems are slightly contracting with rounded bases. These points are somewhat similar to the Neches River, oletha variety defined by Prewitt (1974:67). Materials: chert (1), quartzite (1). Proveniences: 2382.4, (107.5N, 94E, 285 cm). Gary, Smail Variety (1 specimen, Figure 4-11f). This specimen is similar to the regular variety of Gary except for its small size. It measures 2.8 cm in length. The occurrence of this specimen stratigraphically above the larger Gary point suggests that the small variety may date somewhat later in time. Material:quartzite (1). Provenience: 2456.5. Untyped, Straight Stem (2 specimens, Figure 4-11h,i). These specimens are characterized by their rectangular shaped stems and slightly convex bases. The shoulders on one specimen are weakly developed. The second specimen had prominent and perhaps barbed shoulders, but these have been broken. The base of this second specimen is formed by cortex. Materials: chert (1), quartzite (1). Proveniences: 2360.8, (105N, 96E, 282 cm). Finished Bifaces Bristal Bifaces (4 specimens). These are bifacially worked artifacts with subcircular outlines and relatively nonsinuous edges. The single silicified wood specimen differs from the others in being considerably large, and retains some cortex on both faces. Materials: chert (1), quartzite (2), silicified wood (1). Proveniences: 2192.11, 2278.2, 2322.2, 2356.2. Drillf/Awls (2 specimens, Figure 4-11k). These specimens are characterized by their long, narrow, bifacially worked blades. One specimen is broken and consists of only the blade portion. The other specimen is complete, and its base is the unworked platform of the flake on which it was made. Materials: chert (2). Proveniences: 2193.3, (LO9N, 100.7E, 234 cm). Knives (2 specimens, Figure 4-111,m). These complete specimens are leaf-shaped in outline, with rounded proximal ends and pointed distal ends. The chert specimen is much wider and exhibits only unifacial flaking along a portion of one lateral edge. Materials: chert (1), quartzite (1). Proveniences: 2276.6, 2320.2. Aborted Bifaces Late Stage (1 specimen). This quartzite specimen has a roughly oval outline. Its edges are fairly straight, but they lack consistent evidence of secondary retouch. A smail area of cortex remains on one end of the specimen. Provenience: 2104.6. Biface Fragments Possible Arrow Point Tip Fragments (5 specimens). The size and configuration of these bifacially worked specimens

These specimens are fragments of bone and antler that appear to have been worked. The first specimen is a piece of long bone, 33 mm long and 7 mm wide, that is highly polished and appears to be beveled along portions of the longitudinal edges and on one end. Provenience: 2364.6. The second specimen is a distal antler fragment. It tapers to a blunt point and shows evidence of wear at that end. Provenience: 2382.5. CERAMICS (by James E. Bruseth) A total of 22 sherds was recovered from site 41FT193. Table 4-4 lists the proveniences and selected attributes for these sherds. Despite the fact that the sherds were recovered from several vertical and horizontal proveniences, they all belong to the grog, grit, and bone temper ceramic tradition defined for the reservoir area in Chapter 15, Paste textures are medium to coarse, and all but three sherds are undecorated. The three decorated sherds are punctated with a pointed tool (Figure 4.11n). Interior and exterior colors are shades of brown and gray (10YR5/2, 10YR6/4) with core colors slightly darker (1OYR4/1). Sherd thickness ranges from 4.6 to 10.0 mm, with an average of 7.2 mm. The interpretations of the ceramics from the site are limited because of the small sample size. Nonetheless, the good stratigraphic control shows that the grog, grit, and bone temper ceramic tradition existed concurrently with several arrow point styles, and based on associated radiocarbon dates, this tradition lasted for a considerable time span. As outlined in Chapter 15, a time frame of A.D. 700 to 1650 is proposed for this ceramic tradition within the reservoir area, which is consistent with the radiocarbon chronology for 41FT193. VERTEBRATE FAUNAL REMAINS (by Phillip Murry) Vertebrate faunal remains were recovered from most of the 50 x 50 cm excavation units and from the flotation samples from four features (Table 4-5). Relatively few identifiable elements were recovered, and most of these were referrable to whitetail deer, Odocoileus virginianus. Deer elements were identified for 19 different excavation proveniences (Table 4-6), and Feature 202 contained long bone fragments that are probably from that species. Age determinations based on the eruption and wear of teeth

While these differences could reflect changes through time in the intensity of faunal utilization, it should be stressed that only a small percentage of the site area was actually sampled by the 50 x 50 cm units. Because the faunal samples are small, the presence of a few large bones can skew the weight distributions. For example, over 67% of the total bone weight from level 5 was due to two deer elements, a scapula (Unit 2368) and an antler (Unit 2382). The small sample size also inhibits firm conclusions about patterns of species exploitation, Whitetail deer remains were more frequent within levels 1 through 5 than in the lower levels. The lower number of deer remains in levels 7 through 11 was accompanied by an increase in fish and turtle remains from those levels. This could indicate a stronger emphasis on aquatic species during the earlier time period, but it is uncertain whether the sample is truly representative. INVERTEBRATE FAUNAL REMAINS (by Richard Fullington) The invertebrate faunal remains from site 41FT193 consisted of the shells of both freshwater bivalves and gastropods. Bivaive remains were recovered from most of the 50 x 50 cm excavation units and from several features. The gastropods were extracted from special soil samples that were collected from five different soil horizons within the stratigraphic/soil sections. BIVALVES Although numerous fragments of bivalve shell were recovered from all excavation levels, much of it was not identifiable as to species (Table 4-8). Very few complete valves were represented. Specimens were counted as individuals of a particular species only when the umbo was present or when the valve was complete enough for an accurate identification. During the field work at site 41FT193, the author made a collection of living molluscan fauna from Richland Creek at a location immediately downstream from the Richland Creek Dam. The living bivalve species were found to be virtually the same as those identified from site 41FT193 (see Table 4-8). The only species found archaeologically but not represented in the modern assemblage were Obiquaria reflexa (three individuals) and Arcidens confragosus (one individual). Considering their infrequent occurrence archaeologically, they may still be present in Richland Creek but simply were not collected. Given the Volume ITI, Part One similarity between the current bivalve species community and that represented archaeologically, it appears that the flow regime of Richland Creek has changed very little between ca. A.D. 200 and the present. It was, as it is today, a typical Texas stream with alternating areas of relatively deep, slow moving water and riffle areas with shallow, faster running water. Given the present size of Richland Creek, and the evidence that it was similar during the past 1,800 years, it is assumed that the creek never supported large populations of bivalve species during this period. One interesting aspect of the 41FT193 bivalve assemblage was that most of the examined specimens were subadults. Freshwater bivalves generally do not reach reproductive age until 3-4 years. At this age the shells should be between 4 and 6 inches in length, which is significantly larger than most of the archaeological specimens. It would appear that by the practice of collecting so many subadults, the prehistoric inhabitants would have maintained a constant pressure on the local bivalve population. GASTROPODS Soil samples for the recovery of gastropods were collected from five soil horizons at various depths in the stratigraphic/soil sections that were described in an earlier section of this site report. These soil samples were washed through a series of sieves, the smallest of which had 1/32 inch (0.79 mm) mesh. The recovered gastropods were identified as to species and counted for each of the five samples (Table 4-9). The gastropods from all five samples were typical woodland species that are common tq the type of woodlands found in the site area today. All of the species are quite small in size and live primarily under logs and leaf litter. None of the species that are commonly found in sandy terrace soils (e.g., Polygyra and Rabdotus) were recovered from these floodplain deposits. It was somewhat unusual that only one specimen of aquatic snail (Physa virgata) was identified. Given the site's creekside location, more aquatic species were expected. In summary, the gastropod species found in each of the five samples are typical of modern assemblages found in environmental settings similar to that of site 41FT193. The only anomalous aspect of sample assemblages was the almost total lack of aquatic gastropod species. MACROBOTANICAL REMAINS (by Gayle J. Fritz) Macrobotanical remains from 13 flotation samples were analyzed at the Ethnobotanical Laboratory, Research Laboratories of Anthropology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The laboratory work was performed by the author, Paul S. Gardner, and Kristen J. Gremillion, in consultation with Dr. Richard A. Yarnell, Ten of these samples were from archaeological features, and three were collected from the 340-350 cm level of 50 x 50 cm excavation units. These 13 samples yielded a total of 4.46 g of wood charcoal (particles larger than 2.0 mm); 199.93 g of hickory nutshell (>2.0 mm); 4.11 g of pecan shell (>1.41 mm); 0.01 g of acorn shell (>1.41 mm); 0.01 g of tuber thought to be Psoralea (>1.41 mm); 0.02 g of rhizome (>1.41 mm); 0.01 g of a fruiting stem (peduncle) from an unidentified plant, 38 carbonized seeds; and 2.13 g of unknown charred material (>2.00 mm, Table 4-10). The amount of soil floated varied considerably between features. To facilitate comparisons, the weights in Table 4-10 were corrected for volume and are presented as weights per 100 | of soil (Table 4-11). The stratified nature of the site deposit and the series of radiocarbon dates have enabled all samples to be placed chronologically. The samples from the 340-350 cm levels of three 50 x 50 cm units were analyzed to determine the macrobotanical content of an apparent occupation surface dated to approximately

A fifth feature (Feature 205), yielding 6.68 g of hickory nutshell and little else, is on the same stratigraphic level as Feature 204, which dates to A.D. 800 + 100. An impressive amount of pecan (4.0 g) came from Feature 401, but only two other features yielded pecan, and these had very small amounts. Acorn was poorly represented at the site, as was the tuberous material thought to be Psoralea, each occurring in tiny amounts in only two features. “The two latest features (Features 201 and 203) differed from the three earlier small hearths (Features 202, 204, and 206) in terms of botanical content. Feature 201 was dominated by wood charcoal and Feature 203 by a woody stem (Rhizome?). Nutshell was present in relatively greater quantities in the three other hearths, and even dominated the contents of Feature 202. The nine hackberry seeds (Celtis occidentalis) are from the earliest contexts, while the 19 Polygonaceae seeds are from somewhat later features. The latter are trigonous, but could not be confidently identified at the genus level. They are thought to be from one of the many species of either Polygonum or Rumex occurring in the region. Sixteen ef these seeds were from Feature 202 (A.D. 1170 + 150) and are thought to be good evidence for its utilization as a food plant. The other seed types (two Galium sp., three Iva annua, one Poaceae, and four unidentified) are too sparsely represented at this site to be viewed as temporally significant. With the exception of Psoralea, none of the identifiable taxa would have been exploited during any season other than late summer and autumn. Seasonal fall encampment at this locality, focusing on.the procurement of floodplain resources (primarily hickory nuts and pecans, as far as plant foods are concerned) can be hypothesized.

y> nt ay ne 41FT193 stratigraphic ordering of these artifacts is consistent with an } earlier artifact sequence proposed by Story (1965) for the Cedar Creek Lake area. The two untyped, straight stem dart points are | similar to the Gary specimens, except that their stems are almost } parallel-sided. They are most similar to members of the Kent type Suhm and Jelks 1962:199), but the workmanship on the 41FT193 | specimens is better than that indicated by the type description. The associated radiocarbon dates have been discussed in earlier F sections of this site report. With one exception, the dates were } imternally consistent. This date, A.D. 590 + 90, was obtained from | earbonized nutshell fragments recovered from 245-250 cm below | datum. Dates of A.D. 670 + 60 and A.D. 800 + 100 were from features located below this depth. The A.D. 590 date also seems to | be too early based on the presumed dating of the recovered fartifacts, since both Perdiz and Scallom arrow points were i wecovered from below the 250 cm level. Scallorn points are ; thought to date no earlier than A.D. 700, and Perdiz no earlier f than A.D. 1300, in the Central Texas chronology (Prewitt 1981). | The remaining dates are in accord with the presumed dating of the diagnostic artifacts. Interpretations of the horizontal patterning of artifacts are | imited by the fact that only a small portion of the entire site was sampied by the excavation units. The 50 x 50 cm units were all located within an area measuring 6.5 x 10.5 m. The actual area mcavated was 11.25 m2 for levels 1 and 2, 4.75 m2 for levels 3 rough 6, and 4.25 m2 for levels 7 through 10. Level 11 was ‘excavated in only three units (0.75 m2.). Spatial maps (SYMAP program) were generated for the Warious artifact classes for all levels of excavation, but their wsefulness for pattern recognition in levels 3 through 11 is limited pbecause of the small number of units excavated to this depth. Spatial clustering was detected for certain levels, but it is most Wkely that these results provide only a partial picture of how site pocupations were structured spatially. The lithic tools from level 1 were located primarily within the southeastern quarter of the area sampled by the 50 x 50 cm units @Figure 4-12). The exceptions were three retouched flakes marginally modified unifaces) from the units immediately south pand southwest of Feature 202. The SYMAP for lithic debris } (Figure 4-13) seems to indicate three separate clusters for this | artifact category. Once again, the most prominent cluster is located } im the southeastern quarter of the grid. The second occurs in units } Jost south and east of the hearth, Feature 202. A third, relatively F minor Cluster is located along the center of the western edge of the grid. The densest concentration of mussel shell (Figure 4-14) is located immediately to the east of Feature 202. Smaller } concentrations of shell were recovered from the northwest quarter of the grid and along its southern edge. The problem in interpreting these spatial patterns is an } wncertainty in regard to whether the materials from level 1 are the product of a single visit to the site, or the results of several sequential occupations. The mussel shell, lithic debris, and ' retouched flakes associated with Feature 202 form a rather tight F cluster around this hearth and may represent a true activity area.- Feature 202 itself and the units immediately south and southwest of it (Units 2186 and 2188) also contained the largest amounts of bone recovered from level 1. This included identifiable elements of ; whitetail deer and bird. The floated fill of Feature 202 contained the carbonized remains of hickory nutshell, Psoralea tuber, and Polygonum seeds. The artifact concentration in the southeastern quarter of the grid consists of a dense cluster of lithic debris with most of the lithic tools located around its periphery. This may represent an area of lithic tool manufacture. Whether or not these materials accumulated during a single occupation or during the same occupation that produced the hearth cluster is uncertain. The low overall density of artifacts, though, certainly argues for short term occupation at this site. The spatial maps for many of the other levels showed rather uniform distributions of material.

Lithic debris occurred primarily in the south half of the grid, with the highest densities located in the southernmost units (Figure 4-15). Level 5 had the highest density of animal bone (199.6 g/m2), almost all of which consisted of deer elements and unidentifiable fragments from these same southern units, It seems likely that this cluster of material in level 5 extended outside of the area sampled by the excavation units. Level 6 displayed a unique form of patterning in which the majority of mussel shell (Figure 4-16) and lithic debris (Figure 4- 17) was recovered from two nearby units. The relative density of shell from level 6 was surpassed only by levels 10 and 11 (see Table 4-9). However, almost 71% of this level 6 total was recovered from Unit 2280. Similarly, over 77% of the lithic debris from level 6 (92 of 119 pieces) was recovered from Unit 2276. Very little additional material was recovered from level 6, so that these clusters may represent very localized, short term activities of lithic tool production and shellfish processing. Unlike level 6, the weight of mussel shell was relatively high in most units for which levels 10 and 11 were excavated. The depths of these levels corresponded to the upper portion of the lower dark clay stratum (Horizon VIC2b) in this part of the site. This

It appears to represent a period of intensive shellfish collecting and processing. Three hearths associated stratigraphically with this shell deposit have yielded dates of A.D. 170 + 70, A.D. 190 + 70, and A.D. 320 + 150. INTERPRETATIONS Site 41FT193 is a creekside campsite that was occupied sporadically from at least as early as 170 B.C. until perhaps as late as the nineteenth century A.D. The well-stratified nature of the site deposit is a direct result of its creekside location. As the floodplain agegraded through the buildup of flood-deposited alluvium, former occupation surfaces became buried beneath later sediments. Postdepositional disturbances appear to have been minimal.

Distribution of mussel shell from level 1 at site 41FT193. Chambers Creeks have identified a consistent set of depositional zones (see Chapter 7, Volume I). These zones were differentiated by dramatic changes in parent materials. The dense black clay zone designated as Stratigraphic Unit V at site 41FT193 is visible in the banks of both Richland and Chambers Creeks throughout the Project area. Geological testing in the Richland Creek floodplain at varying distances up to 0.7 km away from the channel indicated that this dense black clay zone is present throughout the floodplain. It was found to vary little in depth, thickness, or other depositional characteristics. This zone is a marker horizon representing a unique period in the depositional history of the Project area floodplains. Chapter 5 of Volume I discusses the implications of the geological record at this site in terms of past environments in the Richland Creek area. The results of test excavations at several other creekbank sites have indicated that the floodplain deposits located above the present creek level (ca. 6 m below the floodplain surface) were deposited no earlier than about 3000 B.C. (Raab et al. 1982:107). Evidence of even earlier floodplain occupations very likely is |] AL CRPRROPREBORA ef

One of the most important results of the investigations at site 41FT193 was the recovery of additional radiocarbon dates, allowing better temporal control for reconstructing the | depositional history of the Project area floodplains. It now appears that the upper 2 m of creekbank sediments located above the dense black clay zone (Stratigraphic Unit V) were laid down fairly } recently, probably during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries A.D. Deposition of the dense black clay zone seems to have begun sometime around A.D. 600 and to have continued until after A.D. F 1820 + 50. Previous dates obtained from the floodplain sediments | located below the black clay stratum have ranged from 2380 + 160 B.C. to A.D. 420 + 150 (Raab et al. 1982:107). The lower dark _ elay stratum (Horizon VIC2b) is unique to site 41FT193, and dates to around A.D. 200, Site 41FT193 also has provided new information about the nature of prehistoric floodplain occupation.

The low overall density of artifacts and the ephemeral nature of the features certainly suggest short term occupations. The only seasonal indicators recovered from the site were the macrobotanical remains, which suggest primarily fall occupations focusing on the procurement of floodplain plant resources, primarily hickory nuts and pecans. The limited vertebrate faunal assemblage is dominated by whitetail deer remains, but identifiable elements of fish, turtle, bird, and rabbit were recovered as well. Shells of freshwater bivalves were recovered from all excavation levels, but were densest within levels 10 and 11. This widespread deposit of mussel shell is in the upper portion of the lower dark clay stratum (Horizon VIC2b), and seems to indicate a period of intensive shellfish collecting and processing dating to around A.D. 200. Logistical problems limited intensive investigations at site 41FT93 to those deposits dating between ca. A.D. 200 and the nineteenth century A.D.

The evidence from site 41FT193 and the large numbers of creekbank sites found during the 1980 survey (McGregor et al. 1982) suggest that creekside campsites were an important component of past settlement systems, at least from the Middle Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods. 112 .

EXCAVATIONS AT 41FT199 by Marilee Irvine and Daniel E. McGregor, with a contribution by Phillip Murry ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Site 41FT199 is located on the lower southwestern slope of a terrace, approximately 0.6 km north of the present channel of Richland Creek. A small, intermittent drainage is located less than 40 m west of the site. This drainage has been dammed to construct a large stock tank immediately northwest of the site. During construction of the tank, a small spillway was cut through the approximate center of the site (Figure 5-1). The spoil dirt appears to have been deposited on the southern bank of the spillway on the western edge of the site. Subsequent erosion has deepened and widened this spillway channel, especially along the portion closest to the stock tank, where it has been downcut to a depth of over 2m below surface. The remaining site area has been cleared and is presently in pasture. Ground cover consists of grasses and a few low shrubs. The associated soil type is Crockett sandy loam. SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS The site was originally recorded by SMU in 1974 on the basis of information provided by Mr. Bill Young of Corsicana, Texas. Mr. Young's surface collection included projectile points diagnostic of both Archaic and Late Prehistoric period occupations. In addition, Mr. Young had collected fragmentary remains of a human cranium from a small erosional gulley just north of the spillway channel. Test excavations were conducted at site 41FT199 during the 1980-81 season (McGregor et al. 1982). Eighteen shovel test units (40 x 40 cm) were excavated. A sandy loam A horizon greater than 90 cm in depth was found to be present over much of the site area. A short distance up the terrace slope the A horizon thinned to less than 30 cm and was underlain by a clay B horizon. The test excavations recovered moderate amounts of lithic debris in addition to both dart and arrow points. An Early Archaic San Patrice point was recorded at 40 cm below the surface during 53 the excavation of a geological soil profile. This profile was cut into the south bank of the spillway gully. The point was not collected at that time, and could not be relocated during subsequent visits to the site. Attempts to locate the previously mentioned human burial were also unsuccessful. The significant depth of the site deposit suggested that vertical stratification of artifact assemblages might be present. This fact, as well as the possible presence of a human burial, provided the basis for recommending further excavations at the site. EXCAVATION STRATEGY During the spring 1983 field season, site 41FT199 was investigated by a combination of hand excavations and backhoe trenches (see Figure 5-1), Hand excavations consisted of 72 units dug with a post hole digger (Units 25-32 and 34-97), five 1 x 1m units (Units 20-24), and a single 1 2.8 m unit (Unit 33). The post holes (15 cm in diameter) were excavated in 20 cm levels. All other units were excavated in 10 cm levels. All excavated fill was screened through 1/4 in (6.4 mm) hardware cloth. In addition, 13 backhoe trenches (Units 98-111). were excavated. A total of 48 person-days was expended on this site. The post hole units were excavated at 5 m intervals on a grid system measuring 55 m north-south by 25 m east-west. The purpose of these post hole units was to provide data to be used in generating a series of computer spatial maps (SYMAP program). This strategy was adopted after excavations in Units 20-22 - revealed an apparent midden deposit. The SYMAP results were expected to show relative artifact densities, depth to clay, and changes in soil color for various areas of the site. Units 20-22 were placed north of and parallel to the spillway in an area, identified by Mr. Young, from which human bone had been collected. The reason for opening a 1 x 3 m block was to expose an area large enough to uncover any human remains that might still be in situ. Unit 23 was excavated below the spillway in an area determined to have a high artifact density during testing. It was originally laid

Little excavation was possible in the area below the spillway due to the soil saturation after a season of heavy rains. Below approximately 60 cm, water would seep into the units and make excavation impossible. Unit 24 was laid out just below the spillway and somewhat off the main part of the site. This unit was excavated to provide information on artifact density in this area and to observe the stratigraphy along a portion of the spillway that was disturbed by recent erosional action due to the down cutting of the water flowing from the stock tank through the channelized area. Unit 33 was excavated as a connecting unit between the 1 x3 m block (Units 20-22) and one of the backhoe trenches (Unit 111). It was dug to expose the profile and to open up a larger area within the central part of the site where artifact density seemed to be highest. The 13 backhoe trenches were excavated in order to open up large areas for profile exposure and to search for possible features. Five trenches (Units 98-102) were excavated on either side of the spillway to observe the soil stratigraphy in that location. Units 103 and 104 also were excavated to help determine the limits of the site, and to provide better profile observation for the northern and southern limits of the site. Units 105-110 were excavated in a series running north to south along the slope of the site. These were undertaken to provide a profile of the deepening sandy loam topsoil observed in the lower portions of the site. Finally, Unit 111 was excavated along the western edge of the site to observe a profile of the site from the center out to this edge. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS SITE STRATIGRAPHY The site is situated near the base of a Pleistocene terrace. The general terrace profile consists of a sandy loam A horizon overlying a clay B horizon. Depths of the A horizon are variable across the site. Volume III, Part One Backhoe trenches excavated in the western and northern parts of the site encountered clay at comparatively shallow depths. The western trenches (Units 98-102) found clay at depths of 40 cm or less. The northernmost trench (Unit 105) exposed clay at only 20 cm below the surface. The series of north-south backhoe trenches (Units 105-110) demonstrated a progressive deepening of the sandy A horizon moving do . Although excavation of Unit 20 by 10 cm levels was terminated at 120 cm because of soil saturation, a post hole digger was used to locate the clay at a depth of 150 cm in this area. The clay is at least this deep in the area south of the spillway gully as well. Excavations there were limited in depth due to the high water table. However, clay was observed at 150 cm below surface in Unit 104 before the trench filled with water. Over most of the site a light brown sandy loam makes up the top 20-25 cm of the deposit. This is very likely the result of recent redeposition of soils eroded from the higher elevations of the terrace. Below this top layer the sandy loam is very dark grayish brown in color and contains a higher density of artifacts. This dark, midden-like soil is only present in areas where the A horizon is fairly deep. The backhoe trench profiles showed that it lenses out both upslope and to the west of Units 20-22 and 33. Within those areas where the A horizon is deepest, there is a gradual downward color change to a brown sandy loam before the clay enriched B horizon is encountered. Evidence of a filled gully was found in the western half of Unit 22. A mottled, disturbed soil extended from the surface to a maximum depth of 50 cm in the west wall profile. This was probably the same erosional gully where Mr. Young collected the human cranial fragments mentioned above. Two additional fragments of human cranium were recovered from the 40-60 cm levels of Unit 22. ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS LITHIC TOOLS Arrow Points Cuney (1 specimen, Figure 5-2a).

CERAMICS No ceramic artifacts were recovered from site 41FT199. ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS The artifact assemblage from site 41FT199 is characterized by a limited number of tools and low overall artifact frequencies (see Table F-5 in Appendix F). It had been hoped that spatial maps of the artifact counts from the 72 post hole units would be useful for identifying horizontal and/or vertical concentrations within the site. Unfortunately, the numbers of artifacts recovered from the post hole units (15 cm in diameter) were not sufficient to provide meaningful SYMAPs. Given the relatively low artifact density at this site, this size unit was too small to provide adequate counts. Of the larger, hand excavated units, artifact density is highest in contiguous Units 20-22. The volume of Unit 33 was approximately 2.8 times as great as each of these 1 x 1 m units. When this volume differential is adjusted for, it is apparent that artifact density is somewhat lower for Unit 33. This correlates with a northward thinning of the very dark sandy loam deposit in this area of the site. South of these units the site deposit was inadequately sampled because of the high water table. A similar sandy loam deposit and fairly high artifact density were found in Unit 23, but this unit could only be taken to a depth of 70 cm. Unit 24, on the other hand, appears to be west of the main site deposit since very few artifacts were recovered from this unit. The number of projectile points recovered from vertically controlled excavation units is limited (9 specimens), but their vertical distribution is what would be expected in a stratified deposit. A single arrow point was recovered from level 3 of Unit 21. Six contracting stem dart points (Gary types, including regular, serrated, and small varieties) came from levels 3 through 9 of various units, while the two expanding stem dart points (Yarbrough type) were from levels 10 and 11. By itself, this evidence suggests that the site deposit was aggrading through time. However, the only geological evidence of stratification was confined to the upper 20-25 cm of the site deposit. Below this there was more than 1 m of fairly homogeneous sandy loam extending to an underlying, clay enriched B horizon. Past research in the Project area has suggested that vertical distributions of artifacts in sandy loam terrace deposits may present a "false stratigraphy" that results from the downward movement of these artifacts from a common occupation surface. Under this interpretation, differences in depth are related not only to variation in the ages of the artifacts, but also to differences in their size or mass (McIntyre and Janak 1983). As a result, the recovery of materials from the same excavation level does not necessarily demonstrate their contemporaneity. Evidence of this phenomenon would consist of a “tendency for artifacts to show a decreasing frequency with depth while displaying a higher mean weight with corresponding depth increases” (McIntyre and Janak 1982:346). This seems to be the case for site 41FT199. Smaller artifacts such as lithic debris display higher frequencies in the upper levels of the site deposit. The lowest excavated levels contain far fewer of these small artifacts, while there is a corresponding increase in fire cracked rock (Misc. Stone in Table F-4). FAUNAL REMAINS (by Phillip Murry) Of the 15 excavated units containing bone at site 41FT199, most contained only small amounts, none of which was identifiable. Units 23, 35, 41, 46, 67, and 71 contained traces of unidentifiable, Velume ITI, Part One mainly unburned, bone. The vast majority of bome was recovered from the contiguous Units 20, 21, 22, amd 33, im the central portion of the site (Table 5-1), The largest comcemtsation of bone in these units was from levels 5 through 7 (40-70 cm), although Unit 33 also yielded a significant amount from levels 9 and 10. The distal portion of a whitetail deer kumeras was recovered from level 7 of Unit 20. Level 7 of Unit 21 contained a number of whitetail elements. These included a bumed antler tine, metapodial fragments, and several skull and longbone fragments. The only identifiable element from Unit 22 was the proximal portion of a very large whitetail deer antler. This specimen was from level 5, and it shows evidence of having been worked. It is about 7 cm long with the distal end cut and ground square. The proximal end was cut below the burr and beveled. The coronet was largely removed. Whitetail deer molars and additional tooth fragments were recovered from levels 2 and 3 of Unit 33. Level 7 of this unit contained whitetail longbone and vertebrae fragments and a single premolar of this species. Several whitetail longbone fragments were also recovered from level 10, along with a very large gar vertebra. To illustrate the size of this gar, vertebrae of a 36 cm long gar in the faunal collection at Tarleton State University measured 0.5 cm. The vertebra from Unit 33 was 1.7 cm, indicating that this gar was over 1 m in length. In addition to bone, fragmentary mussel shell was recovered from three excavation units (20, 21 and 33). These were confined primarily to level 8 of Unit 20, level 4 of Unit 21, and levels 4 and 5 of Unit 33. Table 5-1 SUMMARY OF FAUNAL REMAINS FRoM UNITS 20, 21, 22, AND 33, Sve 41FT199 Total Weight!

ni se 3 of al al aS ne aS re rit its ar ty m, ed ed nd . 4INVI60 INTERPRETATIONS } Although several person-days of effort were expended at site | 41FT199, the characteristic soil conditions have tended to impede interpretations. The deep, A horizon deposits which cover much of the area made it impossible to delineate many features, Elsewhere rig the Project area, such archaeologically important contexts were ; often visible only within the clay B horizon. Moreover, in all Ekelihood, the deep A horizon soil has been churned by natural } processes (e.g., bioturbation), and artifact vertical provenience is suspect. _ Despite these limiting factors, however, the site is important E since it provides a sample from a more or less pure Late Archaic period occupation. Although a later occupation is suggested by the two arrow points which were found, the overall rarity of these points, combined with the lack of ceramics, suggests only limited use of the site by Late Prehistoric peoples. In addition to this, a San , Patrice point was found during the initial geological testing, f suggesting a brief Early Archaic encampment at the site. Overall, 57 however, the predominant use of the site seems to have occurred during the Late Archaic period. Perhaps the unusual location of the site on the slope of a terrace contributed to this lack of reoccupation. Most archaeological sites in the reservoir are situated on the crests of rises. Reoccupation of these landforms was a common occurrence and resulted in heavily mixed deposits. Why the Late Archaic peoples would choose to occupy the lower slope of the terrace at 41FT199 is unknown. Perhaps the small slough along the southern part of the site was once a spring, and the presence of water was a major determinant in the location of this Site. On the basis of the artifact content, site 41FT199 seems to represent a short term habitation site. This is seen in the limited range and frequency of tools recovered. The assemblage is dominated by tool forms generally associated with activities such as hunting, butchering, and the processing of animal and plant materials. Terrace resources, such as deer and nuts, could have been easily exploited from the site. Finally, the occurrence of hammerstones, cores, and lithic debris indicates that tool manufacture was undertaken as well.

EXCAVATIONS AT 41FT200, THE HARDY SITE by Daniel E. McGregor, with contributions by Gayle J. Fritz and Phillip Murry ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Site 41FT200 is located on a low terrace remnant knoll within the floodplain of Richland Creek. The present creek channel is approximately 0.2 km south of the site, and a slough is located along the site's southern and southwestern margins. Ground cover at the site consists of grasses and woody shrubs. A few pecan trees were present on the higher elevations of the knoll during the 1980- 81 survey and testing field season, but since then these have been cleared in association with reservoir construction. The previous landowner had bulldozed a small area of the knoll at the southern edge of the site in an attempt to fill part of the slough channel. Subsequent erosion of this fill has exposed large numbers of artifacts within the disturbed context of the slough. SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS Site 41FT200 originally was recorded by SMU in 1974 on the basis of information provided by Mr. Bill Young of Corsicana, Texas. Mr. Young's surface collection from the site contained artifacts diagnostic of both the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. . Test excavations were conducted during the 1980-81 field season (McGregor et al. 1982:34-36). These excavations included eight backhoe trenches, 15 40 x 40 cm shovel test units, one 1 x 1 m unit, and one 1.5 x 1.5 m unit (Figure 6-1). The stratigraphy of the knoll consisted of a sandy loam A horizon overlying a clay enriched B horizon. On the lower, southern slope of the knoll (in the area of Units 14, 15, and 16) this standard terrace soil sequence was capped by a layer of alluvial clay. Testing showed that this upper clay zone contained relatively few artifacts. While artifacts diagnostic of both the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods were recovered from the test units located on top of the knoll, the buried portion of the site deposit produced only Archaic period diagnostics, including both expanding and contracting stem dart points. 59 The available evidence suggested that the southern portion of the site adjacent to the slough contained a buried Archaic period component. It was hypothesized that the aggrading floodplain of Richland Creek had begun covering this lower portion of the knoll prior to the beginning of the Late Prehistoric occupation of the site. Additional excavations were recommended for this part of the site. EXCAVATION STRATEGY Mitigation phase excavations were conducted during Season IV using a total of 117 person days. The excavations were confined to an area in the southern part of the site where the Pleistocene terrace remnant was overlain by Holocene alluvial clay. The initial phase of investigation involved the excavation of two backhoe trenches (Trenches 1 and 2), each approximately 20 m long (Figure 6-2). These trenches provided stratigraphic profiles of the site deposit extending from the edge of the slough to where the upper clay zone thinned out upslope. Both the upper clay and the buried A horizon were found to be considerably thicker in Trench 2. An additional backhoe trench (Trench 3), 16 m in length and oriented perpendicular to Trench 2, was excavated to examine the Stratigraphy to the east of this deeper deposit. Excavation of two 1 x 1 m units in 20 cm levels (Units 101 and 102) was begun to test the artifact content of the upper clay zone. All excavated fill was dry-screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) hardware cloth. Only limited amounts of lithic debris were recovered from the clay. In Unit 102, the buried A horizon was encountered near the bottom of the 20-40 cm level and contained most of the artifacts recovered from that level. All subsequent excavation in Unit 102 was done in 10 cm levels, The upper clay zone was found to be considerably thicker in Unit 101. Excavation of this unit was halted at a depth of 60 cm without ever reaching the buried A horizon. Relatively little cultural material was found to be present in the upper clay zone. Because the buried Archaic component was of

A bulldozer was used to strip an area measuring approximately 15 x 20 m down to the top of the buried A horizon (see Figure 6-2). The locations of Units 14, 15, and 16 were visible on the stripped surface; and they were mapped with reference to an established grid system. A series of 0.5 x 1 m units was systematically placed within the undisturbed portions of the stripped area. These units were excavated in 10 cm vertical levels, and all fill was water-screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) hardware cloth. The thickness of the A horizon varied across this portion of the site, but all units were excavated at least one level into the underlying clay-enriched B horizon. In two cases, additional 0.5 x 1 m units were opened adjacent to existing units to more fully expose burned rock features. In all, 37 0.5 x 1 m units and a single 1 x 1 m unit were excavated within the stripped area. After these excavations were completed, the bulldozer was used to strip this same 15 x 20 m area down to the surface of the lighter colored B horizon. This was done in an attempt to locate features. Only oné feature (Feature 6) was identified using this procedure. Feature 6 was a small pit defined by a roughly circular area of dark A horizon soil at the surface of the lighter colored B horizon. This feature was never excavated due to the inundation of this portion of the site after a period of heavy rains. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS SITE STRATIGRAPHY Three basic stratigraphic zones were recognized throughout the excavated portion of the site. The uppermost of these was a dark gray (1OYR4/1) clay that is identical to the clay covering the modern floodplain of Richland Creek. Buried below this clay is what appears to be a standard terrace soil sequence of a very dark gray (10YR3/1) sandy loam A horizon overlying a yellowish brown (10YR5/4) clay enriched B horizon. There is a clear and smooth boundary between the upper clay zone and the buried A horizon. The boundary between the A and B horizons is gradual, and might be described more accurately as a thin transitional zone. The thickness of the B horizon was not determined by the excavations. Soil corings taken from the bottoms of Trenches 1 and 2 showed that it was underlain by a sandy C horizon that contained numerous, small calcium carbonate concretions. The thickness of both the upper clay and the buried A horizon varied across the area of excavations. Both tended to increase in thickness in the southern and eastern portions of this area. The upper clay thinned out upslope and extended only a few meters beyond the area of excavation.

Backhoe trenches and excavation units investigated during Season IV at site 41FT200. The site stratigraphy has been interpreted as a standard Pleistocene terrace soil profile that has been covered by a layer of alluvial clay. The vertical distribution of artifacts is thought to indicate that the top of the buried A horizon was the occupation surface during the Archaic period. Since then, this former surface has been covered by flood deposited alluvium. FEATURES FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS Six features were identified during the Season IV excavations at site 41FT200. These consisted of a cache of lithic material (Feature 1), four burned rock concentrations (Features 2, 3, 4, and 5), and an apparent pit (Feature 6). The locations of these features are shown in Figure 6-3. They are described individually below. Feature 1 This apparent cache of lithic material consisted of 10 cores in various stages of reduction and a single, unfinished biface, Seven of the cores are on nodules of Pisgah Ridge chert. The three other cores and the biface are made of a light gray, fine-grained chert. All of these artifacts were confined to an area measuring approximately 35 cm in diameter. All were between the surface of the buried A horizon and a depth of 15 cm below this.

It was discovered originally in Unit 138, and Units 141-143 were excavated in an attempt to define its | horizontal limits. Rock was scattered throughout these excavation } Wnits, but the majority was confined to a roughly elliptical area measuring approximately 1 m long and 75 cm wide. A 33 1 soil ' sample of the feature matrix was collected for flotation.

It was observed as a dark stain on the lighter colored, scraped surface of the B horizon after about 40 cm of A horizon had been removed. The | feature outline was fairly circular except for a lobe that extended to the northeast. Maximum dimensions were 72 cm long and 56 cm wide. Unfortunately, this feature was nat excavated. The inundation of the site after a period of heavy rains forced the abandonment of further work there. The field season had ended before these floodwaters receded. Burned rock concentrations similar to Features 2 through 5 were not common at other Project area sites. They are, however, known from several sites in the middie Trinity River basin and in adjacent areas.

Test excavations at site 41FT48 in the Big Brown Lignite Prospect identified three circular concentrations of thermally altered sandstone and quartzite cobbles (Wooldridge 1979). Bumed rock concentrations appear to be even more common in the upper Navasota drainage, where they have been reported at Lake Limestone (Mallouf 1979) and from the Jewett Mine Project area (Espey-Huston and Assoc. 1982; Day 1984; Fields 1984). The largest sample of these features was from site 41LN178 (Day 1984), where most were thought to date to the Archaic period.

The provenience designations that follow each description indicate the unit and level from which the specimens were recovered (e.g., 103.5). LITHIC TOOLS Dart Points Gary (9 specimens, Figure 6-Sa). These specimens are characterized by their triangular blades and contracting stems with rounded bases. Shoulders are poorly developed on most specimens, but one exhibits small, laterally projecting barbs. Materials: chert (4), quartzite (5). Proveniences: 106.5, 108.1, 116.1, 116.2, 116.3, 120.1, 124.2, 130.1, 137.1. Palmillas (4 specimens, Figure 6-5b,c). These specimens are characterized by their expanding stems with rounded bases, giving the stems a bulbar appearance. The distal portion of the blade is missing from three specimens, and shoulders vary from slight to well-developed. Materials: chert (3), Edwards chert (1). Proveniences: 102.3, 119.1, 120.3, 129.2. San Patrice (1 specimen, Figure 6-5d). This small, side notched specimen has a short expanding stem and a slightly concave base. The base has been thinned by the removal of a short channel flake from one side. The asymmetrical blade is alternately beveled. Material: quartzite. Provenience: 102.12. Wells (1 specimen, Figure 6-5¢). The relatively long, slightly contracting stem of this specimen was broken during excavation, but can be reconstructed. Its lateral edges and rounded base have been lightly ground. The long blade apparently has been reworked and is serrated. Material: chert. Provenience: 103.5. Yarbrough (5 specimens, Figure 6-5f, g). These specimens all have moderately long, expanding stems with straight bases. Blade shoulders vary from prominent to slight. Materials: chert (2), quartzite (1), silicified wood (1), Pisgah Ridge chert (1). Proveniences: 113.4, 120.4, 126.4, 127.2, 130.11. Untyped, Contracting Stem (1 specimen).

41FT200 cm Figure 6-6. Bifaces from site 41FT200: (a,b) gouges, (c,d) knives. Finished Bifaces Gouges (3 specimens, Figure 6-6a,b). All specimens have prominent, steeply chipped bits and are roughly triangular in plan view. The bits themselves were formed by unifacial flaking, but the other edges of these tools are bifacially worked. Two of the specimens are each about 3.2 cm long with a maximum width of about 2.8 cm at the bit end. The third specimen (Figure 6-7b) is considerably larger (length 5.5 cm, width 3.8 cm). They are identical to artifacts which have been termed Clear Fork Gouges (Ray 1941; Turner and Hester 1985:205). Materials: silicified wood (2), chert (1). Proveniences: Surface, 114.2, 140.3. Bristal Biface (1 specimen). This small quartzite specimen is circular in outline with relatively straight (nonsinuous) edges. This artifact category was originally defined by Duffield (1963a:43-44). Provenience: 134.2. Knives (10 specimens, Figure 6-6c,d), These specimens are characterized by their nonsinuous blade edges which exhibit fine secondary retouch. Of the five complete specimens, two are triangular (Figure 6-6c) in outline, and three are leaf-shaped, with rounded bases and pointed distal ends (Figure 6-6d). The five broken specimens all appear to be of the latter form. Materials: quartzite (5), chert (4), Edwards chert (1). Proveniences: 102.3, 102.5, 103.4, 104.1 (2), 104.2, 105.4, 120.4, 121.6, 137.3. 65 Aborted Bifaces Early Stage (2 specimens). These specimens are thick and irregular in outline, with sinuous edges. Both retain an area of cortex on one face. Although they could have been used as cutting or chopping tools, their unfinished appearance suggests that they are rejects from an early stage in the biface production process. Materials: quartzite (1), silicified wood (1). Proveniences: 114.2, 129.1. Late Stage (7 specimens). The edges of these specimens are less sinuous than those in the early stage subcategory, but they lack fine secondary retouch. Most specimens retain minor amounts of cortex or have an area of step fracturing on one face. Again, some of these could have been used as cutting tools. Materials: quartzite (3), chert (2), silicified wood (2). Proveniences: Feature 1, 104.1, 106.5, 106.7, 118.3, 121.7, 135.3. Biface Fragments Possible Dart Point Tip Fragments (9 specimens). These are pointed distal fragments of bifacially worked artifacts whose size and configurations suggest that they are the broken tips of dart points. Materials: chert (4), Edwards chert (3), quartzite (2). Proveniences: 105.5, 110.2, 120.1, 121.3, 121.6, 128.3, 128.6, 136.1, 137.2. Possible Dart Point Base Fragments (3 specimens). These specimens appear to be the proximal ends of stemmed dart points. The stem form was contracting for two specimens and rectangular for the third. Materials: chert (2), quartzite (1). Proveniences: 109.1, 116.3, 137.2. Indeterminate Fragments (45 specimens). These are broken specimens with at least one edge showing evidence of bifacial chipping. They are too fragmentary to be confidently assigned to any of the above bifacial tool categories. Materials: chert (27), quartzite (10), silicified wood (4), Pisgah Ridge chert (2), Edwards chert (2). Proveniences: Feature 1, 102.1, 102.6, 103.2, 103.4 (2), 103.5, 103.6, 104.2, 104.3, 105.4, 109.1, 110.3 (2), 113.1, 113.2, 114.8, 120.2, 121.2, 125.1, 126.2, 127.1, 127.7, 128.3, 128.6, 129.1 (2), 130.8, 130.9, 131.1, 131.2, 132.1, 132.2, 132.10, 133.1, 134.3, 135.1, 135.5, 136.3, 139.1, 139.2, 140.3, 140.4, 143.1 (2). Steeply Chipped Unifaces Gossett Gouges (2 specimens). These specimens were made from rather flat nodules of quartzite. One end of each specimen has been steeply retouched to form a slightly convex bit. The flat ventral surfaces of both specimens retain their nodular cortex, as do much of the upper surfaces. This artifact category was originally defined by Story (1965:208-210). Aside from the lithic material used, they are similar to other specimens typed as scrapers on tabular pieces of silicified wood. Proveniences: 130.8, 131.5. End Scraper (1 specimen). This specimen is the distal end of a thick chert flake with steep, stepped retouch on both its end and one of its edges. Provenience: 118.6. , Side Scrapers (14 specimens). These specimens are ail relatively thick flakes, or broken flakes that exhibit steeply chipped retouch along one or both lateral edges. Materials: chert (9), quartzite (2), Edwards chert (2), siltstone (1). Proveniences: Feature 1, 102.4, 102.5, 102.8, 103.4, 118.3, 119.5, 127.5, 130.1, 130.6, 130.7, 130.8, 132.1, 132.2.

Proveniences: Surface, 117.2, 135.6. CERAMICS (by James E. Bruseth) A total of nine sherds was recovered from 41FT200. Proveniences and selected attributes for these sherds are listed in Table 6-2 (details on these attributes can be found in Appendix B). The ceramics from this site fall into two groups. The first group, consisting of a single specimen, is a grog temper category and is similar to the common, grog tempered utility ware found at many other sites within the reservoir. The specimen in the present collection is small (less than 2 cm in diameter) and is undecorated. It has a reddish brown (10YR4/3) color on the interior, exterior, and core. The thickness of the sherd is 5.2 mm. The second group of ceramics, consisting of eight specimens, is part of a distinctive ceramic tradition within the reservoir, occurring in small numbers at only four sites. Sherds in this group are identified as having possible shell temper. In all cases from 41FT200, the shell has leached out, and the identification of temper is based on the laminated nature of the paste. The surfaces of these sherds are highly eroded, as well as being pitted due to the leaching of the shell. Exterior colors are pale brown (10YR6/3); interior and core colors are very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2). The thickness of the sherds is consistent and averages 5.2 mm. All of the sherds are undecorated. As noted in Chapter 15, the shell tempered ceramic tradition appears within contexts indicating a pre-A.D. 700 time frame. The single grog tempered sherd from 41FT200 is thought to date to the Late Prehistoric period. ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS Patterning was observed with respect to both the horizontal distribution of artifacts (Figures 6-7 through 6-9) and their vertical distribution (Table 6-3). The thickness of the buried A horizon varied from about 40 cm in the northwestern excavation units to almost 1 m in the far southern (Unit 130) and southeastern units (Units 118, 128, and 132). In general, artifact counts were highest in the first few excavation levels, and tended to drop off with depth (see Table F-5 in Appendix F). Experience at other Pleistocene terrace sites in the Project area has led to the conclusion that these deposits have not aggraded significantly during the period of human occupation. Following from this conclusion, it seems very probable that the vertical distribution of Table 6-2 CERAMIC ATTRIBUTES FROM SITE 41FT200 TT Body __ Temper _ Provenience Sherds Grog Shell(?)

Location of area included on SYMAPs (daslied line). artifacts in these deposits is the result of their differential downward displacement from a common surface. The projectile points and ceramics from site 41FT200 were tabulated by level in order to examine their vertical distributions (Table 6-3). The established artifact chronologies for this part of Texas (Johnson 1962; Story 1965) have suggested a shift through time in dart point stem forms. Expanding stem forms are thought to date earlier in time, and to have been replaced by contracting stem forms. Although the majority of contracting stem dart points from site 41FT200 were distributed above the majority of expanding stem forms, there is obviously a significant amount of overlap in their distributions. Two dart points were recovered. from much deeper levels. One of these was a San Patrice, which is considered diagnostic of the Early Archaic period. Although this point was recovered from level 12 of Unit 102, this was actually 90-100 cm below the top of the buried A horizon. This might be interpreted as evidence for vertical stratification. However, the tecovery of a Yarbrough point from an even deeper provenience would then be anomalous. Yarbrough points are generally considered to be diagnostic of the Middle Archaic period. The strongest evidence for vertical displacement is the single grog tempered sherd that was recovered from level 6 of Unit 131. This was deeper than all but two of the dart points. This sherd is thought to date later in time than all of the diagnostic artifacts from the excavations. The recovery of this sherd from a presumably sealed, Archaic period component is, in itself,

It might be that the upper clay zone was deposited considerably later in time than had been hypothesized, and that the relative absence of Late Prehistoric diagnostics merely reflects a lack of occupation in this part of the site during that period. The horizontal distribution of artifacts was examined by generating spatial maps (SYMAP program) for all categories of artifacts, The nine sherds were recovered from five different units, two (Units 119 and 120) in the northwest and three (Units 116, 130, and 131) in the southwest part of the excavated area. Projectile points were more widespread, but were absent from the southeastern and west central excavation units. The SYMAPs for lithic debris and fire cracked rock represent the relative densities of these artifact categories across a major portion of the area investigated during Season IV (Figure 6-7). Relatively lower densities of both lithic debris (Figure 6-8) and fire cracked rock (Figure 6-9) occurred in the central part of this area. Higher densities of both classes are located to the south and to Volume III, Part One § Gageanaert eegas. eagergaee-fo-eee7eedeee seudossucus: eo ehttet obRaiiasce: EAST FRAGMENTS OF FIRE CRACKED ROCK [ 157-195 196-272 465-695 273-464 696-926 Figure 6-9.

If this feature zone represents a living area, then these distribution patterns may indicate spatial differentiation of lithic production, and perhaps discard areas in the case of fire cracked rock. Considering the long period of time represented by the diagnostic artifacts, it is not likely that the observed patterns resulted from contemporaneous activities. It is also possible that features were once present to the north and south, but were disturbed by the more intensive activities that are represented by the higher artifact densities in those areas.

The total assemblage of carbonized plant remains | consisted of 0.02 g of wood charcoal and 0.02 g of hickory | mutshell from Feature 4, and 0.02 g of rhizome larger than 1.41 mm from Feature 5. Aside from noting the presence of these | plants, little can be said about Archaic period plant utilization at this site. INTERPRETATIONS Site 41FT200 was somewhat unique in having a layer of f alluvial clay covering a site deposit which, on the basis of the test F excavations, appeared to date exclusively to the Archaic period. | Because unmixed Archaic components are very rare in the Project area, further excavations were recommended, 71 The portion of site 41FT200 that was excavated during Season IV appears to have been occupied on a number of occasions during the Archaic period, and perhaps until as late as A.D. 700. Substantial Middle and Late Archaic period occupations are indicated by the recovered projectile points. The San Patrice and Wells points may represent a minor Early Archaic component. Vertical stratification does not seem to be represented by the distributions of expanding stem and contracting stem projectile points. Site 41FT200 is one of only two RCAP sites where Middle Archaic diagnostics (expanding stem dart points) dominated the projectile point assemblage. The other was Site 41NV96. The recovery of ceramics was unexpected, but the eight shell tempered sherds are not inconsistent with the Gary dart points. These sherds seem to represent a relatively late occupation, but one prior to A.D. 700. The single grog tempered sherd is more difficult to explain. It may be that the upper clay zone was deposited over this portion of the site at a considerably later time than had been thought. The absence of other Late Prehistoric period diagnostics, however, suggests that the recovered artifacts represent an essentially pure Archaic period assemblage. This assemblage has been used to investigate chronological changes in lithic technology and raw material utilization (see Chapters 16 and 17). The rather ephemeral nature of the site's features, when compared with sites dating later in time, is interpreted as evidence of short term occupations by relatively mobile groups. The occupants were almost certainly hunter-gatherers, but the poor preservation of animal and plant remains has prevented an adequate reconstruction of the subsistence economy. The burned rock concentrations were probably hearths used in processing and cooking. Similar features have not been common at Project area sites dating later in time. The substantial amounts of lithic debris and the cores, including the cache from Feature 1, are evidence that lithic tool production was also an important activity at site 41FT200.

EXCAVATIONS AT 41NV96 by Marilee Irvine and Daniel E. McGregor, with contributions by James E. Bruseth and Phillip Murry ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Site 41NV96 is located on a large terrace projection overlook - ing the floodplain of Richland Creek. The terrace surface consists of a series of four sand covered knolls surrounded by slightly depressed areas of clay. Most of the site area is in pasture, but the many large tree roots encountered during excavation indicate that this situation has not existed for long. A narrow strip along the northern terrace edge remains forested. The adjacent floodplain is heavily wooded and is dissected by a number of sloughs. The pre - sent channel of Richland Creek is located about 6 km north of the site. , SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS The site was first recorded by SMU in 1974 on the basis of information provided by Mr. Bill Young of Corsicana, Texas. The diagnostic artifacts in Mr, Young's surface collection indicated occupations during the Late Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. The site was tested during the 1980-81 season (McGregor et al. 1982: 39-40). Eighteen 40 x 40 cm shovel test units and two 1 x 1 m units were excavated across the site, which indicated that cultural materials were contained primarily within the sandy loam deposits atop the knolls. The stratigraphy of these knolls was the usual terrace sequence of a sandy loam A horizon (averaging about 30 cm in depth) underlain by a sandy clay B horizon. The artifacts were distributed throughout the sandy loam deposit, with a few occurring in the upper few cm of the B horizon. Artifacts diagnostic of both the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric periods were recovered. No evidence of natural stratification was detectable within the sandy loam A horizon. In general, the expanding and contracting stem dart points of the Late Archaic period were recovered from 3 levels lower than the arrow points of the Late Prehistoric period, but the vertical distributions of these groups did overlap. It is suggested that the materials from both components were originally deposited on the same ground surface, and that their present vertical distributions are the result of the differential downward movement of artifacts due to pedoturbation within the relatively loose sandy loam A horizon. The greater density of the sandy clay B horizon is thought to have impeded this downward displacement. Mr. Young's surface collection contained a large, unfluted, lanceolate projectile point diagnostic of the Late Paleo-Indian period and several artifacts presumed to be Early Archaic in age. Similar materials were not recovered from the test excavations, Later discussions with Mr. Young indicated that most of these early materials were collected from a single small knoll (Knoll D in Figure 7-1). Only one shovel test unit had been excavated there during testing. Limited additional excavations were recommended at site 4INV96 for the purpose of locating additional early materials and to investigate further the vertical distributions of temporal components. EXCAVATION STRATEGY Twenty-three 1 x 1 m units (Unit 21-43) were excavated to investigate the site deposits associated with the four knolls (Figure 7-1). Vertical control was achieved by excavating in arbitrary 10 cm levels, All units were excavated at least one level into the underlying clay deposit. All excavated fill was passed through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh screens. In addition to the hand excavated units, a series of 16 backhoe trenches (Units 44-59) was excavated to examine site stratigraphy and to search for possible features. These trenches were placed both on top of and down the slopes of the knolls, providing a more complete picture of the site's Stratigraphy. Fifty-eight person-days were expended during the investigation of site 4INV96.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS SITE STRATIGRAPHY The stratigraphy of the knolls consisted of a sandy loam A horizon overlying a sandy clay B horizon. In general, the A horizon was deepest atop the knolls and thinned out downslope. Erosion appears to have removed the A horizon from the low- lying areas between the knolls where clay is exposed at the surface. The depth of the A horizon averaged about 30 cm, but was considerably deeper in certain areas. On top of Knoll A the sandy loam was 60 cm deep in Units 28 and 32. It was relatively shallow across most of Knoll B, except for a small area investigated by Units 34 and 48 where it was 70 cm deep. The A horizon was quite shallow over most of Knoll C. However, in Unit 41 on the western slope of this knoll the sand clay was encountered at 80 cm below the surface. The A horizon was very shallow in all units excavated on Knoll D, reaching a maximum depth of 30 cm in Unit 24. This large amount of variability in the thickness of the sandy loam A horizon is not the result of cultural activities. Instead, the profiles of the numerous backhoe trenches depicted a gently undulating surface of the sandy clay B horizon that appears to be a natural feature of the terrace deposit. ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS A complete tabulation of all artifacts by provenience is presented in Appendix F (Table F-6). The lithic tools and ceramics are described in detail below. LITHIC TOOLS Arrow Points Cliffton (2 specimens). Both of these chert specimens were fashioned from small flakes by retouching that was primarily unifacial.

These complete specimens have straight-sided, rectangular stems. One chert specimen is rather crudely made and lacks shoulders. Its base is straight. The second chert specimen is missing the distal portion of its blade, and has a convex base. One blade shoulder is broken, but the other is prominent. The other specimen has a slightly convex base, convex blade edges, and poorly developed shoulders. Materials: chert (2), Pisgah Ridge chert (1). Proveniences: Surface, 32.7, 34.6. Untyped, Fragmentary (2 specimens). These specimens are missing most of their blades and stems. They resemble the specimen classified as Dawson in terms of both their narrowness and their short, laterally projecting shoulders. Materials: quartzite (1), Pisgah Ridge chert (1). Proveniences: 24.1, 34.3. Finished Bifaces Gouges (2 specimens, Figure 7-2g,h). Both specimens have prominent, steeply chipped bits and are roughly triangular in outline. The lateral edges and proximal ends have been formed by bifacial chipping. One specimen compares favorably with the Clear Fork type defined by Ray (1941), and identified from Archaic period sites in the region (Crook and Harris 1952:18; Story 1965:210). The second specimen closely resembles the Gossett type defined by Story (1965:208-210). The flat ventral surface of this specimen retains the nodular cortex except along its bifacially flaked edges and proximal end. The upper surface also retains an area of cortex. Materials: both are quartzite. Proveniences: 32.6 (Clear Fork type), 37.3 (Gossett type). Knives (3 specimens). All of these specimens have straight blade edges formed by fine secondary retouch. The two broken chert specimens are pointed distal portions of the tools. The complete quartzite specimen is roughly triangular in outline, and its proximal end retains the nodular cortex. Proveniences: 20.2, 36.3, 41.6. Aborted Bifaces Early Stage (2 specimens), These quartzite specimens are thick and somewhat irregular in outline, and retain cortex on one or both faces. The edges are sinuous and lack evidence of secondary retouch. Proveniences: 20.2, 41.6.

Proveniences: surface (3), 28.7, 37.2, 38.2, 41.4, 41.6, 48 (backhoe trench). CERAMICS (by James E. Bruseth) A sample of 26 sherds was recovered from site 41NV96. Proveniences and selected attributes for these sherds are presented in Table 7-1 (see Appendix B of this volume for a discussion of these attributes). The majority of the sherds are undecorated, with medium to coarse texture pastes and with grog, bone, and grit temper combinations. Dominant exterior and interior sherd colors include shades of brown (LOYR6/4, 10YR5/2) and gray (1OYRS5/1, 10YR3/1), while core colors are darker (1OYR3/2, 10YR3/1). Sherd thickness ranges from 5.5 to 8.8 mm, with an average of 6.7 mm. Only two decorated sherds were found, both incised: one with lines vertically oriented (at right angles) to the rim, and one with lines of unknown orientation. The small size of the decorated sherds makes it impossible to associate them with established ceramic types (cf., Suhm and Jelks 1962). Overall, the ceramic assemblage at 41NV96 is similar to those from most other sites within the reservoir. The ceramic assemblage belongs to a tradition of grog, bone, and grit tempered utility wares defined for the reservoir and discussed in Chapter 15 of this volume. These ceramics were occasionally decorated on the rims with simple incisions and punctations, and where specimens are large enough to discern affinity to established types, they conform to Canton Incised and Maydelle Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962). A temporal range of A. D. 900 to 1600 is proposed for this ceramic tradition. ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS When work at 41NV96 began, it was hoped that vertical separation between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric components could be demonstrated, especially for those areas of the site where the sandy loam deposit was relatively deep. This did not prove to be the case. Late Prehistoric period diagnostic artifacts (arrow points and ceramics) were relatively rare at the site. Despite this rarity, there were several instances where ceramics were recovered from levels below Archaic period expanding stem dart points. Specifically, this occurred in Units 32, 20, and 41 on Knolls A, B, and C, respectively. Reversals in the stratigraphic location of contracting and expanding stem dart points were even more common. As a result, it appears that the terrace deposit was not aggrading during the period when site 41NV96 was occupied. Instead, the vertical distribution of artifacts seems to be the result of their differential downward displacement from a common depositional surface as a result of natural soil mixing processes. Artifact density was highest for the central knoll (Knoll B). This knoll and the western knoll (Knoll C) contained the greatest variety of diagnostic materials, with both expanding and contracting stem dart points, arrow points, and ceramics se ht el elle wv. =.) gm

Apart from three sherds, diagnostic f material form the northeastern knoll (Knoll A) consisted of f expanding and straight stem dart points and a Clear Fork gouge.

Only | the two units (Units 24 and 30) located on top of this knoll | contained even moderate amounts of material. The other five units excavated in this area were either sterile or contained only a few pieces of lithic debris. Diagnostic artifacts were recovered from Unit 24, consisting of a contracting stem Dawson dart point, a f contracting stem Gary dart point, and an expanding stem Yarbrough dart point. FAUNAL REMAINS (by Phillip Murry) Bone preservation at site 41NV96 was generally very poor with few identifiable elements (Table 7-2). The few fragments that were identifiable are discussed in the following text. From Unit 32 (Knoll A) a small amount of unbumed bone was collected in levels 4 and 6, with a whitetail deer ulna located within the latter level. No additional bone was recovered from any of the other units located on Knolls A or D. None of the units from Knoll B contained more than a trace (less than 1 g) of fragmentary bone. The only significant amount of bone from the site was within Unit 41 (Knoll C).

78 INTERPRETATIONS The recovered artifacts suggest a relatively substantial Archaic period utilization of site 41NV96. Comparatively minor occupation during the Late Prehistoric period is indicated by three arrow points and 26 sherds. Site 41NV96 was one of only two sites excavated at Richland Creek in which expanding stem dart points dominated the projectile point assemblage. The other was site 41FT200 (see Chapter 6). The time range of these expanding stem forms has not been established for the Project area, but a Late, or possibly even Middle Archaic time frame is suggested. Other than a single Clear Fork gouge and a Wells dart point, no definite Early Archaic materials were recovered from the excavations. Early Volume II, Part One materials do occur in Mr. Young's surface collection from these knolls, including two Waco Sinkers and a large, unfluted, lanceolate projectile point. The vertically mixed nature of the site deposit makes it impossible to assign the nondiagnostic artifacts to individual components. The interpretive value of the site is further diminished by a lack of features and a scarcity of subsistence information. However, because of the dominance of Archaic period diagnostics, the site assemblage itself has been useful for other studies. In Chapters 15 and 16, the lithic assemblage from 41NV96 is one of three Archaic period samples that are used to identify chronological changes in lithic tool assemblages and raw material utilization.

ne sd, it yal 1er ce aic for | to aw EXCAVATIONS AT 41NV139, THE FROSSARD SITE by Daniel E. McGregor and David R. Pheasant ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Site 41NV139 is located withia the alluvial floodplain deposits that form the east bank of the present channel of Chambers Creek. Within the channel at this location, an erosional bench of brown clay is present between the creek and the steep cut bank (Figure 8- 1). Along the eastern edge of this bench, a shallow erosional gully has formed at the base of the cut bank. Archaeological materials were first.observed within this gully. The bench surface is highest immediately .o the west of the gully, where a slightly elevated area is capped by a thin mantle of recent alluvial sediments. The channel itself is generally free of vegetation. The floodplain surrounding the site was densely forested prior to recent clearing associated with reservoir construction. SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS The site was originally discovered by Mr. Woody Frossard, and was recorded by SMU during the 1980 survey. At that time lithic debris, fire cracked rock, and a Gary dart point were found within the shallow erosional gully at the base of the cut bank. Site 41NV139 had been visited on three other occasions prior to the Season IV field work. It was one of two stream bank sites at which preliminary geological and palynological investigations were conducted at the beginning of the 1980 survey. A backhoe trench (Unit 5) was excavated at that time to expose a stratigraphic/soil section from which columns of soil samples were extracted. Two sets of samples were taken; one for geological analyses (grain size and soil chemistry), and the other for pollen analysis. The results of geological studies at site 41NV139 figured prominently in the development of the initial model of the Holocene depositional history of the Project area floodplains 79 (Pheasant 1982a). The initial results of the pollen work were considered to be promising, and have been reported in Raab et al. (1982). Archaeological testing of 41NV139 was conducted in 1981 (McGregor et al. 1982:41), The primary purpose of this work was to determine whether the site contained in situ archaeological deposits that could be used to date the geological and palynological sequences. Test excavations consisted of two 40 x 40 cm units, one 1X 1 m unit, and one 0.5 x 1 m unit (see Figure 8-1). The results of these limited test excavations suggested that the bench area was the intact lower portion of floodplain alluvial deposits from which the upper deposit had been eroded away. Within this bench deposit, cultural remains were encountered at three different vertical levels. The lowest of these consisted of a rock filled hearth (Feature 1) exposed by test Unit 2. Charcoal from this feature yielded a radiocarbon date of 1690 + 120 B.C. (McGregor et al. 1982:41). Unit 1 sampled a lens of mussel shell and charcoal that was 30 cm above the level of the dated hearth. This shell deposit extended back into the bank for an undetermined distance. An apparently in situ concentration of artifacts, consisting of lithic debris, fire cracked rock, and mussel shell was found in Unit 4, just below the bench surface and at a higher elevation than either the hearth or the shell lens, In addition, two Gary dart points were collected from the surface of the erosional gully near Unit 4. Additional geological and palynological investigations were conducted in 1982, during Season I of mitigation. A backhoe trench (Unit 6) was cut into the creek bank, exposing almost 5 m of floodplain alluvial deposits in profile. This stratigraphic/soil section is described in a later section of this site report. Pollen samples were taken from all identified stratigraphic zones. These were analyzed in an attempt to replicate, and perhaps refine, the results of the initial pollen study. The results of the pollen analysis, discussed in Chapter 5 of Volume I, suggested distinct limitations on the usefulness of pollen data derived from stream bank sediments for reconstructing environmental change.

EXCAVATION STRATEGY The objective of Season {V field work at site 41NV139 was to investigate further the Archaic period deposits in the northern part of the site. This was the area in which a hearth (Feature 1), anda lens of mussel shell and charcoal had been discovered eroding from the clay bench. The research design called for mechanically stripping a portion of the bench area down to the level of the shell lens. From there, excavation of the shell lens and deeper deposits was to be done by hand. A backhoe was used to remove 1-1.5 m of overburden from an area measuring 4 x 8 m (see Figure 8-1). The shell lens originally encountered in test Unit 1 was found to be present throughout the northern half of this area. A rock and charcoal filled hearth (Feature 2) also was discovered at about the same depth as the shell deposit. Elevations were taken using a transit and stadia rod. Unfortunately, the planned hand excavations were never accomplished. A period of heavy rain resulted in the inundation of the site before this work would be initiated, and the field season ended before the floodwaters receded. A total of 10 person-days was required for all phases of field work. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS STRATIGRAPHY AND SOILS (by David R. Pheasant) The primary stratigraphic/soi!l section for 41NV139 was located at the east end of Unit 6 (see Figure 8-1). It extended from the surface of the floodplain to a depth of 4.91 m (Figure 8-2). It Velume III, Part One was alkaline and calcareous, with pH ranging from 7.1 to 7.6. Fragmented gastropod and mussel shefls occurred in many of the horizons. The section had been affected by groundwater processes, as was shown by mottling throwghout the profile and the development of calcareous nodules im the lower horizons. The soil profile formed in several layers of alluvium which were deposited intermittently durimg the late Holocene. The alluvial deposits vary from heavy elay (72% clay) to fine sandy loam. Buried paleosols and paleosurfaces oceur within this section. The full field description of the profile is given below.

STRATIGRAPHY The soil section is divided into five major alluvial units. Units I, I] and ITE are separated by distinct geologic discontinuities which are also buried paleosurfaces. Units II], 1V, and V have more gradual transitions. Lesser alluvial changes have been noted within each alluvial unit. . Alluvial Unit I is the youngest and uppermost. It contains at least two, and perhaps three depositional changes. The upper 4 cm 8&3 represent a recent overbank deposit and retain some sedimentary bedding. The whole of Unit I is almost certainly historic. Alluvial Unit I is separated from Unit II by an abrupt and smooth boundary. The boundary is a geologic discontinuity and a paleosurface of possible historic age. The paleosurface has been termed the Chambers Paleosurface (see Figure 8-2). Alluvial Unit II extends from 39 cm to 172 cm below the surface, It is composed of clay, although as much as 20% variation in the texture has been found (Tables 8-1 and 8-2). Between 63 and 108 cm below the surface, the alluvium may be different from that immediately above and below it. It is also possible that these two levels correspond with two additional paleosurfaces. Alluvial Unit I is separated from Unit III by a clearly defined paleosurface; it is a major geologic discontinuity in the floodplain stratigraphy, termed the Navarro Paleosurface. Unit III is composed of the heaviest and blackest clay in the section; it is almost 1 m thick. The boundary between Units III and IV is poorly defined; it is a gradual transition and there is no recognizable paleosurface. Alluvial Unit IV is a less heavy clay than Unit III, and it is not black; obviously it represents an earlier period of creek deposition, although how much earlier is not known. There is a considerable variation of texture within this unit. The transition between Units IV and V is also gradual. The matrix appears to have been disturbed in the transitional zone. A hearth some 10 cm below the assumed surface of Unit V suggests that at one time a paleosurface may have existed close to this level. Alluvial Unit V is coarser than Units II, IN, and IV and more homogeneous than IV. It has a sandy clay loam texture. SOILS The section contains a surface soil and two buried paleosols. The surface soil consists of an aggrading A horizon and is coextensive with geologic Unit I. The soil is 39 cm thick and has relatively uniform amounts of organic matter throughout (see Table 8-1). The soil is divided into Al, Al2 and A13 horizons. The 4 cm thick Al horizon is a recent alluvium and retains some of its sedimentary bedding structure. Calcium carbonate, phosphorus and pH values are similar throughout this historic soil. Below the Chambers Paleosurface is the uppermost of the two buried paleosols. This is termed the Chambers Paleosol and is coextensive with geologic Unit II. It consists of Alb, Al2b, A13b Table 8-1 GRAIN SIZE AND Som.

The soil is calcareous and has pH values between 7.5 and 7.6. The organic phosphorus content is 25 to 30% higher in the upper part of the paleosol than in the lower part; possibly because it is close to a paleosurface. The Chambers Paleosol is an immaturely developed soil; the length of its development probably can be measured in hundreds of years. The second and lower of the two paleosols lies beneath the Navarro Paleosurface. this buried paleosol is termed the Navarro Paleosol. The upper part of the Navarro Paleosol is a black clay with a high organic content. The organic matter decreases with depth. The pH is close to neutral, but the soil is calcareous with increasing amounts of calcium carbonate with depth. Below the IIICib horizon there are no major pedogenic features. Groundwater effects become more important, with mottling and the development of calcareous nodules. In the VC4b and VC5b horizons calcium carbonate powder coats the sandy clay loam matrix. This fine powder is groundwater deposited, possibly from lateral percolation of creek waters. COMPARISON OF STRATIGRAPHIC/SOIL SECTIONS AT SITES 41FT193 AND 41NV139 The stratigraphic/soil section at site 41NV139 is very similar to that of site 41FT193 (Chapter 4). Five stratigraphic units were distinguished at 41NV139 compared to six at 41FT193. However, three of these units at 41FT193 (Units Il, III, and IV) were subsumed within Unit II at 41NV139, and two disconformities arguably were present within the latter, but were not designated as such. Unit | is of recent historic age at both sites, and some of the original alluvial structure is still visible. These units are coarser than the lower units in both sections. Unit I is thicker at 41FT193 (77 cm) than at 4INV139 (39 cm). The dense black clay of Unit III at 41NV139 is equivalent to Unit V at 41FT193. Both units are similar in texture, color, thickness, and other soil/geological characteristics. The upper disconformity was termed the Navarro Paleosurface, but neither the paleosol nor the paleosurface is believed to have taken long to form. Beneath this dense black clay zone are Unit IV at 41NV139 and Unit VI at 41FT193. Both units are subdivided into upper and lower horizons. These units are very similar except that the lower horizon at 41FT193 (VIC2b) was darker in color. An equivalent darker horizon was not recognized at 41NV139. Unit VI was the lowest unit exposed in the stratigraphic/soil section at 41FT193. There are great similarities between the two sections, even though they are located more than 10 km apart with a difference in floodplain elevation of about 7 m. Because of these similarities, it is reasonable to suggest that the floodplains of both Richland Creek and Chambers Creek had a similar depositional history during the latter part of the Holocene. The paleoecological implications of the floodplain deposits are discussed in Chapter 5 of Volume 1. FEATURES Three features were identified at site 41NV139. All were small concentrations of burned rock and charcoal that appear to have been hearths. Feature 1 was discovered eroding from the edge of the bench during test excavations. The western half of this feature had been destroyed by erosion, but the remaining portion was roughly semicircular in plan and measured about 60 cm in diameter. The top of Feature 1 was measured at 474 cm below the surface. Charcoal from this feature was radiocarbon dated to 1690 +120 B.C. Feature 2 was discovered during the Season IV backhoe block excavation at the northern end of the site. This concentration of burned rock and charcoal was exposed only partially and was awaiting further excavation when the work had to be abandoned. The shape and dimensions could not be determined, but the elevation was 445 cm below the floodplain surface. This hearth was in direct association with the lens of mussel shell and charcoal which varied in elevation between 436 cm and 445 cm below the surface. ; Feature 3 was exposed in profile in the backhoe trench, Unit 6. It was a basin-shaped concentration of charcoal and fire cracked rock measuring 35 cm in diameter and 25 cm in maximum depth. The top of the feature was 395 cm below the surface. ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS Very few artifacts were recovered from site 41NV139 (Table 8-3). Units 2 and 3 contained no artifacts whatsoever, although Feature 2 was exposed in Unit 2. All of the five lithic tools described below were collected from the surface. 41 a ocy | | y ye iF > we <3]

INTERPRETATIONS The stratigraphic/soil section described for site 4INV139 is representative of the upper 4.91-m of alluvium in this portion of 8&5 the Chambers Creek floodplain. It is very similar to the section at site 41FT193 on Richland Creek (see Chapter 4), In fact, this same alluvial sequence recurs with minor variation along the channels of both Richland and Chambers Creeks throughout the Project area (Pheasant 1982a). The most outstanding and consistent feature of this sequence is the layer of dense black clay which has been designated Unit ITI at site 4INV139. A series of backhoe trenches cut into the Richland Creek floodplain at varying distances south of site 41FT193 indicated that this dense black clay zone extends throughout the floodplain area. It was similar in depth, in thickness, and in other depositional characteristics everywhere it was examined. A series of radiocarbon dates from site 41FT193 (see Chapter 4) suggests that the dense black clay zone was deposited between approximately A.D. 600 and A.D. 1800. A similar time range is assumed for the deposition of Unit III at site 41NV139. The environmental implications of this black clay layer, in combination with the results of paleoenvironmental research that has been undertaken at bogs located outside of the reservoir, are discussed in Chapter 6 of Volume I. The clay bench area at 41NV139 is the in situ lower portion of the alluvial sequence from which the upper 3-4 m has been eroded away. The alluvium containing the shell lens and two hearths (Features 1 and 2) correlates with Unit V in the stratigraphic/soil section. These archaeological remains were stratigraphically lower than the earliest sampled portion of the 41FT193 site deposit (ca. 170 B.C.). The 1690 + 120 B.C. date from Feature 1 reinforces the view that these remains date to an earlier period. Site 41INV139 offered an opportunity to extend the study of creekside occupations back into the Late Archaic, and possibly even the Middle Archaic period. Unfortunately, the heavy rains and flooding of the site in December, 1984, forced the abandonment of excavations before a more extensive portion of the shell lens, and an associated hearth, could be investigated. Because of this, very little can be said about the nature of occupation, other than the fact that site 41NV139 was a creekside campsite that was visited on several occasions during the Archaic period. Small, rock filled hearths were constructed, and mussels were collected and processed. There was no evidence whatsoever that the site was occupied during the subsequent Late Prehistoric period.

EXCAVATIONS AT 41NV160 by Daniel E. McGregor, with a contribution by James E. Bruseth ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Site 41NV160 is located on a series of low sandy knolls within the Richland Creek floodplain, approximately 1.2 km south of the present creek channel. Known locally as "Little Island Field," these small knolis provide a dry, elevated position during periods of flooding. Ground cover at the site consists of grasses, greenbriar, and woody shrubs, with an overstory of pecan trees. SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS The site was tested during the 1980-81 field season by a series of 22 40 x 40 cm shovel test units and a single 1 x 1 m unit (McGregor et al. 1982:42-43). Artifacts diagnostic of both the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods were recovered from a deposit consisting of approximately 90 cm of sandy loam overlying clay in the units located atop the knolls. Shovel test units placed in the low-lying areas between the sandy knolls encountered floodplain clay and were essentially devoid of artifacts. The vertical distribution of temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered from the 1 x 1 m unit (Unit 1) suggested that a separation of the Archaic and Late Prehistoric assemblages was present. Ceramics and arrow points were confined to the upper 40 cm of the unit, whereas dart points were the only temporal diagnostics recovered from below this level. Additional excavation was recommended at site 41NV160 to investigate further this possible component separation. EXCAVATION STRATEGY Four 1 x 1 m units were excavated during the 1983-84 field season. In addition, two backhoe trenches were excavated to provide a more adequate profile of the site deposit. 87 All 1 x 1 m units were excavated in 10 cm-vertical levels, and the matrix was dry-screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) hardware cloth. From each level, a soil sample of 10 1 was collected and subsequently water-screened through 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) mesh. Units 30 and 31 were placed a short distance to the north and south respectively, of the earlier 1 x 1 m test unit (Figure 9-1). The sandy knoll in this portion of the site appeared to be the most promising based upon the testing results. Unit 33 was located atop a second knoll approximately 30 m to the north. All three of these units were excavated down into the clay substratum. Unit 32 was placed adjacent to Unit 30 to expose further a concentration of animal bone encountered in the upper levels of the latter unit. These bones later were determined to be the remains of a modern cow. Excavation of Unit 32 was terminated at 30 cm below the surface. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS SITE STRATIGRAPHY A backhoe trench (Unit 34) excavated into the main knoll revealed a profile of approximately 85 cm of sandy loam. overlying a clay substratum (Figure 9-2). Unit 35 was a backhoe trench located in the low area between two knolls. Its profile consisted entirely of the black vertisol clay (Trinity clay) that covers most of the Richland Creek floodplain. The elevated knolls at site 41NV160 appear to be eroded Pleistocene terrace remnants surrounded by more recent floodplain clay deposits. FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS The only feature recognized at site 41NV160 was a concentration of large animal bones located between 20 and 40 cm below the surface in the two adjacent Units 30 and 32. These faunal remains were later determined to be unrelated to the prehistoric occupation of the site.

90 Multifaceted (1 specimen). Material: quartzite. Provenience: 1.7. Core Fragment (1 specimen). Material: chert. Provenience: 30.4, CERAMICS (by James E. Bruseth) A total of 17 sherds was recovered from 41NV160. Proveniences and selected attributes for the sherds are listed in Table 9-1 (see Appendix B for a discussion of these attributes). Three paste textures, with associated differences in temper, are observed in the ceramic assemblage. Two sherds have a coarse texture and are tempered with grog and grit; the grit consists of fragments of hematite. These two sherds, undoubtedly part of the same vessel, have a distinctive, dark reddish brown (2.5YR3/2) color on the interior and exterior. The core color is lighter (2.5YR4/8). Both sherds are undecorated. Eight sherds have a medium textured, sandy paste. The interior, exterior, and core colors of these ceramics are a very dark grayish brown (1OYR3/2). All are undecorated. The final paste grouping consists of six sherds with a grog and grit temper combination and medium to coarse texture. Three of these sherds are decorated, with methods of decoration including punctations (pointed instrument) and brushing (see Table 9-1). Exterior colors range from light yellowish brown (10YR6/4) to dark grayish brown (10YR4/2); interior colors range from very dark grayish brown (10 YR3/2) to biack (1OYR2/1); core colors are dark (1OYR3/1, 10YR2/1). Sherd thickness ranges from 4.8 to 13 mm, with an average of 7.6 mm. The sandy paste sherds tend to be thinner than other paste types. With the exception of the hematite tempered sherds, the ceramics from the site are similar to other sites within the reservoir. Since the hematite tempered wares are unique and not common at other sites, we are not able to make chronological inferences about these sherds. The grog and sand tempered ceramics, on the other hand, do enable some chronological inferences to be made. The sandy paste wares, as outlined in Chapter 15, are proposed to date before A.D. 1000. The grog tempered sherds are part of a larger ceramic tradition that existed within the reservoir from A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1600. ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS Artifact counts by unit and level are presented in Appendix F (Table F-8). The lithic tools and ceramics have been described in the preceding section of this site report. Artifact density was considerably higher for Units 30, 31, and 32 than it was for Unit 33. Unfortunately, the site deposit appears to have been far more mixed than the testing results had indicated. This can be demonstrated best by the vertical distribution of temporally diagnostic artifacts within Unit 31. An expanding stem Yarbrough dart point was recovered from Level 4. Level 5 contained an untyped dart point, a contracting stem Gary point, a fragmentary arrow point, and six sherds. An additional sherd was recovered from Level 7 of this unit. Once this vertical mixing of the site deposit had been recognized, excavation of the site was terminated. SUBSISTENCE INFORMATION Preservation of both botanical and faunal materials at site 41NV160 was generally poor. Eight grams of wood charcoal from Level 2 of Unit 33 represent the only recovered macrobotanical material. Faunal materials consisted almost entirely of the remains of a modem cow from Units 30 and 32. Eighteen grams of fragmentary bone were recovered from the 40-50 cm level of Unit 31; none of the bone was identifiable as to species.

The expanding stem dart point styles (Ellis, Marshall, Williams, and Yarbrough) are thought to date to the Late Archaic period, and to predate the contracting stem, Gary style dart points. Occupation during the subsequent Late Prehistoric period is represented by the recovered arrow points and ceramics. The results of test excavations had suggested that the assemblages resulting from the Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations might be vertically separated within the site deposit. It was hoped that further excavations would recover assemblages of tools, debris, and subsistence data which could be assigned to particular temporal components. This was not possible due to the mixed nature of the site deposit. The recovered artifacts can be considered only as a mixed multicomponent assemblage and, as such, have somewhat limited interpretive value. The substantial amounts of lithic debris, the aborted bifaces, and the cores are evidence that lithic tool production took place at the site. The complete and broken bifacial and unifacial tools probably were used at the site, although the activities performed with these tools cannot be reconstructed satisfactorily. The almost complete lack of faunal and floral remains precludes any interpretations concerning subsistence practices. Site 41NV160 is located on a series of elevated knolls in the floodplain of Richland Creek. Although somewhat limited in size, these knolls provided an excellent location from which floodplain resources could be exploited easily. The diagnostic artifacts suggest that this location was visited repeatedly over a period of perhaps 3,000 years. Unfortunately, the lack of features, subsistence data, and component separation makes more detailed interpretations impossible.

McGregor, with contributions by James E. Bruseth and Phillip Murry ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Site 4INV171 is located on the edge of a T1 terrace ridge that extends into the Chambers Creek floodplain (Figure 10-1). The old stream bed of Chambers Creek, which predates recent channelization, is located at the base of the terrace. The creek has created a steep erosional bank along the site's northwestern edge. At the time of the 1981 testing, the far northern part of the site remained wooded, while the rest of the site was largely cleared and used for pasture. The wooded area was cleared prior to the initiation of mitigation phase excavations, facilitating a more comprehensive investigation of the site area. The stratigraphy for the upper part of the site consists largely of a shallow, sandy loam A horizon overlying a clay B horizon. In the southern area of the site, artifacts are confined to the upper 20 to 30 cm which represents the sandy loam stratum. The northern portion of the site along the terrace edge has a somewhat different stratigraphy. Here the sandy loam is underlain by a sandy clay containing small gravel and caliche inclusions. The artifact- bearing deposit is deeper in this area (up to 70 cm). The associated soil type at this site is Crockett fine sandy loam. A high degree of rodent burrowing was evident throughout the site in the excavations. SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS The site was originally recorded during the 1980 survey of the Richland/Chambers Reservoir area. Subsequent test excavations consisted of 19 40 x 40 cm shovel tests, two 1 x 1 m units, and two backhoe trenches (McGregor et al. 1982:45). Unit 13, a40 x 40 cm unit in the central portion of the site, was substantially deeper than the surrounding test units, so a 1 x 1 m unit, Unit 20, was excavated in the general vicinity to investigate a possible cultural depression. The two backhoe trenches, Units 21 and 22, also were excavated to investigate this depression. Although artifacts were noted as deep 91 as 70 cm, no convincing pit profile or other evidence of a feature was observed. Two 40 x 40 units, Units 17 and 18, and a1 x 1 m unit, Unit 19, were excavated along the northwestern edge of the site in the wooded area. The sandy loam deposit was deeper (70-80 cm) with artifacts recovered from the upper 70 cm. Disturbance due to rodent burrowing was evident in the different units, but cultural Stratification was suggested by the vertical distribution of artifacts. Faunal preservation from this area was also good, and recovered specimens included species associated with woodland, grassland, and aquatic habitats (Murry 1982:235). Artifacts diagnostic of both the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods were recovered from the test excavations, with vertical stratification of the northern deposit suggested by the provenience of dart points versus arrow points and ceramics (McGregor et al. 1982:44). It was recommended that further excavations should concentrate on the deeper, and apparently less disturbed, deposits located along the northern edge of the site. EXCAVATION STRATEGY During Season II, 10 1 x 1 m units and six backhoe trenches were excavated to investigate further the archaeological potential of site 41NV171 (see Figure 10-1). Five of the 1 x 1 m units (24-27 and 29) and all six backhoe trenches were located in the more promising northern portion of the sité. Three 1 x 1 m units (28, 31, and 32) were placed along the terrace edge above the former channel of Chambers Creek. This area had been inaccessible during testing because of the dense tree and ground cover which had since been cleared from the site. Two additional 1 x 1 m units (30 and 33) were located to investigate the site deposits on the higher elevations of the terrace ridge. All of the 1 x 1 m units were excavated in 10 cm levels, and the matrix was passed through 1/4 in (6.4 mm) screens. The backhoe trenches, Units 34-39, were excavated in order to provide stratigraphic profiles of the terrace deposit in the northern part of the site. A total of 21 person-days was expended at site 41NV171.

Map of 41NV171 showing testing phase excavation units (gray) and Season II excavation units (black). RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS SITE STRATIGRAPHY The Pleistocene terrace deposits of site 41NV171 form a ridge that projects northeastward into the Chambers Creek floodplain. The southern part of the site exhibits a stratigraphy that is common for terrace deposits in the Project area. This consists of a sandy loam A horizon (20-30 cm deep) overlying a clay enriched B horizon. Downslope in the northern end of the site, the B horizon is considerably sandier and contains small and medium-sized gravel inclusions. Minor amounts of small-sized gravel are also present within the sandy loam A horizon in this area. As excavation proceeded it became clear that rodent burrowing was a serious problem in all areas of the site. This was especially true for the artifact-bearing A horizon, and was also evident to a lesser degree in the sandier B horizon of the northern part of the site. FEATURES A concentration of ash and flecks of charcoal were encountered between 20 and 40 cm below the surface in the northern half of Unit 24. This portion of the A horizon had been disturbed so badly by rodent activity that neither the outline nor the profile of this possible feature could be defined clearly. Large amounts of animal bone, some of it bummed, and mussel shell were recovered from the same vertical levels of this unit. It was not possible to demonstrate that this ash concentration represented in situ burning, as the surrounding soil matrix appeared unaltered. Alternatively, this part of the site may represent a small midden into which the ash was redeposited. Volume LI, Part One ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS LITHIC TOOLS Arrow Points Fresno (2 specimens).

Bruseth) A total of 13 sherds was recovered from site 41NVI171. Proveniences and characteristics of the sherds are listed in Table 10-1 (see Appendix B for a discussion of these attributes). The majority of the sherds are undecorated, possess pastes of medium to coarse texture, and are tempered with combinations of grog, grit, and bone. Interior and exterior sherd colors range in the browns (7.5YR5/6, 10YR5/3) and the grays (10YR3/1, 7.5YR4/0); while core colors are darker, ranging between 10YR3/2 and 10YR2/1. Two decorated sherds were found: one punctated (blunt instrument), and one brushed. A single, sandy paste, undecorated sherd was also found. Sherd thickness ranges from 5.0 to 7.0 mm with an average of 6.1 mm. Although the interpretation of the ceramic assemblage from 41NV171 is hindered by the small sample size and the small size of individual sherds, the majority of the sherds seem to belong to a ceramic tradition of grog, grit, and bone tempered utility wares manufactured in the reservoir area between A.D. 1000 and 1600. The single, sandy paste sherd is similar to ceramics from pre-A.D. 1000 contexts (Chapter 15 of this volume discusses the ceramics from this and other sites, in more detail). Based on the ceramic data, there appears to have been several occupations of the site during the Late Prehistoric period. ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS A tabulation of the artifacts recovered from all excavation units at site 41NV171 is presented in Appendix F (F-9). The lithic tools and the ceramics have been described in the preceding section of this site report. As was found to be the case during testing, artifact density was highest in the northern part of the site. Units 24, 26, 29, and Test Unit 19 all contained relatively large numbers of artifacts and almost all of the faunal remains recovered from the site. Unit 27, although located between Units 19 and 24, contained relatively few artifacts and no faunal remains. Of the units placed along the western edge of the terrace (25, 28, 31, and 32), only Unit 31 contained a significant amount of material. But here, and in the units located upslope (30 and 33), the sandy loam A horizon was quite shallow (less than 30 cm) and faunal remains were not preserved. Because so few temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered, it is difficult to define any patterning in their spatial distributions. Archaic period dart points, and Late Prehistoric period arrow points and ceramics were recovered from both the northern and southern portions of the site. Some excavation units contained only

The vertical stratification of Late Prehistoric diagnostics above Archaic diagnostics that was noted for Test Unit 19 (McGregor et al. 1982:44) was not duplicated during the 1983 excavations. In fact, the only dart point recovered from these excavations was from level 2 of Unit 29, a level that also contained one arrow point (Fresno type) and two sherds. The extensive evidence of bioturbation (primarily rodent burrowing) noted during the excavations indicates that considerable vertical mixing of the site deposit has occurred. 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 FAUNAL REMAINS (by Phillip Murry) Test excavations during the 1980-81 field season yielded a diverse fauna, especially within Unit 19 (Murry 1982:235-326). Whitetail deer, pocket gopher, cotton rat, spiney lizard, racer, water snake, and gar remains all were found within that 1 x lm unit, indicating a diversity of utilized species. During the 1983 field season, only three of the five 1 x 1 m units excavated within the northern part of the site yielded faunal remains (Table 10-2). No fauna were recovered from any of the units located in other parts of the site. The identifiable elements are discussed in the following text. Table 10-2 SUMMARY OF FAUNAL REMAINS!

g Bo ¢386885 41NVI7I Only Unit 24, the northernmost unit, contained materials fapproaching the quantity and diversity of fauna recovered from est Unit 19. Identifiable bone was recovered from levels 1 fthrough 5 of Unit 24. Bone concentration was greatest in level 3 and decreased gradually to level 1 above, and level 5 below. A fish wertebra, most comparable to a medium-sized catfish (/ctalurus ‘sp.), was recovered from level 1. Within levels 2 through 4, ‘wumerous whitetail deer remains were found. These included a partial! mandible from level 2; a burned first phalynx, metapodial, and other longbone fragments from level 3; and two distal portions metapodials from level 4. In addition, turtle scutes were wecovered from levels 4 and 5. Unit 24 also contained the only mssel shell recovered from the 1983 excavations at this site. Very Hittle bone was recovered from Unit 29; although the distal tportions of a humerus and a femur of a cottontail rabbit were Sound in level 1, and whitetail deer molar fragments were found in el 2. Unit 26 contained minor amounts of fragmentary bone. EHlowever, bone density was low and preservation was such that no Mentifiable elements were recovered. In summary, identifiable faunal remains from 41NV171 are hose of whitetail deer, cottontail rabbit, turtle, mussel, fish, snake, ward, pocket gopher, and cotton rat. Whitetail deer dominates the passemblage, but the diversity of species is striking considering the velatively small sample size. The rodents may be intrusive since evidence of extensive burrowing was noted during the excavations. 95 INTERPRETATIONS Site 41NV171 appears to have been occupied during both the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric periods. Although the limited excavations conducted at this site recovered relatively few temporally diagnostic artifacts, those assignable to the Late Prehistoric period dominate the assemblage. Because of the mixed nature of the site deposit, it was not possible to assign the nondiagnostic materials to particular periods of occupation. A lack of definable features also limits the interpretive potential of the site. The low density of artifacts and the lack of definable midden deposits argue against relatively long term or intensive occu- pations of the site area. The site's location adjacent to the former channel of Chambers Creek is reflected by the faunal assemblage. Aquatic species included freshwater mussel, fish (gar and catfish), turtle, and watersnake, However, terrestrial species, most notably whitetail deer, dominate this assemblage. Identifiable elements of cottontail rabbit, spring lizard, pocket gopher, and cotton rat were recovered as well. The most reasonable interpretation for site 41NV171 is that it functioned as a temporary campsite where lithic tool production occurred (as evidenced by hammerstones, core fragments, aborted bifaces, and lithic debris) and a wide variety of animal (and probably plant) species were processed.

EXCAVATIONS AT 41NV173, THE LITTLE CEDAR CREEK SITE by Marilee Irvine and Daniel E. McGregor, with contributions by James E. Bruseth, Gayle J. Fritz, Richard Fullington, and Phillip Murry ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Site 41NV173 is located on the southem end of a terrace ridge - at the western edge of the Chambers Creek floodplain. The closest water source is Little Cedar Creek, an intermittent tributary of Chambers Creek that flows along the southern edge of this terrace. The present channel of Chambers Creek is located approximately 1.2 km east of the site. Much of the site area is in pasture, but a group of several large bois d'arc and hackberry trees is present along the crest of the terrace ridge in the north central part of the site. The site deposit consists of a sandy loam A horizon overlying a clay enriched B horizon. In the area around the trees the soil exhibits a dark, organic staining indicative of a midden soil. SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS The site was originally recorded by SMU during the 1980 survey. Test excavations performed during the 1980-81 field season consisted of 18 shovel test units (40 x 40 cm), two 1 x 1m units, and three backhoe trenches. The general site stratigraphy consisted of a shallow, sandy loam A horizon (about 30 cm deep) overlying a clay B horizon. The sandy loam A horizon was found to be considerably deeper in one area of the site. Backhoe trenching of this spot revealed the profile of a large pit with a maximum depth of 60 cm below the surface. The test excavations recovered substantial numbers of artifacts, including arrow and dart points, ceramics, lithic debris, and faunal materials. The density of ceramic artifacts at 41NV173 was the highest of any of the sites tested in the Richland/Chambers Reservoir area. The ceramic assemblage showed strong similarities to Caddoan materials reported from sites to the east and northeast of the Project area. Most of the recovered artifacts, as well as the possible midden deposit at this site, were thought to be associated with a Caddoan related, Late Prehistoric period component (McGregor et al. 1982:44-45), 97 EXCAVATION STRATEGY The excavation strategy devised for site 4INV173 evolved through several different stages, each determined from the results of the previous step. The initial stage was to establish a grid system for the site (Figure 11-1), A permanent datum was set, and a 20 m grid system was established using a transit and metric tape measure. Six 20 x 20 m blocks were established on the site to be used for reference. The next stage of investigations involved magnetic and electromagnetic conductivity (EM) surveys of the site area. Previous work at Bird Point Island (41FT201) had indicated that localized anomalies in both the magnetic and electromagnetic properties of soils often correlate with the locations of archacological features. Similar results were expected at 41NV173. The surveys at Little Cedar Creek were conducted over four 20 x 20 m blocks covering 1600 m2, Measurement of the magnetic field over the site was accomplished using two proton magnetometers. One magne- tometer remained stationary on the site to monitor the time fluctuations in the earth's magnetic field (diurnal drift). The second magnetometer measured the field over the survey area at 1 m intervals. The collected readings were first computer-corrected for diurnal drift, and then used to generate a color density contour map of the site’s magnetic field which keys the magnetic intensity of a given area to a specific color. Several anomalies of potential archaeological interest were identified, and a priority list was established for further investigation. Electromagnetic conductivity (EM) surveying measures the conductivity of the soil, which is primarily a function of soil moisture content. Because of the different water retention and transmission characteristics of sandy loam versus clay soil horizons, changes in their depth or continuity are often detectable (see Chapter 10, Volume II for further details). The EM-38, a portable sensor developed by Geonics Limited, was used for this survey. It covered the same 1600 m2 area as the magnetic survey, and readings were again taken at 1 m intervals. These data were used to generate density contour maps of the site's conductivity which indicated large scale changes in the depths of the soil

The next stage of investigation was the collection of data for producing spatial maps (SYMAP program) of the site's subsurface characteristics. A series of 117 50 x 50 cm units was excavated at 5 m intervals across the site, within the previously established 60 x 40 m grid system. These units were excavated in 10 cm levels down to the clay B horizon. All fill was screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh. Munsell soil colors were taken for each level, and the depth to clay was recorded, These data were used to generate site maps plotting artifact densities, depth to clay, and soil color changes by level. This, in conjunction with the magnetometer and EM results, provided a picture of the site below the surface. The anomalies that were identified from the techniques described above were compared and an excavation strategy was developed. A series of trenches composed of contiguous 1 x 1 m units was excavated through the centers of the anomalies. The trenches started from outside the anomalies and were excavated toward their centers in stratigraphic levels. Eleven anomalies were identified from the surveys, and each of these was investigated using this method. The numerical designations of the contiguous, square meter units used to investigate each of the 11 anomalies are presented in Table 11-1. Their locations are shown in Figure 11-2. All excavated fill was passed through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh screen. After a trench was completed, the floor was scraped to provide a clean surface for feature observation. Any features or other items of interest were flagged for future consideration. After these trenches were completed, six backhoe trenches were excavated to further investigate those anomalies determined to be of possible cultural significance. The backhoe trench walls Volume LI, Part One were cleaned and profiled. In two cases a single, square meter unit was excavated within an anomaly in 10 cm levels in order to collect soil, flotation, and fine screen samples for more detailed analyses. The next stage of work consisted of block excavations. These blocks were 2 x 2 m, but were excavated in 1 m2 quadrants. Again, all excavated fill was passed through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) screen. These blocks were located in areas where no anomalies had been identified during any of the above mentioned surveys. Their primary purpose was to open up large areas down to the clay surface where any existing features could be detected. Two areas of block excavation were dug, exposing 16 m? of clay surface. A third area of block excavation was begun, but this was abandoned after only three 1 x 1 m units (Units 234, 235 and 236) had been excavated. Although the above technique was adequate for exposing the clay surface, the time remaining to complete excavations at the site required the use of a different technique for exposing larger areas. The method employed was the use of a small bulldozer to make 3-4 m wide cuts across the east-west axis of the site. Six of these cuts were made through both excavated and unexcavated areas of the site during Season II (see Figure 11-2). These bulldozer trenches were cut down into the top few centimeters of the clay, removing the sandy loam A horizon. They then were hand scraped using sharpened hoes, and any features or other anomalies were flagged. Once the trenches had been completely scraped and all features marked, each feature was investigated separately. The features were photographed, mapped, cross-sectioned, and sampled for artifact, faunal, and floral contents. Flotation samples were collected from features that were determined to be of cultural origin. The site was revisited during Season IV with the objective of mechanically stripping a more extensive area in the northern portion of the site. Most of the A horizon deposit that remained between Bulldozer Trenches 1 and 4 was removed at that time (see Figure 11-1). As before, the stripped surface was scraped with sharpened hoes, and the newly discovered features were mapped and investigated. A total of 260 person-days was required to complete all stages of investigation at site 41NV173. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS The results of the magnetic and electromagnetic (EM) surveys in conjunction with the spatial maps derived from the 50 x 50 cm unit data served to guide subsequent excavations at site 41NV173. The results of each of these different stages of investigation will be discussed in the order in which they were performed. This is followed by descriptions of the features, artifacts, and faunal and floral remains. ; Table 11-1 NUMERICAL DESIGNATIONS OF UNITs USED TO INVESTIGATE ANOMALIES 1 TO 11 a UES EEs Enna Magnetic/EM Anomalies Unit Numbers ne A-1 141-154 A-2 155-163 A-3 164-168, 240 A-4 169-172 A-5 173-178 A-6 179-186 A-7 187-193, 212-215 A-8 194-200 A-9 201-206 A-10 207-211 A-1l 237-239

MAGNETIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC CONDUCTIVITY (EM) SURVEYS The magnetic survey identified three areas of potential cultural interest and nine magnetic anomalies with possible cultural sources (Huggins 1983). The anomalies were described as being localized areas rather than discrete features and represented areas where the soil was magnetically enhanced. Each of the anomalies was given a number denoting its priority for consideration. Those with the highest priority were investigated first. The EM survey data were disappointing and pictured the stratigraphy of the site as variable, probably due to geologic factors. The image presented by this survey indicates that the clay surface undulates, causing a wavy pattern across the site (Huggins 1983). This is probably the result of the vertic properties of the clay, causing it to shrink and swell with the moisture content of the soil, Some filtering was performed on the electromagnetic data, showing smaller scale anomalies which were interpreted as cultural in origin based on the results from 41FT201. As will be discussed later, most of these were not cultural features and appeared to have no cultural basis whatsoever. 50 x 50 CM UNITS AND SYMAP RESULTS The vertical distribution of temporally diagnostic artifacts within the 50 x 50 cm units was examined to assess the possibility Volume III, Part One 40 60 EAST MUNSELL COLOR LOYR3/4, 4/3, 4/4 ce 10YR3/2 10YR3/3, 4/1, 4/2 1OYR2/1, 2/2, 3/1 Figure 11-4. SYMAP of Munsell soil colors at site 41NV173. that the site's A horizon had been aggrading during the period of occupation. These artifacts were found to be distributed throughout the sandy loam A horizon deposit. However, there was consistent overlap between the vertical distribution of the presumed earlier diagnostics (dart points) and that of the later diagnostics (arrow points and ceramics). This was interpreted as indicating that the site deposit was not agerading during the period of occupation. Instead, the vertical distribution of artifacts appears to be the result of their differential downward displacement from a common surface. The data derived from the 50 x 50 cm units provided some interesting results when compared with the two surveys. Several different spatial maps (SYMAP program) were generated from these data. Each artifact category was plotted after collapsing all levels into one. Spatial maps also were produced for the measurements of depth to clay across the site and for soil color based on Munsell readings for each unit. The spatial maps for depth to clay (Figure 11-3) and soil color (Figure 11-4) will be considered first. The deepest areas of the site were noted running from the north central section of the grid system down to the approximate center of the grid, then veering off to the southeast. This area roughly parallels the crest of the ridge and also corresponds to the location of a line of trees still present on the site. Much of this variation in depth ta clay later proved to be a natural phenomenon. In two instances, however, areas of maximum depth (>40 cm) proved to be the locations of large prehistoric pits (Features 18 and 27). 4INV

The highest densities of both animal bone (Figure 11-5) mad mussel shell (Figure 11-6) were confined mainly to this area darker soil. The 50 x 50 cm units excavated among the trees on ridge crest did not exhibit a plow zone, although the other units the site did. It seems possible that the enhanced organic staining ad better preservation of faunal materials might be attributable to relatively undisturbed nature of the deposit in this portion of site. However, the spatial map for lithic debris (Figure 11-7), artifact category with the largest number of specimens, displayed a similar distribution pattern. The spatial maps for ceramics (Figure 11-8) and the various categories of lithic tools exhibited less well defined patterning, but this may be due to their relatively low frequencies of occurrence. ‘The areas of highest ceramic density were located in the north feentral and northwestern portions of the grid system. The }concentration of ceramics near the northwest corner of the grid eorresponds to the location of a high-density cluster of bone. This cluster was designated as Anomaly A-11, and three contiguous 1 x 1 m units subsequently were excavated to investigate this possible activity area.

Temains were located there, within an area of organically stained midden soil. In addition, a separate, high-density cluster of both ceramics and animal bone was detected near the northwest corner of the site grid system. This spatial patterning, based on data derived from 50 x 50 cm units spaced at 5 m intervals, was confirmed by the more extensive excavations that followed. INVESTIGATION OF ANOMALIES Each of the nine anomalies identified by the magnetic and EM surveys (A-1 through A-9) was tested. Test trenches also were excavated in two isolated areas of high artifact densities that were identified from the spatial maps. In one of these areas the sandy loam A horizon was quite deep, suggesting the presence of a large pit. The second area had a shallow A horizon but yielded abnormally high quantities of both ceramics and faunal remains. These two SYMAP anomalies were designated A-10 and A-11. Anomaly A-i corresponded to both a magnetic and an EM anomaly. It was investigated using two perpendicular, 1 m wide trenches. The trenches were 8 m long (Units 141-148) and 6 m long (Units 149-154). The source of Anomaly A-1 appears to have been a large pit (Feature 18). Units 141-150 were located outside of this pit, and Units 151-154 were within it. Backhoe Trench 4 was used to cross-section the pit. It measured about 4.5 m across and had a maximum depth of 90 cm below the site surface. A

At that point this same unit was redesignated Unit 228, and five additional 10 cm levels were excavated. A 10 | flotation sample was collected from each of these levels, and the remaining fill was passed through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) screen. Anomaly A-2 corresponded to several magnetic anomalies and an area indicated by the EM. This was the location of a backhoe trench and an adjacent 1 x 1 m unit that had been excavated during the testing phase. A 9 m long trench (Units 155-163) was excavated to investigate Anomaly A-2, and the earlier backhoe trench was reexcavated with Backhoe Trench 2. This backhoe trench cross-sectioned a pit similar to but shallower than the pit associated with A-1. This pit (Feature 27) measured approximately 4 m across and had a maximum depth of 60 cm below the site surface. It had been excavated into the site's clay B horizon and was filled with sandy loam A horizon soil. Anomaly A-3 corresponded to an EM anomaly and, roughly, to a magnetic anomaly. A 5 m long trench (Units 164-168) and one adjacent 1 x 1 m unit (Unit 240) were excavated in this area. A small pit (Feature 1) was uncovered in Unit 166 at a depth of 18 em below the surface.

Distribution of ceramics at site 41NV173. 9.11-13.00 Eg Anomaly A-4 corresponded to a magnetic anomaly and was located within that portion of the site where the trees were still present. The spatial maps had shown an area of high artifact density and darker soil color to be present in the north central part of the site. Anomaly A-4 was located near the southern edge of this possible midden deposit. Units 169-172 were used to test this anomaly. No features were identified, but large numbers of artifacts were recovered. Magnetic Anomalies A-5 and A-6, and EM Anomaly A-9 all were located within this same, possible midden area. Units 173- 178 tested Anomaly A-5, Units 179-186 tested Anomaly A-6, and Units 201-206 tested Anomaly A-9. Although no features were encountered in any of these trenches, subsequent stripping of the site's A horizon uncovered two small pits and a hearth in the area of Anomaly A-6. The sandy loam A horizon was somewhat deeper in the area of Anomaly A-9 than in most other parts of the site. This greater depth was not due to cultural modification, but to natural variation in the depth of the clay B horizon across the site. Artifact densities were high in these three test trenches, as was the density of faunal remains. Anomaly A-7 corresponded to both a magnetic and an EM anomaly. A 7 m long trench (Units 187-193) was excavated initially to investigate Anomaly A-7. Several small stains were visible in the floors of these units, so Units 212-215 were added to “hateam Petere beer

iS ll Ss iS of li or or ah OaG AT d re (a) 4INV173 expand the area of investigation. No additional features were uncovered, and cross-sectioning of the stains showed them all to be either rodent burrows or root molds. Anomaly A-8 was an EM anomaly that was tested with Units 194-200. Anomaly A-8 had registered as an area of low conductivity much like the patterns that had been picked up for the large pits at Anomalies A-1 and A-2. Instead, excavation revealed a very shallow A horizon (less than 15 cm). Artifact density was relatively low and faunal preservation was poor in this area of the site. Anomaly A-10 was an area identified from the spatial maps as having a deep, sandy loam deposit and a high density of artifacts. Anomaly A-10 was investigated with Units 207-211, and was cross-sectioned by Backhoe Trench 6, Although the clay B horizon was as deep as 40 cm in some units, the trench profile did not resemble the pits of Anomalies A-1 and A-2. Variation in the depth of the clay B horizon appears to be a natural phenomenon at site 41NV173. A similar situation was found to exist at the far northem edge of the site grid system. Backhoe Trench 1 exposed a long (18 m) profile which documented the gradually undulating nature of the argillic B horizon. Within this profile the sandy loam A horizon varied in thickness from 25 cm to 65 cm. A control unit (Unit 230), located 3 m south of this trench and excavated in 10 cm levels, encountered the clay at a depth of 70 cm below surface. Anomaly A-11 was located in the northwest corner of the grid system and was tested with Units 237-239. The spatial maps had shown an isolated concentration of both ceramics and bone in this area. Although the A horizon was less than 20 cm in depth, these units contained large amounts of both burned and unbumed bone, including identifiable elements of whitetail deer and cottontail rabbit. The only temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered from these three units were assignable to the Late Prehistoric occupation of the site (arrow points and ceramics). Although it was not detected at this stage of investigation, subsequent stripping of the A horizon revealed a small prehistori¢ pit (Feature 28) at the western end of this trench. BLOCK EXCAVATIONS The 2 x 2 m blocks were located in areas where no anomalies had been identified. Six of these blocks had been planned, but only four were completed before this technique was abandoned. Units excavated during this phase of investigation were 216-227, 229, and 231-236. Their locations are shown in Figure 11-2. The sandy loam A horizon was quite shallow in all of these units, and very few faunal remains were recovered. The only temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered are all associated with the Late Prehistoric occupation of the site (arrow points and ceramics). A single feature (Feature 2) was discovered during these excavations. This was a small circular pit and it is described in a subsequent section of this site report. More extensive block excavations had been planned for site 41NV173, but this strategy provided only limited results in terms of locating features. The documentation of features was considered essential for interpreting the site. Therefore, block excavation was discontinued in favor of the mechanized removal of the A horizon from much larger areas of the site. MECHANIZED EXCAVATIONS During Season II, six trenches, oriented east-west, were cut across the site by a bulldozer, exposing the top of the clay B horizon. Fifteen dark stains of various sizes and shapes were identified. AIl of these were located in relatively restricted sections of only two of the six bulldozer trenches (Trenches 2 and 3 in Figure 11-2). Additional mechanized stripping at the site during Season IV resulted in the identification of seven features and 14 post holes, The results of their investigation are discussed in the following section of this site report. 103 All temporally diagnostic artifacts (projectile points and ceramics) observed on the surface of the stripped areas were collected. These included 18 sherds, one Perdiz arrow point, one Gary dart point, and four expanding stem dart points (one each of Bulverde, Ellis, Marshall types, and an untyped specimen). FEATURES Twenty-eight feature numbers were assigned during the excavations at site 41NV173. Subsequent investigation indicated that seven of these features were noncultural in origin. These seven had been designated Features 6, 8, 10, 11, 17, 19, and 22. The 14 post holes identified during Season IV were not given individual feature numbers. The 21 numbered features that were determined to be of cultural origin and these 14 additional post holes are described below. This is followed by an analysis and discussion of feature contents. FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS The cultural features are described in numerical order, followed by a brief description of the 14 post holes identified during Season [V. A plan map of their locations is shown in Figure 11-9. Feature 1 (Figure 11-10a) This small, oval-shaped pit (42 cm long by 32 cm wide) was first observed at 18 cm below the surface in Unit 166 during the investigation of Anomaly A-3. The profile was basin-shaped and extended to a depth of 12 cm below the surface of the clay B horizon. A sample of scattered charcoal was collected, but was too small for radiocarbon dating. No artifacts were observed during the excavation of the feature fill, and its subsequent flotation produced little more than 18 pieces of lithic debris and carbonized plant remains. Feature 2 (Figure 11-10b) This feature was a circular pit (56 cm in diameter) located in adjacent Units 224 and 227. It was initially recognized as a dark stain in the surface of the clay B horizon at a depth of 28 cm below the surface. Cross-sectioning revealed an irregular, basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 10 cm below the surface of the B horizon. No artifacts were recovered during the excavation of the feature fill. A small charcoal sample was collected, but was insufficient for radiocarbon dating. A flotation sample was not collected from this feature. Feature 3 (Figure 11-10c) This was a circular pit measuring 67 cm in diameter. It was basin-shaped in profile, extending only 10 cm below the scraped surface of Trench 3. Originally, this feature was thought to be a hearth because charcoal was found scattered throughout the fill. A sample was submitted for radiocarbon analysis, but yielded a “modern” date (Beta-9062). The fill from the western half of this feature was saved for flotation, but remains unprocessed. Feature 4 (Figure 11-10d) This feature was an oval-shaped pit measuring 94 cm by 83 cm. The feature was cross-sectioned and the western half was excavated. The profile was basin-shaped with a maximum depth of 12 cm below the surface of Trench 3. A post hole (Feature 14) penetrated Feature 4 near its western edge. A grog/grit tempered rim sherd from a ceramic bottle was recovered from flotation.

Feature 5 This small, circular stain is interpreted as a post hole. It was 15 cm in diameter and extended to a depth of 12 cm below the scraped surface of Trench 2. The entire fill was collected for flotation and was found to contain lithic debris and carbonized plant remains. Feature 7 (Figure 11-10e) This was a small, roughly oval-shaped pit (50 cm long by 48 cm wide). The feature was cross-sectioned, and the northem half was excavated. The profile was basin-shaped with a maximum depth of 10 cm below the surface of Trench 3. Diagnostic artifacts recovered from flotation of the excavated fill included an untyped, contracting stem arrow point and a drill/awl, both indicating a Late Prehistoric period date for the feature. Importantly, a single com cupule fragment also was recovered from this feature. Feature 9 (Figure 11-10f) This was a roughly circular pit (75 cm in diameter) with an irregular, basin-shaped profile. Maximum depth was 18 cm below the scraped surface of Trench 2. The entire feature fill was collected, but only a 10 1 sample was floated. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered from flotation. Feature 12 (Figure 11-10g) This apparent hearth consisted of a roughly circular stained area (55 cm long by 48 cm wide) containing large amounts of fire cracked rock and oxidized clay. The feature profile was basin- shaped with a maximum depth of 8 cm below the surface of Trench 2. The entire fill was excavated, and a 20 | sample was collected for flotation. Materials recovered from this sample included four sandy paste ceramic sherds. Feature 13 This small, circular stain was determined to be a post hole measuring 18 cm in diameter and extending to a depth of 31 cm below the surface of Trench 3. The feature was cross-sectioned, and a 41] sample of fill was collected. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered, but the fill did contain three small corn cupule fragments. Feature 14 This post hole was located within the western edge of Feature 4, penetrating through the bottom of that feature. It measured 19 cm in diameter and extended to a depth of 29 cm below the surface of Trench 3. The eastern half of this feature was excavated and the

A drill/awl was the only tool recovered from this fill. Feature 15 (Figure 11-10h) This was an oval-shaped pit (70 cm long by 42 cm wide). The cross section revealed a basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 20 cm below the surface of Trench 3. The western half of this feature was excavated, and the fill was collected for flotation. The only temporally diagnostic artifact recovered from this fill | was a grog tempered sherd. Feature 16 (Figure 11-10i) The outline of this feature was rather irregular with maximum dimensions of 100 cm by 95 cm. The feature was cross-sectioned, and the southern half was excavated. The profile was basin-shaped with 2 maximum depth of 10 cm below the surface of Trench 2. The excavated fill was found to contain significant amounts of lithic debris, fire cracked rock, bone, mussel shell, and several lithic tools, including a Steiner arrow point. A sample of carbonized hickory nutshell collected during the excavation of this feature was submitted for radiocarbon dating. This sample was very small (0.6 g) and was dated using the accelerator (AMS) technique. The resuiting date was 880 + 110 B.C. (Beta-9061), which is far too early to be associated with the Steiner arrow point recovered from this feature. Feature 18 (Figure 11-11) This feature was a large pit that measured 4.5 m across in the profile of Backhoe Trench 4. Feature 18 had a basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 90 cm below the original site surface. The feature fill from between 42 cm and 92 cm was

A 10 1 flotation sample was collected from each level, and the remaining fill was passed through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) screen. All but the southern edge of Feature 18 was exposed in plan view by the Season IV mechanical stripping. The pit outline was found to be somewhat irregular, but basically circular in plan. One Gary dart point, one Untyped, straight stem dart point, and 12 grog tempered sherds were recovered from Unit 228. Feature 20 (Figure 11-12a) This was a small, roughly oval pit (50 cm long by 43 cm wide). It had a basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 13 cm beneath the scraped surface. The excavated fill contained lithic debris, fire cracked rock, mussel shell, and animal bone, but no temporally diagnostic artifacts. Feature 21 (Figure 11-12b) This feature had a shallow, basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 10 cm below the scraped surface. The excavated fill was almost devoid of cultural materials. Two small pieces of lithic debris and about 1.5 g of wood charcoal were the only materials recovered from this feature. Feature 23 (Figure 11-12c) This was a small oval pit (55 cm long by 42 cm wide). Its shallow, basin-shaped profile extended only 7 cm below the scraped surface. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from the excavated fill. Feature 24 (Figure 11-12e) This feature was a rather large pit measuring 180 cm in length and 158 cm in maximum width. The pit outline is somewhat irregular, but basically oval in plan. The profile was basin-shaped with a maximum depth of 37 cm below the scraped surface. Temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered from the excavated fill consisted of three Scallom arrow points; one Gary dart point; and a single, sandy paste sherd. These materials indicate that Feature 24 dates to an earlier period of occupation than do most of the other features at site 41NV173. Feature 25 (Figure 11-12f) This was a roughly circular pit measuring 110 cm in diameter. The shallow, basin-shaped profile extended only 6 cm beneath the scraped surface. The excavated fill contained no temporally diagnostic artifacts. Feature 26 (Figure 11-12d) This feature originally was observed as an irregularly shaped dark stain at the scraped surface of the B horizon (see Figure 11- 9). Subsequent investigation indicated that the southern portion of this stain was an oval-shaped pit, but that the northern portion represented an amorphously shaped, noncultural disturbance. Only the oval-shaped pit is considered to be Feature 26. It measured 78 cm in length and 70 cm in width. It had a shallow, basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 10 cm below the scraped surface. Feature 26 contained no temporally diagnostic artifacts. Feature 27 (Figure 11-13) This is a large pit that is similar to, but somewhat shallower than Feature 18. It was cross-sectioned by a backhoe trench during _ the site testing phase. In profile, it measured approximately 4 m across and had a somewhat irregular, basin shape with a maximum depth of 60 cm below the original site surface. The north half of Feature 27 was exposed in plan view when this area was mechanically stripped during Season IV. Like Feature 18, the pit outline was somewhat irregular, but was basically circular in plan. After the A horizon had been removed, Feature 27 was sampled by three 1 X 1 m units (Units 1001-1003). Temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered from these units consisted of two arrow points and 17 primarily grog tempered sherds. Feature 28 (Figure 11-12g) This was a somewhat irregularly shaped pit that measured 84 cm in length and 82 cm in width. It had an irregular, basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 32 cm below the scraped surface. The feature was excavated completely, and contained 40 sherds and two ceramic pipe fragments. No projectile points were recovered from Feature 28. Importantly, three maize cupules and six cupule fragments were recovered from the flotation sample. A sample of carbonized nutshell from the fill yielded a date of A.D. 1410 + 60 (Beta 12755). 412 aos bad

Their locations are shown in Figure 11-14. Three of these were discovered during the Season II excavations, and were assigned feature designations (Features 5, 13, and 14). The 14 post holes } that were identified during Season IV were given alphanumeric designations P1 through P14. All were approximately circular in pian. Diameters ranged between 11 cm and 19 cm, and their depths were between 6 cm and 31 cm below the scraped trench surfaces i (Figure 11-15). Although all 17 post holes were located in the northwestern portion of the site grid system, they appear to represent two separate clusters which are only 3-4 m apart. Although no convincing pattern could be identified, they may indicate the presence of one or more prehistoric structures at the site. | FEATURE CONTENTS The standard procedure employed for feature investigation involved cross-sectioning and removing the fill from one half of the feature. This was not practical for the two large pits (Features 18 and 27), which were sampled with 1 x 1 m excavation units. Ideally, a soil sample of at least 10 1 was removed from each | Figure 11-12. Profiles of features at site 41NV173: (a) Feature 20, (b) Feature 21, (c) Feature 23, (d) Feature 26, (e) Feature 24, (f} Feature 25, (g) Feature 28. Note: e-g are reproduced at half the scale of a-d. feature for flotation, and any remaining fill was screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh. For the small features with excavated volumes of less than 10 1, all fill was retained for flotation. Most of the features were small, shallow pits from which less than 50 | of soil were excavated. In general, such features contained little more than lithic debris and, occasionally, fire cracked rock and faunal remains (Table 11-2 and 11-3). The four largest features (Features 18, 24, 27, and 28) yielded much more substantial collections of artifacts. Because the volumes of excavated fill varied greatly between features, the figures in Table 11-3 were corrected for volume, and the counts and weights per 100 | of fill are presented in Table 11-4. Most of the variation in the densities of faunal remains appears to correlate with the horizontal locations of the features. Spatial maps showing the distributions of animal bone and mussel shell within the site's A horizon were discussed in an earlier section of this chapter. Two high-density concentrations of bone were identified (see Figure 11-5). The smaller of these was in the northwest comer of the grid system, and corresponds to the location of Feature 28. The second concentration was in the north central portion of the grid. Features 9, 16, 20, 24, 25, and 26 were located within the limits of this second concentration; and they contained relatively high densities of bone within their fill. The spatial map for mussel shell showed a single, very high density cluster in the north central portion of the site grid (see Figure 11- 6). Features 16, 20, 25, and 26 were located within the limits of

It is possible that the features with high densities of faunal remains were related to the processing of these animals. This is almost certainly the case for Feature 28, since it is located outside of the area of organically stained midden soil and within a small, isolated concentration of animal bone. Large amounts of faunal remains occurred only within the immediate vicinity of this feature. On the other hand, the remainder of these features all were located within the central portion of the midden and within the limits of a much more extensive concentration of animal bone. The relatively high densities of faunal remains within these features might be unrelated to feature function per se, and may reflect merely the high bone and shell densities present within the surrounding midden deposit. The large pits (Features 18 and 27) contained only moderate densities of most artifact categories, and very low densities of faunal remains.

Although fire cracked rock was present in the fill of these features, the relatively small amounts suggest that they are not equivalent to the large roasting pits present at sites 41FT201 (Volume II, Chapter 4) and 41NV182 (Chapter 12, this Volume). Nine of the features at site 41NV173 contained temporally diagnostic artifacts (projectile points and/or ceramics), and these suggest that two different periods of occupation may be represented. Based on radiocarbon dates from site 41NV182, the coarse-grained, sandy paste ceramics recovered from Features 12 and 24 are thought to date sometime between A.D. 700 and A.D. 900. Feature 24 also contained one Gary dart point and ‘three Scallorn arrow points. Feature 28 contained the highest density of ceramic artifacts, with 40 sherds and 2 pipe fragments. The A.D. 1410 + 60 date from this feature provides a date for the distinctive ceramic assemblage from the site and also for the use of maize. Three other features contained maize cupule fragments (Features 7, 13, and 27), as did two flotation samples from Unit 230 (98N 80E). Feature 13, a post hole, contained no diagnostic artifacts; but Feature 7 contained a single arrow point. Feature 27 contained two arrow points and 17 primarily grog tempered sherds. The temporal placement of Feature 18 is uncertain. Although the 1 x 1 m unit sampling this large pit contained one Gary dart point, one untyped, straight stem dart point, and no arrow points, it also recovered 12 grog tempered sherds. The former are diagnostic of the earlier component, while the latter suggest a late temporal placement. Three other features each contained only one diagnostic artifact. One grog tempered sherd was recovered from both Feature 4 and Feature 15, Feature 16 contained a Steiner arrow point. The ‘temporally diagnostic artifacts indicate that most of the features probably date to the ca. A.D. 1400 component. An earlier component appears to be represented by Features 12 and 24, and possibly others in the north central portion of the site. ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS A complete tabulation of artifact counts by provenience is presented in Appendix F (Table F-10). The artifacts recovered from flotation of feature fill are tabulated separately in Tables 11- 2 through 11-4. The lithic tools and ceramics are described below.

This specimen is characterized by its long, rectangular stem and straight base. Its broad, triangular blade has convex edges and barbed shoulders. Material: dark gray Edwards chert. Provenience: Surface. Gary, Regular Variety (15 specimens, Figure 11-17a). These specimens are distinguished by their triangular blades and contracting stems with rounded bases. Blade shoulders vary from weakly developed to prominent. Specimens which are similar in morphology but less then 3 cm in length are included in the Gary, small variety category. Materials: quartzite (10), chert (5). Proveniences: Surface, 149.1, 150.1, 152.1 (2), 160.1, 186.1, 188.1, 190.1, 207.1, 208.1, 209.1, 213.1, 228.6, Feature 24. Gary, Serrated Blade (2 specimens). These are similar to the regular variety except that their blade edges are serrated and exhibit distinct right hand beveling. The stems contract slightly and the bases are rounded, Materials: chert (1), quartzite (1). Proveniences: 119.5, 186.1. Gary, Small Variety (7 specimens, Figure 11-17c). These short (less than 3 cm long) specimens are identical to examples of the hobson and colfax varieties of Gary that were defined by Johnson (1962:163-166). Their stems are either slightly contracting or somewhat square. Stratigraphic evidence from site 41FT193 suggests that specimens in this category may date somewhat later in time than the larger Gary form. Materials: chert (4), quartzite (4). Proveniences: 150.1, 154.1, 155.1, 160.1, 176.1, 205.1, 213.1. Ellis (1 specimen). This specimen has a short, straight-edged, triangular blade and a sharply expanding stem with straight base.

Knives, Small Subdtriangular (10 specimens, Figure 11- 17g). These knives are distinguished by their triangular to subtriangular outline and rather small size. They are, however, somewhat larger than specimens in the arrow point preform category, which they resemble in terms of shape and workmanship. Six specimens are complete and four are broken. Lengths of the complete specimens range from 2.8 to 3.5 cm. Materials: quartzite (7), chert (3). Proveniences: 80.3, 119.5, 151.1, 156.2, 178.1, 211.1, 217.1, 228.6, 230.4 (2). Aborted Bifaces Early Stage (12 specimens). These specimens tend to be thick and somewhat irregular in outline, with sinuous edges formed by the removal of large flakes. All specimens retain at least one area of surface cortex. Materials: quartzite (4), silicified wood (4), chert (4). Proveniences: 41.5, 45.4, 50.4, 127.5, 134.3, 156.3, 188.1, 209.1, 1003.2, Feature 24, Feature 27 (2). Late Stage (15 specimens). The edges of these specimens are less sinuous than those specimens in the early stage subcategory, but they lack evidence of fine secondary retouch. Some specimens retain minor amounts of cortex or have an area of step fracturing on one face. Outlines are variable and include oval, subtriangular, and subrectangular forms. Materials: quartzite (8), chert (7). Proveniences: 49.4, 120.3, 126.7, 152.1, 153.1, 163.1, 178.1, 191.1, 202.1, 208.1, 215.1, 228.2, 237.1, 1002.1, Feature 27. Arrow Point Preforms (7 specimens).

114 CERAMICS (by James E. Bruseth) Vessel Sherds A sample of 1131 sherds was recovered from site 41NV173. Table 11-6 lists selected ceramic attributes according to spatial areas of the site and by feature number. The spatial divisions, formally defined in the following section of this chapter, are used to examine differences in the horizontal location of temporal components, Additional information on the design element configurations observed on the ceramics is presented in Tables 11- 7 and 11-8 (see Appendix B for details). Only sherds which are large enough for element configurations to be identified are listed. Finally, the proveniences of sandy paste ceramics are listed in Table 11-9. These sherds have been found to be sensitive chronological indicators at other sites and, consequently, are listed separately. Since the site is located on a terrace knoll away from a major water source, it was thought initially that the area may not have been reoccupied as frequently as were other sites within the reservoir. The analysis of the ceramic artifacts has verified this interpretation, at least for the Late Prehistoric period. Two ceramic traditions are represented: one consisting of sandy paste wares, and the other of grog, grit, and bone temper wares. The occurrence of sandy paste sherds demonstrates that occupation took place during the A.D. 700 to 900 time period. These sherds occur over much of the site but are concentrated in Area 2 and in certain features within this area (see Table 11-9). The remainder of the sherds from the site are associated with a single, major occupation during which grog, grit, and bone tempered ceramics were used. The overall contemporaneity of these sherds is supported by the general uniformity in ceramic attributes among the different spatial areas. Of course, sample sizes are small in some cases (particularly for Areas 3 and 4); but comparisons between Feature 28, which has been radiocarbon dated to A.D. 1410 + 60 and reflects a discrete temporal episode, and the remainder of the site show that similar ceramic characteristics occur. For these reasons, the ceramics are discussed as two groups: sandy paste sherds, and grog, grit, and bone tempered wares. A total of 11 sandy paste sherds which possess characteristics similar to sandy paste sherds from other sites in the reservoir was recovered from 41NV173. They have a very high sand component, but it is unclear whether this represents the intentional use of sand as a tempering agent or the selection of a sandy clay for pottery manufacture. The sherds have a medium paste texture and a rather uniform thickness, ranging from 5.0 to 6.5 mm and averaging 6.2 mm. Exterior colors are shades of brown (10YR4/3, 10YR2/2), with interior and core colors darker (Q0YR2/2, 10YR2/1). All specimens are undecorated. The remaining 1120 sherds are considerably different from the sandy paste sherds. Although a variety of tempers is evident, the most common is grog in combination with grit or bone. Paste textures are medium. Although most sherds are undecorated, the rim panels on vessels are frequently decorated. Common decoration methods are incised and engraved lines, with occasional punctations and brushing. Most punctations were made by pointed instruments, except when fingernails were used to make pinched ridges. Since the sample of decorated specimens is large, several design element configurations can be observed (see Table 11-7, and Figures 11-18 and 11-19). The category of crosshatched incised lines is most frequent, with parallel engraved lines being next most frequent. Overall, the composition of design config- urations is almost equally split between the incised and engraved categories, underscoring the high incidence of engraving at the site as compared to most other sites in the reservoir. The ceramic design configurations are similar to several Caddoan types: Canton Incised and/or Maydelle Incised, Poynor Engraved, Karnack Brushed-Incised, Killough Pinched, and Avery Engraved. All of these are Late Caddoan types with the exception of Canton Incised, Volume III, Part One .

However, the distinction between Canton Incised and Maydelle Incised is made purely on the basis of vessel form, and since most sherds are too small for accurate form assessment, little emphasis should be placed on the possible identification of Canton Incised. Although vessel form identification is hampered by the small size of the sherds (most are less than 4 cm in diameter), a few sherds are large enough to suggest the more common fonns. These are bottles, bowls, and jars. Several carinated rim elements are present and suggest this bowl variation was popular. The color of the vast majority of the sherds (including both interior and exteriors) is brown and, less commonly, red. The most frequent shades are red (2.5YR3/6, SYR5/6) and brown (10YR3/1, 10YR3/2, 10YR4/1, and 10YR6/2). Sherd wall thickness ranges from 4.0 to 8.0 mm, with an average of 5.9 mm. The few basal sherds that are recognizable as such are thicker and average 9.4 mm. In conclusion, the ceramics from the site offer important chronological information not only for interpreting the sequence of occupations at the site, but also for interpreting the ceramic chronology for the entire reservoir. The question of site chronolo- gy is discussed below, whereas the broader issue of reservoir-wide

Similar to elements on types Canton Incised and Maydelle Incised. Similar to above except that punctations are in a row. The specimen illustrated has pinched rows formed by the punctations, and the design is similar to elements on types Killough Pinched. Most specimens similar to types Canton Incised and Maydelle Incised. Incised lines diagonally orientated to the rim. Only specimens with rim can be classified in this category, and some of the sherds placed into the “Parallel Incised Lines, Orientation Not Observable" category may actually be part of this design group but lack the rim. Similar to elements on types Canton Incised and Maydelle Incised. Incised, parallel lines where the rim is lacking prevents the orientation of the lines from being determined. Intersecting incised lines orientated diagonally to the rim. Sherds with this element configuration lacking a rim have also been included. Similar to types Canton Incised and Maydelle Incised. Closely spaced incised lines that trend to brushing on some examples. Orientation is usually unknown although the only specimen with a rim shows a vertical orientation (specimen j). Similar to type Karnack Brushed-Incised. Similar to category "Random Punctations" except that one or more incised lines are present. Similar to elements on types Canton Incised and Maydelle Incised. Closely spaced and parallel engraved lines forming linear and curvilinear designs. Number of lines varies from two to eight with five to seven most common. Similar to elements on type Poynor Engraved. Triangular elements formed either by (1) freestanding pendant triangles (specimen e), or (2) diagonal line connecting two intersecting engraved lines (specimen f). In either case the area enclosed by the triangle is filled with incised parallel lines or with excising. Although similar elements occur on types Ripley engraved or Poynor Engraved, the latter is suggested based on other element configurations. Multiple engraved lines made at various orientations to the rim. (All three sherds that make up this group are probably from the same vessel.) Concentric pattern formed by engraved lines, some with perpendicular incised lines forming a "ladder" pattern. The single example, made up of several sherds, is the body of a bottle and the concentric nature of the design is similar to type Avery Engraved. Intersecting engraved lines, the orientation of which to often cannot be determined. The specimens from the site are quite small and may be interior parts of other elements (e.g., Engraved Triangles). Usually a single engraved line serving as a boundary for punctations made with a pointed instrument. Similar to elements on type Poynor Engraved. Engraved lines oriented diagonally to the rim.

As. noted above, the 11 sandy paste sherds suggest a limited occupation of the site sometime between A.D. 700 and 900. The remainder of the sherds appear to represent a single occupation around A.D. 1410 that occurred over much of the site. The ceramics are similar to the grog, grit, and bone temper tradition noted for the early Late Prehistoric occupations at other sites. However, these sherds occur within a later temporal context at 41NV173, and correspondingly, have some important attribute differences. These include the higher incidence of engraved wares, the occurrence of several design element configurations similar to Late Caddoan ceramic types, and the possible increased use of carinated bowls and bottles. Pipe Sherds A total of nine clay pipe sherds was recovered during excavations at 41NV173. All but three are less than 2 cm in diameter limiting their interpretive potential. Proveniences and selected attributes of all the pipe sherds are listed in Table 11-10, and the larger specimens are illustrated in Figure 11-20a-c. Only three specimens are large enough for form identification, and all three indicate a tubular shape. The clay used for the pipes is unique in comparison with most of the vessel sherds. Paste textures are finer, and sand temper, in combination with bone or grog, is more Table 11-9 DISTRIBUTION OF SANDY PASTE CERAMICS AT SITE 41NV173 ee Number of Sherds a General Surface Area 2 Area 3 Feature 12 Feature 24 Provenience om Dae Pe Total ll Volume III, Part One Table 11-10 ATTRIBUTES OF CLAY Pire SHERDS i Area 2 Area 5 Feature 28 i Tubular 3 4 2 Temper Sand/Grog 2 Sand/Grog/Bone 3 2 2 Stem Inside Diameter (mm) 5.0 6.0 common. In fact, two of the pipe sherds (both from Feature 28) are similar in paste characteristics to the sandy paste sherds from the site. We do not interpret this to indicate an early temporal association for these sherds, but rather a functional selection of paste characteristics. The spatial locations of the sherds suggest, at first glance, a nonrandom distribution. However, upon closer examination, it is clear that low sample sizes are partially responsible for this apparent patterning. Feature 28, located in Area 1, had two pipe fragments, and this feature also had a large sample of vessel sherds. Area 2, representing the north central part of the site, had three pipe fragments, while Area 5, representing the southern part of the site, had four. Thus, pipe fragments actually occur over much of the site. Ceramic Ball A ceramic ball (Figure 11-20d) made with a medium texture, sandy clay was recovered from Feature 28. The ball is spherical in shape and measures 2.4 cm in diameter. A single dimple has been made on the surface, apparently with the end of a finger. The original use of this artifact is unknown. ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS Spatial patterning in the horizontal distributions of various artifact categories was discussed in an earlier section of this chapter. These patterns were based solely on data obtained from the systematically placed 50 x 50 cm units, and subsequent excavations yielded results that were in complete accord with these earlier findings. The crest of the ridge in the north central part of the site's 40 x 60 m reference grid appears to have been the primary focus of activity. The highest densities of lithic debris and faunal remains were located there, within an area of organically stained midden soil. A separate, high-density cluster of both ceramics and bone was detected near the northwest corner of the grid, where Feature 28 was discovered during subsequent investigations. The recovery of relatively small numbers of dart points and sandy paste ceramics suggested that a minor early (ca. A.D. 700- 900) component was represented at the site. The distribution of the early diagnostics recovered from all A horizon excavations (50 x 50 cm and 1 x 1 m units) in the intensively investigated northern half of the site grid is shown in Figure 11-21. It can be seen that the early diagnostics cluster in three locations. These are the north central portion of the grid (Area 2 in Figure 11-21), and in close spatial association with Feature 18 (Area 4) and Feature 27 (Area 3). The northwest quarter of the grid, excluding Area 3 and a portion of Area 2, contained no early component diagnostics and has been designated as Area 1. No projectile points were recovered from the northeast quarter of the grid except for those within Areas 2 and 4. This area did, however, contain ceramics, and has been combined with the south half of the grid (Area 5) for this analysis. These same spatial divisions have been used for the ceramic analysis presented in the previous section of this chapter.

When all projectile points and ceramics from the A horizon excavations are considered (Table 11-11) it is obvious that the lack of early component diagnostics from Area 1 is not merely a factor of sample size. The units excavated in Area 1 contained 36 arrow points and 370 sherds. The six dart points from Area 5 were from various units in the south half of the grid, but did not tend to cluster spatially. . It appears that early component activity was confined primarily to Area 2. Two of the features within Area 2 (Features 12 and 24) have been assigned to this component. The only ceramics recovered from these features were of the sandy paste variety (see Table 11-6). Feature 24 also contained a Gary dart point and three Scallorn arrow points. The recovery of early component diagnostics in close spatial association with Feature 18 (Area 4) and Feature 27 (Area 3) suggested that they also might relate to the early component. However, the artifacts recovered from these large pits did not support this interpretation. The two arrow points and 17 sherds from Feature 27 suggest that it dates to the late component (ca. A.D. 1400). The artifacts from Feature 18 are less definitive. Although the two Gary points suggest an early component date, the 12 grog tempered sherds (all undecorated) could relate to either component. The major occupation of the site appears to have occurred around approximately A.D. 1400. In fact, late period diagnostics dominate all five spatial subdivisions, especially in terms of the ceramic assemblage. This is indicated by the similarity between the ceramics from Feature 28, dated to A.D. 1410 + 60, and the ceramic assemblages from each spatial subdivision of the site. The ceramics from site 41NV173 are significantly different from earlier Project area ceramic assemblages. These differences include a higher incidence of engraved wares, the occurrence of several design element configurations similar to Late Caddoan ceramic types, and the possible increased use of carinated bowls and bottles.

The systematically placed 50 x 50 cm units excavated during Season II provided the data used in generating a spatial map of the distribution of animal bone across the site (see Figure 11-5). However, only 13 of these units contained identifiable bone, all of which were elements of whitetail deer. Eleven of these units were within the larger concentration of bone in the north central portion of the site grid system, and one unit was responsible for the small, high-density cluster in the northwest corner of the grid. The final unit had coordinates of 80N SOE. The general sparsity of faunal remains within many areas of the site was due probably in part to relatively poor preservation. However, the lack of faunal diversity within the site was due also to the exclusive use of 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) screen for sifting the fill of these 50 x 50 cm units. Subsequent excavations provided a much more substantial faunal assemblage. The spatial distribution of bone from the 1 x 1 m units and features was very similar to the pattern defined by the 50 x 50 cm unit data. However, the larger - samples from the 1 x 1 m units, and especially the small screen size used in the flotation of feature fill, produced a larger and more diverse faunal assemblage (Table 11-12). The 1 x 1 m units were confined primarily to the northern half of the reference grid.

Tentative identification MACROBOTANICAL REMAINS (by Gayle J. Fritz) Twenty-nine flotation samples from site 41NV173 were analyzed at the Ethnobotanical Laboratory, Research Laboratories of Anthropology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Twenty-four of these samples were from 19 different features. Multiple samples were taken from the two large pits at the site (four from Feature 18 and three from Feature 27). The other five samples were collected from individual 10 cm levels of an excavation unit located within the site's midden deposit. Macrobotanical remains larger than 1/32 inch (0.79 mm) had been separated from other types of material prior to shipment to North Carolina. The unsorted contents of the 1/43 inch (0.59 mm) screen were examined macroscopically for seeds, but carbonized remains other than seeds were not sorted from the rootlet fragments and soil particles that constituted the bulk of their contents. Fragments larger than 2.0 mm were sorted completely according to category (Table 11-16). The weights of pecan shell, acom shell, Psoralea tuber, and maize cupules include fragments as small as 1.41 mm. All carbonized seeds were separated. The weights of carbonized plant remains from all 29 samples included 25.26 g of wood charcoal, 16.24 g of hickory nutshell, 0.08 g of pecan shell, 0.17 g of acorn shell, 0.59 g of Psoralea tuber, and 1.11 g of unknown carbonized material. The samples also contained 11 carbonized seeds and six unidentifiable seed fragments distributed among 14 samples. Five of these seeds are the spheroidal vetch type (Vicia sp.), one is an unidentified member of the legume family (Fabaceae), one is maygrass (Phalaris caroliniana), one is an unidentified grass, one is an unidentified member of the Caryophyllaceae, and one could not be placed at any taxonomic level. Except for the vetch seeds, which are widely distributed among features at Project area sites, it seems unlikely that any of these taxa were playing much of a role in the prehistoric subsistence system here, if any. Corn cupules (Zea mays spp. mays) and/or cupule fragments were recognized in six flotation samples. One fragment came from Feature 7; three fragments (possibly all from the same original cupule) were found in Feature 13; one cupule fragment came from Feature 27; and Feature 28 contained three cupules plus six cupule fragments. Unit 230 (98N 60E) contained two good fragments from different cupules and four more questionable pieces in the level 3 sample, and two fragments from seemingly different cupules in the level 5 sample. The small weights of plant food remains in most of the samples make interpretive comparisons between features somewhat Table 11-14 AGE DETERMINATIONS FOR WHITETAIL DEER FROM SITE 41NV173 Provenience Elements Age (years) Criteria Unit 127 P3 1.3- 1.42 Third milk premolar is cus Slight wear, but dentine line width is less than that of enamel Premolars are fully erupted, but no evidence of wear is present Lingual crests are sharp.

The two features with the most remains (Features 24 and > 28) are thought to date to different periods of occupation. Both of these features are dominated by hickory nutshell, but the earlier feature (Feature 24) has more acorn and Psoralea tuber, while Feature 28 contains pecan and maize cupules. The radiocarbon determination from Feature 28 (A.D. 1410 + 60) is thought by the excavators to date the use of maize at site 41NV1i73. Another feature which may date to the earlier component (Feature 18) contained a rather high Psoralea weight, especially considering the relatively low weights of other types of plant food remains.

In terms of seasonality indicators, the vetch and maygrass seeds, as well as the Psoralea, indicate spring occupation. Considering also the maize and nutshell, a multiseasonal or year- round occupation can be inferred. In general, the macrobotanical remains conform to the pattern exhibited by most of the other Project area sites. The dominant subsistence items are the three major nut types, especially hickory and acorn, along with the distinctive tuber that is believed to be a type of prairie turnip.

41NV173 Seeds are present in relatively low numbers. The occurrence of maize in six of the 29 flotation samples does, however, indicate a possible food-producing element at this site. INTERPRETATIONS The artifact assemblage from site 4INV173 suggests that the principle occupation of the site occurred during the Late Prehistoric period. An ephemeral Late Archaic component may be indicated by seven straight and expanding stem dart points, five of which were recovered from surface contexts. Arrow points outnumbered dart points by a ratio of 3.1:1, the highest of any site excavated in the Project area. Twenty-four of the 37 dart points were of the contracting stem Gary, regular variety, Gary, serrated blade, and Gary, small variety types. The assemblage also contained the highest density of ceramics of any Project area site. Over 1100 sherds were recovered, the majority of which are thought to be assignable to a very late (ca. A.D. 1400) period of occupation. These sherds show a number of differences when compared to those in other Project area ceramic assemblages, including a higher incidence of engraved wares, the presence of several design element configurations similar to Late Caddoan ceramic types, and the possible increased use of carinated bowls and bottles. The majority of Gary dart points and sandy paste sherds, thought to date to a relatively minor early Late Prehistoric component (A.D. 700-900), were located in the extreme north central part of the site and in the vicinity of Feature 18. However, most of the features and artifacts recovered from the site are thought to relate to the major period of site occupation, dating around A.D. 1400. : Unfortunately, two of the three radiocarbon determinations are considered unacceptable for dating this principal occupation. A modem date was obtained on charcoal from Feature 3, and a very small sample of carbonized nutshell from Feature 16 yielded a date of 880 + 110 B.C. using the accelerator (AMS) technique. The only diagnostic artifact from Feature 16 was a Steiner arrow point indicative of the Late Prehistoric period. It is possible that 123 the nutshell derived from an earlier Late Archaic occupation and was included incidentally in the feature fill. The A.D. 1410 + 60 date from Feature 28 provides the best temporal placement for the major occupation of site 41NV173. In terms of technology and decoration, the ceramics from this feature are virtually identical to the total ceramic assemblage. Because three maize cupules and six cupule fragments were recovered from Feature 28, this date also gives a temporal placement for the use of maize at the site. The site's midden deposit and numerous pit features are indicative of a relatively sedentary occupation. Although no definite evidence of permanent house structures was found, two clusters of post holes may indicate the location of more ephemeral structures. Seasonal indicators in the macrobotanical and faunal assemblages provide limited evidence for occupation during all seasons of the year, but a nonsedentary, multiseasonal use of the site could also be inferred from these remains. The subsistence economy, as indicated by the faunal and floral remains, shows some minor differences when contrasted with the evidence from other Project area sites. The faunal assemblage was dominated by whitetail deer, while very few elements of other species were identified. While it is possible that dependence upon deer was even more pronounced at 41NV173 than at other Project area sites, the differences are more likely due to variable preservation. The faunal remains from several of the features were more similar to those from other sites, and include turtle, rabbit, fish, snake, rodent, frog, and raccoon. Elements of domestic dog and bison were identified also. As at other Project area sites where flotation has been conducted, the macrobotanical remains were dominated by nuts (hickory, acorns, and pecan) and tubers (Psoralea). The relatively low numbers of seeds indicate that they were a very minor dietary element. Of particular interest is the presence of maize. Maize cupules and/or cupule fragments were recovered from four features and from an excavation unit located in the midden deposit. Maize was extremely rare in Project area samples and appears to occur only in post-A.D. 1300 contexts at site 41FT201. While subsistence at site 4INV173 was oriented primarily toward wild plant and animal resources, the occurrence of maize in six of the 29 flotation samples seems to indicate a partial reliance on food production during the late occupation at this site.

EXCAVATIONS AT 41NV182, THE IRVINE SITE by Daniel E. McGregor and Jeffery Bohlin, with contributions by James E. Bruseth, Gayle J. Fritz, Phillip Murry, and Gary Rutenberg ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Site 41NV182 is located-on a large knoll at the southern end of a long terrace ridge that projects into the floodplain of Richland Creek. The creek, encircling the southern portion of the knoll, is actively eroding both the southwestern and southeastern edges of this landform, exposing Eocene bedrock .in both locations. These Eocene strata are capped by Pleistocene terrace deposits that form the surface of the knoll. Most of the site had been cleared and was in pasture during the 1980-81 survey and test excavations. A forested strip remained along the southern perimeter of the knoll adjacent to the creek. This area has since been cleared. The former landowner reported that the site area had been under cultivation as recently as 10 years ago and was subject to seasonal plowing. SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS The site was originally recorded by SMU in 1974 on the basis of information provided by Mr. Bill Young of Corsicana, Texas. Test excavations performed during the 1980-81 field season consisted of 26 shovel test units (40 x 40 cm), two 1 x 1 m units and three backhoe trenches (McGregor et al. 1982:49-50). The site stratigraphy consisted of a sandy loam A horizon (20- 40 cm thick) overlying a clay B horizon. The artifacts recovered from testing, as well as those in Mr. Young's surface collection, indicated that the site had been occupied during both the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. Artifact density was relatively low in all areas except the lower portion of the knoll’s southeastern slope. In this area artifact density was quite high, and the relative darkness of the soil suggested a possible midden deposit. Both burned and unburned bone identified as whitetail deer were recovered also. A 11m unit (Unit 20) placed near the edge of the midden stain exposed a single post hole at the surface of the clay B horizon. The testing results suggested that a midden and associated structure might be present at the site. The relative shallowness of the A horizon indicated that post hole patterns and other features would be preserved in places where they had penetrated into the underlying clay. Additional excavations were recommended to further investigate the more productive southeastern portion of the site. EXCAVATION STRATEGY Prior to the start of excavations, a grid system measuring 80 x 40 m was laid out over the southeast slope of site 41NV182. The grid was oriented 17° east of magnetic north, conforming to the orientation of the slope (Figure 12-1). Within the gridded area an initial series of 50 x 50 cm units was excavated at 5 m intervals. All units were excavated to a depth of 30 cm, which represented the average depth to the clay B horizon in this portion of the site. The soil matrix was water-screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh hardware cloth. A total of 149 units was excavated during this initial phase of site investigation. The counts of recovered artifacts were used to generate spatial maps (using the SYMAP program) of the site's subsurface content, The resulting maps indicated two major areas of high artifact concentration. Both of these were located in the eastern portion of the grid system. To further define this patterning, an additional series of 133 50 x 50 cm units was excavated. This resulted in units located at 2.5 m intervals over an area measuring 25 x 40 m (Figure 12-2). Again, these units were excavated to a depth of 30 cm, and the soil was passed through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) screen. The next phase of investigation involved the excavation of trenches composed of contiguous 1 x 1 m units in the two areas where the SYMAPs showed high artifact densities. Excavation in the northern area initially consisted of cross trenches composed of 30 contiguous units (see Figure 12-2). An additional 1 x 1 m unit and a 0.5 x 1 m unit were added to further investigate two features encountered during these excavations (Features 1 and 2). 125

Map of site 41NV182 The relatively shallow A horizon was removed as a single level in most of these units. The deposit was considerably deeper in the far eastern end of the east-west trench. This area proved to be the location of a historic feature (Feature 2). Unit 2169 (210N 289E) was excavated as a control unit in 10 cm levels. The underlying clay was encountered at a depth of 90 cm in this unit, and historic period artifacts were present throughout the deposit. The excavated fill from all units was water-screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh hardware cloth. Profiles were drawn of the north wall of the east-west trench and the east wall of the north-south trench. A plan map was made showing the locations of Features 1 and 2, and two post holes discovered during the excavations. Five contiguous 1 x 1 m units were excavated in the area of the southern SYMAP cluster (see Figure 12-2). This appears to have been the location of a large, prehistorically excavated pit (Feature 3). The depth to clay varied between 65 cm and 70 cm in these units. Again, all excavated fill was water-screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) hardware cloth. Following excavation, a 5 m long profile of the north wall of these units was drawn. The final phase of Season III investigation consisted of the search for and excavation of features. In two areas of the site (Areas 1 and 2 in Figure 12-2), the A horizon was mechanically removed to expose any features preserved in the clay enriched B horizon. A bulidozer was used to strip these areas to the top of the B horizon. The resulting surface was planed off using a tractor equipped with a box scraper, and finally, by hand scraping the surface with sharpened hoes. A plan map showing feature locations and configurations was made for both stripped areas. Most of these features were cross- sectioned and sampled for artifactual, faunal, and floral contents. Three human burials (Features 12, 15, and 16) and a single burned rock concentration (Feature 4) were excavated completely. Flotation samples were taken from all excavated features and the remainder of the excavated fill was water-screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh hardware cloth. Profiles were drawn of all cross-sectioned features. MN ° 20 40 eee cos meters Contour Interval lm showing locations of excavation units. Two 1 x 1 m units (Units 4001 [214N 280E] and 4002 [213N 280E]) were excavated in 10 cm levels within a large depression (Feature 18) that was manifested as a dark stained area in Area 1. Another large depression (Feature 17) was partially exposed in the northeast comer of Area 2. This feature was cross-sectioned by Backhoe Trench 1. The north wall profile of this backhoe trench was drawn, and a flotation sample was taken from near the bottom of the feature. Additional excavations were conducted at site 41NV182 during Season IV with two primary objectives: (1) obtaining a sample of the contents of Feature 17, and (2) locating additional features through the mechanical stripping of Area 3 (see Figure 12-2). Feature 17 was sampled with four 0.5 x 1 m units (Units 4007- 4010) excavated in arbitrary 10 cm levels. All excavated fill was water-screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) hardware cloth. Mechanical stripping of the A horizon from Area 3 followed the same procedures described above. Several additional features were identified, mapped and investigated. Once again, features were cross-sectioned and sampled for artifactual, faunal, and floral contents. : A total of 218 person-days was expended to accomplish all phases of investigation at site 41NV182. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS SITE STRATIGRAPHY The large knoll on which site 41NV182 is located is underlain by Eocene age bedrock of the Wilcox Formation. This bedrock is only visible within the channel of Richland Creek. The knoll itself is made up of Pleistocene age terrace sediments. The archaeological deposits of site 41NV182 are contained within the upper part of these terrace sediments. The general site stratigraphy consists of an artifact-bearing, sandy loam A horizon underlain by a sandy clay, argillic B

It also varied in color depending upon the amount of organic staining, but was always noticeably darker than the yellowish brown B horizon. Biological disturbances such as plant root growth and rodent burrowing, and recent cultural disturbances such as plowing have primarily impacted the sandy loam A horizon. The clay B horizon is a much more stable zone in comparison to the A horizon. Experience during site excavation showed that the upper parts of features, such as pits and post holes, were not definable within the A horizon. These features were visible only in places where they had penetrated into the underlying B horizon. They were identifiable as dark stained areas on the surface of the lighter colored clay. The stratigraphic characteristics of the site deposit figured prominently in our choice of excavation techniques. After the A horizon had been sampled extensively, selected areas of the site were stripped to the top of the clay B horizon to facilitate the identification of features. This technique was successful and the features are discussed below. FEATURES Thirty-one features were identified at site 4INV182. Of this total, seven were post holes that appear to be related to the prehistoric occupation. Two features (Features 2 and 24) were of recent historic age. Additional post holes associated with the historic Feature 2 were not given individual designations, but were considered to be part of that feature. Features 12, 15, and 16 contained human burials. Feature 14 was originally designated as Burial 1, because a human mandible was observed at the scraped surface of this feature. However, subsequent excavation of this supposed grave pit failed to locate any additional, intact, human remains. All 31 features are described below. These descriptions are followed by an analysis and discussion of feature contents. A more detailed discussion of the burials is presented in a later section of this site report. FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS The cultural features are described in numerical order, followed by a brief description of the seven post holes. A plan map of their locations is shown in Figure 12-3. Feature 1 (Figure 12-4b) This was a circular pit measuring 79 cm in diameter that was first encountered in Unit 3206 (206N 284E). The pit outline was not definable in the 20 cm thick A horizon of this unit, but was observed as a very dark gray (10YR3/1) stain at the surface of the yellowish brown (10YR5/6) sandy clay B horizon. Unit 4005 (206N 283E) was opened to expose the feature in full plan view. Cross-sectioning of the feature revealed a shallow, basin-shaped profile. Maximum depth was 10 cm below the surface of the B horizon. The entire fill of Feature 1 was collected for flotation. The feature fill itself contained no temporally diagnostic artifacts, but the A horizon deposits of Units 3206 and 4005 contained one Alba arrow point, three Gary dart points, one dart point base fragment, and eight grog tempered sherds. Feature 2 This large, historic feature has been interpreted as the remains of a sawmill carriage pit and associated shed. The recovered historic artifacts indicate an early twentieth century date (ca. 1910- 1930) for this feature. Additional historic artifacts were recovered from some of the excavation units located in the eastern portion of the site.

This depression was presumed to be a cultural feature and was designated Feature 3. The areal extent of Feature 3 has not been determined. It was 70 cm deep in the area of the excavated units, but this may not represent the maximum depth of the feature. The excavated fill was a very dark gray (10YR3/1) sandy loam containing midden debris and relatively large amounts of fire cracked rock. Feature 3 may be similar to two other depressions that have been identified at site 41NV182. These are Features 17 and 18. The locations of these large depressions correlate well with the locations of major fire cracked rock concentrations in the A horizon, and they may be analogous to the large roasting pits that have been identified at site 41FT201. Feature 4 (Figure 12-4e) This was a roughly elliptical concentration of fire cracked rock and charcoal. It was located within the fill of a large depression that has been designated Feature 18. Feature 4 was visible at the scraped surface of Area 1 after approximately 25 cm of A horizon had been removed. It measured 75 cm by 40 cm and had a basin- shaped profile with a maximum depth of 14 cm below the scraped surface. The feature fill contained large quantities of fire cracked rock, animal bone, and artifacts, including one Edgewood dart point, one Gary dart point, one dart point base fragment, and two arrow point tip fragments. Charcoal from this feature yielded a date of A.D. 870 + 140 (Beta 9063). Flotation samples were not collected from this feature. Feature 5 (Figure 12-4a) This feature was a shallow, circular pit almost identical to Feature 1 in size and configuration. It measured 81 cm in diameter and had a basin-shaped profile extending to a maximum depth of 10 cm below the scraped surface of Area 1. The excavated feature fill contained the medial section of a dart point blade and a single, sandy paste potsherd. Features 6 and 7 (Figure 12-5a) These were two intersecting pits that were originally observed as a single, irregularly shaped, very dark gray (10YR3/1) stained area at the southern edge of Area 1. The cross section suggested that Features 6 and 7 were two separate pits. The profile of Feature 6 was approximately 100 cm long and was basin-shaped with a maximum depth 23 cm below the scraped surface. Feature 6 appears to be intrusive into a portion of Feature 7. Feature 6 contained no temporally diagnostic artifacts. Feature 7 was a large, irregularly shaped pit that measured about 180 cm in both maximum length and width.

130 irregular, basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 25cm. A Gary dart point, two sandy paste sherds, and one grog tempered sherd were recovered from the fill of this feature. Feature 8 (Figure 12-5b) This was a pit with an oval outline and a relatively deep (75 cm below the scraped surface), basin-shaped profile. The cross section was 180 cm long and revealed several large pieces of fire cracked rock near the bottom of the feature. The maximum width was 127 cm. Diagnostic artifacts recovered from Feature 8 included a Scallorn arrow point, a Gary dart point, and five sherds, Feature 9 (Figure 12-5d) This pit had an irregular oval outline measuring 212 cm long and 175 cm wide. It was basin-shaped in profile, with a maximum depth of 48 cm below the scraped surface. A thin (2 cm) layer along the bottom of the pit contained numerous small pieces of burned clay and a noticeably higher density of artifacts. Diagnostic artifacts recovered from the feature fill included two arrow points, two Gary dart points, and one sandy paste sherd. A sample of charcoal and carbonized nutshell from Feature 9 yielded a date of A.D. 670 + 130 (Beta 9064). Feature 10 (Figure 12-5b) This was an oval (length 80 cm, width 40 cm) pit with a basin- shaped profile. Maximum depth was 38 cm below the scraped surface of Area 1. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from the excavated portion of this feature. Feature 11 (Figure 12-5c) This was an irregularly shaped pit measuring 203 cm in maximum length and 156 cm in maximum width. A long, linear disturbance extended from the northeastern edge of Feature 11, but was not considered to be part of this feature. Cross-sectioning revealed a basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 38 cm below the scraped surface. Diagnostic artifacts recovered from the feature fill included two arrow points (a Scallorn and an untyped, expanding stem) and two dart points (a Gary and a Yarbrough). Feature 12 This feature was an irregularly shaped pit intruding into the fill of the large depression designated Feature 18. The two 1 x 1m units excavated in Feature 18 caught the western edge of Feature 12, revealing an irregular, basin-shaped profile extending 20 cm below the scraped surface. The maximum width of Feature 12 was 120 cm, and it was at least 200 cm long, but continued for an unknown distance into the north wall of Area 1. The fill of Feature 12 was slightly lighter in color (10YR3/1) than that of the surrounding Feature 18 (10YR2/1). , When the site was returned to in Season IV, human remains (Burial 9) were discovered eroding from the southern portion of Feature 12. Subsequent excavation uncovered the partially disturbed remains of an adult. This individual was flexed and placed on the right side with the head oriented toward the west. Feature 13 This was a small, oval pit (length 46 cm, width 25 cm). The profile was basin-shaped with a maximum depth of 20 cm below the scraped surface of Area 1. Rodent disturbance was evident at the base of this feature. The excavated fill contained only small amounts of lithic debris, bone fragments, and fire cracked rock. Volume II, Part One Feature 14 This feature was originally thought to be a grave pit because a human mandible was observed at the scraped surface. Its outline was defined by its slightly lighter colored (1OYR3/1) matrix within the dark (1OYR2/1) central portion of Feature 18. It extended for an unknown distance into the north wall of Area 1. Subsequent excavation of the exposed portion of Feature 14 failed to recover additional human remains. The feature appears to be roughly oval in plan view (length >150 cm, width 140 cm), and the profile was basin-shaped with a very irregular bottom. Rodent burrowing had greatly disturbed the eastern half of this feature so that its lower boundary was difficult to define. The maximum depth was 32 cm below the scraped surface of Area 1. Diagnostic artifacts consisted of two Gary dart points, one dart point tip fragment, one dart point base fragment, and one grog tempered sherd. Feature 15 This was the grave pit containing Burials 2 and 4. The pit was roughly oval in outline with maximum dimensions of 96 cm long, 72 cm wide, and 22 cm deep below the scraped surface of Area 1. Burial 2 was the complete skeleton of an aduit male. This individual was flexed and placed on the right side with the head oriented toward the east. Burial 4 consisted of the cranial and facial remains, and the upper thoracic area of a 5- to 8-year-old individual, and was located immediately southwest of Burial 2. Two Gary dart points were recovered from the fill at the northern edge of the grave pit, but these may not have been intentional inclusions. Feature 16 This was the location of Burial 3, which consisted of the lower limbs and phalanges of a 6- to 10-year-old individual. No grave outline was visible but all skeletal material was confined to an area measuring 30 cm long, 15 cm wide, and 10 cm deep. Three dart points were found within this area: one Dawson, one Yarbrough and one untyped, straight stem. Additional phalanges and cranial fragments that may be assignable to Burial 3 were recovered from the fill of Feature 4, located about 1 m to the northeast. Portions of this burial probably were removed during the mechanical stripping of Area 1. Feature 17 This feature was first recognized as a very dark gray (10YR3/1), stained area in the northeast corner of Area 2. The northern limits of Feature 17 were defined during the scraping of Area 3, and its contents were sampled by four 0.5 x 1 m units (4007-4010). The entire outline was not exposed, but this feature appears to be an irregularly shaped pit measuring almost 10 m across at the surface of the B horizon. Backhoe Trench 1 provided a partial cross section (Figure 12-6), revealing an irregular, basin- shaped profile that extended more than 100 cm below the original site surface. The undulating pit bottom may be the result of a series of smaller and deeper pits. The deepest of these contained a concentration of fire cracked rock, and it is from there that the flotation sample was collected. Feature 18 This feature is a very large, irregularly shaped pit similar to Feature 17. It was first observed as a dark stained area at the northern edge of Area 1 measuring more than 10 m across. Features 4, 12, 14, and 16 all were located within the limits of Feature 18. While Features 4 (a burned rock concentration) and 16 oo a O@erw gRpepreenke | —=—_ "7 2. 2 eo? a ee)

(a burial) could be related to the original use of the pit; Features 12 and 14 are smaller, intrusive pits that were excavated into the fill of Feature 18 at a later time. The maximum depth of Feature 18 is not known for certain. In Units 4001 and 4002, the sandy clay B horizon was encountered at a depth of only 20 cm below the scraped surface (ca. 45 cm below the pre-excavation surface of the Site). Feature 19 (Figure 12-Se) This is a large pit with a somewhat irregular outline, measuring 280 cm in length and 265 cm in width. In profile, the pit had an irregular basin shape with a maximum depth of 52 cm below the scraped surface of Area 3. The spatial maps derived from the 50 x 50 cm unit data had shown a small, high-density cluster of fire cracked rock in the A horizon at the location of Feature 19. Similar, but larger, high-density clusters of fire cracked rock had marked the locations of Features 3, 17, and 18. However, within the fill of Feature 19 the relative density of fire cracked rock was much lower than in these other three features. The only possibly diagnostic artifacts recovered from Feature 19 were two dart point fragments. Feature 20 (Figure 12-4c) This was a shallow, circular pit measuring 77 cm in diameter. It is almost identical to Features 1 and 5 in size and configuration. It had a shallow, basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 14 cm below the scraped surface of Area 3. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from this feature. Feature 21 (Figure 12-5f) This feature was approximately oval in plan view, measuring 220 cm in length and 12 cm in width. Cross-sectioning revealed a basin-shaped profile with a maximum depth of 42 cm below the scraped surface of Area 3. Diagnostic artifacts recovered from the fill included three arrow points and 10 grog tempered sherds. A sample of carbonized nutshell from this feature yielded a date of A.D. 1140 + 50 (Beta 11183). The date and the diagnostic artifacts indicate that Feature 21 was associated with a later period of occupation than that which produced the majority of features at site 41NV182. Feature 22 This appears to be a small, circular pit that was only partially exposed at the south edge of Area 3. The visible portion of this feature measured 45 cm in diameter. Feature 22 was not excavated. Feature 23 (Figure 12-4d) This feature first appeared as a small, oval stain at the scraped surface of Area 1. It measured 21 cm in length and 15 cm in width. Cross-sectioning showed that its diameter expanded with depth toa

132 Volume III, Part One North Profile 272E 274E 276E i 1 1 1 1 Black Fill maximum of 35 cm. The profile resembled an irregular bell shape with a maximum depth of 22 cm beneath the scraped surface. The feature fill contained no temporally diagnostic artifacts. _ Feature 24 This feature was only partially exposed at the eastern end of Area 3. It was observed as a rectangular, dark stain at the surface of the B horizon. Within this stained area were several large patches of burned clay. It is thought that this was the location of a boiler that was one component of an early twentieth century, steam powered sawmill. Other remains that can be attributed to this late historic period use of the site are a large ash deposit that was cross- sectioned by Backhoe Trench 2, and Feature 2, which has been interpreted as a sawmill carriage pit and associated shed. The exposed portion of the ash deposit is located approximately 8m southeast of Feature 24, while Feature 2 is 4.5 m to the north. Post Holes Seven post holes were identified during the excavations at site 41NV182, These were assigned the alphanumeric designations P1 through P7. All were roughly circular in plan, but they varied considerably in both diameter and depth (Table 12-1). Post Holes 6 and 7 are considerably larger than the others, and resemble the centerposts of the house structures at site 41FT201. The profiles of all seven post holes are shown in Figure 12-7. . Post Holes 1, 2, and 7 were isolated occurrences, but Post Holes 3, 4, 5, and 6 all were found within the north half of Area 2 (see Figure 12-3). The A horizon was quite shallow in this area, and only about 20 cm of overburden was stripped from Area 2. Considering the substantial depth of Post Holes 3 and 4 (17 cm and 15 cm below the scaped surface), it is unlikely that additional post holes were scraped away during the mechanized stripping of Area 2. FEATURE CONTENTS Most of the features were sampled for artifact content. For the very large pits (Features 3, 17, and 18), this was accomplished with either 1 x 1 mor 0.5 x 1 m excavation units. All fill from 278E 280E | t ‘ horizon horizon Very Dark Grayish Brown Sandy Loam Figure 12-6. North profile of Feature 17 (North wall of Backhoe Trench 1). these units was water-screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh. The standard procedure for sampling the other prehistoric features involved cross-sectioning, and removing the fill from only one half of the feature. A soil sample of at least 15 1 was removed from each feature for flotation, and the remainder of the fill was water-screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh. For some small features, the sampled volume was less than 15 1, and all of this was retained for flotation. The contents of these features are tabulated in Table 12-2 and 12-3. Features 3, 17, and 18 have been identified as roasting pits because of their morphological similarities to those at site 41FT201. As will be demonstrated in a later section of this site report, the locations of these large, irregular pits correlated spatially with high-density clusters of fire cracked rock recovered from the site's A horizon. When the weights of fire cracked rock are converted to grams per 100! of feature fill (Table 12-4), it can be seen that the densities are consistently high for Features 3, 17, and 18. However, four other features contained fire cracked rock in densities that are similar to, or greater than, those of the roasting pits. In two instances these high fire cracked rock densities are easily explained. Feature 4 contained the highest density simply because this feature was defined as a burned rock concentration located within Feature 18. Feature 14 was an intrusive pit within Feature 18, and its fill most likely derived from the surrounding matrix. Features 8 and 9, however, were located outside of the high-density A horizon clusters of fire Table 12-1 Post Hote DIMENSIONS FROM SITE 41NV182 Diameter (cm) Depth!

The relatively large amounts of fire cracked rock in the fill of these features may indicate that they once functioned as - roasting pits or earth ovens. Most of the variability in the relative densities of bone and shell (see Table 12-3) correlates with the horizontal location of the features. As discussed in a later section of this chapter, spatial maps of bone and shell densities within the 50 x 50 cm A horizon excavations show definite spatial clustering. In general, the features located within these clusters contained the highest densities of bone and shell. This may indicate that much of the fill within features consists of general midden soil that is perhaps unrelated to the original function of the feature. The diagnostic artifacts recovered from individual features have been mentioned in the feature descriptions. Most of the features at site 41NV182 are thought to date somewhere between A.D. 700 and A.D. 900. A relatively low density of ceramics, including a distinctive sandy paste variety, and the presence of both dart and arrow points are thought to characterize this time period. The diagnostic artifacts from Feature 9 are considered to be typical of this period. Dated to A.D. 670 + 130, this feature contained two Gary dart points (one regular variety and one small variety), two arrow points, and a single sandy paste sherd. On the other hand, Feature 21 dated to a later component, and the diagnostics from its fill were different from those of Feature 9. Feature 21 yielded a radiocarbon date of A.D. 1140 + 50 and contained three arrow points and 10 grog tempered sherds. Although grog tempered ceramics are thought to have been used during the earlier occupation, Feature 21 contained neither dart points or sandy paste ceramics. HUMAN OSTEOLOGY (by Gary W. Rutenberg) Skeletal remains from at least nine individuals were recovered from site 41NV182. The overall condition of these remains was poor and highly fragmentary. Burials 1 to 4 and 9 were all 133 discovered after partial exposure by heavy equipment. Fragmentary remains of at least four other individuals were recovered from hand excavated units. The methods used in this report have been outlined previously (Rutenberg 1982). BURIAL DESCRIPTIONS Burial 1 Sex unknown, 25-35 years; fragmentary remains of body of left mandible, possibly associated cranial fragments. Burial 2 Male, 35-45 years; complete skeleton, highly fragmented and in poor condition. Individual was flexed, placed on the right side with the head oriented toward the east. Slight periostitis can be noted on the left tibia and a small neoplasm occurs midshaft of the medial aspect of the right femur. Rodent gnawing occurs on the fibula. Considerable hypercementosis is noted on the anterior dentition. Burial 3 Female? 6-10 years; lower limbs, cranial fragments and phalanges are present. Individual appears to have been flexed, but orientation of the body is difficult to ascertain. Burial 4 Sex unknown, 5-8 years; cranial-facial remains and portions of upper thoracic area found in association with Burial 2. Burial position is indeterminate, but the individual was apparently buried on its left side with the head oriented toward the south. (The following fragmentary remains were recovered from various excavation units throughout site 41NV182. Skeletal remains were matched by age attributes, non-redundancy of skeletal elements, spatial proximity, and bone consistency. Some fragmentary remains were attributed to Burials 1 through 4.) Burial 5 Sex unknown, young adult, cranial fragments and premolar recovered from Units 2156 (210N 276E), 2154 (210N 274E), and 341 (207.5N 275E). Burial 6 Sex unknown, 30-40 years; maxillary molar recovered from Unit 311 (217.5N 285). Burial 7 Sex unknown, mid-adult; cranial fragments and premolar recovered from Unit 3212 (212N 284E). Burial 8 Sex unknown, 5-9 years; cranial fragments, unerupted permanent premolar, worn deciduous molar recovered from Unit 2167 (210N 287E). Burial 9 Female, approximately 25 to 35 years of age. Gender identification was made via secondary sexual traits (the gracile nature of the mastoid and accompanying cranial muscle origins). Age determination was estimated by the relative degree of occlusal! surface attrition on the dentition. Skeletal remains recovered from this individual consisted of much of the left calvarium, portions of

No skeletal evidence of traumatic death has been found. Fragmentary remains recovered at 41NV182 were matched with Burials 1 through 4. The matching procedure, which considered age and gender attributes, nonredundancy of skeletal elements, bone consistency, and spatial distribution, yielded four additional individuals. Roper (1976) argued that lateral displacement of artifacts (and thus, skeletal material) on a disturbed site may be minimal. Roper demonstrated mean artifact movement at approximately 4 m and median artifact displacement at less than 2 m. The probability that skeletal elements at distances of greater than 5 m are from the same individual can be assumed to diminish considerably. Therefore, spatial distribution of skeletal materials at site 41NV182 became an extremely important factor in the assessment of individual burial identity.

However, the robust femoral and tibial measures taken from this individual are consistent with male measures from previous work. PALEOPATHOLOGY The individuals recovered from site 41NV182 are relatively free from disease impacting the skeletons. Burials 2 and 3 demonstrated probable (slight) periostitis on tibial fragments. An amorphous neoplastic area (approximately 2.25 cm by 0.8 cm) was ‘ found midshaft on the medial aspect of the right femur of Burial 2. No associated cloacal openings or periostitis was noted. For Burial 9, a possible anomaly was noted on the proximal articular surface of the (right?) fifth proximal phalange. The defect is a groove into the articular surface of the bone, giving the surface a ‘horseshoe’ appearance. Dental pathology is minor and limited largely to carious lesions and calculus deposits. Enamel hypoplasia and root hyper- cementosis are found in lesser amounts. Dental calculus is prevalent on the posterior teeth of most adult individuals and is moderate in degree. Table 12-6 presents a brief summary of the dental pathologies. ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS A complete tabulation of all artifact classes by their proveniences is presented in Appendix F (Table F-11). Artifacts recovered from features are tabulated separately in Table 12-2. The lithic tools and ceramics are described below. Provenience designations follow each description and present the unit number first, followed by the level number (e.g., 313.1). LITHIC TOOLS Arrow Points Alba (7 specimens, Figure 12-8a,b).

Dart Points Bulverde (1 specimen). This specimen has a large triangular blade with prominent, slightly barbed shoulders and a rather long rectangular stem with straight base. Material: quartzite. Provenience: 2168.1. Dari (2 specimens, Figure 12-9a). These specimens have rather narrow blades with slightly convex edges and poorly developed shoulders. Their rather short stems are slightly expanding with concave bases. Materials: both are chert. Proveniences: 2162.1, 4002.1. Dawson (12 specimens, Figure 12-8b). These specimens all have relatively long and narrow parallel sided or slightly contracting stems. The stem edges are lightly ground on seven specimens. Ten of them have relatively long and narrow blades, whereas two specimens have much broader blades. Only three specimens retain cortex on their base. This type was originally defined by Duffield (1963a:17-18) and later expanded upon by Prewitt (1974:58-62). Materials: quartzite (6), chert (5), Pisgah Ridge chert (1). Proveniences: 140.1, 141.1, 359.1, 378.1, 403.1, 1285.1, 1288.1, 2154.1, 2164.1, 2168.1, 3215.1, Feature 16. Edgewood (2 specimens). These specimens have triangular blades with prominent shoulders. Their distinctive, markedly expanding stems are rather short and almost as wide as the blades. The bases are concave on both specimens. Materials: both are chert. Proveniences: 187.1, Feature 4. Elam (3 specimens). The short, rather crudely made specimens have roughly rectangular stems with slightly convex bases. The blade shoulders are weakly developed on all specimens. Materials: chert (1), silicified wood (1), Pisgah Ridge chert (1). Proveniences: 389.1, 402.1, 2166.1. Gary, Regular Variety (45 specimens, Figure 12-9c,g). These specimens are characterized by their triangular blades and contracting stems with rounded bases. There is a considerable range in blade form with shoulders varying from poorly developed to prominent. True barbs do not occur in this sample. Specimens which are similar in morphology, but less than 3 cm in length are included in the Gary, small variety category. Materials: quartzite (33), chert (11), silicified wood (1). Proveniences: (see Table 12-7). Gary, Serrated Blade (15 specimens). These are similar to the regular variety of Gary except that their blade edges are serrated. The blades are distinctly beveled on ten specimens. The stems are only slightly contracting on all but one. They are somewhat similar to Prewitt's (1974:67) Neches River, oletha variety. Materials: quartzite (8), chert (6), silicified wood (1).

They have rather narrow blades with pointed distal ends and rounded proximal ends. The blade edges are serrated on one of these specimens. A fourth specimen as a broad triangular blade and a small contracting stem. Similar specimens have been classified by others as dart points of the Gary type, alsa variety (Johnson 1962:161; Story 1965:190). The four remaining specimens are fragmentary. Three of these are pointed, distal portions and the fourth is a proximal portion with a rounded base. Materials: chert (3), quartzite (4), Edwards chert (1). Proveniences: 118.1, 132.2, 213.1, 343.1, 3213.1, 3214.1, 3215.1, Feature 21. Knife, Small Subtriangular (1 specimen). This specimen is distinguished by its rather small size (3 cm in length) and triangular outline. Similar specimens from site 41NV173 were recognized as being sufficiently different from other knife forms to warrant their inclusion in a separate subcategory. Material: chert. Provenience: 323.1. Aborted Bifaces Early Stage (26 specimens). These specimens tend to be thick and somewhat irregular in outline, with sinuous edges formed by the removal of large flakes. All specimens retain at last one area of nodular cortex. Although some of these specimens may have been used as cutting or chopping tools, their unfinished appearance has led to their classification as rejects from an early stage in the biface production process. Materials: quartzite (20), chert (4), silicified wood (2), Proveniences: 133.1 (2), 193.1, 206.1, 303.1, 346.1, 349.1, 373.1, 422.1, 1286.1, 1289.1, 2157.1 (2), 2159.1, 2160.1, 2161.1, 2164.1, 3212.1, 3213.1, 3214.1, 4001.1, 4008.3, Feature 14, Feature 21 (2). Late Stage (34 specimens). The edges of these specimens are less sinuous than those in the Early Stage subcategory, but they lack evidence of fine secondary retouch. Some specimens retain minor amounts of cortex or have an area of step-fracturing on one face. Outlines are variable and include oval, leaf Shaped, and subtrianguiar. Again, some of these specimens could have been used as cutting tools. Materials: quartzite (21), chert (11), silicified wood (2). Proveniences: 132.1, 140.1, 144.1, 160.1, 179.1, 186.1, 311.1, 319.1, 322.1, 324.1, 334.1, 378.1, 385.1, 1285.1 (2), 1289.1 (2), 2161.1, 2164.1, 2165.1, 2166.1 (2), 2168.1, 2170.1, 3206.1, 3212.1, 3213.1,(3), 3215.1, 4002.2, 4006.1, 4008.1, Feature 8 (2). Arrow Point Preforms (11 specimens). These specimens are made on small flakes and are generally subtriangular in outline, Their edges were shaped by varying amounts of bifacial and unifacial retouch. The proximal ends of some specimens retain portions of the flake's original striking platform. None of these specimens are stemmed. Materials: quartzite (5), chert (6). Proveniences: 164.1, 187.1, 378.1, 1285.2, 2164.1, 2165.1 (2), Feature 8, Feature 9 (2), Feature 19. Biface Fragments Possible Projectile Point Tip Fragments (100 specimens). These are pointed, distal fragments of bifacially worked artifacts whose size and configurations suggest that they are the broken tips of projectile points. Forty-three are of arrow point size. Materials: quartzite (34), chert (20), Edwards chert (1), Pisgah Ridge chert (1). Fifty-seven are of dart point size. Materials: quartzite (34), chert (20), Edwards chert (1), Pisgah Ridge chert (1). Proveniences: (see Table 12-7). 139 Possible Projectile Point Base Fragments (48 specimens). These specimens appear to be the proximal ends of stemmed projectile points, Six specimens are of arrow point size. Materials: quartzite (5), chert (1). Forty-two are of dart point size. Materials: quartzite (22), chert (15), Edwards chert (3), silicified wood (2). Proveniences: (see Table 12-7). Possible Dart Point Medial Fragments (6 specimens). The size and morphology of these fragmentary specimens suggest that they may be medial blade sections of dart points. Materials: chert (3), quartzite (3). Proveniences: (see Table 12-7). Indeterminate Fragments (291 specimens). These are broken specimens with at least one edge showing evidence of bifacial chipping. They are too fragmentary to be confidently assigned to any of the bifacial tool categories. Materials: quartzite (141), chert (119), silicified wood (14), Edwards chert (13), Pisgah Ridge chert (4). Proveniences: (see Table 12-7). Steeply Chipped Unifaces Gossett Gouges (4 specimens, Figure 12-10e). These specimens were made from rather flat nodules of lithic material and all have straight, steeply chipped bits at one end. The flat ventral surfaces of all specimens retain their nodular cortex, and all but one specimen retain some cortex on their upper surfaces. All or some portions of the lateral edges of these specimens have been unifacially retouched. The proximal end remains unworked on two specimens and unifacially retouched on the others. This artifact category was originally defined by Story (1965:208-210). Materials: quartzite (3), silicified wood (1). Proveniences: Surface, 117.1, 349.1, 2159.1.

Sherd thickness ranges from 5.0 to 11.0 mm, with an average of 7.2 mm. Exterior and interior colors are shades of reddish yellow (10YR6/6, 10YR7/6, 1OYR8/6), gray (7.5YR4/0, 10YR4/1, 7.5YRS5/0), and brown (10YR5/3, 10YR7/3). Interior colors are darker (7.5YR3/0, 7.5YR2/0, 10YR3/1). The ceramics from 41NV182 are important, since they represent a sample from primarily one component. Although some later material does occur (perhaps the engraved specimens; Figure 12-11g) and a radiocarbon date of A.D. 1140 + 50 was obtained from Feature 21, most of the material from the site seems to relate to an earlier occupation. Radiocarbon dates place this occupation between A.D. 670 and 870. At this time, both grog and sand tempered ceramics were used, with some of the sherds heavily tempered with sand. Although many of the vessels were plain, punctations and incised lines on the rim panels were used Volume ITI, Part One occasionally. These designs are similar to stylistic elements present on the type Canton Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962:22-23). ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS During the mitigation program at 41NV182, spatial maps (SYMAP program) of the distribution of all artifact classes were generated from the 50 x 50 cm unit data. These spatial maps showed that the vast majority of artifacts were located in the eastern portion of the grid system (east of 270E). All subsequent excavations were located in this area of the site. The spatial maps also indicated that two separate areas of high artifact density were present within this eastern portion of the grid system. This is best illustrated by the distribution of lithic debris, the category with the largest numbers of specimens (Figure 12-12). The distribution of faunal remains was somewhat different. The major concentration of animal bone covers an area approx- imately 20 m north-south by 10 m east-west (Figure 12-13). Most of this concentration was located in the central portions of Areas 1 and 3. Later excavations in this section of the site served to confirm the animal bone distribution represented by the spatial maps. The distribution of mussel shell (Figure 12-14) was similar to that of bone, except that it formed a somewhat tighter cluster. The highest densities of both bone and shell were located within the area where subsequent investigations discovered a number of prehistoric pit features of various sizes. This seems to have been the principle area of activity at the site, where vertebrate and invertebrate animals were processed, and where their remains were discarded. Two major areas of fire cracked rock concentration can be observed in Figure 12-15. Subsequent investigations indicated that these are associated with the three large depressions that have been identified at site 41NV182. The somewhat smaller cluster to the north corresponds to the location of Feature 18. The larger, southern cluster seems to represent overlapping concentrations associated with Features 3 and 17. The association of these features with large amounts of fire cracked rock suggests that they may be analogous to the large roasting pits identified at site 41FT201 (see Chapter 4, Volume II). Definable clusters in the distribution of ceramics are not so apparent (Figure 12-16) but this may be due to the relatively small numbers of specimens recovered from each of the 50 x 50 cm units. As was the trend for the other artifact categories, the vast majority of ceramics were recovered from the eastern portion of the grid system. In fact, 224 of the 250 total sherds recovered from all 50 x 50 cm units were from those units located east of the 270E line. One interesting pattern concerns the distribution of the coarse-grained, sandy paste sherds. Sandy paste ceramics are thought to predate Caddoan style ceramics over much of the central and southern portions of East Texas (Shafer 1975; Story 1981), and presumably in the Project area as well.

Within the eastern portion of the site grid (east of 270E), sandy paste ceramics were noticeably more frequent in the 50 x 50 cm units located north of 200N than in the units to the south. Eighteen © (19%) of the 95 sherds from units north of 200N were sandy paste, while only five (3.9%) of the 129 sherds from units located south of 200N were sandy paste. When all excavations (50 x 50 cm units, 1x1 m units, and features) within these two areas are considered, this same pattern is still apparent. The North Area yielded 40 sandy paste sherds (18.6%) out of a total of 215 sherds. In the 240 260 280 300 EAST PIECES OF LITHIC DEBRIS 8.43-33.76 Figure 12-12. Distribution of lithic debris at site 41NV182. 33.77-84.40 84.41-211.00 South Area, only six (3.3%) of a total of 181 sherds were sandy paste. The difference appears to be significant, and suggests that an earlier period of occupation might be better represented in the North Area. This was supported somewhat by the radiocarbon dates. Dates of A.D. 670 + 130 and A.D. 870 + 140 were obtained from features located in the North Area. Feature 21, located to the south of these, yielded a date of A.D. 1140 + 50. However, the ratios of arrow point to dart points were not significantly different between these two areas. Sixty arrow points and 84 dart points 240 260 280 300 EAST BONE (g) 2.13-8.48 Figure 12-13.

Distribution of mussel shell at site 41NV182. 5.93-14.80 4 14.80-37.00 were recovered from all excavations in the North Area, for an arrow:dart point ratio of 0.70:1. From the South Area excavations, including Feature 21, 27 arrow points and 36 dart points were recovered, for an almost identical arrow:dart point ratio of 0.75:1. It is apparent that both areas of the site contained a scattering of materials related to relatively minor Archaic period occupations. These are indicated by the expanding and straight stemmed dart points, and perhaps some portion of the contracting stem Gary points. Although the arrow/dart point ratios are similar, certain point styles seem to be disproportionately overrepresented in the | North Area (Table 12-10). These include the Gary, regular variety and Gary, small variety among the dart points, and the Steiner and perhaps, Scallorn among the arrow points. These four point types may be most characteristic of the A.D. 700-900 occupation. Aside from the difference in the percentages of sandy paste sherds, the ceramic assemblages from these two subareas were very similar. The dominant temper type was grog, which is true for all Late Prehistoric period. sites in the Project area. The relatively few decorated sherds exhibited primarily punctations and incised lines. It appears that both grog tempered and sandy paste ceramics were used concurrently during the earlier, major period of occupation (ca. A.D. 700-900), and that only the grog tempered wares were diagnostic of a less intensive, slightly later use of the site (ca. A.D. 1000-1200). VERTEBRATE FAUNAL REMAINS (by Phillip Murry) The vertebrate faunal remains from all 1 x 1 m units, 0.5 x 1m units, and the excavated features at site 4INV182 were included in this analysis, The animal bone from the 50 x 50 cm units was weighed, and the spatial distribution of this material has been discussed in the preceding section of this site report. It was not, however, included in this analysis. Total weights of both burned and unburned bone were recorded for each excavation unit and feature (Table 12-11). When possible, the remains were identified as to skeletal element and species. The spatial maps of animal bone densities based on the contents of the 50 x 50 cm units indicated a major concentration, measuring about 20 m long and 10 m wide. This concentration stretched from the northern edge of Area 1 in the north, to the northern edge of Area 2 in the south. Subsequent excavations, although more limited in areal extent, also recovered the greatest amounts of animal bone from this same area.

Distribution of fire cracked rock at site 41NV 182. ¢ 85-210 211-527 In the north central part of Area 1, Units 4001 and 4002, and Features 4 and 14 contained large amounts of both burned and unburned bone. This included numerous elements of whitetail deer and testudinid turtle, along with minor amounts of fish, bird, rodent, and rabbit. A short distance to the south was an east-west trench composed of contiguous 1 x 1 m units. The units with the largest amounts of faunal remains were between 276E and 284E (Units 2156-2163). Remains of whitetail deer and testudinid turtle were the most numerous, but the relative lack of smaller species is probably due to the fact that no flotation samples were taken from these units. Several elements of domestic dog were recovered from two of these units as well. The most abundant and diverse collections of faunal remains were recovered from a series of pit features located at the southern edge of Area 1 and within Area 3 (primarily Features 7, 8, 9, 11, and 21). Deer and turtle (both softshell and testudinid) were most abundant; but rabbit, fish, snake, bird, raccoon, and rodent were also well represented. A vertebra and mandible fragment of domestic dog were recovered from Feature 9. Substantial quantities of bone were recovered from the 0.5 x 1 m units excavated within Feature 17.

Elements of rabbit, snake, rodent, bird, and beaver also were recovered from this feature. Faunal remains occurred in relatively lower densities in the other excavation units and features at site 41NV182, with the identifiable elements being dominated by those of deer and turtle. Possible bison remains were recovered from two 1 x 1 m units. Both of these specimens were very thick fragments of long bone that were tentatively assigned to that species. All intact, mandibular teeth of whitetail deer were examined to determine the ages of the individuals and, if possible, the season of death. Based on eruption and degree of wear, age could be determined for seven individuals (Table 12-12). According to Schmidly (1983:297), deer are in their prime between 2.5 and 7.5 years of age. The seven individuals from site 41NV182 may all fall within this range, although four of them are at the early end of it. The estimation of the season of death requires the determination of age in months. This is difficult to determine precisely for individuals that were older than 1.5 years and, therefore, could not be provided for the sample from site 41NV182. In summary, site 41NV182 produced an abundant and diverse faunal assemblage. Whitetail deer elements dominated the identifiable remains, but a wide variety of other terrestrial and aquatic species was represented as well. MACROBOTANICAL REMAINS (by Gayle J. Fritz) Nineteen flotation samples from 16 different features were examined for macrobotanical remains at the Ethnobotanical 145 Laboratory, Research Laboratories of Anthropology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The smallest screen size examined for these samples was the 1/32 in (0.79 mm) portion. Macrobotanical remains larger than 2.0 mm had been separated from other types of materials larger than 2.0 mm had been separated from other types of materials larger than 2.0 mm, present in the light and heavy fractions, prior to shipment. Contents of the 1/16 in (1.59 mm) and 1/32 in (0.79 mm) screens were sent to North Carolina with no previous sorting. Fragments larger than 2.0 mm were sorted completely according to category (Table 12-13). The weights of pecan shell, acom shell, and Psoralea tuber include fragments smaller than 2.0 mm. but larger than 1.4 mm. All carbonized seeds were separated. Items recovered from these samples included wood charcoal (8.76 g), hickory nutshell (9.69 g), pecan shell (0.16 g), acorn shell (0.16 g), the tuber thought to be Psoralea (0.40 g), a bulb resembling the wild onion, Allium sp. (0.11 g), and unknown carbonized fragments (0.64 g). The 19 samples contained only six, reasonably intact, carbonized seeds. Wood charcoal was present in all 16 features. Thick shelled, hickory nut (Carya sp.) fragments were present in all features except Post Hole 7. Pecan shell (Carya illinoensis) occurred in nine features. Acorn shell (Quercus spp.) was recovered from 13 features. As at other Project area sites, the most abundant plant food represented, other than nuts, was prairie turnip tuber (Psoralea sp., possibly Psoralea latestipulata). These remains occurred in 10 features at the site. Feature 1 also contained fragments, weighing 0.08 g, of what appears to be a type of tuber other than Psoralea. No taxonomic determination of that material has been made. Another type of underground plant part was present in Feature 5. The heavy fraction of that sample included a bulb that closely resembles wild onion (Allium sp.). The 19 samples contained only six reasonably intact, carbonized seeds and 10 unidentifiable, seed fragments. Two spheroidal vetch or wild pea seeds were recovered. The specimens in Feature 1 has an exceptionally well-preserved hilum and surface patterning that looks like Lathyrus pusillus. The specimen from Feature 7 is not as well preserved and might be either Lathyrus or Vicia. One chenopod seed (Chenopodium sp.) and one spurge seed (Euphorbia cf. maculata) were present in Feature 9. Use of the former genus for food is possible, but both specimens might have been charred incidentally rather than during activities connected with food processing or consumption. Two seeds, one from Feature 6 and a second from Feature 14, remain unidentified. The former resembles the true seed (interior “kernel") of wild sumpweed fruit (/va sp.), but also looks very much like the true seed inside the hard fruit wall of biconvex Polygonum nutlets. No diagnostic embryo or ribbing could be discerned, and the shape seems somewhat altered by carbonization. The low numbers of seeds in these samples reflect the same pattern exhibited by macrobotanical assemblages from other Project area sites. Hickory nuts, acorns, pecans, and tubers are the dominant plant foods represented. Other underground plant parts were exploited, and a few seed types evidently were gathered as a minor dietary element. No evidence of plant domestication was found at site 41NV182. The Psoralea and vetch seeds suggest spring/early summer occupation, while the Chenopodium seed and the high nutshell percentages indicate a fall utilization of the site as well. INTERPRETATIONS Most of the features and artifacts from site 41NV182 are thought to have resulted from an occupation dating between A.D. 700 and A.D. 900. It appears that both contracting stem, Gary dart points and arrow points were in use during this period. Expanding and straight stem dart points accounted for a relatively minor portion of the projectile point assemblage, and they probably indicate a minor, yet significant occupation of the site during the Late Archaic period.

The coarse-grained, sandy paste sherds are thought to be diagnostic of the A.D. 700-900 period. These accounted for over 11% of the total 442 sherds from site 41NV182, but were relatively more common in what has been defined as the North Area of the site. This difference in the spatial distribution of sandy paste sherds is thought to indicate a less intensive, slightly later occupation that was concentrated in the South Area of the site. The A.D. 1140 + 50 radiocarbon date from 147 Feature 21 suggests that this later occupation was contemporary with Late Prehistoric period occupations elsewhere in the Project area (See Volume II). Subsurface features at the site included three, very large depressions that are thought to have been roasting pits, based on their association with large amounts of fire cracked rock. The irregular profiles of these large pits, and the presence of smaller, intrusive pits within them, suggest that they were reused repeatedly during the period of site occupation. The only radiocarbon date from within one of these features (A.D. 870 + 140) was on charcoal from a concentration of fire cracked rock located within Feature 18. The two large roasting pits in the South Area of the site are thought to have been contemporary with Feature 18, but these have not been dated. A series of smaller pit features was located in the area between the large roasting pits. Almost all of these are thought to date to the A.D, 700-900 occupation, but other than Feature 21, only Feature 9 has been dated (A.D. 670 + 130). The exact functions of these features are uncertain, but most may represent storage or trash pits. Because Features 8 and 9 contained such high densities of fire cracked rock, it is possible that they represent smaller roasting pits or earth ovens. The large numbers of features and the presence of burials suggest a relatively sedentary occupation at site 4INV182. Although seven post holes were identified, no firm evidence of permanent structures was found. Macrobotanical remains suggesting both spring/early summer and fall occupations were recovered from many of the features. An occupation of the site by groups of at least semisedentary hunter-gatherers is hypothesized. With respect to subsistence, substantial amounts of faunal and floral remains were recovered from the site. Whitetail-deer remains dominate the faunal assemblage but a wide variety of other terrestrial and aquatic species also were identified. These included turtle (both testudinid and softshell), freshwater bivalves, fish, bird, rabbit, raccoon, rodents, domestic dog, beaver, and possibly bison, Nuts (hickory, acorn, and pecan) and tubers (Psoralea) dominate the plant remains. A few seed types evidently were gathered as a minor dietary element. A rather generalized subsistence economy based on a broad range of wild plant and animal resources is indicated, but there is no evidence for agriculture during this period.

EXCAVATIONS AT 41NV203, POLECAT HILL by William A. Martin and Daniel E. McGregor, with contributions by James E. Bruseth and Phillip Murry ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Site 41NV203 is located on a high knoll overlooking the floodplain of Mesquite Creek, an intermittent tributary of Richland Creek. The knoll is the only elevated landform in the lower Mesquite Creek floodplain and is actually an upland erosional remnant. The soil on the knoll is Lamar clay loam and the surrounding floodplain soil is Kaufman clay (Meade, Chervenka, and Greenwade 1974). Mesquite Creek is actively eroding the western portion of the knoll and has undoubtedly destroyed the western end of the site, as indicated by the presence of high artifact densities at the edge of the steep erosional bank. A few oak, hickory, and mesquite trees are present on top of the knoll and along the creek bank, but most of the site and surrounding area has been cleared and used for pasture. Slope erosion along the southern and eastern edges of the knoll is pronounced, with broad areas of lighter colored subsoil exposed. As a result, the precise limits of the occupation cannot be determined, although it is clear that the total site area was rather small. The present extent of the cultural deposit covers an area of only about 10 x 20 m. Despite its small size, the knoll's height above the floodplain and location adjacent to the creek would probably have made it an attractive location for aboriginal occupation. SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS Polecat Hill was reported to the SMU research team in 1980 by Mr. Oscar Bounds, the landowner. Test excavations were conducted at that time, consisting of seven 40 x 40 cm shovel tests and two 1 x 1 m units (Figure 13-1). Results of the test excavations demonstrated that artifact density was highest on the crest of the knoll and decreased sharply downslope (McGregor et al. 1982:51- 52). Very few artifacts were observed on the slopes of the knoll, even though ground exposure was excellent, indicating that most of the deposit had been washed away with the topsoil. The cultural deposit was relatively shallow on top of the site as well, with most artifacts confined to the upper 30 cm of the profile. A few artifacts were recovered as deep as 80 cm below the surface in Test Unit 1, but deep vertical cracks were also observed in the soil suggesting that vertical displacement of artifacts had occurred as a result of the active soil. The cultural deposit contained Gary type dart points, as well as arrow points and ceramics which are characteristic of Late Prehistoric period occupations. The dart points may date to the Archaic period, suggesting the possibility of a mixed deposit of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric period occupations. The faunal assemblage is notable because of its excellent state of preservation and the diversity of species present. As with most sites, deer was the dominant species, but several aquatic species, such as fish, turtle, and water snake, were recovered as well. Site 41NV203 was recommended for additional excavation because the faunal sample appeared to offer a strong potential for clarifying Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric subsistence patterns in the western end of the Project area, an area in which few sites had been found. More specifically, the uplands in the western portions of the reservoir are located in the Tall Grass Prairie biotic zone, as noted in the Introduction to this volume. Most of the other excavated sites are situated in the central and eastem parts of the reservoir where the Post Oak Savannah biotic zone occupies the uplands. Since the faunal and floral resources of these two zones differ significantly, subsistence practices were expected to differ also. The excellent faunal preservation, coupled with the probability of locating features containing macrobotanical remains, caused this site to be scheduled for additional data recovery. In addition, the location of the site along a tributary of Richland Creek, rather than along the main channel where many of the other sites are situated, offered an opportunity to compare assemblage characteristics not only between the western and eastern portions of the reservoir but also between tributary and main channel sites. This opportunity was an additional motivation for excavation at Polecat Hill. 149

Map of site 41NV203 showing locations of the 1980 test excavation units and the Season IV (1984) block excavation area. EXCAVATION STRATEGY Season IV excavations were confined to the crest of the knoll since test excavations indicated that this was the most productive area of the site. A total of 123 person-days was expended to investigate this area. An excavation block measuring 5 x 15 m was laid out, with the long axis oriented parallel to the eroded creek bank, 29° west of magnetic north (see Figure 13-1). Since the orientation was away from magnetic north, grid coordinates were assigned, using designations of A for the long axis and B for the short axis. The block contained 75 1 x 1 m units of which 39 were excavated (Figure 13-2). Although most of the block was excavated in a checkerboard pattern, with every other unit being dug, a few contiguous units were excavated. This procedure resulted in the excavation of 50% of the site. Vertical control was maintained by excavating in 10 cm arbitrary levels. A 10 1 soil sample was collected from each level for fine screen processing through 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) mesh. All remaining soil was dry- screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) hardware cloth. A single cultural feature was uncovered during the excavation. This was a pit which was partially exposed in the western halves of Units 107 and 108. It was cross-sectioned along the west wall of these units, and all fill from the eastern half of this feature was saved; 30 I were screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh, and 10 | were processed by means of flotation. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS SITE STRATIGRAPHY The soil profile of the knoll consists of a dark grayish brown, clay loam A horizon, 25-30 cm thick, which forms a gradual, smooth boundary with a light olive brown B horizon. The clay loam B horizon extends down to about 60 cm where it forms a clear, smooth boundary with a yellowish brown, clay loam C horizon. All of the clay in these horizons is calcareous and moderately alkaline, which accounts for the excellent bone preservation observed at the site. The clay is very sticky and plastic when wet, and very hard and friable when dry. As previously noted, deep vertical cracks form when the soil is dry due to its high shrink-swell potential. This undoubtedly has affected the vertical provenience of several artifacts. The Lamar clay loam comprising the knoll contains substantial amounts of shale and siltstone. In fact, the resistance to erosion exhibited by these rocks has resulted in the presence of the knoll as an erosional upland remnant on the floodplain (Edward Janak, personal communication 1984). The shrink-swell activity of the clay soil has fractured the rock, creating thousands of tiny fragments. These fragments impeded screening progress and also created artificially high counts of fire cracked rock, since these rocks were classified as fire cracked prior to the site's examination

The contents of the 30 1 sample that was processed through 6.4 mm mesh include: 1 hammerstone, 78 flakes, 33 fragments of fire cracked rock (184 by a pedologist. Collection of the rock fragments ceased once it was determined that they were the result of natural rather than cultural processes. FEATURE 1 Feature 1 was the only cultural feature uncovered during the excavation of 41NV203. The eastern half of this pit was exposed in Units 107 and 108, while the western half extended outside of the excavation block toward the creek bank. Feature 1 is slightly irregular in outline, but it appears to be roughly oval with a diameter of 132 cm. In profile, the feature is a shallow, basin- shaped pit (Figure 13-3). It was first observed at a depth of 30 cm and extended down to 55 cm below the surface. The pit fill was very dark gray (7.5YR3/0) in color, with areas of yellowish brown (10YR5/4) along the edges. The pit fill was clearly visible against the light olive brown (2.5Y5/4) subsoil. Artifact content was not very different from the artifact content of the general deposit. The quantities of baked clay and charcoal recovered in the 10 | flotation sample were minimal. Only 13 g of baked clay and 0.12 g of charcoal were recovered. In fact, the pronounced lack of macrobotanical remains is the most notable characteristic of this feature. Whereas nearly all features at other sites contained substantial amounts of charcoal and hickory nut shell, Feature 1 contained only 0.12 g of wood charcoal, 0.01 g of Psoralea, and two carbonized vetch seeds, thought to be Vicia. Psoralea (sp) and Vicia mature in the spring, so at a minimum a spring or early summer occupation is indicated by their presence in the feature fill. It is difficult to interpret the function of Feature 1 based on content. The contents of the 10 1 flotation sample include 1 arrow point, 2 core fragments, 71 flakes greater than 6 mm, 150 flakes less than 6 mm, 45 fragments of fire cracked rock (23 g), 1.3 g of baked clay, 25.2 g of unbumed bone, 6.1 g of burned bone, 12.8 g g), 48.9 g of unbumed bone, 9.6 g of burned bone, and 35.5 g of mussel shell. Interpretation of feature function is hindered by the fact that most of the feature fill includes artifacts that were present in the soil when the pit was dug and were dumped back into the pit during the fill episode. Thus, it is impossible to determine which artifacts were intentionally included in the feature. The low quantities of baked clay and charcoal indicate that the pit was not used as a hearth, but its actual function cannot be assessed. ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS A tabulation of all artifacts by excavation proveniences is presented in Appendix F (Table F-12). The lithic tools and ceramics are described below. The specimen counts by vertical level are listed following the description of each artifact category, and are summarized for the lithic tools in Table 13-1.

Gary, Regular Variety (39 specimens). These specimens are characterized by their contracting stems with rounded bases. There is a considerable range in blade form with shoulders varying from weakly developed to prominent. Specimens which are similar in morphology, but less than 3 cm in length, are included in the Gary, small variety category. Materials: quartzite (30), chert (5), silicified wood (3), Edwards chert (1). Proveniences: level 1 (20), level 2 (12), level 3 (4), level 4 (2), surface (1). Gary, Serrated Blade (3 specimens). These are similar to the Gary, regular variety except that the blade edges are finely serrated and the blade edges are beveled on the right hand side.

They are considerably larger than the blade portions of specimens in the Drill/Awl category described below. Material: chert (2). Proveniences: level 1 (1), level 2 (1). Drill/Awl (10 specimens, Figure 13-4f). These specimens are characterized by their long, very narrow and thin, bifacially worked blades. Five of these specimens may have been reworked from arrow points since they are stemmed and have shoulders on the lower blade portion. The bases of the other five specimens are the essentially unworked portions of the flakes on which these tools were made. Materials: chert (8), quartzite (1), Edwards chert (1). Proveniences: level 1 (5), level 2 (4), level 3 (1). Bristol Bifaces (4 specimens). These bifacially worked artifacts are subcircular in outline with relatively straight (nonsinuous) edges. This artifact category as originally defined by Duffield (1963b:42-44), Knives (16 specimens, Figure 13-4g). These nonstemmed specimens are characterized by their straight blade edges formed by fine secondary retouch. Outline morphology is variable, including triangular, subtriangular, and oval specimens. Materials: quartzite (9), chert (5), silicified wood (2). Proveniences: level 1 (6), level 2 (7), level 3 (3). Aborted Bifaces Early Stage (73 specimens). These specimens tend to be thick and somewhat irregular in outline, with sinuous edges formed by the removal of large flakes. Most specimens retain at least one area of nodular cortex. Although some of these specimens may have been used as cutting or chopping tools, their unfinished appearance has led to their classification as rejects from an early stage in the

The number of sherds exhibiting selected attributes pertaining to sherd location, rim orientation, lip form, tempering material, and decorative motif are presented in Table 13-2. The ceramic frequencies for each attribute are presented by vertical provenience only (i.e., total ceramics from each 10 cm level at the site). Patterns in the horizontal distribution of ceramics are discussed in a subsequent section. The only exception to this form of presentation is the inclusion of Feature 1 on the table as a separate provenience. Explanations of ceramic attributes are presented in Appendix B. Most of the sherds from 41NV203 are tempered with combinations of grog, grit, and bone and exhibit medium to coarse paste textures. Incising and punctation are the most common decorative techniques, but other decoration methods are present, including brushing and engraving. The configurations of design elements include random fingernail punctations (Figure 13-5a), parallel incised lines (Figure 13-5c), and crosshatched incised lines (Figure 13-5d). The engraved decorations include a unique star element (Figure 13-5e), cross-hatching (Figure 13-5f), and concentric back-to-back lines (Figure 13-5g). 155 Table 13-2 CERAMIC ATTRIBUTES FROM SITE 41NV203 Level Feature Attribute 1 2 3 4 i Sherd Location Body 206 117 19 4 1 Rim 12 15 2 Base 1 2 1 Rim Orientation Straight 2 2 1 Inverted 4 5 Everted 4 2 Lip Form Flat 1 1 Rounded 8 6 2 1 Bevelled to Interior 1 Rolled to Exterior 2 4 Pointed 1 Temper Grog 57 32 6 Grit 27 22 7 1 Bone 9 6 Grog/Grit 47 17 3 1 Grog/Grit/Bone 12 19 2 Grit/Bone 26 7 Grog/Bone 35 19 5 1 None Visible 6 12 1 Decoration Method Plain 177 108 15 3 1 Engraved 5 1 1 Brushed 3 ll 2 1 Incised 17 3 1 Punctated 16 ll 3 Punctated/Incised 1 Design Element Configuration 1A 4A 1A 1B 2B 1B 4c 4c 1c 1D 1F iF 1E 1G Total 219 134 22 4 1 Key: A = Random punctations; B = Linear arrangement of punctations; C = Parallel incised lines, orientation not observable; D = Crosshatched incised lines; E = star; F = Parallel and horizontal incised lines; G ~ Crosshatched engraved lines; H = Concentric, back-to-back engraved Lines with diagonal engraved lines . Most sherds are too fragmentary for the determination of vessel form, but the few sherds of sufficient size suggest that jars and simple bowls were the predominate forms. A single rim sherd was large enough to obtain an orifice diameter of 28 cm for one jar. Sherd thickness ranges from 5.0 mm to 12.0 mm, with an average of 7.8 mm. Interior and exterior sherd colors are primarily shades of brown (10YR7/4 and 10YRS5/2) and dark gray (10YR3/1). Core colors are darker and include very dark gray (1OYR3/1) and black (10YR2/1). All three ceramic traditions defined from the reservoir area in Chapter 15 are represented in the ceramic assemblage at this site. Eleven of the grit tempered sherds have a sandy paste and are similar to sherds found at other sites in the reservoir that have been dated between A.D. 700 and 900. The only sherd recovered from Feature 1 was comprised of this sandy paste, suggesting that

Feature 1 also dates to this period. Fully 97% of the ceramics assemblage, however, is from the ceramic tradition defined as grog, grit, and bone temper utility wares with occasional rim panel decorations of incised lines and punctations. These decorations and vessel forms, when observable, show similarity to the type Canton Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962:23-24), and are believed to range between A.D. 900 and 1300 within the Project area. Finally, five sherds appear to belong to the post-A.D. 1300 ceramic tradition marked by grog, grit, and bone tempered wares with exterior burnishing and engraved decorations (Figure 13-5f,g). It is possible that some of the unbumished plain ware identified as part Volume III, Part One of the A.D. 900-1300 tradition may actually belong to this later tradition, but there is no way to verify this possibility. One sherd (Figure 13-5g) has part of a decoration similar to portions of the scroll motif associated with Poyner Engraved, which supports a post-A.D. 1300 temporal estimate for the tradition. The other sherds assigned to this tradition are either plain and burnished (two sherds) or are decorated with engraving (one sherd). ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS Site 41NV203 yielded the densest concentration of artifacts found anywhere in the reservoir area. The quantity of artifacts recovered from the 39 1 x 1 m units that were excavated is staggering. A total of 34,439 pieces of lithic debris was uncovered from the 6.4 mm mesh. Including the 71 flakes recovered from 6.4 mm mesh in Feature 1, the total is 34,510. This translates to an average of 2,900 flakes per cubic meter. Tremendous quantities of other artifacts were recovered also, yielding densities of 43 bifaces, 188 unifaces, 46 projectile points, 32 sherds, 675 g of bone, and 354 g of mussel shell per cubic meter. The extremely high artifact density of 4INV203 is probably a reflection of intensive occupation on a recurrent basis over many years. Unlike most other sites, the small size of the knoll limited the area of occupation, which in tum limited the area in which debris was discarded, resulting in a massive accumulation of artifacts on the top of the knoll. Comparison of artifact frequencies on a unit by unit basis suggests that some degree of spatial separation of activity areas is evident. In general, the northern half of the block excavation contains the highest artifact densities, but the horizontal distribution of specific artifacts varies from class to class. Most of the units with high concentrations of lithic debris are located in the northern half of the block (Figure 13-6a), but the unit with the highest frequencies, Unit 155, is present in the south half, suggesting that stone tool manufacture was conducted all across the knoll. In contrast, all of the high density units for ceramics are limited to the northwest quarter of the block (Figure 13-6b). Bone is also concentrated in this area (Figure 13-6c), so it seems reasonable to conclude that cooking and/or refuse disposal was conducted in this area on a regular basis. Unfortunately, there is considerable overlap of artifact concentrations, owing to the occurrence of multiple occupations within the small area encompassed by the knoll. This overlap of | activity areas limits any further interpretation of the horizontal distribution of artifacts. The vertical distribution of artifacts varies only slightly from unit to unit. In all units, the highest density of artifacts occurs within the upper 20 cm of the deposit. The only variability present is in regard to some units having the highest frequencies in level 1 (the upper 10 cm) as opposed to other units which having the highest frequencies in level 2 (the second 10 cm level). Despite this, the vertical distribution of temporally diagnostic artifacts indicates that no discernible cultural stratigraphy is present at 41NV203. The variability within this upper 20 cm is largely due to chance and is probably related to the degree of bioturbation that has occurred within any particular unit. The site is an upland remnant that apparently has been relatively stable on top throughout the Holocene. Under these conditions, artifacts deposited on the ground surface were moved downward by the natural action of roots, rodents, and other forms of bioturbation as well as the shrink-swell action of the Lamar clay loam. FAUNAL REMAINS (by Phillip Murry) As previously noted, the alkaline nature of the Lamar clay loam is conducive to excellent bone preservation. As a result, 41NV203 provided the best preserved faunal assemblage in the reservoir area and included a broad diversity of species. Elements from 20 species were identified, including fish, turtle, rabbit, rodent, bird,

The spectrum of species recovered at the site is more diverse than at most other sites, but this may reflect the relative lack of preservation at many of the other sites, rather than a major difference in patterns of faunal exploitation. The high density of bone is undoubtedly due to the fact that all occupations at Polecat Hill were confined to the same small area on top of the knoll. Patterns of seasonality in site occupation are clearly discernible from the faunal assemblage. A deer mandible from Unit 101 represents an individual that was aged 1 year and 6 months at the 157 time of death (based on dental eruption and wear). Since deer give birth in this part of Texas between May and June (Schmidly 1983), this individual was taken in November or December. Although the other deer mandibles recovered at the site are too old to provide reliable estimates of seasonality (ranging from 2.5 to 9.5 years old), it seems likely that fall was the primary time of deer exploitation, since their behavior changes during the rutting season, making it easier for hunters to approach them (Smith 1975:37). The presence of wild turkey in two units (Units 115 and 131) also indicates a fall occupation, as does the duck bone in Unit 133. Spring and summer occupations are indicated by the presence of fish and turtle. Turtles hibernate during the winter months and are most easily exploitable during the spring, summer, and fall. Site Polecat Hill contains the highest density of turtle bone of any site found in the reservoir area. Whereas deer bone dominates the assemblage at all sites in the eastern end of the Project area, turtle bone outnumbers deer bone here (as well as at 41NV206). Turtle bone was recovered in 108 levels, totaling 630 elements, whereas deer was present in only 80 levels totaling 255 elements. Deer provide much more food energy per individual than do turtles, so deer were still the major dietary item. However, the high incidence of turtle suggests that regular occupation of the site occurred during the spring and summer months. The presence of gar, catfish, and other fish bones also supports the idea that spring and summer occupations occurred. The location of Polecat Hill in the western end of the reservoir places it within a narrow strip of Bottomland Forest extending into the Tall Grass Prairie. Therefore, one might expect that there was a heavier reliance on prairie species here than at sites in the eastern end of the reservoir, where the Post Oak Savannah offered a higher density and greater variety of exploitable resources. Examination of Table 13-3 reveals that the relative abundance of Table 13-3 SUMMARY OF FAUNAL REMAINS!

158 Table 13-4 FAUNA RECOVERED FROM FINE SCREEN (1.6 MM) SAMPLES AT 41NV203 Unit 117 Unit 141 Unit 169 Level Level Level 1 2 3 1 2 3 2 3 Gar 1 Other Fish 1 Testudinid Turtle 2 1 3 2 #2 2 1 Pocket Gopher 1 Cottontail/ Swamp Rabbit 2 Whitetail Deer 2 1 1 1 1 jackrabbit is not significantly different from that found at other sites. Although bison remains were present in only four levels, this represents a higher proportion than normally found at sites in the reservoir area and suggests a possible increase in bison utilization at Polecat Hill. Thus, the evidence needed to address the question of increased use of prairie resources is inconclusive. Jackrabbit utilization is no higher than at other sites, and although there isa trend toward increased use of bison, the increase is not dramatic. Fine screen samples from four units (totaling 12 levels) were examined to assess the potential of fine screen samples to add significant data on the use of fish at Polecat Hill. The high proportion of turtle bone and the presence of gar and catfish remains within the faunal assemblage recovered from the 6.4 mm mesh suggested that aquatic resources were important subsistence items. Since most small fish bones pass through 6.4 mm mesh and are underrepresented in the sample, analyis of fine screen samples which were processed through 1.6 mm mesh, it was necessary to examine the role fish played in the diet. Units 117, 141, 159, and 169 were selected with a table of random numbers for the initial analysis. This represents a 10% sample of the area excavated. All bone was sorted, regardless of size, and sent for identification. Although bone was present in all levels, most fragments were too small to be identified. As a_ result, no identifiable elements are listed for levels 1 through 3 in Unit 159 or level 1 in Unit 169 (Table 13-4). Surprisingly, very few fish bones were recovered from the 12 levels sampled. Only two vertebrae, one from a gar and one from a small unidentifiable fish, were present. In fact, the overall fine screen faunal assemblage looks remarkably similar to the assemblage recovered from dry screening. Both assemblages are dominated by deer and turtle. The location of Polecat Hill along Mesquite Creek, an intermittent stream, was apparently less conducive to fish acquisition than were the locations of sites along the main channel of Richland Creek. The intermittent nature of Mesquite Creek may have been unsuitable for fishing during the primary seasons of site occupation, resulting in the relatively limited use of fish. The similarity of the fine screen faunal assemblage to the 6.4 mm mesh assemblage indicates that no significant additional data would be recovered by further analysis of fine screen samples. Therefore, the remaining fine screen samples were not examined. However, they are being curated with the entire site collections for future study. Volume UI, Part One INTERPRETATIONS Polecat Hill (41NV203) is one of the smallest archaeological sites within the Richland/Chambers Reservoir area, yet it has the highest artifact density of any site. Originally, four factors prompted the selection of the site for mitigation: (1) a high artifact density, which appeared to represent a limited time span on the basis of testing data; (2) the excellent bone preservation qualities of the soil and the diversity of fauna present; (3) the location of the site next to an intermittent stream and its potential for clarifying the nature of occupations away from the main channel of Richland Creek; and (4) the site's location in the western end of the reservoir, which offered potential for comparison with the other sites selected for mitigation which were centered in the eastern end of the reservoir. Only one other site in the western end of the reservoir, 41NV206, appeared to have potential for addressing the research goals. Therefore, both 41NV203 and 41NV206 were deemed important for understanding the settlement/subsistence system on a Project-wide scale. The results of the intensive excavation of Polecat Hill lead to several conclusions. First, the extremely high artifact density demonstrates that intensive occupation occurred at the site. Second, the relative lack of features indicates that the site was occupied recurrently on a short term basis. If continuous, long term occupation had been responsible for the accumulation of cultural debris, then numerous pits and hearths similar to those found at habitation sites, such as 41NV173 and 41FT201, should have been present. Third, the flora and fauna represent species available during spring, summer, and fall, suggesting that short term occupations occurred at the site several times a year. The extremely high density of turtle bone suggests that spring and summer occupations were especially prevalent. Fourth, artifacts associated with several time periods recognized in the Project area (i.e., the Late Archaic period to the later portion of the Late Prehistoric period), are present at the site, indicating that the site was regularly used over a span of at least 700 years. However, the ceramics from the site indicate that most frequent habitation occurred during the period from A.D. 900 to 1300. The mixture of material from several different periods of occupation complicates the interpretation of the site. Originally it was believed that the high artifact density was the result of intensive occupation during a more limited time span. Results of mitigation, however, have revealed that the assemblage is mixed to a greater degree than was thought on the basis of testing data. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to say whether spring, summer, and fall occupations occurred during all periods equally, or whether certain seasons of occupation were common only during certain periods. The small habitable area present on top of the knoll limited all occupations to the same area. Thus, there is considerable mixture of components over the entire site area and very little spatial separation of activity areas can be observed. There does seem to be a concentration of ceramics within the northwest comer of the block excavation, possibly reflecting cooking, refuse disposal, or later occupations occurring here. The only other conclusion that can be reached by examining the horizontal distribution of artifacts is that more debris was deposited on the northern half of the block than in the southern half. This suggests that habitation was concentrated on the south half, while the north half was used for refuse disposal during many of the occupations.

wea Vee f of EXCAVATIONS AT 41NV206, GUY'S GARDEN by William A. Martin with contributions by James E. Bruseth and Phillip Murry ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING Guy's Garden (41NV206) is located on a low knoll in the floodplain of Richland Creek, approximately 350 m south of the creek, at an elevation of about 315 ft (95.5 m) msl. The site is named after the landowner, Mr. Guy Langsford, who plows it annually to plant a garden. The knoil is a Tl terrace remnant comprised of Crockett fine sandy loam which is surrounded by the heavy Trinity clay of the floodplain (USDA, SCS 1974). The lower portion of the terrace is frequently inundated. Only the top of the knoll appears to be free from seasonal flooding as evidenced by the well-developed soil horizons (Edward Janak, personal communication 1984). SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS The site location was reported to SMU researchers during the survey and testing program in 1980-81 by Mr. Langsford. Mr. Langsford had an extensive artifact collection from the site's surface which included artifacts diagnostic of both the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. Therefore, the site appeared to have potential for clarifying our understanding of long term prehistoric occupation in the westernmost portion of the Project area. Test excavations were conducted during the 1980-81 season (McGregor et al. 1982:34). Ten 40 x 40 cm shovel tests and two 1 x 1 m units were excavated (Figure 14-1). Most artifacts were confined to the upper 20 cm plow zone, although some artifacts were found as deep as 45 cm below the surface. Based on evidence from the two 1 x 1 m units, a roughly stratified deposit was suggested in which arrow points and ceramics were confined to the upper 10 cm, whereas dart points were recovered as deep as 30-40 cm. The presence of a possible stratified deposit, coupled with the shallow A horizon which indicated good potential for locating subsurface features, prompted the recommendation for additional work during the mitigation program. EXCAVATION STRATEGY Mr. Langsford still owned the site at the time of mitigation, during Season IV in the fall of 1984, so excavations were limited in accordance with his wishes. Mr. Langsford was kind enough to permit extensive excavation by hand, but did not want his garden damaged by the use of heavy equipment. Therefore, excavation was limited to digging 213 50 x 50 cm units within an area of 3,600 m2 (Figure 14-1). A total of 45 person-days was expended on this work. The first units excavated were dug in arbitrary 10 cm levels in hope of detecting the cultural stratigraphy suggested by the test excavations. Unfortunately, no clear separation of components was discernible. Since experience at other TI terrace sites (e.g., 41FT201, 41NV96, 41NV177) had shown that the A horizon is usually too disturbed by bioturbation to warrant excavation in 10 cm levels, this procedure was abandoned. Instead, most units were excavated down to the B horizon as a single level, or to a depth of 40 cm below the surface in cases where the B horizon was absent. All soil was dry-screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS SITE STRATIGRAPHY The terrace deposits on top of the knoll are characterized by a dark brown, sandy loam A horizon, 20-30 cm thick, a dark yellowish brown, clay B horizon, 50-70 cm thick, with a mottled light gray C horizon. Further downslope, a very dark grayish 159

This appears to represent a slight B horizon development. The Trinity clay of the floodplain is a black, very heavy clay which exhibits little color change with depth. Cultural deposits were confined to the sandy loam and sandy clay A horizons; virtually no artifacts were recovered from the Trinity clay. ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS A summary of all the artifacts recovered from the site is presented in tabular form in Appendix F (Table F-13). Lithic tools and ceramics are discussed in more detail below.

Bruseth) A total of 42 ceramic sherds was recovered from site 41NV206. Provenience and selected attributes for the sherds are listed in Table 14-3 (see Appendix B for a discussion of these attributes). The most notable characteristic of the sherds from 41NV206 is their small size. Most are less than 2 cm in diameter, which is no doubt a result of the extensive plowing that has been undertaken at the site. Aside from this, the ceramics are similar to samples from other sites within the reservoir. Most sherds are plain with combinations of grog, grit, and bone tempering; paste textures are medium to coarse. Exterior colors include several shades of brown (1OYR8/3, 10YR5/3, 1OYR5/2), gray (1OYR6/1, 10YR6/2, SYR6/1), and yellowish red (SYR6/6, SYR7/3). Interior colors Table 14-2 PROVENIENCES!

164 c d 0 5 Ltt) cm Figure 14-3. Ceramics from 41NV206: (a) fingernail punctations, (b) random punctations, (c) incised lines, (d) engraved lines. show similar basic colors with darker values (10YR3/1, 5YR4/2, 7.5YR4/0). Core colors are even darker, tending towards dark gray (10YR4/1) and very dark gray (10YR3/1). Sherd thickness ranges from 3.9 to 7.5 mm, with an average of 5.7 mm. Eleven decorated sherds were recovered (see Table 14-3). The most common decoration consists of random punctations produced with fingernails (Figure 14-3a) and pointed instruments (Figure 14-3b). Other decorations include incising (Figure 14-3c) and engraving (Figure 14-3d). All of the decorated sherds are too small to allow typological affiliation with any established ceramic types (cf., Suhm and Jelks 1962). The temporal placement of the sherds is based on the type of temper observed in the paste, as well as on the decorative techniques employed and the rim and lip forms of the vessels. The sherds appear to have come from utility ware vessels with incised and punctated decorations along the rim panels. The sherds from 41NV206 are similar to samples from other sites which have been identified as belonging to a grog, grit, and bone temper utility ware tradition. The types Canton Incised and Maydelle Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962) were recognized at other sites and could very well be represented at 41NV206; however, the sherds from the site are too small for accurate determination. Within the reservoir, this ceramic tradition has an estimated temporal span of A.D. 900 to 1300. Although some of the plain sherds could belong to the latter portion of the Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 1300-1600), only one sherd with an attribute (i.e., a rolled outward lip) characteristic of the latter period was found. On this basis, occupation after A.D. 1300 is thought to be minimal. FAUNAL REMAINS (by Phillip Murry) The faunal assemblage at Guy's Garden is less diverse than that recovered at Polecat Hill (41NV203), even though both sites are located in the western end of the Project area in close proximity to each other. Whereas 20 species were identified at 4INV203, only six species were identified at 41NV206 (Table 14-4). Part of this discrepancy may be due to the relatively low bone preservation potential of the soil at Guy's Garden and the smail size of the excavation units used. Volume III, Part One Although no deer mandibles were found which could indicate age at death and, therefore, season of exploitation, the overall abundance of deer bone suggests that a fall occupation occurred at the site. Like, 4INV203, Guy's Garden contained a tremendous quantity of turtle bone, with turtle elements outnumbering the deer elements recovered (see Table 14-4). Turtle bone was present in 30 units (52 elements total), whereas deer bone was present in only 27 units (28 elements total). The high density of turtle bone suggests that summer occupations were frequent at 41NV206, and that turtle was the principal animal species available for exploitation. Unlike 41NV203 where a few fish elements were found, no fish remains were recovered in the 6.4 mm mesh at 41NV206. Since fine screen samples were not taken from the 50 x 50 cm units, it is not possible to quantify the nature of fish utilization. However, the close proximity of the site to Richland Creek and the evidence for summer occupation suggests that fish would have probably been exploited. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS Systematically spaced, 50 x 50 cm units were dug to obtain data for the SYMAP program in order to produce maps of artifact distributions. The distribution maps for the three most distinct artifact classes are presented in Figures 14-4, 14-5, and 14-6, Clusters of lithic debris, fire cracked rock, and ceramics were selected for illustration because these categories provided the most interpretable information at other sites, such as Bird Point Island (41FT201). Although only these three artifact classes are illustrated, the distribution of all classes are discussed here. The highest density cluster of lithic debris represents 117-160 flakes per 50 x 50 cm unit and occurs at 160N 124. This is surrounded by a large, high-density cluster between 156-172N and 120-128E, on the highest part of the knoll. Eight, smaller, high- density clusters occur along the lower elevation of the knoll, roughly paralleling the 99.5 m contour, just above the contact with the Trinity clay of the floodplain. Based on this pattern, it appears that most stone tool manufacture occurred on top of the knoll, although it was not limited to this area alone. Lithic debris clusters overlapped Houses 1 and 2 at Bird Point Island (41FT201), and additional lithic analysis at that site demonstrated that much of the manufacture of stone tools occurred inside the houses. Although the highest density cluster of lithic debris at 41NV206 occurs on the portion of the site best suited for habitation, no other evidence of houses, such as a cluster of ceramics, is present. It seems likely that habitation was concentrated on the highest elevation of the knoll, but it is improbable that substantial structures were present, judging from the distribution of other artifact classes generally associated with houses. The densest clusters of unifaces range from 4 to 7 and from 7 to 11 artifacts per unit. These clusters occur within the area of the large lithic debris cluster on top of the knoll, and within or parallel to the smaller clusters along the 99.5 contour. Since the category of “uniface,” which includes hundreds of marginally modified flakes, is actually a subset of lithic debris, the parallel distribution of these clusters is not surprising. Distribution of other specific tool types, such as end scrapers and side scrapers, does not reveal any concentration which could be interpreted as a work area. Assuming that dart points are earlier than arrow points, the distribution of dart points and arrow points should delineate temporally distinct occupations or activity areas. When plotted on the site map, dart points tend to fall into two clusters, both of which are outside of the lithic debris cluster found on the top of the knoll. One of these clusters lies between 176-184N and 108-116E and overlaps the distribution of arrow points. The other cluster is in the southern portion of the site, between 116-140N and 124- 136E. This second area is devoid of arrow points, and would be interpreted as an Archaic period activity area were it not for the fact that the highest density of ceramics also falls within this area. Some types of dart points have been shown to be contemporaneous

SYMAP of ceramic distribution at site 4INV206. 167 with arrow points at Bird Point Island (41FT201), and it is possible that this area represents a Late Prehistoric activity area that involved the use of dart points as knives or scrapers. However, it is also possible that a Late Prehistoric activity area, involving the use of ceramics, was deposited on top of an Archaic period occupation associated with the dart points. Bifaces are concentrated on top of the knoll within the area encompassed by the cluster of lithic debris. Although a few, smaller clusters exist in isolated units across the site, it is difficult to assess their significance. They may represent random discard rather than specialized work areas. The largest concentration of fire cracked rock does not occur on top of the knoll, but is located downslope, to the northwest of the concentration of lithic debris, unifaces, and bifaces on top of the knoll. The densest cluster of fire cracked rock has between 44 and 63 fragments per unit, while the next contour contains 25-44 fragments per unit. These contours are concentrated between 172- 184N and 108-116E. Two smaller clusters of fire cracked rock occur in individual units located at 168N 112E and 160N 112E. The location of the fire cracked rock concentration away from the majority of the lithic debris and stone tool distribution suggests that there is some degree of spatial isolation of heat related activity, such as roasting or heat treating lithic raw material. Some degree of coassociation exists between fire cracked rock and dart points. The northern cluster of dart points, located from 176-184N and 108-116E, occurs within the area encompassed by the densest fire cracked rock concentration (see Figure 14-5). These dart points are Gary points and untyped contracting stemmed points, which are the same types that were associated with roasting pits at Bird Point Island (41FT201). This coassociation between dart points and fire cracked rock at 41NV206 may represent roasting activity, either associated with a pit, as at 41FT201, or confined to the A horizon, as at 41NV177. Instead of a temporally mixed deposit, the coassociation of arrow points and dart points in this portion of the site may represent a contemporaneous deposit during the early to middle portion of the Late Prehistoric period. The highest ceramic contour represents 3-5 sherds per unit and is located at the southern end of the knoll at 128N 132E, It is surrounded by a larger area containing 2-3 sherds per unit, ranging from 120-140N and 124-136E. A few, small, high-density clusters occur in isolated areas; three of these clusters fall within the fire cracked rock concentration on the northwest portion of the site. This correlation of ceramics and fire cracked rock has been observed in other sites in the Project area and is thought to reflect cooking activities. The distribution of ceramics to the south of the major lithic debris and stone tool concentrations provides additional evidence that there is observable spatial separation of work areas. The distribution of baked clay closely parallels the distribution of ceramics. This pattern was observed at Bird Point Island (41FT201) and probably reflects activities in which ceramic vessels were used to cook, and baked clay resulted from the heat of the fire. Charcoal, on the other hand, is concentrated away from clusters of ceramics, fire cracked rock, or other artifact classes. The largest cluster is along the base of the knoll and appears to be unrelated to prehistoric cultural activity. On the other hand, smaller clusters in individual units scattered across the top of the knoll may be related to prehistoric hearths. Bone, ranging from 2.8 to 7.0 g, occurs in only two units, located at 156N 112E and 136N 132E. Otherwise, a low density scatter occurs across the top of the knoll. These smaller bone concentrations may represent discard of trash. | INTERPRETATIONS The artifact distributions at 41NV206 strongly suggest that functionally discrete areas exist at the site. Lithic debris and stone tools are concentrated along the northwest portion of the site, and

168 ceramics and baked clay are concentrated on the southern portion of the knoll. This suggests that some degree of spatial separation existed between stone tool manufacture, roasting, and cooking activities. However, the distribution of temporally diagnostic artifacts does not permit the spatial separation of occupations. For instance, dart points, which could represent either Archaic period or Late Prehistoric period occupation, occur within the ceramic cluster from a Late Prehistoric period occupation. Varying quantities of dart points, arrow points, and ceramics are scattered all across the site, with no clear separation of components. Site 41NV206 probably represents a small temporary campsite which was occupied on a recurrent basis over the course of several centuries. The artifact distributions noted on the SYMAPs suggest Volume LI, Part One that no substantial houses were located at the site. Houses at Bird Point Island (41FT201) were marked by the co-occurrence of lithic debris, bifaces, projectile points, ceramics, and baked clay resulting from a wide variety of activities concentrated within the house areas over long periods of time. No such degree of overlap among artifact distributions was noted at Guy's Garden, so it is likely that only temporary shelters were present. The nature of the projectile point types and ceramics is such that occupation was primarily limited to the early part of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 900-1300), with limited occupation during both the Late Archaic period (A.D. 1-700) and the latter part of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 1300-1600).

ARTIFACT CHRONOLOGY by Daniel E. McGregor and James E. Bruseth When work began on the RCAP, only a rather general local artifact chronology had been established. This was due partly to the relatively limited amount of previous research in the middle Trinity River basin, but also to the nature of the local archaeological record. There was a general lack of well stratified sites and dated single component sites. Because of this, attempts to develop local artifact chronologies have depended almost entirely on the established, or presumed, dating of typologically similar artifacts in adjacent regions (i.e., North Central, East, and Central Texas). The dating of diagnostic artifact styles has been developed most accurately in Central Texas (e.g., Jelks 1962; Johnson et al. 1962; Shafer 1963; Sorrow et al. 1967; Weir 1976; Prewitt 1981). For reasons of geology, both East and North Central Texas generally lack the well stratified stream terrace deposits and rockshelters that have provided the essential contexts for Central Texas chronological refinement. Unfortunately, diagnostic artifacts from the middle Trinity are more closely related typologically to East and North Central Texas materials than they are to the better dated Central Texas materials. In the first section of this chapter, previous efforts to chronologically organize the archaeological materials from closely related areas surrounding the Richland/Chambers Reservoir are reviewed. The results of these studies provide a background for the presentation of new data from the RCAP. The existing information is then combined to propose a refined artifact chronology for the Project area. PREVIOUS CHRONOLOGIES UPPER TRINITY RIVER A chronological sequence of diagnostic artifacts was established for the upper Trinity River drainage through definitions of the Trinity aspect (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954a) and the subsequent Wylie focus (Stephenson 1952). The Archaic 171 period Trinity aspect was divided into early (Carrollton focus) and late (Elam focus) periods, and artifact traits were described for each of these. Diagnostics of the Carrollton focus included: the Carrollton and Trinity dart point types, a variety of steep-bitted gouges, scrapers, and spokeshaves, the Waco sinker, and the chipped stone Carrollton ax. Also associated with the Carrollton focus was a constant minor percentage (about 5%) of late Paleo- Indian projectile point types (e.g., Plainview, Scottsbluff). The Ellis dart point was the most common projectile point type of the Elam focus, followed by Yarbrough and Elam. The Darl and Ensor points reported by Crook and Harris were thought by Suhm et al. (1954:79) to belong to the Yarbrough type. A few contracting stem Gary dart points were said to be associated with the Elam focus, but these were thought to appear in late Elam times (Crook and Harris 1954a:12). Scraping tools were still present, but were generally smaller and less numerous than their Carrollton focus counterparts. Diagnostic artifacts of the subsequent Wylie focus (Stephenson ‘ 1952) included both dart and arrow points. The Gary type was the most common dart point form, and Ellis was present in minor amounts. Arrow point types included Alba, Fresno, Harrell, and Perdiz. Smal! snub-nosed scrapers and small drills or awls were among the diagnostic lithic tools. Pottery was present in Wylie focus sites, with both shell temper and clay/grit temper represented in similar proportions. The shell tempered sherds were of the Nocona Plain type, which was-associated with the Henrietta focus (Krieger 1946; Suhm et al. 1954). The clay/grit tempered sherds exhibited incised, punctated, engraved and brushed decorations similar to ceramic types a68ociated with both early (Sanders focus) and late (Frankston focus) Caddoan groups. As defined, the Wylie focus included materials spanning a very long period of time. As a result, its usefulness in terms of artifact chronology is somewhat limited. It appears that artifacts ranging in age from the Late Archaic through most of the Late Prehistoric period were included among the traits of the Wylie focus (see Chapter 21, Volume IJ). Similar problems have been noted for sites of the Trinity aspect (Hofman 1978:312; Richner and Bagot 1978:52; Richner and Lee 1977:35). Temporal control for the

172 changes in artifact types is limited, and the stratigraphic and contextual integrity of the sites has been questioned. The only published date for the Carrollton focus is 3995 + 200 B. C., on mussel shell from the Wood Pit site (Crook and Harris 1959). The validity of this date is questionable because of problems with dating shell, and because the sample was from an intermediate level within a deep sandy deposit. It was not associated with a feature or definable occupation surface. Both the Carrollton and Elam materials probably represent substantially mixed assemblages spanning several thousand years of occupation. UPPER SABINE RIVER Johnson(1962) defined the LaHarpe aspect to organize the Archaic period materials of East Texas. Characteristic artifacts included expanding stem dart points during the earlier phases, contracting stem dart points during the later phases, with plain pottery appearing during the terminal phase. The Archaic period ended with the introduction of arrow points and abundant decorated pottery. Much of Johnson's study was based on materials from the Yarbrough site, located on the upper Sabine River approximately 90 km northeast of Richland/Chambers Reservoir. Five temporal periods were recognized at the Yarbrough site. The artifact sequence was based on the relative vertical distributions of diagnostic artifacts. Considerable overlap of these distributions was noted, such that "in the upper levels, most of the early styles of artifacts continued (although their late occurrence may conceivably result from partial mixing of deposits)" (Johnson 1962:212). It appears that the stratigraphic situation at the Yarbrough site was similar to that at sites along the upper Trinity River. A series of brief occupations by Paleo-Indians during Period 1 was represented by a number of early projectile point types. These included Clovis, Plainview, Meserve, and San Patrice. The earliest of three Archaic periods (Period 2) was characterized by Yarbrough, Ellis, Edgewood, and Morrill dart point types. The diagnostics for Period 3 were Gary and Yantis dart point types. Several bifacial knife styles, Mineola end scrapers, side scrapers, Clear Fork gouges, and full-grooved axes were all thought to date to the Archaic, but were distributed throughout the deposit. The terminal Archaic Period 4 was characterized by Gary and Kent dart points and the first appearance of pottery. These are plain, grog tempered wares identified as Williams Plain, and perhaps Sanders Plain. Decorated ceramics were assigned to Period 5, as were the few recovered arrow points. Recognized pottery types included Sanders Engraved, Poynor Engraved, Bullard Brushed, and Maydelle Incised. The Period 5 materials were said to represent the Sanders focus of the Gibson aspect, as well as one or more foci of the later Fulton aspect (Johnson 1962:234). More recent work conducted in the upper Sabine River basin (Skiles, Bruseth, and Perttula 1980; Bruseth and Perttula 1981) has provided more details on Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods. An Early Ceramic period has been recognized and is presumed to date between A.D. 1 and 850. This period is characterized by contracting stem dart points and thick, plain ceramic wares. Following this, two phases of the Caddoan cultural tradition are distinguished. The earliest is the Pecan Grove phase and dates from A.D. 850 to A.D. 1350. Ceramics are the most diagnostic artifacts of this phase, and show close similarities to styles of the Sanders focus. Specifically, types Sanders Engraved, Canton Incised, and Monkstown Fingernail Impressed are found. Next, the Forest Hill phase is recorded and dates from A.D. 1350 to 1650. This Caddoan phase shows ceramic similarities to the Titus focus, with types Ripley Engraved, McKinney Plain, and LaRue/Nash Neck Banding common. MIDDLE TRINITY RIVER Cedar Creek Reservoir is located less than 25 km north of Richland/Chambers Reservoir. Excavations were conducted at Volume III, Part Two three Cedar Creek sites, for which Story (1965) defined a five period sequence of occupations. Period 1 was an ephemeral Paleo- Indian occupation represented by a Folsom point medial section and the basal section of a second point exhibiting Paleo traits. Period 2 was the earlier of two Archaic periods. The diagnostic artifacts of this occupation were thought to include rectangular and expanding stem dart points, notched pebbles, and a high percentage of large scraping and cutting tools, including Gossett and Clear Fork gouges, Albany spokeshaves, and Mineola end scrapers. Period 3 represented the Late Archaic occupation, and was marked by the presence of contracting stem Gary dart points. While Gary points were thought to be associated with early pottery in East Texas (Johnson 1962; Tunnell 1961), the Cedar Creek data suggested to Story (1965:250) that Period 3 was largely preceramic. Period 4 was the early Neo-American (Late Prehistoric) occupation which was marked by the appearance of arrow points. The Scallorn and Granbury types were thought to be most diagnostic, but Alba, Friley and Steiner were also thought to be associated. Both plain and decorated ceramics were being made during Period 4. Period 5 was the final prehistoric occupation recognized at Cedar Creek Reservoir. Diagnostic arrow point types were Cliffton, Perdiz, and Catahoula-like. Small flakes and drills also were thought to be associated with this period. Pottery continued to be manufactured, with shell tempering and engraved decoration appearing during Period 5. Subsequent work at the proposed Tennessee Colony Lake provided several radiocarbon dates in association with diagnostic projectile points. A date of 1864 + 57 B.C. was obtained on charcoal associated with a rectangular stem Carrollton point (Richner and Bagot 1978:232). Two contracting stem Gary points were associated with four dates from the same context. Two were on charcoal (685 + 49 B.C. and 719 + 58 B.C.) and two were on mussel shell (903 + 57 B.C. and 1151 + 59 B.C.) (Richner 1982:221). The charcoal dates are considered more reliable. UPPER NAVASOTA RIVER Following an archaeological survey of Lake Limestone (formerly Upper Navasota Reservoir), Prewitt (1974) presented a preliminary artifact chronology for the area (Table 15-1). Like Richland/Chambers Reservoir, the location of Lake Limestone is intermediate between the East Texas and Central Texas archaeological areas. Diagnostic artifacts of both East and Central Texas origins were recognized by Prewitt (1974:12). Subsequent excavations (Mallouf 1979) did little to alter this framework. Most of the sites exhibited substantially mixed deposits, but site 41LT12 contained generally stratified components of the Middle Archaic, Late Archaic and post-Archaic periods (Mallouf 1979:44). Unfortunately, no radiocarbon dates could be obtained to date this sequence. Most of the artifact types recognized by Prewitt were present in the excavation assemblages. The relative vertical distributions of projectile points were said to demonstrate the sequence of expanding stem dart points dating earlier than contracting and bulbar stem forms. There was, however, considerable overlap in these distributions (Mallouf 1979:41). ARTIFACT CHRONOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FROM THE RICHLAND CREEK ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT The same contextual problems that have hampered chronological refinement in North Central and East Texas also characterized most of the RCAP sites. The sites located on Pleistocene terraces have had essentially nonaggrading surfaces during the period of human occupation (See Chapter 7, Volume J). As a result, there is a lack of clear vertical separation between components. Certain sites did, however, provide much better

These were the Perry site (41FT193) and the large depressions ("Wylie focus pits") at Bird Point Island (41FT201) and Adams Ranch (41NV177). The assemblages from these contexts are most important for refining local artifact chronology and are considered in detail below. THE PERRY SITE (41FT193) The importance of the Perry site is the direct result of its long history of alluvial deposition (see Chapter 4). The excavated deposits were radiocarbon dated to between 170 + 120 B.C. and A.D. 1820 + 50 (Figure 15-1). When the standard deviations are considered, only one of the radiocarbon dates (A.D. 590 + 90) appears to be out of sequence. The vertical distribution of the dates indicates that alluviation was relatively rapid until between A.D. 800 and 1170, when it slowed markedly. As a result, there is good vertical separation between the remains of sequential occupations prior to A.D. 1170. Some mixing of temporally distinctive artifacts may have occurred during the period of relative surface stability that appears to have lasted from ca. A.D. 1170 until the nineteenth century. Although the Perry site is the best context for establishing artifact chronology, the sample is smali. Diagnostic artifacts recovered from the various levels of excavation are shown in Table 15-2. In addition to these, a single Gary, regular variety dart point was recovered during test excavations from a lens of mussel shell associated with Soil Horizon VIC2b (see Chapter 4). This extensive mussel shell deposit correlated stratigraphically with the 340-350 cm excavation level. Radiocarbon dates from three different features associated with this horizon provide an average date of approximately A.D. 200 for the artifacts at this depth. The next group of dart points (two untyped, straight stem, two Gary, serrated blade, and one Gary, small variety) was recovered 173 between deposits with radiocarbon dates of A.D. 300 + 60 and A.D. 670 + 60. Although one untyped, straight stem specimen was at least 20 cm below the others, the three point types represented were not vertically separable. The two untyped specimens have relatively short, almost parallel sided stems. They are most similar to some examples of the Kent type, but the workmanship is better than that indicated by the type descriptions (Suhm and Jelks 1962:199; Suhm et al. 1954:432). The Gary, serrated blade specimens exhibit characteristics of the Neches River, oletha variety defined by Prewitt (1974:67), including right-hand beveling and serration of the blades, and almost parallel-sided but slightly contracting stems. However, the dating of these specimens is considerably later than the Middle Archaic period estimate for the Neches River, oletha. The dart point typed as Gary, small variety is most similar to the smaller examples of Johnson's (1962:163) Gary, hobson variety. Its stratigraphic position above the Gary, regular variety specimen is limited evidence for a gradual diminution in size through time for the Gary type. Arrow points were confined to the excavation levels between 230 cm and 270 cm. The time period represented seems to extend from about A.D. 700 to possibly as late as the nineteenth century. The problematical A.D. 590 + 90 date is out of sequence both in terms of the radiocarbon dates and the artifact distributions, and is not considered reliable (see Chapter 4). The often demonstrated Scallorn-Perdiz sequence is indicated here by the single Scallorn point in the level below the Perdiz, Cliffton, and Steiner specimens. On the other hand, stratigraphic evidence from the Adams Ranch site will be used to suggest that Steiner is an earlier type than Perdiz. This relationship cannot be demonstrated at the Perry site, but the slow rate of deposition in this portion of the profile may be responsible for the lack of vertical stratification. Ceramics were confined to the excavation levels between 230 cm and 260 cm, dating later than A.D. 800.

The distinctive drill/awls were restricted to the 230 - 250 cm and 260 - 270 cm excavation levels. These small flake tools are diagnostic of the Late Prehistoric period. Three Bristol bifaces were recovered from the 250 - 260 cm level in addition to the single specimen from 340 - 350 cm. The late (post-A.D. 800) occurrence of this artifact type contradicts earlier suggestions that it may be diagnostic of the Late Archaic period (Story 1965:202; Prewitt 1974:12). While the specimen from 340 - 350 cm demonstrates the presence of the Bristol biface during the Late Archaic, it is certainly not restricted to that period. THE "WYLIE FOCUS PITS" The fill excavated from the large depressions ("Wylie focus pits") at both Bird Point Island and the Adams Ranch site was divided into stratigraphic zones which were dated by a series of radiocarbon determinations. The stratigraphic integrity of the artifact assemblages from these features is not as ideal as that of the Perry site for several reasons. Because these features were located within intensively occupied multicomponent sites, there is a possibility that artifacts from earlier occupations could have been incorporated into later fill episodes. In addition, bioturbation and/or later cultural activities within these features could have resulted in the introduction of artifacts that actually postdated the original deposition of a stratigraphic zone. In spite of these possible problems, the assemblages from these features provide additional data sets covering approximately the same time span as the assemblage from the Perry site, and provide useful corroborative information. The radiocarbon dates indicate that the original excavation of the pit at Bird Point Island occurred Volume III, Part Two somewhat earlier than the one at Adams Ranch. In both cases the ‘assemblages from the earliest stratigraphic zones are rather limited in the numbers of artifacts recovered. However, there are differences between these earliest assemblages which have temporal significance, and these are discussed below. BIRD POINT ISLAND (41FT201) Three stratigraphic zones were recognized within Feature 1. Radiocarbon dates from each of these were used to produce the following temporal estimates: A.D. 1000 - A.D. 1650 for Zone 1; A.D. 580 - A.D.860 for Zone 2; and 170 B.C. - A.D. 130 for Zone 3 (see Chapter 6, Volume II). Zone 3, the earliest of these, contained six dart points but no arrow points (Table 15-3). The ratio of arrow points to dart points increases from 1:4 in Zone 2 to approximately 5:1 in Zone 1. The only arrow point types present in Zone 2 were Alba and Scallorn. Both are generally recognized as early arrow point types, but both were also found in greater numbers in the Zone 1 assemblage. Perdiz is most common type in Zone 1. Other types found only in Zone 1 included Steiner, Hayes, and Catahoula-like. Because such a long period of time seems to be represented by the Zone 1 deposit, the co-occurrence of these types does not necessarily imply strict contemporaneity. With respect to dart points, the Gary, regular variety was by far the most common in all three zones. The serrated blade and small varieties of the Gary type were present in minor amounts. Two Dawson and one Yarbrough were found in Zone 2 even though both types are though to be diagnostic of the Middle Table 15-3 DISTRIBUTION OF PROJECTILE Point TYPES AND CERAMICS WITHIN FEATURE 1 AT BirD PoInt ISLAND UU EEEEENIE AREER AREER eanemmneenammnenmie” Zone 1 Zone 2 Zone 3 AD. 1000-1650 A.D. 580-860 170 B.C.-AD. 130 Arrow Points Alba Catahoula-like Hayes Perdiz Scallom Steiner Untyped, expanding stern Untyped, contracting stem Untyped, fragmentary Total ~ an Awe NW _ N wu an WN woe fo] Dart Points Dawson 2 Gary, regular variety 7 1 Gary, serrated blade 1 1 1 Gary, small variety 1 1 Yarbrough 1 Untyped, straight stem 1 1 Untyped, expanding stem 1 Untyped, fragmentary 1 2 Total 11 20 6 Ceramics Total 136 69 4

These may represent earlier materials that were introduced incidentally into the pit fill from the surrounding site deposit. The recovery of dart points from Zone 1, even in relatively minor proportions, was somewhat surprising. This zone was dated to later than A.D. 1000, a time when it is generally thought that dart points had been replaced entirely by arrow points. Although some mixing of materials between zones may have occurred through both natural and cultural processes, other lines of evidence presented in Chapter 7 of Volume II were used to argue for the concurrent use of arrow points and Gary dart points during most of the Late Prehistoric period. The strongest line of evidence was the consistently higher proportion of dart points from the fill of features dated to the Late Prehistoric period than from the A horizon deposits surrounding these features. The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that dart points were being used in the activities associated with these features. If the dart points were simply the remains of earlier occupations, it is unlikely that they would be relatively more common in Late Prehistoric feature fill. Temporal changes in ceramic artifacts are difficult to discern because of the relatively small sample from Feature 1 (109 sherds). However, certain trends can be noted. The majority of sherds was recovered from Zone 1. Only four were found in Zone 3, and these were from the upper part of that zone. It is suggested that the 170 B.C, - A.D. 130 time period was preceramic, and that the four sherds had been displaced from an upper zone. These four sherds are more similar to those from Zones 1 and 2 than they are to the ceramics from demonstrably early contexts within the Adams Ranch pit. At the Adams Ranch site, shell temper characterized the earliest ceramics. The four Zone 3 sherds at Bird Point Island belong to a grog, grit, and bone temper tradition, as do the ceramics in Zones | and 2. The distribution of decoration types shows some differences between Zones 1 and 2 (Table 15-4). A higher percentage of plain sherds was present in Zone 2. Zone 1 had the only engraved sherds as well as a far higher percentage of incised sherds. No differences between zones in tempering materials could be demonstrated for this particular assemblage. ADAMS RANCH (41NV177) The fill within Feature 1 at the Adams Ranch site was also divided into three major stratigraphic zones. The estimated time spans are: A.D, 200 - A.D. 700 for Zone 3; A.D. 800 - A.D. 1000 for Zone 2; and post-A.D. 1000 for Zone 1. As at Bird Point Island, few diagnostic artifacts were present in the earliest zone (Table 15-5). Two contracting stem dart points (one Gary, regular variety and one untyped), a single untyped, bifurcated stem arrow point, and seven shell tempered potsherds were the only diagnostic artifacts recovered from Zone 3. Five dart point fragments and one arrow point fragment were also recovered. 175 The seven sherds are most important in terms of artifact chronology. They are the earliest dated ceramics from the RCAP area, and belong to a distinctive ceramic tradition that is represented at three other Project area sites (41FT158, 41FT200, and 41FT201). Two additional shell tempered sherds were found in the lower part of Zone 2, but those occurred in an area of apparent redigging by later inhabitants of the site. Moreover, the lack of any grog, grit, or bone tempered sherds in Zone 3 is seen as further evidence of the early dating of this shell temper tradition. The other 10 sherds from Zone 2 and all 36 sherds from Zone 1 belong to the grog, grit, and bone temper tradition found at most sites in the reservoir and dated elsewhere between A.D. 900 and A.D. 1650. The only decorated sherds were from Zone 1. Incised and punctated decorations were the most common, followed by punctated/incised and brushed. Engraved decoration was not represented in the Feature 1 assemblage. Most of the arrow point types were present in both Zone | and Zone 2. Three types occurred only in a single zone, and may be significant in terms of artifact chronology. The Steiner type was confined to Zone 2 (A.D. 800 - 1000), while the Perdiz and Catahoula-like types occurred only in Zone 1 (post-A.D. 1000). As at Bird Point Island, dart points were present in all three stratigraphic zones. The majority of these could not be assigned to an established type. Little chronological information is apparent in their stratigraphic distribution, except that it reinforces the contention that dart points continued to be used well into the Late Prehistoric period.

ARTIFACT CHRONOLOGY FOR THE RICHLAND/CHAMBERS RESERVOIR The stratigraphic data presented above are most important for building an improved artifact chronology for the Project area. Unfortunately, stratified and dated contexts extended back to only about A.D. 1. The artifact sequence for the earlier part of the prehistoric period must be reconstructed by a less direct approach. The assemblages from sites with predominantly Archaic period deposits will be compared to assemblages that are known to date later in time. By contrasting the intersite distributions of certain artifact types, changes through time in material culture can be inferred. Interassemblage comparisons are also used to investigate changes through time in ceramic artifacts during the Late Prehistoric period. Although only relatively small ceramic samples were recovered from most dated contexts, intersite comparison of the ceramic assemblages is nonetheless helpful in refining the local cultural chronology. Using the archaeological resuits from Richland/Chambers Reservoir along with the work by previous investigators, a refined artifact chronology can be offered for the Project area (Figure 15-2). This chronology includes both the temporal periods outlined in Chapter 3 of Volume I, and a series of local phases that can now be defined as a result of the RCAP investigations. These phases represent subdivisions within the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, and were initially introduced in Chapter 12 of Volume II. The term phase, in contrast to a period which only indicates a length of time, is used here to refer to a cultural episode that occurred within a specific time period and that possessed a variety of traits sufficiently distinctive to be separated from other cultural episodes. In Chapter 18 details on the internal site composition, economic strategy, and overall settlement organization used during each phase are presented. The current chapter only provides chronological details on these cultural episodes. In addition, Figure 15-2 presents the distribution of all nonmodern radiocarbon dates from the RCAP sites. Specific details concerning these dates can be found in Table 15-6. PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (11,000 TO 6000 B.C.) The traits listed for the Paleo-Indian period are based , neccessarily on data from outside the Project area. The few diagnostics of these periods that were recovered from RCAP sites were either mixed with artifacts from later occupations or were from surface contexts. The Clovis and Folsom fluted point types are known to date to the early part of the Paleo-Indian period. | Although none were recovered during the RCAP, a few Clovis and

The various unfluted lanceolate types (e.g., Plainview, Meserve, Angostura) are diagnostic of the late Paleo-Indian period. Very few of these points were recovered from the testing and mitigation excavations, but several are present in avocational collections from sites within the reservoir (Raab, McGregor, and McIntyre 1982:111). - The Horn Shelter (Watt 1978) in the Central Brazos River Valley is the nearest stratified Paleo-Indian site. At Horn Shelter No. 2, the earliest points are of an untyped, lanceolate form and are followed by a sequence of Folsom, Brazos Fishtail, and Plainview types. The Brazos Fishtail is somewhat similar to, and is thought to be a variant of the San Patrice type (Prikryl and Jackson 1985:22; Turner and Hester 1985:147). Two radiocarbon dates on charcoal (7550 + 200 B.C. and 8030 + 370 B.C.) and two on snail shell (8080 + 130 B.C. and 8360 + 150 B.C.) were associated with the Brazos Fishtail points. A date of 6450 + 110 B.C. on snail shell was associated with the Plainview stratum. An additional snail shell radiocarbon date of 7325 + 360 B.C. was associated with the Plainview stratum at Horn No. 1 (Watt 1978:127). The nearest dated occurrence of the Angostura type is the Loeve site on the San Gabriel River, where radiocarbon dates of 7700 £ 910 B.C. and 6550 + 130 B.C. were associated stratigraphically (Prewitt 1982:237). Although Prewitt (1981:77) considers the Angostura type to be diagnostic of the Archaic stage Circleville phase, it is here considered late Paleo-Indian based on both age and style. ARCHAIC PERIOD (6000 B.C. TO A.D. 700) Subdividing the materials from the Archaic period occupation of the Richland/Chambers Reservoir into temporally discrete subsets is a difficult task. Because of a general lack of stratified components or dated single component sites, artifacts of the Archaic period form an almost undifferentiated assemblage. Three RCAP sites (the Hardy site 41FT200, 41FT158, and 41NV96) contained substantial numbers of Archaic period diagnostics that were rare or absent at other excavated sites. Because none of these sites produced radiocarbon dates, chronological placement of these artifacts must rely on comparisons with the artifact chronologies that have been established for areas close to the Project. As a result, the Archaic chronology is more generalized and tentative than that for the later periods. These three sites contained not only projectile point types thought to be diagnostic of the Early and Middle Archaic, but Late Archaic and Transitional Archaic diagnostics (Gary dart points and shell tempered ceramics) as well. A few Late Prehistoric period artifacts, deposited during later periods, were also recovered from 41FT158 (grog tempered ceramics) and 41NV96 (arrow points and grog tempered ceramics). Unlike other RCAP sites, expanding stem dart points outnumber the contracting stem types at Hardy and 41NV96 (Table 15-7). Although the contracting stem Gary was the most numerous type at 41FT158, the combined total of expanding stem and other typologically early types (Bulverde, San Patrice, and the untyped, lanceolate specimen) outnumbers these. EARLY ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3000 B.C.) Although Lynott (1981:103) has suggested that the San Patrice projectile point type is diagnostic of this time period in North Texas, this type is considered here to be related to the late Paleo- Indian period. A lack of dated Early Archaic assemblages in East Texas prevents cross dating of artifact types to that region. Of the Central Texas projectile point types considered to date to this time span, only the Wells type was found in the Project area. The Wells type is considered diagnostic of the Early Archaic, San Geronimo phase in Prewitt's (1981) Central Texas chronology, with an estimated age of 5050 B.C. to ca. 4050 B.C. (Prewitt 1981:78). Although conclusive evidence is lacking for the Project area, other artifacts such as the Clear Fork gouge and Waco sinker may also date to the Early Archaic period. MIDDLE ARCHAIC (3000 TO 1000 B.C.) The temporal range of expanding stem dart points is not well established for the Project area, but a Middle Archaic (3000 - 1000 B.C.) range is suggested for some of these. Expanding stem types which are thought to date to the Middle Archaic include Yarbrough (Figure 15-3a-g), Edgewood, Palmillas (Figure 15- 3h,i) and possibly many of the untyped, expanding stem specimens. Expanding stem dart points typed as Ellis and Marshall may date later in time. Although relatively few in number, they were more often found in the later sites (Table 15-7). At the proposed Tennessee Colony Lake, a straight stem dart point typed as Carrollton was dated to 1864 + 57 B.C. (Richner and Bagot 1978:232). This date is within the 2050 B.C. to 1450 B.C. range suggested by Prewitt (1981:79) for the morphologically similar Bulverde type (Figure 15-4a,b). Most of the straight stem dart points could not be classed as Bulverde or Carrollton. A few of the untyped, straight stem specimens may be Middle Archaic in age, especially those with long and relatively wide rectangular stems (Figure 15-4c). However, most were generally smaller in size, with shorter and narrower stems (Figure 15-4d-g). The two specimens from the Perry site (Figure 15-4f,g) were dated to between A.D. 300 and A.D. 670, demonstrating that some straight stem dart points are considerably younger. tes.

The stem edges are ground on many specimens. It has been suggested that the Dawson type may date to the Middle Archaic (Prikryl and Jackson 1985:23; Turner and Hester 1985:85). This type has not been found in well dated contexts at the Richland/Chambers Reservoir, but they were not common in assemblages where expanding stem dart points were well represented (Table 15-7). Dawson points are tentatively assigned to the Middle Archaic period, although a Late Archaic date is equally likely given our present evidence from the Project area. Other chipped stone artifact types were also present at Hardy site 41FT200, 41FT158, and 41NV96, but were rare or absent at other sites, These include Clear Fork gouges (Figure 15-3j-!) and Waco sinkers, Although relatively few of these were recovered, 1 83 22 20 2 8 4 4 1 g 3 1 2 7 2 10 2 :} 8 1 1 2 1 1 2 3 31 1 4 6 3 65 6 21 1 18 3 1 51 11 28 2 1 20 3 1 23 26 20 4 3 12 2 28 18 35 1 1 3 4 14 1 1 46 13 19 1 2 7 1 1 2 1 1 2 18 5 B) 1 3 1 8 1 20 1 237 30 39 9 2 15 3 2 20. 6 3 2 1 1 32 4 7 1 7 2 1 1 2 1 2 3 2 11 1 1 1 2 6 6 7 1 1 3 2 36 9 7 4 1 6 4 13 3 their presence is considered to be significant and they are thought to have been in use during the Middle Archaic period.

The unifacially flaked Gossett gouge was more widely distributed, and probably represents a later type. Mineola end scrapers (scrapers on tabular pieces of silicified wood) were present at almost all sites, and are not thought to be useful as a temporal diagnostic. LATE ARCHAIC (1000 B.C. TO A.D. 700) Contracting stem dart points are most diagnostic of the Late Archaic period. However, certain expanding stem types such as

Ellis and Marshall may date to the earlier half of this time span. For the latter part of the Late Archaic period, a Transitional Archaic phase (200 B.C. - A.D. 700) has been identified for the Project area. The beginning of this phase corresponds with the initial excavation of the large depression ("Wylie focus pit") at Bird Point Island, and the ending with the introduction of arrow points into the Project area. Components of the Transitional Archaic phase were recognized at five RCAP sites on the basis of either the presence of large depressions (Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch) or the occurrence of distinctive shell tempered ceramics (41FT158 and Hardy). The earliest dated ceramics from the RCAP sites belong to a distinctive shell temper tradition. These shell tempered sherds were recovered from four of the sites and were always limited in number. They are uniformly thin and undecorated, with a plately texture and a shell tempered paste. In some cases the shell has been leached out, leaving platey vesicules in the paste. These ceramics appear to be very similar to sherds recovered from Lake Limestone (Prewitt 1974, 1975; Mallouf 1979), which are described as consisting of buff to pinkish buff colors, being made from fine-grained clays (kaolin), and having a compact platey structure. Although shell temper was not observed in the Lake Limestone specimens, the other strong similarities suggest to us that the Richland Creek sherds may also be made from non-local, kaolinitic clays, perhaps from the Limestone County area. No local sources of this clay type are known, and the texture of these sherds varies significantly from the coarse-texture clays used during later periods which petrographic analysis has suggested were manufactured locally (see Appendix C). The best evidence for the early dating of this tradition is from the Adams Ranch site, where seven shell tempered sherds constituted the only ceramics from the earliest stratigraphic zone of Feature 1, This zone was radiocarbon dated between A.D. 200 and A.D. 700. Of the three other sites with shell tempered a. am on he oe lee le

The third was the multicomponent Bird Point Island. The lack of shell tempered ceramics in the earliest stratigraphic zone of Feature 1 at Bird Point Island is interpreted as indicating that they had not yet been introduced during the 170 B.C. - A.D. 130 time period. The contracting stem Gary was the most common dart point type at RCAP sites (Figure 15-5). Gary points have been dated as early as 719 + 58 B.C. at the proposed Tennessee Colony Lake (Richner 1982:221). They are considered most diagnostic of the Late Archaic period in general. A date of about A.D. 200 was obtained for the Gary, regular variety specimen at the Perry site (Figure 15-5a). Two additional varieties of the Gary type were recognized. At the Perry site, both the serrated blade and small varieties were found in contexts dating between A.D. 300 and A.D. 670. It may be significant that neither of the latter two varieties was present at the three primarily Archaic sites, although small sample sizes may be a problem. In any case, all three varieties of the Gary type were in use during the Transitional Archaic phase. LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 700 TO 1650) In terms of diagnostic artifacts, the Late Prehistoric period is distinguished primarily by the initial appearance of arrow points and two additional ceramic traditions. Within the Late Prehistoric period in the Project area, three distinct phases have been recognized (Figure 15-2): the Richland Creek phase (A.D. 700 - 900); the Round Prairie phase (A.D. 900 - 1300); and the St. Elmo phase (A.D. 1300 - 1650). For purposes of this chapter, however, artifact chronology cannot easily be discussed by individual phases since few traits are uniquely associated with a single phase. In a few instances the dominance of a given artifact type can be attributed to a phase, and in such cases this is noted. Otherwise the discussion covers the Late Prehistoric time period overall. In the central and southern portions of East Texas, sandy paste ceramics are thought to predate the Caddoan ceramic tradition (Shafer 1975; Story 1981). Coarse-grained, sandy paste sherds were present at several Project area sites, but occurred in significant proportions only at the Irvine site (11% of all ceramics) and at 41FT161-B (13%). The major component at both of these sites has been assigned to the A.D. 700 to 900 period Richland Creek phase. The use of sandy paste ceramics may have been restricted to only a portion of that time period, most likely the earlier portion. The lack of sandy paste ceramics in the early stratigraphic zones of the "Wylie focus pits” at Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch indicates that this tradition cannot be documented locally prior to about A.D. 700. This is considerably later than the presumed dating of sandy paste ceramics in East Texas, where introduction possibly as early as 200 B.C, has been suggested (Story 1981:146). The most common ceramics at RCAP sites are those belonging to the grog, grit, and bone temper tradition. The earliest occurrence of this tradition appeared to be contemporary with the sandy paste traditon. It was present in the Richland Creek phase features at the Irvine site, two of which have yielded radiocarbon dates of A.D. 670 + 130 and A.D 870 + 140. It remained the dominant ceramic tradition throughout the remainder of the prehistoric period. Within the long time span of this grog, grit, and bone temper tradition, there are proportional changes in methods of decoration that have chronological significance. When the ceramic assemblages from several sites are compared (Table 15-8), these changes can be characterized. Although all of these sites were to some extent multicomponent, the principle components represented differ between them. The earliest assemblage (Irvine) contained mainly punctations and incised lines and engraving is more frequent than in the later

Round ‘Prairie phase assemblages. Punctations were made most frequently with fingernails, and less often with both pointed and blunt instruments. Some variability exists between the Round Prairie phase assemblages, but incised and punctated decoration continue to dominate during this period. In terms of design element configurations (see Table 8-9), Random Punctations (Figure 15-6a,b) are the most frequent, followed by incised lines at various angles relative to the vessel orifice, including design elements Diagonal Incised Lines (Figure 15-6c,d), Parallel Incised Lines, Orientation Not Observable Volume III, Part Two Figure 15-5.

These element configurations are most similar to parts of the design on type Canton Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962). The St. Elmo phase assemblage from the Little Cedar Creek site is significantly different from the earlier assemblages. Differences include a higher percentage of engraved and a much lower percentage of punctated decoration. The most frequent design element configuration is Crosshatched Incised Lines (Figure 15-6g,h), with Parailel Engraved Lines (Figure 15-6i,j) the next most frequent.

Artifact Chronology 183 i 0 5 a es ee es ee ee || Figure 15-6. Ceramic design element configurations from the Richland/Chambers Reservoir: (a,b) Random punctations, (c,d) Diagonal incised lines, (e,f) Parallel incised lines, orientation not observable, (g,h) Crosshatched incised lines, (i,j) Parallel engraved lines, (k,l) Engraved triangles. appears to be the Engraved Triangle configuration (Figure 15- 6k,1). Overall, ceramic designs are similar to those of several late Caddoan types, including Maydelle Incised, Poynor Engraved, Karnack Brushed-Incised, Killough Pinched, and Avery Engraved. As suggested previously, the Gary type continued to be used after the introduction of arrow points, and well into the Late Prehistoric period. This is based on their consistent appearance in later features at Irvine, Little Cedar Creek, and Bird Point Island. The sequence of arrow point types is based on a composite of the stratigraphic information from the Perry site and the two Wylie focus pits. At Perry, the Scallorn type may date as early as A.D. 700, and the stratigraphic distributions at Adams Ranch and Bird Point Island suggest that its use continued until after A.D. 1000. Both the Steiner and Alba types appear relatively early (A.D. 800 - 1000) at Adams Ranch, and both are found at Bird Point Island in the stratigraphic zone dating later than A.D. 1000. The Perdiz type seems to date consistently later than these other types at all three sites. Although there is a degree of overlap in the temporal distributions of particular arrow point types, Scallorn and Steiner are most diagnostic of the Richland Creek phase, Alba of the Round Prairie phase, and Perdiz and Cliffton of the St. Elmo phase. Among the other lithic tools, the distinctive drill/awls are restricted to the Late Prehistoric period, but do not appear to be associated with any particular phase. These artifacts are identical to the "awls" that Shafer (1973:220) described from the Davis site, and considered to be diagnostic of the Late Prehistoric period in East Texas. They also occur in Late Prehistoric contexts in both North Central and Central Texas. The only other bifacial tool that may be temporally diagnostic is the small, subtriangular knife form. This artifact type was well represented only at the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173), and is apparently associated with the St. Elmo phase. No distinctive unifacial tool forms can be assigned exclusively to the Late Prehistoric period. Steeply chipped unifaces are significantly less common than they were in Middle and Late Archaic assemblages. Notably absent are the small, snub-nosed end scrapers that are associated with the Late Prehistoric period in Central Texas (Prewitt 1981:83; Suhm et al. 1954:112) and in the

184 upper Trinity River basin (Stephenson 1952:304; Suhm et al. 1954:83,90). This as well as other "Plains traits" (ic., beveled knives and shell tempered Nocona Plain ceramics) do not occur at RCAP sites. EVALUATION OF THE RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS As noted in Chapter 1 of this volume, several prehistoric research hypotheses were developed prior to beginning the mitigation phase of the Project. These hypotheses are addressed at various points within Volumes II and III, depending on the particular data's applicability to the hypothesis. The artifact chronology information of this chapter is pertinent to addressing one of the culture-historical hypothesis: H1. Archaic stage sites in the Project area can be subsumed taxonomically within the Carrollton and Elam foci of the Trinity aspect, and the Neo- American stage sites within the Wylie focus of North Central Texas Two test implications were presented for this hypothesis: (1) demonstration of stylistic similarities in artifact assemblages between sites in the Project area and sites in the upper Trinity River basin, and (2) contemporaneity of the sites with similar assemblages. The part of this hypothesis which deals with the Archaic period will be evaluated here. The part dealing with the Wylie focus is addressed in Chapter 21 of Volume I. Comparisons between the Project area and the upper Trinity River drainage are difficult because Archaic period culture history continues to be insufficiently documented in both areas. Volume III, Part Two Crook and Harris’ (1952, 1954a) original definitions of the Carrollton and Elam foci and their artifact traits remain the most complete treatment of this subject. As mentioned in an earlier section of this chapter, the stratigraphic integrity of these Trinity aspect sites has since been questioned. The Carrollton focus in particular may contain a mixture of artifacts that actually spans several thousands of years. Even so, there are few specific similarities between Carrollton diagnostics and the Archaic period assemblages from the Project area. Several of the artifact types common to both areas (Clear Fork gouges, Waco sinkers, steeply chipped scrapers) are also known to be more widespread in their distribution, and their presence in the Project area does not necessarily indicate cultural connections with the Carrollton focus. Dart points of the Carrollton and Trinity types are not common in Project area assemblages. The smaller straight stem dart points called "Dallas Pentagonal" by Crook and Harris (1954a:3) are more similar to specimens from the Project area. However, based on evidence from the Perry site, the Project area specimens may date considerably later in time. Artifact traits of the Elam focus (primarily Ellis, Yarbrough, and Gary dart points) are more numerous in the Project area. However, these same traits are also shared with the LaHarpe aspect sites, particularly those in its central area (Johnson 1962:269). This was noted previously by Johnson (1962:270), who suggested that the Elam focus might be included within the LaHarpe aspect when better data became available. In summary, there seem to be few specific similarities in artifact traits between sites of the Carrollton and Elam foci and the Archaic sites in the Project area. Shared traits are also common to Archaic period sites in other regions. If cultural ties are to be defined on the basis of artifact similarities, then the Project area Archaic shows closest affinities to the LaHarpe aspect of central East Texas.

LITHIC RAW MATERIAL UTILIZATION by Daniel E. McGregor Temporal differences in the use of lithic material types have been recognized previously for the prehistoric period in North Central Texas. In defining the Archaic period Trinity aspect, Crook and Harris (1952) noted the more frequent use of nonlocal “flint” for artifacts diagnostic of the earlier Carrollton focus relative to those of the later Elam focus. Most of Elam focus artifacts were made from locally available quartzites, and this trend was said to be even more pronounced in the subsequent Wylie focus (Crook and Harris 1952:27). The authors attributed these differences to "an increasing adaptation to the Dallas County region environment" (Crook and Harris 1952:24). Grady (1978) noted similar changes in lithic material utilization for the Archaic period in the middle Trinity River drainage. The more frequent use of nonlocal materials during the Early and Middle Archaic was thought to reflect a higher degree of mobility over larger territories, and an exchange network that involved interaction with groups exploiting adjacent territories where high quality cherts were available. The less frequent occurrence of nonlocal materials in Late Archaic assemblages was seen as resulting from reduction in the size of group territories and the development of more regionally oriented exchange systems through time. Temporal differences in lithic material use were also recognized for the Richland/Chambers Reservoir area (McGregor, Raab, and Irvine 1982:66-67). Based on the artifact samples from test excavations, it was suggested that a higher proportion of chert was characteristic of Archaic period assemblages relative to those of the Late Prehistoric period. This conclusion resulted from a comparison of both the chipped stone tools and the lithic debris from only three single component assemblages (one Archaic and two Late Prehistoric). The recovery of larger samples from the subsequent RCAP excavations allows a more complete investigation of the patterns of lithic material use. In this chapter, we identify the local and regional lithic resources that were available to the prehistoric inhabitants of the Richland/Chambers Reservoir area. During analysis, all lithic artifacts from the RCAP sites were sorted into a series of raw material types. The relative amounts of various material types represented in the assemblages from these sites are compared, and intersite differences are identified. Based on the dating of these particular site assemblages, the differences in material use are interpreted as having resulted from reductions in the size of exploitive territories through time. Additional support for this interpretation is provided by an analysis of the regional distribution of temporally diagnostic projectile points made from one distinctive lithic material type with a spatially restricted local source (Pisgah Ridge chert). SOURCES OF LITHIC MATERIAL For the purpose of discussing lithic resources, an area considerably larger than the middle Trinity River basin will be considered (Figure 16-1). Within this region silicious materials suitable for the manufacture of chipped stone tools occur in two general forms: (1) in primary bedrock deposits; and (2) as redeposited gravels. The chert-bearing bedrock deposits of interest to the present discussion are the Lower Cretaceous limestones (Fredericksburg Group) to the west and southwest of the middle Trinity drainage, and the Tehuacana limestone (Paleocene) which outcrops a short distance to the west of Richland/Chambers Reservoir. The high quality chert of the Edwards formation (Figure 16-1) is the most abundant bedrock source. Its area of outcrop is predominantly that portion of the Edwards formation located south and southwest of the Brazos and Bosque Rivers (Henry et al. 1980; Perttula 1984). A minor bedrock chert source is located a short distance west of the Richland/Chambers Reservoir. Pisgah Ridge chert occurs as nodules and small seams in the Tehuacana limestone member of the Kincaid formation (Midway Group) on Pisgah Ridge, about 6 km west of Richland, Texas. The Tehuacana limestone itself outcrops discontinuously over a distance of approximately 200 km (Figure 16-1), but the Pisgah Ridge outcrop is the only known source of this visually distinctive chert. , 185

Geological map of the study area. The major sources of silicious gravels throughout the region are known collectively as the Uvalde gravels (Byrd 1971; Menzer and Slaughter 1971). The Uvalde gravels occur on upland stream ‘divides and, to a lesser extent, in reworked terrace deposits throughout central and northeast Texas. They include pebbles and cobbles of quartzite, chert, and silicified wood. Chert is only a minor constituent of the upland gravels at Richland/Chambers Reservoir, where fine grained quartzites predominate. However, the lithological content of these upland gravels is not uniform throughout the larger region that is being considered. Byrd (1971:18) noted that in certain locations just east of the Balcones Escarpment in Central Texas, chert and limestone were the dominant constituents, while quartzites predominated farther to the east. He suggested that the chert and limestone were derived from the Edwards formation, a source sufficiently close so that the limestone was not abraded away or dissolved during transport

Lithic Raw Material Utilization (Byrd 1971:22). In discussing the upland gravels in the vicinity of Aquilla Lake, Ritchie and Slaughter (1972:150) suggested that the abundant chert cobbles in these gravels may have been derived from the Lower Cretaceous limestone formations which outcrop not far to the west of Aquilla Creek. In order to assess this regional variability in lithological content, upland gravel outcrops at four locations along an east- west transect were inspected by the author (Figure 16-1). While the observed differences have not been quantified, chert cobbles were present in both greater relative frequency and larger size at Location 1. Location 1 is in the uplands adjacent to Aquilla Lake, east of the former confluence of Aquilla and Hackberry Creeks. Much of the chert in these gravels is indistinguishable from bedrock samples of Edwards chert, suggesting that some portion of them originated in the Edwards limestone. Location 2 overiooks the upper reaches of Ash Creek, a tributary of Richland Creek. It is only a short distance east of the divide between the Brazos River and the Trinity River drainage basins. Location 2 exhibited both lower relative frequency and smaller size for chert cobbles than did Location 1, but significantly more than was observed for Locations 3 and 4. The gravels at Locations 3 and 4 did not differ noticeably from one another. At both locations chert was a very minor constituent, occurring in nodules that were significantly smaller than those at Locations 1 and 2. LITHIC MATERIAL TYPES All chipped stone artifacts recovered from the RCAP sites were assigned to one of the following lithic material categories: Variety 1. Chert Variety 2. Quartzite Variety 3. Pisgah Ridge Chert Variety 4. Silicified Wood Variety 5. Other Originally, a subset of the artifacts now included in Variety 1 was identified as Edwards chert on the basis of its dark to light gray color and lustrous surface finish. It has been determined subsequently that cobbles and pebbles of identical materials are present in upland gravels located far to the east of the Edwards formation outcrops. These materials do occur in higher proportions and larger clast size west of the Richland Creek drainage, but, because minor amounts are known to be present in the Project area gravels as well, they cannot be considered strictly nonlocal materials. The vast majority of materials in Variety 2 are fine-grained quartzites that have also been termed Ogallala chert (Hughes and Willey 1978:47; Mallouf 1976:48; Pertulla 1984:135). This is the most common material in the upland gravels of the Project area. Variety 2 also includes small amounts of medium and coarse- grained quartzites that are also present in the local gravels. Pisgah Ridge chert (Variety 3) contains numerous small fossil fragments which give it a speckled appearance. Its color is predominantly black or dark gray, although it weathers to a white patina. This material occurs as nodules and small seams in the Tehuacana Limestone member of the Kincaid Formation on Pisgah Ridge, about 6 km west of Richland, Texas. Silicified wood (Variety 4) is also available locally. It is present as cobbles in the Uvalde gravels, and also occurs in larger nodule size within the Wilcox formation. The other category (Variety 5) consists primarily of sandstone, siltstone, and ironstone. These materials are available locally, but are present only in very minor amounts in the artifact assemblages. 187 LITHIC MATERIAL USE AT RICHLAND/CHAMBERS RESERVOIR TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN CHERT UTILIZATION The analysis of projectile points recovered from test excavations at Richland/Chambers Reservoir suggested variation over time in the choice of lithic materials used in projectile point manufacture (McGregor, Raab, and Irvine 1982:66). A large majority of the expanding stem dart points, which were thought to date to the earlier part of the Archaic period, were made of high quality cherts. This was not the case for the contracting stem dart points, nor for the arrow points. A much higher percentage of these later projectile point forms were made from quartzite or silicified wood. This same general pattern can be demonstrated for the projectile points recovered from the RCAP mitigation excavations (Table 16-1). Of the few dart points that are believed to date to the late Paleo-Indian or Early Archaic periods (Angostura, San Patrice, Wells, and Untyped, lanceolate specimens), only the two San Patrice specimens are made from materials other than chert, The types thought to be diagnostic of the Middle Archaic period (i.e., Bulverde, Edgewood, Yarbrough, and perhaps the Untyped, expanding stem forms) are among the highest in percentages of chert. Of all dart point types, chert was used least frequently for manufacturing the three varieties of the Gary type, and for the Dawson type. Gary points are thought to have been used during the Late Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. The chert percentages for all dart points classified by stem form are presented in Table 16-2. Overall, the use of chert for the manufacture of Late Prehistoric period arrow points was greater than for contracting stem dart points. Of the best represented arrow point types, the use of chert was highest for the Perdiz, Alba, and Hayes types. Chert was used least frequently for the Steiner and Scallomm specimens, types which are thought to be the earliest arrow points in the Project area. Based only on the projectile points, it would appear that the use of chert was highest during the Middle Archaic period and earlier. Chert use was much lower for the Late Archaic through the earliest part of the Late Prehistoric period, but increased somewhat after this. There is a problem with attempting to relate directly these changes in chert use to changes in the size of group territories. Although many of the chert nodules available in Project area gravels may not have been sufficiently large for manufacturing dart points, arrow point production would have required considerably smaller blanks. While greater accessibility to larger pieces of chert may be indicated by the Middle Archaic dart points, this is not necessarily required for the production of arrow points. The lithic debris assemblages may provide a more reliable indicator of overall lithic material utilization. Because most of the RCAP sites contained more than one component, the precise temporal placement of the lithic debris assemblages is less certain than it is for many of the projectile point types. Dominant components can, however, be identified for many of these sites, so that general comparisons can be made. For example, Middle Archaic diagnostics were dominant at only two sites: 41FT200 and 41INV96. The lithic debris assemblages from these same two sites contained the highest percentages of chert (Table 16-3). Consistent differences between the Late Archaic and the various Late Prehistoric components are not so well defined (Table 16-4). This could be as much a result of the multicomponent nature of the site assemblages as it is a reflection of actual patterns of chert utilization during this time span. For example, it is not known to what extent the minor yet significant Archaic period (both Middle and Late) occupation of the Irvine

Alternatively, it may be that chert use changed relatively little during the Late Archaic and all subsequent periods. The increased use of chert for temporally later arrow point types (Alba, Hayes, and Perdiz) has been demonstrated, but the lithic debris assemblages do not indicate any marked increase in chert use for the Round Prairie and St. Elmo phase components. The idea that the presence of exotic lithic materials can provide an indication of the scale of prehistoric group mobility has been discussed in the recent literature (Binford 1979; Goodyear 1979; Meltzer 1984; see also Binford and Stone 1985; Gould and Saggers 1985). Based on ethnographic evidence, Binford (1979:259) suggested that mobile hunter-gatherers tend to obtain lithic materials incidentally to the execution of basic subsistence tasks. He observed that the proportions of lithic material types in a given site asssemblage are primarily a function of the raw materials available in the habitat exploited from that location, plus those of any artifacts discarded at the site which had been procured from the areas of previously occupied sites (Binford 1979:260). In such cases, the material types within a given assemblage can be seen as a measure of the scale of settlement mobility. While none of the identified material types can be considered strictly exotic to the Project area, it is argued that accessibility to chert was greater for those prehistoric groups whose exploitive territories included areas located a significant distance to the west of the reservoir. In those areas the upland gravel deposits contain a far greater abundance of chert relative to the gravels of the Project area, The chert may have been transported from its source directly as the result of changes in site location over considerable distances, or through exchange with adjacent groups that had direct access to it. In either case, a reduction in the size of the territory that was exploited would effectively limit a group's access to this material. In addition, a reduction in the frequency of changes in site locations (settlement mobility) would reduce the rate at which this material was introduced into Project area sites. The longer a group remained within the Project area, the more locally obtained lithic materials would be utilized and added to the site assemblages. If this argument is accepted, then the temporal variations in chert use described above can be interpreted as follows. Middle Archaic settlement systems were characterized by relatively high mobility over territories that were large enough to include both the Project area and areas where substantially greater amounts of

Pisgah Ridge is a prominent limestone capped escarpment located about 6 km west of the town of Richland, in Navarro County, Texas. Within the area of Pisgah Ridge, the limestone is exposed discontinuously over a distance of 9 km. To the south it is present below the surface, but does not outcrop again for a distance of 15 km. North of Richland Creek the limestone is not seen again until a point approximately 75 km to the northeast. An archaeological survey of the entire Pisgah Ridge escarpment demonstrated that outcrops of this chert are restricted to an area atop the ridge that is 2 km long and .3 km wide. As noted previously, the Tehuacana limestone member outcrops over a total distance of about 200 km, and could possibly contain chert at other locations. Brief reconnaissance surveys were made of Tehuacana limestone outcrops on both the north and south sides of Lake Tawakoni on the Sabine River, and in the vicinity of Lake Mexia on the- Navasota River. No chert outcrops were discovered in either area, and it seems likely that the chert outcrop on Pisgah Ridge is the only source of this material. The temporal differences in chert utilization described in the preceding section of this chapter were interpreted as indicating changes through time in the size of group territories. Projectile points made of Pisgah Ridge chert, diagnostic of all time periods from late Paleo-Indian/Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric, were recovered from sites in the Richland/Chambers Reservoir area. Although Pisgah Ridge chert was a relatively minor lithic resource, it was thought that a study of the spatial distribution of temporally diagnostic artifacts made of this material would be useful for examining the questions of mobility and territorial size. In addition to the artifact collections from the Richland/ Chambers Reservoir sites, several other collections were also examined for Pisgah Ridge chert artifacts (Table 16-5). In most cases only the chipped stone tools were studied. Lithic debris assemblages were examined for the collections from Joe Pool Lake, Tennessee Colony Lake, Lake Palestine, and three sites at Lake Whitney. Three private artifact collections from sites within the study areas were also examined: the Young, Reading, and Harper collections. The Young collection remains in the possession of Mr. Bill Young of Corsicana, Texas, and is the best documented of the three. Mr. Young's extensive collection was made from numerous sites located primarily along the middle Trinity River, Richland and Chambers Creeks, and Aquilla Creek. The Harper collection is Volume III, Part Two curated at Southern Methodist University, and includes primarily sites in the upper Trinity River drainage in Dallas and Denton Counties. The only Pisgah Ridge chert artifacts in the Harper collection were from two sites, one in Ellis County and one in Navarro County. The Reading collection is on display at Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas. It includes artifacts from sites within both the middle Trinity and upper Navasota River drainages. Unfortunately, the locations for most of these sites are based on verbal descriptions only. The original map showing site locations was not available for study. Most sites yielding Pisgah Ridge chert artifacts were located within the middle Trinity River basin, including both Richland and Chambers Creeks (Figure 16-2). However, this material was found to be present at sites in each of the adjacent river drainages (i.e., the Sabine, Neches, Brazos, and Navasota). In general, many of the chipped stone tools and the lithic debris from these sites are poor chronological indicators. In all, 37 different sites contained one or more projectile points made of Pisgah Ridge chert (Table 16-6 and Figures 16-3 through 16-5), and the spatial distribution of these artifacts is the subject of the following analysis. Only three projectile points thought to be diagnostic of the late Paleo-Indian or Early Archaic periods were documented during this study. Two of these are typed as San Patrice and the third is a Dalton point with the blade reworked into a drill (Figure 16-3a). Interestingly, two of these specimens are from sites at Lake Fork Reservoir on a tributary of the Sabine River (Figure 16-6), and are farther from the known source of Pisgah Ridge chert than any other artifact documented by this study. Because the Tehuacana limestone outcrops only about 40 km west of these sites, it might be reasonable to suggest that an additional source of this chert may exist there. However, this is thought to be unlikely because the chipped stone tool collection Table 16-5 ARTIFACT COLLECTIONS EXAMINED FOR PISGAH RIDGE CuerRT ARTIFACTS!

If another source of this material was located in this part of the Tehuacana limestone, its presence in the Limerick site assemblage would be expected. The occurrence of only San Patrice and Dalton types at Lake Fork Reservoir is thought to indicate a very high degree of settlement mobility during this early time period. In addition, the reworking of Dalton point blades is thought to be a trait common to this type (Goodyear 1974), and indicates a long use life for this particular Pisgah Ridge chert specimen. As was noted in Chapter 15, expanding stem dart points are generally diagnostic of the Middle Archaic period in the Richland/Chambers Creek area. In contrast, contracting stem dart points occur primarily in the Late Archaic and Transitional Archaic periods, while arrow points are representative of the Late Prehistoric period. Straight stem dart points are more difficult to place chronologically, as this stem form seems to have been present throughout the Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, and Transitional Archaic periods. The spatial distributions of the Pisgah Ridge chert projectile points of these various forms offer an additional line of evidence for evaluating the hypothesized changes through time in group territorial size and settlement mobility. The distribution of these projectile points fits well with expectations of the model developed from the chert data. With the exception of the San Patrice and Dalton points from Lake Fork Reservoir, the expanding stem dart

Expanding stem dart points have been recovered from sites along the middle Trinity River, Waxahachie Creek, the Navasota River, and tributaries of the central Brazos River (Aquilla and Brookeen Creeks). Volume III, Part Two Progressively smaller clusters are formed by the sites containing contracting stem dart points and arrow points, respectively (Figure 16-6). This apparent contraction of territorial size in comparison to the expanding stem dart point distribution provides support for the interpretation of the chert data. The slight reduction in the size of the arrow point distribution relative to that of contracting stem dart points does not correlate with definable differences in chert percentages between Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic assemblages. However, this reduction in the spatial extent of Pisgah Ridge chert arrow points may indicate smaller territories for Late Prehistoric peoples when compared to the Late Archaic period. The distribution of Pisgah Ridge chert projectile points can be interpreted as indicating reductions in the size of group territories through time. It is thought to be significant for interpretation of the chert percentage data that expanding stem dart points made of Pisgah Ridge chert have been recovered from sites located along tributaries of the central Brazos River. It is precisely in these areas that upland gravels are known to contain a far greater abundance of chert relative to the gravels of the Richland/Chambers Reservoir area. CONCLUSIONS The relative proportions of lithic material types represented in the projectile point and lithic debris assemblages from RCAP sites have been used to demonstrate temporal variations in chert utilization. Chert use was highest during the Middle Archaic period and earlier. Chert use was much lower during the Late Archaic and the earlier part of the Late Prehistoric period. There is some evidence for an increase in the use of chert during the St. Elmo phase (A.D. 1300-1650), but this is based almost exclusively on the projectile point data and is reflected less clearly in the lithic debris. These differences in chert use are interpreted as resulting from reductions in group territorial size and settlement mobility over time. Although chert is present as a minor constituent in the upland gravels of the Project area, it occurs in both greater relative frequency and larger nodule size in gravel deposits to the west of the Richland Creek drainage. Access to chert would have been greater for those prehistoric groups whose exploitive territories included areas located a significant distance to the west of Richland/Chambers Reservoir, specifically those areas along tributaries of the central Brazos River. Reduction in the size of group territories would limit access to this material, and reduction in settlement mobility would tend to reduce the rate at which it was introduced into Project area sites. The lack of definable site components attributable to the Paleo- Indian and Early Archaic periods limits our knowledge of lithic raw material use prior to the Middle Archaic period. Of the few recovered projectile points that are thought to date to these earliest periods, only the two San Patrice specimens are made from materials other than chert. The predominate use of high quality, nonlocal lithic materials is considered diagnostic of the Paleo- Indian period for North Central Texas (Lynott 1981:101; Richner and Bagot 1978:51), and for North America in general (e.g., Goodyear 1979; Meltzer 1984). This pattern of raw material use is invariably interpreted as evidence that Paleo-Indian adaptations were characterized by high settlement mobility over very large territories. Middle Archaic period settlement systems appear to have been characterized by relatively high mobility over territories that were large enough to include both the Project area and areas where substantially greater amounts of chert were locally available. In comparison, Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric peoples confined their settlement systems within significantly smaller territories, and/or made less frequent changes in site locations. The result of these adjustments was a loss of, or less frequent, access to the more abundant chert resources located west of the Project area. Lith Figu Dae Leer iibl cdi bulk chil ABM ET

Lithic Raw Material Utilization Additional evidence for these hypothesized reductions in territorial size was provided by an examination of the regional distribution of Pisgah Ridge chert projectile points. Again, materials assignable to the Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic periods were too limited to allow definite conclusions. However, it is probably significant that the San Patrice and Dalton points from sites at Lake Fork Reservoir were the farthest from the known source of Pisgah Ridge chert of all the artifacts documented by this study. Aside from these two specimens, expanding stem (Middle Archaic) dart points are distributed farthest from the known source, having been recovered from sites along the middle Trinity River, Waxahachie Creek, the Navasota River, and tributaries of the central Brazos River. It is again stressed that the sites associated with these central Brazos River tributaries are within areas where upland gravel deposits contain a far greater 195 abundance of chert than was available in the Richland/Chambers Reservoir area. Progressively smaller clusters are formed by the distributions of contracting stem (Late Archaic) dart points and Late Prehistoric period arrow points, respectively. Although it was not clearly indicated by the chert percentage data, this reduction in the spatial distribution of Pisgah Ridge chert arrow points may indicate smaller territories for Late Prehistoric period peoples relative to the Late Archaic period. Unfortunately, the arrow point sample is rather small and many specimens cannot be assigned to a temporally diagnostic type. For these reasons, their distribution offers little insight into possible variations in territorial size for the three temporal phases that have been defined within the Late Prehistoric period.

LITHIC REDUCTION SYSTEMS AND INTERASSEMBLAGE VARIABILITY: PROBLEMS OF RECOGNITION by Duane E. Peter and Daniel E. McGregor Archaeologists today attempt to extract a maximum amount of cultural information from the stone tools and debitage which comprise the major component of most prehistoric sites. Lithic studies, both of the artifacts themselves and the information they impart concerning technology, have long been recognized as a source of understanding of site function within a settlement- subsistence system. However, the development of analytical frameworks that can provide effective indicators of site function or chronological changes in lithic reduction systems has been less than satisfactory. The formation processes contributing to the archaeological context make the recognition of site function very difficult (Raab 1982:8-12). Nevertheless, the explanatory advantage of being able to relate interassemblage variability to functional differences between sites is a very compelling reason for developing an effective analytical framework. This chapter, therefore, attempts to address the analytical problems associated with the recognition of lithic reduction systems and their relationship to site function. It is proposed that an examination of the entire reduction system as attempted by Collins (1975), Ferring (1979), Ferring and Peter (1982), Johnson (1981), Jefferies (1982), and Morrow (1984) is essential if the study of lithic technology is to serve as a means of processual inference. The characterization of two reduction systems, bifacial core reduction and debitage production, is attempted by means of attribute analysis. Controlled replication studies of these reduction systems are used to evaluate the contribution of the attributes to the recognition of substrategies within the reduction process and the presence of multiple strategies within a single assemblage. The replication data are also used as a comparative data base for the recognition of assemblage-specific reduction strategies within the Richland Creek lithic assemblages. The technological analysis presented here recognizes activity sets such as decortication, internal core reduction, preforming, core blank selection, and tool blank selection which are meaningful in a behavioral context. The examination of these behavioral processes in relation to overall assemblage variability, resource availability, and distance to raw materials generates the basis for assemblage comparisons. The viability of such an approach for recognizing intersite functional differences is examined. PREVIOUS APPROACHES Until the 1970s, one analytical framework dominated the examination of intersite functional differences as reflected in lithic assemblages. Most analytical efforts focused upon the formal tools within an assemblage (Holmes 1894; Muto 1971; Crabtree 1966, 1970) and their relative proportions. Systemic ratios, as proposed by House and Ballenger (1976), have also been used to relate biface use and discard to the lithic reduction activities conducted at a site. House and Ballenger (1976) proposed the Index of Biface Discard (BD) as a means of differentiating sites on the basis of the relative proportion of biface use and discard in relation to early stage reduction. A second ratio, the Index of Early Stage Reduction (ER), proposed by House and Wogaman (1978) reflects the relative proportions of early stage reduction and bifacial thinning. Unfortunately, this latter index is not useful due to the limited definition of a biface thinning flake which was used in the ratio. Bifacial thinning will produce the classic biface thinning flake as defined by House and Ballenger (1976:54); however, numerous other flakes lacking a lipped and/or multifaceted platform will be produced also. Another systemic ratio under consideration concerns use- related artifacts. It has been hypothesized that use-related artifacts may have significant differences in frequency of occurrence between sites. The most viable implication of this hypothesis is related to the occurrence of marginally modified pieces. Functional differences among sites should be reflected in the proportion of marginally modified pieces in relation to the total quantity of chipped stone. It has been postulated that marginally modified tools, assumed to be tools of expediency, should occur in larger proportions at sites within a foraging system which is highly mobile or at extraction sites within a less mobile, logistically oriented system. The potential for cultural interpretation of lithic debitage was initially explored through the efforts of researchers such as Jelinek (1975, 1977), Munday (1976, 1977) and Collins (1975). These initial studies stimulated a variety of approaches to characterizing reduction activities represented by archaeological assemblages. Frequencies of debitage types have often been examined in relation 197

198 to hypothesized models of stone too! manufacture (Fish 1981:374- 386) as a means of inferring the reduction activities represented within an assemblage. Attributes such as weight, platform type, amount of dorsal cortex, and numerous size dimensions have also been examined (Katz 1976; Pokotylo 1978; Bouey 1983:39-42) in an effort to interpret the tool production or maintenance activities conducted at a site. Many studies (Raab, Cande, and Stahle 1979; Stahle and Dunn 1982; Magne and Pokotylo 1981) have also sought to characterize the reduction sequence or trajectory of a given assemblage on the basis of a single variable or a small set of attributes of the debitage alone. These approaches have immediate appeal, for they reduce the variability to a single or very small set of variables which reduce the analysis necessary for valid results. Unfortunately, the statistics involved in such an approach allow significant latitude in the interpretation of the results. Their own test cases are not always classified as accurately as one would like (Stahle and Dunn 1982:92; Magne and Pokotylo 1981:46). Unfortunately, most of these studies have failed to address the problems associated with the recognition of site function through lithic studies. The models of lithic reduction systems and their expected by-products frequently reflect a lack of knowledge concerning lithic mechanics (Raab, Cande, and Stahle 1979:176) or a lack of understanding concerning the expected by-products of a particular technology (Morrow 1984:24). These models are also largely hypothetical; consequently, there is some question concerning how well they reflect the actual prehistoric technology. The "product groups" defined by Collins (1975:25) and the “stages” recognized by Bradley (1975:7-10) are necessarily inferred and require sophisticated judgments on the part of the analyst. Models of bifacial core reduction and debitage production systems and the expected characteristics of their products are similarly inferred. Replication studies (Burton 1980:131-148; Patterson and Sollberger 1978:103-112; Raab, Cande and Stahle 1979:167-182; Stahle and Dunn 1982:84-97; Patterson 1982:50-58; Magne and Pokotylo 1981:34-47) designed to provide realistic models of the reduction process have been infrequent. Such studies are essential, for they provide an excellent model for expectations concerning particular reduction strategies within the prehistoric assemblage. It is realized, however, that such replication models do not represent the only strategies available to the prehistoric knapper; rather, they merely serve as a source of comparative data for the development of realistic models. The interpretation of site function is further confounded by the formation processes affecting the archaeological context. This is especially true for those assemblages which are the result of activities from numerous occupations. The success of any analytical framework in yielding effective indicators of differing site functions is therefore dependent upon good temporal control. Unless radical differences in raw material use or the reduction systems is known to correlate with given temporal spans, detailed analysis of the debitage from a mixed assemblage will be unproductive. GOALS OF THE RCAP ANALYSIS It remains to be determined, however, if lithic assemblages will yield effective indicators of differing site functions. It has been a working hypothesis of the RCAP that such is the case (see Chapter 1). Following the lead of Raab, Cande, and Stahle (1979), bivariate graphs of flake dimensions were proposed for the placement of the components within the manufacturing trajectory. The flaws within this approach were quickly realized (Ferring and Peter 1982:36- 44; Bruseth et al. 1983:451-455) and alternative approaches were examined. As others have noted (Collins 1975; Ferring and Peter | 1982; Johnson 1981; Jefferies 1982; Morrow 1984), the analysis of lithic reduction systems depends on an understanding of the entire reduction process. Lithic reduction is a cultural process patterned by the desired function of the finished tools, the type and Volume III, Part Two size of available raw materials, the cultural tradition of the flintknapper, and the principles of fracture mechanics. An understanding of this cultural process may be achieved through the recognition of the kinds of reduction systems present and the nature of those systems relative to intra-assemblage variability in cores, debitage, debris, and tools. Recognition of reduction systems is best achieved though the delineation of assemblage- specific reduction strategies (Bradley 1975). A reduction strategy, or a planned order of detachments designed to produce an intentional product, is actually composed of several substrategies. These substrategies (i... decortication, preforming, internal reduction, error recovery, and tool blank selection) are processual activity sets which are directed by decisions of the flintknapper, and are important behavioral domains for assemblage analysis and comparison. The traditional approach to characterizing reduction systems has been to focus on @ priori artifact types as the units of analysis. Such an approach, however, fails to recognize the relative positions of artifacts within the reduction system. It is only through the study of attribute relationships both within and between artifact types that we will begin to understand reduction strategies and their relationships to the larger behavioral system. Unfortunately, archaeologists have not been successful in isolating relevant attributes in lithic assemblages. A lack of understanding of lithic reduction mechanics and little interest in conducting replication studies with such goals in mind have contributed to this problem. Therefore, a replication study of two reduction systems, a bifacial core reduction and a debitage production system, was conducted on raw materials similar to those available to the prehistoric occupants of the RCAP area. It was reasoned that the attribute analysis of the replicated, staged reduction of raw materials would reveal those attributes most suited for the recognition of the reduction strategies employed at a site or the assignment of artifacts to particular substrategies (i.e., decortication, preforming, etc.) within a reduction strategy. The study of attribute relationships permits the investigation of dependent variables such as flake shape in relation to technological attributes such as amount of cortex or platform preparation. This process reveals important reduction relationships which are not dependent on the frequency of the reduction process. If certain attribute relationships within the replicated debris can be used to correctly identify the stage of reduction and/or the reduction strategy, then the Richland Creek lithic assemblages can be compared to the replication data to aid the recognition of assemblage-specific reduction strategies. Of course, such an approach requires the assumption that similar strategies were employed prehistorically. The viability of this approach for recognizing intersite functional differences will be evaluated. Our ability to recognize multiple reduction strategies within an assemblage may also be evaluated through the replication study. The proposed analytical framework involves more than the attribute analysis of the debitage and debris alone. The recognition of the reduction strategy depends upon the analysis of the early and late aborted bifaces and all finished tools as well. Although the recognition of the tool blank form is not always possible, the size dimensions and the technological attributes remaining often reveal the position of the tool within the reduction strategy. Systemic indices concerning relative proportions of cores and bifaces in relation to the lithic debris are also examined to determine their utility in differentiating site function versus that of the attribute analysis. This analytical framework is applied to a selected group of assemblages from the RCAP. This selection reflects the need to limit detailed analysis to a reasonable amount of lithic debris and the realization that no analytical scheme will be effective in differentiating site function if the assemblage is from a context in which several occupations or activities are intermixed. It is essential, therefore, to select assemblages which represent occupational activities from a limited time span. After all, the detailed analysis of numerous assemblages which cannot be placed within a temporal framework will not produce interpretable results. Of the assemblages investigated, only five exhibit significant samples from known temporal periods. These five i ORE <D PR Ee BSAC s SIP Pp Anas veunet RDEeRP OR RUAA a ae ae ae ae. oe.

ee Tee Lithie Reduction Strategies assemblages represent a spectrum of occupation from the Middle Archaic period to the St. Elmo phase (A.D. 1300 - 1650). The Hardy site (41FT200) represents primarily a Middle Archaic occupation. Unfortunately, a distinctive Late Archaic assemblage was not available for study. The remaining assemblages are of the Late Prehistoric period. The Irvine site (41NV182) represents the Richiand Creek phase (A.D. 700 - 900). The Round Prairie phase (A.D. 900-1300) is represented by the block excavation of House 1 at Bird Point Island (41FT201). The later St. Elmo phase (A.D. 1300 - 1650) is best represented by the assemblage recovered from the western half of the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) (Figure 17-1). The upper three levels of the Perry site (41FT193) were also included in this analysis as representative of the Late Prehistoric period overall. The selection of these assemblages provides adequate samples from known temporal contexts. Variation in site complexity ranging from a possible sedentary hamlet (Bird Point Island) to a short term foraging camp (Perry) also provides an important functional framework for an evaluation of the proposed analytical schemes. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK The analytical framework for the RCAP assemblages recognizes lithic reduction as a behavioral system in which a special set of raw materials, skills, and functions are involved. The purpose of this analytical framework is to reveal the kinds of reduction systems present and the activity sets represented by assemblage variability in cores, debitage, debris, and tools. As Collins (1975) has noted, the recognition of “product groups” or activity sets is essential to the interpretation of the adaptive role of lithic technology within a cultural system. The proposed analytical framework focuses on processual activity sets which are common to almost all reduction systems. A reduction system necessarily involves choices or decisions on the part of the knapper. The planned order of detachments to systematically produce intentional products comprises a reduction strategy. The strategy, in turn, is made up of a number of activity sets, such as decortication and preforming, internal core reduction, and tool blank selection which are important behavioral domains for assemblage comparisons. The activity sets or substrategies recognized within this analysis are as follows: CORE BLANK SELECTION The choice of core blanks is largely dependent on the availability and form of raw materials, the shape of the desired product, and the technique of the flintknapper. Two forms of core blanks are recognized. Primary core blanks are those made on naturally occurring nodules or cobbles. These may be either bifacial or debitage cores (Figure 17-2). Secondary core blanks are made on flakes detached from either primary bifacial or debitage cores. The use of secondary core blanks was likely quite common, since a flake approaches the lenticular shape of a biface; consequently, the effort needed to produce a biface and the potential for errors are both reduced. The recognition of the two forms of core blanks is dependent upon the stage of reduction at the time of discard. Many cores have been reduced to the point that the blank form is “indeterminate.” Those blanks which exhibit cortex on several surfaces and the shape of the original cobble are designated as "primary" core blanks. The recognition of secondary blanks depends on the presence of a platform and an associated bulb of percussion. DECORTICATION/PREFORMING Decortication and preforming are achieved simultaneously during the initial stages of reduction. Decortication is actually incidental to the primary goal of bifacial edging or preforming. 199 Preforming is essential to the establishment of morphological homogeneity of the blank so that the removal of flakes of predictable size and shape may be accomplished. Since the morphological variability of the decortication/preforming flakes is dependent upon the morphology of the raw material, it is assumed that the morphological variability of these flakes will be great. Because of the simultaneous accomplishment of these two processes, it is also assumed that the presence of cortex on a flake is good a priori evidence of its removal during decortication (Ferring 1979). It should be emphasized, however, that the recognition of interassemblage variability of this substrategy focuses on the patterns of decortication and preforming rather than the frequencies of artifact classes. Frequencies of artifact classes may reflect differing portions of the reduction process, but the recognition of significant technological differences can be recognized best through patterns of attribute relationships. The technological attributes chosen for this study (Appendix G) permit an examination of the relationships of flake dimensions to platform preparation, error recovery, and amount of cortex. INTERNAL CORE REDUCTION The previous substrategy of decortication/preforming has removed most of the cortex and reduced the morphological variability of the core blank; therefore, it is assumed that the by- products of internal core reduction will exhibit very little cortex and will exhibit less variability in morphology than the decortication/preforming debris. Of course, flakes without cortex are not limited to internal core reduction. Flakes, especially small ones, may be removed any time after decortication begins. As with the decortication/ preforming flakes, attribute relationships are examined to infer patterns of the reduction process. ERRORS AND ERROR RECOVERY Hinged or overpassed terminations are assumed to be the result of insufficient or excessive loadings, respectively. Flakes exhibiting such terminations may have an effect on the size and shape variability of the assemblage. The patterns of error recovery may also be studied by examining flakes which have hinge or step scars on their dorsal surface. TOOL BLANK SELECTION Although most bifacial tools have been reduced to the point where recognition of the blank form is impossible, many aborted bifaces and unifacial tools exhibit evidence of the original blank form. The size and shape of the finished tools also reveal the minimum blank size necessary for the production of those tools. The size relationships between the tools and the debris at the site often reveal whether or not debitage production was necessary or whether the debris incidental to bifacial reduction was sufficiently large to be used as tool blanks. The examination of attribute relationships within the above substrategies should reveal the kinds of reduction systems represented within the prehistoric assemblages. Archaeologists (Skinner and Gallagher 1974; Lynott and Peter 1977; Lynott 1978; Henry et al. 1980) have long recognized the possibility of two reduction systems being primarily responsible for the production of bifacial tools within North Central Texas. It has been assumed that the large dart points of the Archaic period were the result of bifiacial core reduction and the smaller arrow points of the Late Prehistoric were produced from secondary core or flake blanks removed from debitage cores. The presence of numerous bifacial blank/preforms within prehistoric assemblages indicates that bifacial reduction of either primary or secondary cores was prevalent.

Figure 17-2. Schematic model of reduction-systems and their respective strategies (after Ferring and Peter 1982: 9.4). The two reduction systems of concern here do not reflect significant technological differences; after all, both involve bifacial thinning of a primary or secondary blank. The bifacial core reduction system (Figure 17-2) involves the reduction of the core itself as the intended product. The spalls removed from the core are necessary by-products of intentional tool production; therefore, they are waste flakes or "debris." Many of these waste flakes, however, may be suitable secondary blanks for the production of unifacial tools Debitage production systems, on the other hand, involve the production of flakes as the intended product. The resulting core and the unsuitable flakes generated while producing the desired flake blanks are the by-products. Success in distinguishing the by-products of both reduction systems, however, has unfortunately been judged on the basis of the presence or absence of temporal separation of the two systems. Furthermore, hypothetical models have also been used to predict the expected products of these two systems. Consequently, which attributes or attribute relationships are most critical to our understanding of the prehistoric technology of different reduction systems remain to be determined. A detailed study of replicated bifacial core reduction and debitage production systems was proposed as an approach to this continuing problem of system differentiation. REPLICATION STUDY REPLICATION METHODOLOGY The objective of the replication study was to reproduce bifacial artifacts by alternative reduction strategies within a controlled experimental! situation. Such a controlled experiment permits an objective comparison of the by-products of bifacial core reduction and debitage production. As noted earlier, an understanding of such by-products is frequently assumed in the literature, when in truth, the sources of variability in debitage assemblages are very poorly understood. To gain an understanding of such variability in relation to the stages of reduction, certain sources of variability must be controlled. Raw material type and size, the knapper's abilities, and the sequence of flake removal are the most critical 201 variables. Of course, the reproduction of bifacial artifacts represented within the archaeological assemblages is also very important. Failure to control these variables will result in a data base which is not relevant to the archaeological assemblages under study. Eleven cobbles (6 quartzite, 5 chert) were initially selected for reduction. Extreme difficulties in systematically removing flakes from four quartzite cobbles resulted in their abandonment. Only cobbles thought to be similar in size to those used by the prehistoric inhabitants of the Richland/Chambers Creek area were utilized, Archaic dart points from the RCAP assemblages served as models for the replication experiment. Ideally, arrow points should have served as models also; however, time constraints did not allow additional replication. The lack of replicated arrow point production is not as critical as it may seem, for the debris from the dart point production provides a very good comparative data base by which to judge the technological parameters of the Late Prehistoric assemblages. A single flint knapper, J. B. Sollberger, bifacially reduced the flake blanks or cobble cores. A quartzite hammer stone, an antler billet, and an antler flaker were used to reduce the cores. Control over the sequence of debitage removal was attained by placing each flake or group of flakes produced by a given process (e.g., platform preparation) in a numbered plastic bag. All debris, even the dust and shatter, was systematically collected from the swept concrete floor. COBBLE REDUCTION Four of the seven specimens (Table 17-1) were bifacially reduced into a single tool. Only one specimen, a chert cobble, was reduced to a finished dart point (Figure 17-3a). Another chert cobble was reduced to a preform (Figure 17-3b) before snapping and hinging of pressure flakes made further thinning of the specimen impossible. The fracture characteristics of the remaining chert cobble prevented systematic thinning; consequently, an aborted biface (Late Stage) with a small amount of cortex was the final product (Figure 17-3e). The removal of thinning flakes from the quartzite cobble was equally difficult. The repeated snapping of flakes resulted in a large, thick biface with no cortex remaining (Figure 17-3f). The failure to produce a finished tool from each cobble raises questions concerning the comparability of the resulting debitage. The full range of debitage from the quartzite cobble is obviously unavailable for examination; nevertheless, the data concerning early reduction and initial thinning elements may be compared to the archaeological assemblages. The chert debitage, on the other hand, is representative of the entire bifacial core reduction sequence. Although dart points were the desired product, the various stages within the reduction sequence are well represented. Such a sample should permit an evaluation of the reduction processes contributing to assemblage variability. FLAKE BLANK REDUCTION One quartzite cobble from the Richland/Chambers Creek area and two chert cobbles from the “Uvalde gravels” found east of Aquilla Lake were used for the production of the flake blanks. All flakes removed from the cobbles in order to produce a satisfactory flake blank were collected. Reduction of the cobbles ceased upon the production of a flake blank satisfactory for further reduction. The size of the quartzite cobble and one chert cobble was similar to that likely used by the prehistoric inhabitants of the Richland/ Chambers Creek area. The remaining chert cobble was much larger; however, the selected flake blank was similar to that from the smaller cobble (Table 17-1). All of the flake blanks were reduced to finished dart points (Figure 17-3c,d,g). Reduction of an additional quartzite flake blank was attempted, but satisfactory flakes could not be detached. In retrospect, it would have been desirable to have reduced the

Comparability of a debitage production system with a core reduction system, however, should not focus on the production of the flake blanks alone. Recognition of a debitage production system would be quite easy if flake blanks were the end product, It is the variability of the debitage produced during the blank reduction which is most critical to the recognition of the two reduction systems. ANALYSIS OF REPLICATION DEBRIS As discussed above, several analytical schemes have been designed to infer lithic reduction stages from debitage attributes. These analytical frameworks have ranged in focus from a very limited number of attributes (Raab, Cande and Stahle 1979; Stahle and Dunn 1982; Morrow 1984:20-28) to a multivariate examination of an exhaustive attribute list (Katz 1976; Pokotylo 1978). This spectrum of analytical frameworks has had one objective, however: the discovery of a limited number of attributes that will allow the systematic analysis and classification of archaeological collections. Like the previous analyses, this analysis is exploratory in nature concerning the relative worth of the selected attributes for recognizing reduction strategies. Unlike the previous attempts, it is readily recognized that the variability within a reduction system is not likely to be characterized by a single attribute, but rather by a set of attributes which define classificatory units which are meaningful in a behavioral context. Consequently, the interreiationships of flake dimensions (length, size, etc.) and technological attributes (platform type, dorsal scar pattern) are examined for patterning within the reduction sequence. CORE REDUCTION DEBRIS Production of the bifacial core tools produced a total of 870 pieces of chert debris and 383 pieces of quartzite debris. Table 17- 2 reveals that the percentages of debris types are remarkably similar for the two raw material types. The lower relative frequency of whole quartzite flakes and corresponding higher frequency of quartzite shatter is not unexpected given the difficulties in knapping quartzite. The high percentages of shatter from the reduction of both raw materials suggest that most analysts’ reliance on whole flakes for characterizing a reduction strategy may be biased. Recent efforts (Magne and Pokotylo 1981; Stahle and Dunn 1982) to recognize reduction stages within prehistoric assemblages have incorporated all debris; however, the contribution of shatter and proximal flakes to the resulting size distribution remains to be evaluated. Decortication and Preforming - During the replication study, the knapper made us aware that decortication is not a primary goal of the first stage of bifacial reduction, but is largely incidental to the processes of bifacial edging and preforming. Nevertheless, the presence of cortex on flake debris is often assumed to indicate removal during the early stages of preforming (Ferring 1979). An examination of the cortical flakes removed during the reduction of cobble 2 reveals that the last cortical flake was removed when almost two-thirds of the reduction sequence was completed. This position of a cortical flake suggests that decortication may occur throughout much of the reduction sequence and that its usefulness as an indicator of early stage reduction is suspect. It should be noted, however, that such late occurrences of cortical flakes are not statistically important. Seventy-one percent (n = 27) of the cortical flakes from cobble 2 had been removed when 30% of the reduction sequence had been completed. Therefore, the occurrence of cortical flakes later in the reduction sequence is quite sporadic (n = 11). Although these late occurring cortical flakes increase the range of variability of the cortical flakes, it is equally apparent that the cortical classes provide an important framework for characterizing initial preforming. Cortex appears on 22.6% of the chert cobble debris and on 36% of the quartzite cobble debris. The difference may be attributed to the failure to reduce the quartzite cobble to a finished biface. Since only one of the chert cobbles was completely reduced, the frequency value for chert cortical flakes also is inflated. It is apparent that the relative frequencies related to cortex: removal depend upon a number of factors (degree of reduction, amount of cortex on cobble, etc.). The usual reliance upon frequencies of artifact classes alone for the recognition of interassemblage variability may be productive (Jefferies 1982); however, the archaeological context is often a palimpsest of behavioral activities which are not so easily separated and understood. Technological differences among such sites are best recognized by examining the patterns of decortication and preforming.

Products of the replication experiments: products of bifacial core reduction include specimens (a) Core #2, (b) Core #10, (e) Core #8, and (f) Core #4; flake blanks were used for the production of specimens (c) Core #5 (d) Core #1, and (g) Core #3. Variability within the preforming stage of reduction for the cobbles is summarized in Figure 17-4 and Table 17-3. Variability of the flake dimensions and size and shape indices was analyzed by means of the BREAKDOWN procedure of SPSS* (SPSS* User's Guide, 2nd ed.; 1986: 373-383). Examination of the bivariate graph of flake shape (length/width) in relation to amount of cortex (Figure 17-4) reveals that flake shape is relatively constant throughout the reduction sequence of a chert cobble. Analysis of variance results showed no significance between group variability (F = 19.81, dif. = .0000). The reduction of the quartzite cobble on the other hand, produced greater flake shape variability (Figure 17-4). Unfortunately, the significance of this variability is diminished by the small number of flakes involved, for the production of only three short flakes (Mean Shape = .6) comprises the entire 51 to 75% cortical class. Flake shape is, therefore, relatively constant throughout the reduction trajectory of either a chert or quartzite nodule. Flake length is most often slightly greater than flake width for the chert debris. The consistently smaller shape indices of the quartzite flakes reflect the less desirable flaking properties of quartzite. The flake size indices (length x width x thickness/100) of both the chert and quartzite debris exhibit significant variability in relation to the amount of cortex. The debris from the quartzite cobbles exhibits an almost linear relationship between the two attributes, for the flakes get smaller with each decrease in amount of cortex. The chert debris exhibits a similar relationship of variability (F = 19.8; Sig. = .000); however, the attribute relationship is not so linear. The flakes exhibiting the most cortex are not necessarily the largest (Figure 17-4). Edging or platform preparation contribute to this variability. Small flakes removed by these processes early in the reduction sequence may exhibit any amount of cortex from 0 to 100%. Therefore, the amount of

Similarly, size variability within a cortical class, especially that of the interior flakes (C.V. = 2.25), is so great that size alone will not allow the confident placement of a flake within the reduction sequence. Size and amount of cortex together, though, allow a reasonable approximation of the reduction sequence. The joint distribution of the cortical classes and the technological attributes was initially examined by means of the CROSSTABS procedure (SPSS* User's Guide, 2nd ed., 1986). Although cell frequencies were frequently too low for statistical evaluations of the associations, patterns of association may be noted. A comparison of cortical class with platform type was of particular interest due to the reliance of many archaeologists (Morgan and Raspet 1979; Johnson 1981; Morrow 1984) on such a oe & Mean Flake Length (mm) Mean Flake Thickness (mm) iN 0 Percentage of Cortex 100- 76 7§- 50- 25- 0 100- 51 26 1 16 wk co © Mean Flake Width (mm) S Mean Flake Shape Index bn Qo 0 Percentage of Cortex 100- 76 75- 50- 25- 90 §1 26 1 100- 76 ——— Chert Nodule ----- Quartzite Nodule matrix to characterize reduction assemblages within the Southeast. An examination of the cross matrix reveals that the platform types are not limited to any one cortical class (Table 17-3). Nevertheless, those flakes with greater than 50% cortex exhibit a high proportion of cortex platforms while the remaining cortical flakes exhibit primarily single faceted platforms. Multifaceted platforms are more common on the interior flakes. Such an interrelationship is as expected in a bifacial reduction sequence. Of course, the platform types are not limited to a particular stage of reduction, but the trend is evident. This pattern is similar to the cross matrix pattern postulated by Carol Morrow (1984:20-24) for the bifacial reduction of small river gravels.

Cell values represent COUNT, EXP VAL, and COL PCT, 2 atl values from SPSS croestabs output. Cell Values represent COUNT and PERCENT gravels, The converted cross matrix (Table 17-4) reveals that the cells along the diagonal contain more flakes than expected by chance. Flakes exhibiting cortex are more likely to have cortical or single faceted platforms. Multifaceted platforms are more common on interior flakes. Although cells 2 and 9 add unwanted noise to the pattern, this cross matrix does parallel the expectations of Morrow (1984:20-24). Further comparison of the matrices suggests that the complete reduction sequence is present within Morrow's sample. However, the positive loading of cell 3 flakes in Morrow's sample, together with the very high proportion of cortical flakes (58.1%), suggests that not all cobbles were completely reduced to finished bifaces. Our replication results indicate that the flakes with cortex only on their platforms do not occur more frequently than expected. Furthermore, cortical debris makes up only: 22.5% of the assemblage. Therefore, it is suggested that Morrow's sample possibly represents the initial reduction of gravels to blanks or preforms as the predominant reduction process. Of course, the verification of this hypothesis is dependent upon the replicated reduction of small river gravels, since our replication cobbles appear to be larger than those used to produce the tools within Morrow's (1984:26) assemblage. Nevertheless, the quartzite cobble reduction (Table 17-1) which produced an aborted biface (Morrow's Preform 2) supports the above stated hypothesis also. The replicated debris closely resembles Morrow's (1984:24) assemblage. Flakes with cortex on their platforms only occur more often than expected and the percentage of cortical flakes is significantly higher than that produced by the chert cobble reduction. Such characteristics appear to be representative of early stage reduction activities. The relationships between cortical class and dorsal scar patterns are very straightforward. Unidirectional and perpendicular patterns dominate both classes, with tridirectional patterns more common on flakes with lesser amounts of cortex. The. quartzite sample differs very slightly with complete dorsal cortex cover better represented and multidirectional patterns unrepresented. Internal Core Reduction Flakes without cortex present on their dorsal surfaces are the predominant by-product of bifacial core reduction. Their low mean size index (Figure 17-4) reflects their position within the reduction strategy. As noted earlier, however, the size variability of the interior flake population is exceedingly large compared to the cortical classes (Figure 17-4). Many of the cortical flakes easily fall within the range of size variability exhibited by the interior flakes. Such overlap raises serious questions concerning dependence on a single attribute, such as flake size, as a discriminating variable to differentiate assemblages. The joint distributions of the interior flakes with the technological attributes are particularly interesting given Morrow's (1984) previous research. Without the apparent benefit of replication data, Morrow (1984:24) interprets the flakes with platform cortex but without dorsal cortex in this manner: Table 17-4 PLATFORM TYPE AND AMOUNT OF DORSAL CORTEX ON DEBRIS PRODUCED BY BIFACIAL CorE Repuction! i 2 Row 0 1-50 51-100 Total ee Platform Type Cortex »” 29 11 3 43 33.3 8.6 1.1 14.1 20.8 42.9 16.2 Single Faceted 46 20 0 66 51.1 13.2 1.7 22.3 37.7 0.0 24.8 Multifaceted 80 li 3 94 72.8 18.7 2.5 38.8 20.8 42.9 35.3 Crushed §1 11 1 63 43.8 12.6 1.7 24.8 20.8 14.3 23.7 Column Total 206 53 7 266 17.4 19.9 2.6 100.0 1 Cortical classes have been converted to format used by Morrow (1984:21) 2 All values from SPSS crosstabs output; cell values represent COUNT, EXP VAL, and COL PCT

Lithic Reduction Strategies These Cell 3 flakes cannot be logically related to any bifacial production and/or maintenance activities, and may represent some other facet of the techno- logical system. It is suggested that these flakes may have been produced as the result of flaking activities not directed towards the production of bifacial tools. They may be chipping debris from the production of other types of tools, or may themselves have been the focus of production. Morrow is clearly interpreting flakes with cortex present on their platforms only as “specialized flakes.” Our replication sample, however, reveals that such flakes are a very common product of bifacial core reduction. Such flakes (Table 17-3) comprise 10.9% of the total debris produced by bifacial reduction. The replication material clearly demonstrates that our logical assumptions concerning the by-products of bifacial reduction must be verified rather than assumed to be fact. As expected, a multifaceted platform is the predominant platform type for the interior chert flakes. Nevertheless, single faceted and cortex platforms remain well represented. Such is the case for the interior quartzite flake assemblage in which cortex and single faceted platforms are predominant. Three factors likely contributed to this underrepresentation: (1) the incomplete reduction of the cobble limited the proportion of interior flakes produced; (2), the analyst's ability to clearly distinguish multiple flake scars on quartzite material is hampered by the coarse texture of the quartzite which renders the delineation of individual flake scars more difficult; and (3), the greater tensile strength of quartzite may reduce the need for extensive platform preparation to avoid platform crushing. Unfortunately, the relative contribution of these thrée factors cannot be presently evaluated. Error Recovery Error recovery is very poorly represented in the replication assemblage. This is especially interesting since error‘recovery has been noted in prehistoric assemblages (Ferring and Peter 1982). Given the relatively high percentage of snap terminations on the quartzite debris (Table 17-3), one would expect some need for error recovery; however, evidence of such a process does not survive on the dorsal surfaces of the debris. The more knappable chert exhibits a minimal amount of error recovery with hinges being the most common termination form other than the usual feathered termination (Table 17-3). SUMMARY The above analysis of the core debris reveals that the amount of dorsal cortex, platform type, and flake size are the best indicators of the reduction sequence. No one attribute, however, reflects the degree of reduction performed. It is the interaction of these attributes which best characterizes bifacial core reduction. Dorsal scar patterns, on an intuitive basis, should also reflect the reduction sequence. Perhaps the difficulty of recognizing the states of this attribute as defined for this study obscures the expected patterning. A simple count of the dorsal flake scars may be more useful as indicated by Magne and Pokotylo's study (1981:34-42). However, examination of their Figure 2, reveals that dorsal scar count alone provided for the separation of only the initial decortication flakes from the subsequent flakes. The relationship of dorsal scar patterns to the stages of reduction is therefore not as direct as often assumed. FLAKE BLANK REDUCTION DEBRIS Production of the flake blank tools yielded a total of 1692 pieces of chert and 351 pieces of quartzite. As with the cobble 207 reduction debris, the debris types produced by the reduction of the quartzite and chert flake blanks are almost identical in relative frequency (Table 17-2). The higher absolute frequency of the chert debris is due to the greater size of the chert blanks—over twice as large as the quartzite blank. Nonetheless, the mass of the individual quartzite flakes is much greater than that of the chert, for almost five times as many chert flakes were needed to reduce twice as much mass as that of the quartzite flakes. Once again, the predominance of shatter as the primary by-product of lithic reduction is apparent. Decortication and Preforming The relative frequencies of cortical flakes for both raw material types (Table 17-5) are significantly lower than that produced by bifacial core reduction. It should be noted, however, that the replication study did not include the reduction of the entire cobble into several flake blanks. The production of additional flake blanks would produce greater quantitites of cortical flakes. Magne and Pokotylo's (1981:45) study indicates that debitage production may produce an assemblage which is 33% cortical flakes. This figure is comparable to that produced by bifacial core reduction. Variability within the preforming stage of flake blank reduction is summarized in Figure 17-4 and Table 17-5. As with the bifacial core reduction debris, flake shape is most variable within the mid-range categories of cortex. Nonetheless, the analysis of variance results show no significant variability between groups (F = .48, SIG. = .62 - quartzite; F = 1.65, SIG. = .19 - chert). It is apparent that flake shape is quite constant through the reduction sequence of either bifacial core or flake blank reduction. The bivariate graph of flake size indices in relation to amount of cortex demonstrates that the debris from flake blank reduction exhibits a pattern very similar to that of cobble reduction. The size of the flakes is merely smaller throughout the reduction trajectory. Of particular note is the distinctly smaller size of the two initial classes of cortical flakes (100-76, 75-51%). If the production of the flake blanks was conducted at a location other than that of their bifacial thinning one would be able to detect flake blank reduction within a prehistoric assemblage containing no other reduction system. Those flakes exhibiting more than 75% dorsal cortex are actually no larger than most of the flakes exhibiting no dorsal cortex. The effect of the knappability of raw material may be exhibited in the remainder of the bivariate graphs relating flake dimensions to amount of cortex present. It is apparent that tHe quartzite flakes exhibiting the most cortex are always very small compared to the chert flakes exhibiting similar amounts of cortex. The tenacity of the quartzite apparently requires preliminary edging and platform preparation for the removal of the larger secondary flakes. The reduction of the chert flake blanks, however, begins with the removal of long thick flakes. As the amount of cortex decreases, so do the flake dimensions, except for a slight increase in the 1 - 25% cortex class. Perhaps, the most telling attribute concerning the effect of the raw material on the dimensions of the flake assemblage is platform thickness. The mechanics of lithic reduction indicate that platform thickness should be closely related to flake size (Ferring and Peter 1982:38- 39). Even though platform thicknesses of the two material types are very similar, there are significant differences in the lengths and thicknesses of the corresponding cortical classes. Raw material differences are most likely responsible for this variability. The cross matrices of cortical classes and the technological attributes reveal a reduction pattern similar to that of the bifacial core reduction. The platform types exhibit the expected pattern of cortical and single faceted platforms in association with cortical flakes. Cortical and unidirectional dorsal scar patterns are most common on the flakes exhibiting 51 - 100% cortex, while unidirectional and perpendicular patterns appear on the majority of the remaining cortical flakes (Table 17-5).

Cell Values represent COUNT and PERCENT Internal Core Reduction ; As expected, interior flakes comprise the major portion of the debris produced by flake blank reduction. Contrary to expectations, single faceted platforms remain the dominant platform type, while multifaceted platforms follow in relative abundance (Table 17-5). Cortical platforms are even more frequent than multifaceted platforms within the quartzite sample. The greater amount of cortex on the quartzite flake blank may have contributed to this relative abundance of cortical platforms on interior flakes. Dorsal scar patterns on both the chert and quartzite debris are similarly at odds with expectations. Unidirectional and bidirectional patterns remain as the predominant patterns. It is apparent that the increasingly small size of the flake precludes more complex scar patterns. The dimensions of the interior flakes (Figure 17-4) are the smallest within the reduction sequence. The chert debris is particularly interesting, for the interior flake dimensions are remarkably similar to the flakes exhibiting 26 - 50% cortex. Those flakes exhibiting less than 25% cortex are larger than either of these classes. The chert interior flakes, however, exhibit a smaller range of variability than any of the cortical flakes. The quartzite interior flakes, on the other hand, are the most variable of any flake class. The large size of the chert flake blanks likely contributed to this dissimilarity between the raw material types. Error Recovery As with bifacial core reduction, evidence of error recovery is almost non-existent. Terminations, other than normal feathered terminations, occur on only 10% of the replicated debris. The vast majority of these terminations (hinged, blocky, and snap) occur on the products of internal core reduction (Table 17-5). It is interesting that so few of these termination scars are observable on the dorsal surfaces of subsequent flakes. SUMMARY The analysis of the flake blank debris reveals interrelationships between the amount of cortex and technological attributes which are very similar to those within the bifacial core reduction debris. The most apparent difference between the by-products of the two reduction systems is the overall difference in flake size. The dimensions (thickness, length, width, platform thickness) of the flake blank debris (Figure 17-4) are consistently smaller than those of the bifacial core reduction debris. The relationship between the size dimensions and the cortical classes of the flake blank debris, however, is not as linear as that of the cobble debris. Those flakes exhibiting no cortex or greater than 75% cortex are quite small while the flakes exhibiting 51 to 75% cortex are significantly larger. The chert flakes exhibiting 1-25% dorsal cortex are also larger in relationship to the remaining cortical classes. This relationship may reflect the larger size of the original flake blank. Although the overall differences in the size of the by-products of the reduction systems are real, the recognition of such differences within an archaeological context may not be an easy task. A very clear understanding of the size variability of the raw materials used by the inhabitants of a site is necessary. It is also apparent that the reduction systems will be recognizable only if they are recovered in distinct areas or assemblages. The intermixing of the by-products of these processes will make their recognition a very difficult, if not impossible, task if the debris alone is examined. ANALYSIS OF THE RCAP ASSEMBLAGES As noted earlier, five assemblages representing the Middle Archaic period and phases within the Late Prehistoric period were chosen for analysis. These assemblages represent the most adequate artifact samples from these temporal periods. The debitage from all five assemblages is examined. CORE BLANK SELECTION Cores recovered from all five sites are included in this analysis. The cores from these sites represent the entire core assemblage recovered from the site areas selected for detailed analysis. The blank/preforms of all five assemblages are also discussed in this section, for they often retain characteristics diagnostic of the original core blank. The raw materials represented in the core assemblages from these sites vary considerably. The greatest variety of raw material is present within the Archaic component of the Hardy site (41FT200). Quartzite, chert, silicified wood, and Pisgah Ridge chert are the predominant raw materials (Table 17-6). Raw material variability is similarly great at the Irvine site (41NV182); however, quartzite is the predominant material used. The two

The bifacial cores or blank/preforms exhibit a similar trend in raw material usage (Table 17-7). Interestingly, chert is as well represented as quartzite in the early and late aborted biface samples from the Hardy site (41FT200). The later assemblages (Irvine [41NV 182], Bird Point Island (41FT201], Perry [41FT193], and Little Cedar Creek [41NV173]) exhibit predominantly quartzite blank/preforms. Silicified wood and Pisgah Ridge chert are not represented at all in the later occupations. Of the 104 cores and blank/preforms recovered from the Hardy site (41FT200), 43.3% were flaked beyond the point that the core blank form could be recognized. It is apparent, however, that primary cores (nodules, cobbles) are a primary source for debitage cores, for only three flake blanks were recognized within the entire core sample. Secondary cores are also poorly represented within the blank/preform sample. Flake blanks are poorly represented at the remaining sites also. It is only within the aborted late class (Table 17-7) at the Bird Point Island site (41FT201) and the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) that secondary blanks are well represented in relation to the other blank forms. Unfortunately, the lack of secondary ’ cores within the blank/preforms may merely reflect the analysts’ inability to recognize their presence once a blank has been bifacially shaped. The recognition of secondary cores within an assemblage (Ferring and Peter 1982:9.12-9.13) may depend upon the availability of raw material. If raw material is plentiful, the knapper is more likely to abandon a secondary core at any point within the reduction process; consequently, there is no reluctance to discard a flake blank. However, if resources are scarce, the knapper would likely reduce a flake blank as much as possible before abandoning it. The diagnostic attributes of a flake blank would likely be removed in the process. The size of the cores (Table 17-6) from the Hardy site (41FT200) are generally larger than those from the remaining sites. Only the cores from the Perry site (41FT193) (Mean Size = 1086.5; n = 2) are larger. The core size variability is very dependent upon the stage of reduction at the time of discard. Those cores with more cortex were obviously discarded early in the reduction process. Since the proportion of cores exhibiting 50% or more cortex is greatest at the Hardy site (41FT200), the Perry site (41FT193), and the Irvine site (41NV182) (Table 17-6), one would expect those sites to exhibit a greater mean core size. Unfortunately, the small sample of cores from the Perry site (41FT193) precludes any observations concerning the lesser’ availability of larger cobbles during the Late Prehistoric period. The relative size of the early and late aborted bifaces is expectedly smaller than that of the discarded cores (Tables 17-6 and 17-7). An expected gradual reduction in size from the early aborted bifaces to the late aborted bifaces is not consistently exhibited by these assemblages, however. The quartzite blank/ preforms from the Bird Point Island site (41FT201) and the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173), and all of the blank/preforms from the Irvine site (41NV182) are the only samples which exhibit a significant reduction in mean blank size from the early aborted bifaces to the late aborted bifaces (Table 17-7). The reduction of flake blanks versus that of primary cores may contribute to the inconsistencies observed within the other assemblages. The discard of blank/preforms at these sites indicates that tool production was an important activity at most of the sites. An examination of the ratio of whole flake debris to blank/preforms from these assemblages (Table 17-8) indicates that bifacial tool production was most intensive at the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) and least intensive at the Perry site (41FT193). However, examination of the primary raw materials, chert and quartzite, separately reveals a different pattern. Biface production at the Perry site (41FT193) remains at a very low level for both raw materials. The production of quartzite bifaces, however, is most intensive (a low value for this index) at the Hardy site (41FT200) with the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) following closely. The biface discard index (BD = number of bifaces, including fragments and projectile points divided by number of unfaceted and cortex platform flakes) further reveals that the amount of biface use and discard in relation to the amount of initial reduction flakes is practically the same for all the assemblages. The biface discard index value is significantly higher for the quartzite material, however. The use of quartzite as a blank material and the associated debris is highly variable among these sites. Perhaps, the lack of greater amounts of initial reduction flakes of quartzite reflects the need to test the nodules and produce a knappable flake blank at the source area rather than carry nodules back to camp and then discover that they are not suitable. Unfortunately, the interpretation of these ratios is not a straight forward matter. The small samples of whole flakes from the two latest assemblages (Little Cedar Creek [41NV173] and Perry [41FT193]) raise important questions concerning the production of the numerous blank/preforms. At the Perry site (41FT193) the production of two blank/preforms should have produced more than 161 flakes. A similar problem exists at the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173). The number of blank/ preforms is exceedingly high in relation to the number of whole flakes. Perhaps, the initial reduction of these blank/preforms took place elsewhere, either within the site or at the raw material source. Whatever the case, the

Bifacial tool production was similarly important within the three earliest assemblages (Hardy [41FT200], Irvine [41NV182}, and Bird Point Island [41FT201]). The additional presence of numerous debitage cores reflects the overall intensity of early stage cobble reduction at these sites. On a superficial level, it would appear that a bvifacial core reduction system is the dominant system reflected by all of these assemblages. Secondary cores are poorly represented. However, as noted earlier, the lack of recognizable flake blanks in an area lacking an abundance of cobbles is not unexpected. Furthermore, the size of the cores from these sites is sufficient for the removal of flake blanks for further reduction. An examination of the unifacial and bifacial tools should reveal whether large flakes were commonly utilized for tool blanks at these sites. DECORTICATION AND PREFORMING A comparison of the five assemblages with the replication assemblage reveals some very interesting but not easily explained differences. Immediately noticeable is the variability in the relative proportions of cortical flakes within each assemblage (Table 17-9). Once again, the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) and the Perry site (41FT193) are somewhat anomalous in comparison to the other sites. The percentage of cortical flakes at the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) is extremely high for both the chert (60.9%) and quartzite (78.9%) materials. The Perry site (41FT193), exhibiting 47.5% cortical chert flakes and 55.8% cortical quartzite flakes, also stands in contrast with the remaining assemblages. The remaining assemblages (Table 17-9) exhibit proportions of cortical flakes which are similar to that of the bifacial core reduction replication (Table 17-3). Pmt pees pt ee eet X o N.

The initial reduction of cobbles was likely an important activity of the site occupants. None of the remaining sites are located as close to a raw material source area. The large proportion of cortical flakes at the Perry site (41FT193), however, is not related to raw material availability. The site, due to its geomorphological location, was occupied intermittently for brief periods (Chapter 4). The expected behavioral output of a short term foraging camp is frequently postulated as consisting of expediency tools, debris from tool maintenance, and the discard of broken tools. Initial reduction of cobbles is not expected; however, cobbles were apparently carried onto the site and initially reduced. The small number of flakes at the Perry site (41FT193) indicates that the cobbles may have provided flake blanks for use as tools of expediency or merely served as blanks for the production of blank/preforms. Whichever is the case, tool maintenance or rejuvenation do not appear to have been common activities. The lithic assemblage from the Little Cedar Creek site (4INV173) is also distinguished by relatively small flakes (Figure 17-4). Those flakes exhibiting less than 50% cortex are considerably smaller than those from the other assemblages. Perhaps the use of flake blanks would contribute to this decrease in size. On the other hand, the locally available raw materials may have been sufficiently small that large flakes were not possible. The size distributions of all five assemblages indicate that the latter is likely. The replication debris, except that from the quartzite flake blank, is significantly larger than that from the prehistoric assemblages. Apparently the prehistoric occupants of the RCAP area were either utilizing very small cobbles or relying almost totally upon flake blanks for tool production. Both factors likely played a large part in the production of many small cortical flakes. The debris from the Hardy site (41FT200), on the other hand, is noticeable because of its greater size in relation to the later

Although the flakes exhibiting 51 - 100% cortex are considerably smaller than those of the replication study (except for the quartzite flake blank), those flakes exhibiting less cortex (1 - 50%) fall well within the size range of the debris from the smaller blanks reduced in the replication study (Figure 17-6). The lack of larger primary flakes (51 - 100% cortex) may reflect their use as blanks for unifaces. Given the results of the replication study, it is difficult to attribute the larger size of the Archaic debris solely to the use of bifacial core reduction for tool production. The presence of some secondary cores at the Hardy site (41FT200) denotes that multiple reduction strategies were utilized. The larger size of the Archaic period debris is likely related to one or both of the following factors: (1) the postulated broad territorial range of the Middle Archaic period would have brought these people into areas where larger blanks or cobbles could be acquired, and (2) perhaps the Archaic inhabitants of RCAP exploited the large, prime cobbles so intensively, that subsequent occupants of the area were forced to use smaller cobbles. Although it is evident that the Middle Archaic occupants of RCAP were utilizing more distant source areas (see Chapter 16), it is presently unknown if they also exhausted the prime cobbles of the local sources. An examination of the size variability of cobbles available today is needed in order to address this alternative. As with the replication material, the joint distribution of the cortical classes and the technological attributes were examined by means of a cross matrix. Assemblages from the Irvine site (41NV 182) and the Bird Point Island site (41FT201) most closely approximate the patterns exhibited by the replication material. Cortical and single faceted platforms are most common on the cortical flakes of either chert or quartzite. Interestingly, multifaceted platforms are better represented on the cortical flakes than among the replication debris. This is especially true for the quartzite flakes from the Irvine site (¢41NV182) and the Bird Point Island site (41FT201). Several factors may have contributed to these differences. Of course, observer error must be considered as a source of such variability; however, all analysis was supervised with the intent to minimize inter-observer bias. Assuming that observer error was minimized, it is apparent that the prehistoric knappers utilized faceted platforms more extensively to control flake removal during bifacial thinning of quartzite than our modem knapper did. The relatively small size of the raw material and its knappability may have required greater contre! over flake removal for successful bifacial reduction. This factor, together with the possible greater emphasis on bifacial thinning within these assemblages (relative to the other assemblages), may explain this occurrence of multifaceted platforms. The remainder of the technological attributes exhibit relationships to the amount of cortex which are very similar to those of the replication debris. Unidirectional and bidirectional dorsal scar patterns dominate the cortical flakes. Tridirectional or multidirectional patterns increase in occurrence on those flakes

Termination shape is most commonly feathered, with hinged terminations following in frequency. Due to this excellent control of flake removal, error recovery is minimal (Table 17-9). INTERNAL CORE REDUCTION The three earliest assemblages (Table 17-9) exhibit the largest proportions of interior flakes. As with the decortication flakes, unidirectional dorsal scar pattems are most common among the interior flakes. Multidirectional dorsal scar patterns follow in frequency of occurrence for both chert and quartzite flakes with the exception of the earliest (Hardy [41F1T200)) and latest (Little Cedar Creek [41NV173]) assemblages. In those assemblages the bidirectional scar patterns are better represented than the multidirectional. The apparent lack of internal core reduction at 41NV173 is likely responsible for the above pattern at that site; however, the lack of multidirectional scar patterns on the larger flakes of the Hardy site (41FT200) is not so easily explained. A comparison of the mean interior flake size from the Hardy site (41FT200) (Figure 17-5) with that of the replication material (Figure 17-6) reveals that the former are significantly larger. Perhaps, the final finishing of bifaces was not a predominant activity at the site. As with the decortication flakes, the internal core reduction flakes exhibit a high percentage of multifaceted platforms (Table 17-9). This is especially true of the interior chert flakes from the three earliest assemblages and the quartzite flakes from the Bird Point Island site (41FT201) and the Irvine site (41NV182). The interior flakes from the Perry site (41FT193) and the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) exhibit percentages which are very similar to those of the replication study. Although sample size may have contributed to this pattern, the emphasis on initial reduction rather than bifacial thinning within these two assemblages is likely - responsible for the lack of multifaceted platforms within the interior flake assemblage. As usual, the assemblage from the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) stands in contrast with the other assemblages. Its anomalous characteristics may be due to sample size; nevertheless, it is notable that no flakes exhibit cortex on their platform surfaces only. It was previously noted that the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) exhibited a high proportion of relatively small cortical flakes. The initial reduction of raw materials, perhaps flake blanks, is evident. Perhaps the larger flakes removed during cobble reduction were utilized as secondary blanks or the production of flake blanks was the primary goal of the knappers. Either strategy would diminish the number of interior flakes exhibiting cortical platforms. The reduction of these flake blanks apparently took place elsewhere. As with the replication material, flake termination and error recovery vary little between assemblages (Table 17-9). Feathered terminations are most common with hinges a distant second. The prehistoric knappers apparently maintained excellent control over flake removal throughout the reduction process. Due to this control, evidence of error recovery is very limited throughout these assemblages. Only the Hardy site (41FT200) and the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) exhibit a significant amount of recovery which originates from the same direction as the flake scar bearing the error. Why the earliest and the latest assemblages should share this trait is unclear at this time. TOOL BLANK SELECTION The preceding discussion has noted the size dimensions and the technological attributes of the reduction strategies used to bifacially reduce primary and possibly secondary cores within the five assemblages. However, a thorough understanding of the reduction process necessarily involves an examination of the blanks selected for tools. Indeed, the recognition of a purposeful debitage production strategy is dependent upon the evaluation of tool blanks. The evaluation of the tool blanks will involve unifaces, finished bifaces, and projectile points. Blank size and shape and the technological attributes when recognizable will be examined. Flake blanks are overwhelmingly the prehistoric knapper's first choice as a secondary core for the production of a unifacial tool (Table 17-10). This is especially true for the marginally modified artifacts. It is readily apparent from Table 17-10 that the flake blanks used for unifacial tools, especially the steeply chipped tools, are much larger in size than the unmodified debris left at the site (Table 17-11). This indicates the use of debitage cores or the large flakes removed during the early stages of bifacial reduction. The large number of interior flake blanks, however, reflects the use of debitage cores for the production of sufficiently large blanks. The size and shape of the blanks also reflect the use of larger debitage cores. A comparison of the technological attributes of the unifaces (Table 17-11 and 17-12) with those of the debris (Table 17-9) reveals that multifaceted platforms are more common on the unifacial tool blanks of the Bird Point Island site (41FT201) and the Irvine site (41NV182) just as they were on the debris. The . presence of multifaceted platforms on the tool blanks of these sites might be related to the predominant use of interior flakes as blanks. Interestingly, this relationship does not hold up at the Hardy site (41FT200) where the unifacial tool blanks are predominantly interior flakes, but platform types are mainly single faceted. Perhaps, the occupants of the Hardy site (41FT200) were utilizing larger debitage cores which required less platform preparation than the removal of a large flake from the smaller pieces of raw material apparently available to the later RCAP occupants. As with the debris assemblages, unidirectional dorsal scar patterns are most common. Feathered terminations also remain as the predominant termination form. The identification of flake blanks within the bifacial tool categories is more difficult, for the bifacial flaking often removes all identifiable characteristics of the original blank. Within all of the assemblages examined, however, flake blanks are represented within the bifacial tool categories. Among the finished bifaces (Table 17-13), the few identifiable flake blanks range in size from a value of 6.2 to that of 205.2. The bifaces of an indeterminate blank form tend to be larger with a maximum size index of 396.0.

Bivariate graphs of mean flake dimensions in complete flakes from the replication study. The recognizable flake blanks also exhibit a shape index which is within the range of the normal debris variation. The size of two- thirds of these flake blanks, however, is of sufficient magnitude to suggest that the blanks represent either flake removal from a debitage core or initial bifacial reduction by-products. The predominance of single faceted (n = 6) or cortex platforms (n = 1) further supports such a conclusion. Interestingly, many of the flake blanks of finished tools are larger than those recognized as early or late aborted bifaces. Within the projectile point assemblages, flake blanks are also recognizable (Table 17-14). As expected, there is a notable size difference between the dart and arrow points. Like the other finished bifaces, many of the projectile points could not be fashioned from the normal debris (Table 17-11) recovered from the site. The use of debitage cores or large, initial bifacial reduction flakes is necessary for the production of these tools, especially the dart points.

Unlike the other finished bifaces, the projectile points from these assemblages are smaller than the late, aborted bifaces from their respective assemblages. SUMMARY RESULTS OF THE REPLICATION STUDY The attribute analysis of the replication of two reduction systems provided a comparative data base for the evaluation of the lithic technology represented in five assemblages from the RCAP. The replication data were used as a model to evaluate the variability within these assemblages. Although it was understood that the replication assemblage may have been produced by

An experimental basis for our assumptions concerning bifacial and debitage production systems was definitely needed for an evaluation of present efforts to characterize reduction systems and related strategies. : ; The attribute analysis of the replication debris clearly demonstrates that the by-products of bifacial core reduction and debitage production systems are not easily recognized within an archaeological assemblage. The only variable that is consistently different between the two systems is that of flake size. The differences are not great enough, however, that one would be able to recognize both systems within a mixed assemblage. It is only through the additional analysis of the activity sets of core blank selection and tool blank selection that multiple reduction systems may be recognized. The examination of the individual attributes, however, did reveal their relative worth for the recognition of the reduction process. Within the replication assemblage and the RCAP assemblages it is apparent that flake termination and error recovery provide little worthwhile information. The lack of variability in these attributes reveals that their occurrence is quite constant regardless of the reduction process. Dorsal scar patterns exhibit more variability, but the pattern is not as well defined as archaeologists have often assumed. The assumption that dorsal scar patterns become more complex as the reduction process proceeds is not substantiated by the replication data. Admittedly, the lack of a linear relationship between dorsal scar pattern complexity and the amount of dorsal cortex may be related to the analysts’ abilities to detect the full scar pattern. A more reliable method of recording this attribute is needed. Perhaps, dorsal scar count, as used by Magne and Pokotylo (1981) is a more replicable approach. The greatest variability within the replication material is exhibited by the flake dimension attributes (length, width, thickness, platform thickness) and a calculated size index. It is Volume III, Part Two evident that flake size varies significantly throughout the reduction sequence. Size alone, however, does not permit the confident placement of a flake within the reduction sequence. It is only when flake size is related to the cortical classes that the reduction sequence is properly characterized. Unlike other research efforts (Stahle and Dunn 1982; Magne and Pokotylo 1981), this study did not reveal that flake size would permit an evaluation of the degree of reduction represented within a given assemblage. Discriminant analysis of the flake size dimensions was unsuccessful as a means of properly classifying the flakes from the replication study. The relationship between platform type and the amount of dorsal cortex is also very useful for the characterization of a reduction system. The cross matrix of the states of these two attributes revealed that flakes with cortex platforms, but without dorsal cortex, are normal products of bifacial reduction and not “specialized flakes” as sometimes assumed. The replication data also revealed that multifaceted platforms are not as abundant on interior flakes as often assumed. Once again, however, this attribute relationship does not permit a ready portrayal of the reduction sequence represented at a site. The reduction strategies represented within the RCAP assemblages were first suggested through the analysis of the size and platform attributes in relation to the amount of cortex.

The relationships remain the same regardless of the relative size of the core being reduced. At the very least the replication study provided a comparative basis for the evaluation of the prehistoric assemblages.

Comparisons of the assemblages with the replication data, however, revealed interpretable assemblage differences. The most visible anomaly within the temporal sequence is the assemblage from the Hardy site (41FT200). This Middle Archaic assemblage exhibits a greater variety of raw material, larger sized debris, and a lesser proportion of multifaceted platforms on quartzite debris than the later assemblages. The first two elements may reflect a higher degree of mobility which provided access to raw materials which were both more varied in type and larger in size than the locally available materials (see Chapter 16). Of course, the larger size of the dart points used during the Archaic period required a larger primary or secondary core. It is also possible that the Archaic occupants of the RCAP area utilized the prime cobbles within the local sources to the point of exhaustion. Subsequent occupants of the area were forced to utilize smaller, less desirable cobbies. The lower percentage of multifaceted platforms within the Archaic quartzite assemblage is perplexing, for the large number of blank/preforms indicates a significant amount of bifacial thinning. Although there is a technological adaptation of the bow and arrow represented in the later assemblages, no concomitant change in the reduction strategies is evident. Perhaps, the bifacial thinning represented by the discarded blank/preforms from the Hardy site (41FT200) is of an early stage that did not require extensive platform preparation.

Such platforms would have allowed for the greater control necessary for successful flake removal from such small cobbles. The significantly lower representation of multifaceted platforms at the Perry site (41FT193) and the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) likely reflects an emphasis on initial reduction rather than bifacial thinning. The large proportion of cortical flakes within these assemblages (Table 17-9) supports this interpretation. A more primary concern of this study has been the determination of the viability of the proposed analytical frame- work for recognizing intersite functional differences. The Irvine site (41NV182) and the Bird Point Island site (41FT201) are clearly very similar in their assemblage composition. The entire reduction sequence is represented within both assemblages. The production of blank/preforms (Table 17-8) is moderately high compared to the remaining assemblages. Debitage cores are also quite numerous. The Hardy site (41FT200) exhibits a similar assemblage except that the presence of blank/preforms is even more pronounced (Table 17-8). This is particularly true of the quartzite raw material. The reduction of these blank/preforms apparently took place elsewhere or ceased early in the reduction process, for very few quartzite flakes are present in relation to the number of discarded blank/preforms. The relative proportions of marginally modified unifaces in relation to the total number of lithic tools and debris from the Hardy site (41FT200) is also quite similar to that of the Irvine site

A value of 3.9% for the Hardy site (41FT200) is comparable to the 3.2% for the Irvine site (41NV 182) and lower than the value of 7.1 percent for the Bird Point Island site (41FT201). Contrary to our expectations, the relative proportions of marginally modified Pieces are quite high relative to the remaining assemblages. At the Perry site (41FT193), which is thought to be a short term foraging camp, a high proportion of marginally modified pieces was expected; instead, only 2.1% of the lithic assemblage consists of these tools of expediency. The Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) exhibits an even lower percentage of 1.7. Apparently, the need for tools of expediency, such as marginally modified pieces, is not related to the mobility of a hunter-gatherer group. Rather, it is related to the duration of the occupation as indicated by the sedentary hamlet at the Bird Point Island site (41FT201). The index of biface discard (House and Ballenger 1976) was unable to differentiate the sites (Table 17-8). The indices for the Hardy site (41FT200), the Perry site (41FT193), and the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) are almost identical. Given the variability in lithic density, the number and size of features, and the overall complexity of these assemblages, it is difficult to accept that biface use and discard was equivalent at these sites. As with the marginally modified pieces, it is apparent that many of our assumptions concerning tool use and discard are erroneous. Furthermore, our assumptions concerning the mobility of a hunter-gatherer group and its effect on the resulting archaeo- logical manifestations need to be reexamined. The attribute analysis of the assemblages from the Perry site (41FT193) and the Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173), however, demonstrates that functional differences may be evident. The assemblage from the Perry site (41FT193) is particularly distinctive due to the presence of a limited number of large cores and bifaces, a large proportion of cortical flakes, and the smallest interior flakes of any assemblage. The foraging band who used this site carried raw material onto the site, conducted primary reduction of those materials, and maintained their existing tool kit as indicated by the extremely small interior flakes. The total reduction sequence related to the production of finished tools is not indicated. Such activities seem consistent with the interpretation that the Perry site (41FT193) served as a short term foraging camp. The Little Cedar Creek site (41NV173) also exhibits an abundance of initial reduction debris. These cortical flakes are relatively small in comparison with the other assemblages. Since the site is close to a gravel source, flake blanks were likely produced at the source area and brought onto the site. Blank/preforms are particularly abundant at this site (Table 17-8). The production of blank/preforms may have been a primary activity at this site, for the low proportions of interior flakes

228 indicate that internal core reduction was conducted either elsewhere on the site or at another location. It is possible that the site was occupied primarily for the use of the nearby source area. Although the proposed analytical framework did not provide any radically different interpretations of assemblage function, it did provide indications of functional differences among the selected assemblages. In this respect it was more successful than the usual dependence on bifacial discard indices or proportions of expedient tools. Perhaps, the most disappointing aspect of this analysis is the failure to readily identify the stages of reduction represented within an assemblage, and consequently site function, on the basis of the debris attributes. Further research concerning the diagnostic traits of the stages within reduction strategies is needed, Cluster and discriminant analysis of the attributes of the replication debris may point the way to statistical assessments of the degree of bifacial reduction conducted at an archaeological site by isolating attributes or attribute clusters which are primarily associated with a particular activity set. Magne and Pokotylo Volume III, Part Two (1981) and Stahle and Dunn (1982) have provided the initial impetus for this effort. The proportion of various flake sizes in relation to reduction stages (Patterson and Soilberger 1981) also needs to be investigated. It should be noted, however, that an understanding of the lithic technology of an assemblage in relation to the total behavioral system will always depend on more than a single attribute or attribute cluster denoting the presence or absence of reduction stages. Our zeal for analytical efficiency should not cause us to ignore the complexities involved with site formation processes. Reliance upon a single attribute to provide determinations of site function is an overly narrow perspective. It is only through replication studies, which provide an experimental basis for our inferences, and the analysis of the entire tool production trajectory in the broader cultural context that we will be able to approach our perceived goal of functional differentiation and ultimately an understanding of settlement-subsistence systems.

HUNTER-GATHERERS OF THE PRAIRIE MARGIN: SUMMARY OF THE PREHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD by James E. Bruseth, Daniel E. McGregor, and William A. Martin In Part One of this volume and Parts One and Two of Volume Il, the results from four seasons of excavations at prehistoric sites within the Richland Creek Archaeological Project are presented. The discussion has been detailed to present basic information from field work and data analysis on the mitigation of prehistoric sites within the Richland/Chambers Reservoir. Part Two of the present volume and Part Three of Volume II depart from this descriptive presentation and provide syntheses of various aspects of the prehistoric investigations conducted during the Richland Creek Archaeological Project (RCAP). Specifically, the previous chapters of Part Two of this volume have been concerned with the establishment of a refined artifact chronology for the Project area and with the establishment of changes in lithic technology and raw material usage over time. The present chapter builds upon these earlier studies to accomplish two goals. First, an outline is presented of culture- historical patterns in the data. This is done by summarizing the trends during each of the major chronological periods described in Chapter 15. Second, certain topical problems are then addressed that attempt to move beyond culture history and explain aspects of culture behavior. This is accomplished through an ecological approach to examining hunter-gatherer subsistence-settlement strategies from a diachronic perspective. The Richland Creek data record a developmental history markedly different from the neighboring Caddoan groups less than 50 km to the east (cf., Story 1981; Bruseth and Perttula 1981), and comparisons with these nearby inhabitants provide insight into hunter-gatherer adaptive strategies within the RCAP. PROBLEMS OF DATA INTERPRETATION In any synthesis of a major body of data, an important question confronting the researcher is how far the data can, or should, be “pushed.” Is a careful discussion of basic trends most appropriate, or should speculative interpretations also be included? We have chosen a compromise between the two by first presenting major trends in the data and then providing our interpretations of what these trends mean. We wish to point out that these interpretations should be viewed as our best estimates of cultural developments in the RCAP area and are proposed as a testable model for other researchers to use. This section examines the major weaknesses in the data base that may serve to make some of our interpretations speculative. Although extensive excavations were conducted at 15 prehistoric sites over four field seasons of mitigation as well as the test excavations conducted at several other sites during the survey and testing phase of the Project, major gaps still exist in the data. Most importantly, not all periods of occupation are equally tepresented in the reservoir. For example, there is evidence of occupation from the Paleo-Indian to the Late Prehistoric periods, but our sample for the Paleo-Indian through Middle Archaic is severely limited. This is largely due to the geological facto pointed out in Chapter 7 of Volume I. The vaileys of Richland and Chambers Creeks have undergone significant changes during the period of known human occupation. The terraces and floodplains as they appear today represent one stage in a long series of erosional and aggradational cycles. Although the T1 terrace was deposited during the Pleistocene, it was eroded to its present configuration during the Pleistocene/ Holocene transition. The floodplain, in contrast, has experienced a massive build-up of deposits throughout most of the Holocene. As a result, much of the evidence of late Pleistocene and early Holocene occupations may have been either destroyed by stream, valley incision, or buried deeply within Holocene floodplain sediments. If we base our interpretations of the Paleo-Indian through Middle Archaic occupations on the kinds of sites that are normally found by surface surveys, we are almost certainly observing only a biased segment of the original settlement patterns. Unfortunately, this fact of geology became apparent too late in the Project to permit large-scale excavations into floodplain deposits to search for buried sites. Although a limited attempt was made to do this at the Perry site (41FT193), the full potential of this approach has not been realized. In our opinion, these geological conditions exist throughout much of northern and eastern Texas, and large-scale subsurface testing of floodplain 229

230 alluvium holds the greatest promise for locating intact early sites in these regions. An additional factor that has limited our efforts of archaeological interpretation concerns the soils of the terraces and uplands in the Project area. The Pleistocene terraces of the Project area have been geologically stable through the period of human occupation. Although localized conditions have caused small areas of colluvial or alluvial deposition and other areas of erosion, these deposits are relatively rare. The occurrence of sites on nonaggrading surfaces is part of a larger phenomenon observed over much of the eastern part of Texas (Story 1981; Bruseth and Perttula 1981), and presents a major problem for archaeological interpretation. Further compounding this situation is pedoturbation that has been documented throughout much of the area (Duffield 1970; Story 1976; Brown 1975; Bruseth and Perttula 1981). This has resulted in artifacts being displaced vertically within the soils of these geologically stable surfaces. Although the deposits appear to have “cultural stratigraphy,” with older artifacts usually occurring deeper, this in fact is not the case. The older artifacts have simply had more time to be vertically displaced. Some workers have taken exception to the view that many of the terrace and upland surfaces in East Texas are geologically stable (e.g., Crook and Harris 1952; Slaughter et al. 1962; Fields 1984; Bianchi 1984; Heinrich 1985), and instead have argued for colluvial and alluvial aggradation. Evidence often used in support of this interpretation is the occurrence in sites of rock concentrations located at varying depths below the present surface. These are interpreted to represent hearths on old surfaces. However, based on the occurrence of similar features at some Richland Creek sites and on experiments using magnetometers to model the formation processes of these features, we suggest as an alternative hypothesis that the features represent earth ovens used for processing plant and animal foods. This interpretation has important implications for understanding the variable depths of the features. According to the earth oven hypothesis, these rock concentrations represent the bottom portions of pits excavated into the soil for food processing. Thus the rocks were never on an exposed ground surface, but were buried into pits of variable depth. Of course, the Richland Creek experimental work is most convincing for the RCAP, and further research is needed before final conclusions can be made for other areas of East Texas. Nonetheless, this work points up present interpretative problems concerning the archaeology at many sites in this part of the State. The final factor that has biased our interpretations is preservation of the economic data. Floral and faunal preservation have been generally poor throughout the reservoir, and in fact, the situation is no different than that recorded for the remainder of this part of Texas (Story 1981). However, based on work elsewhere in East Texas (Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Perttula and Bmuseth 1983), and on the results of the 1980-81 RCAP testing program, it was known that some economic data would be recovered. However, in the majority of cases these data would be minimal from any given context. Consequently, a major emphasis of the mitigation program was the analysis of as many different feature contexts as possible. Our assumption was that the bias from small, poorly preserved samples in individual features could, to a certain degree, be overcome by analyzing multiple samples. In fact, the analysis of several contexts should provide a more reliable picture of the overall subsistence strategy, and certainly has merit over relying upon data from a single well preserved feature which may not be truly representative of the entire range of foods in the diet. The outcome of this extensive recovery program has been generally rewarding. While the remains recovered from individual features were often small, the sum of many such features has allowed us to suggest overall trends in economic strategies. Importantly, the data record a hunting and gathering subsistence strategy throughout the prehistoric record, with maize horticulture utilized only to a very small degree late in the prehistoric record. This stands in contrast to developments from surrounding areas (Story 1981; Lynott 1981). Volume III, Part Two NATURAL SETTING OF THE RCAP As recorded in Chapters 5 and 6 of Volume I, the RCAP is located along the Prairie Margin of Texas, a major ecotone separating the Eastern Deciduous Forest from the Midwestern Plains. Moreover, the Prairie Margin is part of a continent-wide ecotone extending from Canada to Texas (Shelford 1963:328). Along this zone the forests of the eastern U. S. give way to the Great Plains. In some areas this transition is relatively sharp, perhaps a few tens of kilometers as in the Project area. In other areas a complex mosaic of prairie, savannah, and woodland communities form the transition between grassland and forest. In this section we examine essential characteristics of the environment to serve as a background for understanding trends in human adaptations to the area. Within the RCAP area, three major vegetational communities are found: Post Oak Savannah, Bottomland Forest, and Tall Grass Prairie. Since the disturbances that have occurred within each zone from historic settlement are not relevant to this discussion, we only reconstruct each community as it would have appeared at approximately 1850. Chapter 6 of Volume I presents greater detail on the environmental construction from the GLO records for the Project area. Included within these GLO records are directions, distances, and sizes of witness trees for all major tracts of land. This type of data, although potentially biased (cf., Wood 1976; Warren 1976), has been nonetheless a useful tool for the reconstruction of pre-Euro-American settlement in many parts of the midwestern United States (King 1984). In addition to the GLO witness tree data, other more general botanical summaries of Texas, such as Kiichler (1964) and Gould (1975), as well as data on soils and topography, have been used to interpolate between the known GLO data points. The results of this effort are shown in map form in Figure 18- 1, based on Figure 6-1 in Volume I. This represents our best approximation of the distribution of pre-Euro-American settlement vegetation and provides a valuable ecological baseline for understanding the potentially exploitable prehistoric biomass surrounding the RCAP.

The third most frequent tree species would have been hickory, accounting for 11 to 15% of all species. The distribution of hickory in the GLO data with respect to topography shows that it prefers slopes and was slightly more frequent in these ‘areas. The remaining 4 to 6% of trees would have consisted of red oak, pin oak, ash, and locust which probably would have been encountered in small drainages and along creeks cutting into the Savannah environment. Although today the dominant understory vegetation consists of shrubs and vines (U. S. Army, Corps of Engineers [USA,COE] 1982), in a prehistoric state tall grasses would have been dominant (Gould 1969:11). Climax species would have been little bluestem, indiangrass, purple top, silver bluestem, and Texas wintergrass. The occurrence of these species indicates that the density of trees was substantially less than is seen today, and the area would have ‘been more open and a true savannah environment. This interpretation is also supported by the fact that modem prevention of fires has caused trees to increase in density during the past decade (Hall 1977:171). In fact, some botanists prefer to classify the Post Oak Savannah as a prairie association of the grassland (Gould 1969:11). Important faunal resources indigenous to this area would have included whitetail deer, red wolf, fox squirrel, raccoon, gray fox, easter cottontail rabbit, opossum, and several species of rodents, snakes and birds. Several elements of this community would have made it particularly important to prehistoric populations. The dominance of oak and hickory species, accounting for nearly 95% of all trees, would have offered great potential for acorn and hickory nut collection, both known to have been important foods of native American groups throughout the Eastern Woodlands during the historic contact period (Swanton 1946:364-367). In addition, the high frequency of nut producing trees would have created a favorable environment for deer, and hunting of this mammal would no doubt have been a major exploitation strategy. An important plant food available in this habitat, but not found commonly in the others, would have been the prairie turnip (Psoralea spp.; Correll and Johnston 1970:813-817). The remains of the tuber from this plant are omnipresent at many of the reservoir sites, and its common occurrence underscores its importance in the prehistoric diet. A similar heavy usage of this plant is documented further to the north in the Great Plains by historic Native American groups (Wedel 1978; Reid 1977; Kaye and Moodie 1978). 231 BOTTOMLAND FOREST As with the Post Oak Savannah, the dominant overstory species of this zone would have been post oak (Table 18-2). The second most frequent species in the Savannah, blackjack oak, would have dropped in frequency within the Bottomland Forest to fifth, again based on GLO records. The species that would have replaced it in occurrence are ash, hackberry, and elm. Less common species would have included hickory, red oak, locust, and bur oak. In the swamps and wetter parts of the floodplain, green ash, sugarberry, hackberry, and cedar elm would have been dominant with willow and cottonwood also occurring. Understory vegetation probably would have consisted of shrubs (¢e.g., greenbriar, Virginia creeper, poison ivy, and grape), grasses, and sedges. The difference in the vegetational composition between the Bottomland Forest and the Post Oak Savannah is due in large part to a single factor. The bottomlands tend to collect runoff from rain that falls in the surrounding uplands and thus provide a better watered environment for plant growth. Potentially important mammal species of this area would have been whitetail deer, fox squirrel, raccoon, gray fox, bobcat, swamp rabbit, eastern cottontail, opossum, several species of fish and amphibians in creeks and other water sources, and a variety of birds. This vegetational zone would have offered several species of potentially high economic value to prehistoric people. The oak species would have comprised a third of all trees, and acorns would have been an important autumn food source. The dense shrubby understory would also have permitted the exploitation of several types of wild berries, grapes, and fruits. And finally, the total faunal biomass would have been the greatest of any of the habitats, with a greater variety and frequency of most species. Two obvious exceptions to this would have been deer and bison, both of which would have been greater in frequency in the Post Oak Savannah and the Tall Grass Prairie, respectively. Nonetheless, the high overall exploitable biomass would have made this zone a focus of many procurement activities throughout the prehistoric period. TALL GRASS PRAIRIE As the name implies, the dominant plant of this zone was grass. The dominant climax species would have been little bluestem, followed by big bluestem, indiangrass, switch grass, side oats grama, and hairy grama. The GLO records indicate that post oaks Table 18-2 PERCENTAGES! OF TREE SPECIES WITHIN THE BOTTOMLAND ForREST ZONE BASED ON GLO RECORDS Species Percent Post Oak 28 .

232 and blackjack oaks were present among the grasses, although these trees were widely spaced at 80 m or more apart. This occurrence of oak species in some parts of the prairies is common where soils are medium to light in texture (Gould 1969). Faunal species of species of importance to prehistoric man would have been bison, eastern cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, rodents, and birds. Bison, however, were probably never common (Lynott 1979). LATE HOLOCENE CLIMATIC CHANGE The location of the RCAP along the Prairie Margin of Texas offers a unique perspective for the investigation of prehistoric cultural behavior. As noted earlier, the zone is the transition between the Eastern Deciduous Forests and the Midwesterm Plains. Importantly, the location of the Prairie Margin has not been static during the Holocene. As pointed out in Chapter 5 of Volume I, changes in temperature and moisture regimes have caused advances and retreats of the forests and grasslands. Moreover, based on continent-wide historical records, periods of drought are found to have occurred over consecutive years and to have been concentrated in the grasslands of the Midwest (Bochert 1950). More specific studies of drought in the Midwest were conducted by Albertson and Weaver (1945). These have shown that the effects of the 1930s drought upon vegetation resulted in 20 to 50% of upland trees being killed, and a lowering of the water table causing many springs to stop flowing. Dyksterhuis (1948:373), studying the effects of the 1930s drought upon the Cross Timbers region of Texas, noted that trees died on the western margin of this biogeographical zone. The overall pattern of vegetational change noted during dry periods in the Midwest is the replacement of tall grasses by mid and short grasses and the woodlands by tall grasses (Bochert 1950:35). Recovery of vegetation after dry periods can be slow and substantial erosion can occur (Albertson and Weaver 1945:423). Similar conditions can be assumed to have occurred during prehistoric droughts. The dynamics of the Prairie Margin have important implications for archaeological research in the area. Prehistoric economic strategies possible in grasslands versus forests were markedly different, and the movement of this ecotone can be assumed to have influenced prehistoric societies. This ecotone, then, can be viewed as a natural archaeological laboratory for examining the impacts of environmental change on human populations (e.g., Wood and McMillan 1976). In the remainder of this section, we outline the major environmental periods for the late Holocene. The periods were devised after analysis of paleoecological data from along the Prairie Margin in Oklahoma and Texas, and the summary presented here is based on a more detailed presentation in Chapter 5 of Volume I. ENVIRONMENTAL PERIOD I: 3000 B.C. TO A.D. 500 This period appears to have been one of relatively greater effective moisture. How much greater than at present is difficult to estimate, but the rapid sedimentation rates on the floodplain of Richland Creek and high representation of arboreal taxa in the regional pollen record suggest significantly wetter conditions. This is not to imply that dramatically different species composition existed during this period as contrasted with the present. Rather, significant changes in the proportional representation of species would have existed in comparison with today. We suggest that much of the area presently occupied by Tall Grass Prairie was then covered with an open canopy woodland, or a savannah, environment. In all probability, the arboreal species present today in the Post Oak Savannah would have occurred throughout the Project area. This would have provided greater numbers of hickory and oak trees in proximity for exploitation by prehistoric hunter-gatherers along Richland Creek. Furthermore, the increased woodland area would have provided more forage for deer and allowed an increase in the frequency of this species. Volume III, Part Two The bottomlands appear to have been subject to frequent flooding and relatively rapid alluviation. The frequent deposition of sediments would have prevented a mature climax forest from developing, as exists in the area today, and instead the floodplain would have consisted of a highly diverse vegetation mosaic representing communities in various stages of succession. The overall biotic potential would have been greater than today's, due to the increased variety of floral and faunal resources such an environment would have provided. ENVIRONMENTAL PERIOD II: A.D. 500 TO A.D. 1200 During this period, the western margin of the savannah woodlands surrounding the Project would have started to slowly recede eastward as an increasingly drier climate was becoming established. The sedimentation rates for the floodplain indicate approximately comparable deposition to the previous period, but the increase in clays observed in floodplain stratigraphy argues for slower movement of water. It appears that overbank flooding was gradual, perhaps indicating a decreased occurrence of intense storms. The formation of a prairie environment along Richland Creek would have resulted in a net decrease in the potentially exploitable biomass. However, as the recession of the woodlands would have been from the west to the east and the RCAP is located on the eastern edge of the Tall Grass Prairie, the prairie environment may not have reached the reservoir area until late in this, or even into the next, period. The floodplain environment would have been similar to that of the previous period. The rates of sedimentation would most likely have been sufficient to have prevented a climax forest from developing, and a rich variety of exploitable bottomland resources would have been present. ENVIRONMENTAL PERIOD III: A.D. 1200 TO 1820 The evidence from a variety of sources suggests this period represented a major climatic deterioration. The cessation in floodplain alluviation suggests a marked decrease in rainfall that persisted until historic times. In all likelihood, the Tall Grass Prairie observed today was established during this period, and resulted in substantial amounts of grassland surrounding the central and western portions of the reservoir. Bison would have been more common than before, but based on the overall rarity of this species at archaeological sites throughout North Central Texas (Lynott 1979), this animal would have still been infrequent. ‘The prairie would have also resulted in a marked decrease in the abundance of many important food species such as nuts and deer. The floodplain would not have been seasonally inundated, and a climax forest would have developed. Within the floodplain, this factor would have further decreased the abundance of many exploitable resources. In particular, deer would have been less abundant since they prefer edge areas and a floodplain forest does not provide this situation. However, this effect may have been partially offset by the increased edge area formed by the forests of the floodplain meeting the grasses of the prairie in the uplands. HUNTER-GATHERERS OF THE PRAIRIE MARGIN: DESCRIPTIVE TRENDS IN THE DATA The purpose of this section is to use the chronological foundation established in Chapter 15 ta reconstruct the lifeways of the prehistoric inhabitants during each major temporal period. As the following discussion indicates, a hunting and gathering lifestyle was maintained throughout the entire prehistoric record in the

Summary RCAP. Consequently, this section discusses changes over time in this mode of human economic adaptation. More specifically, the focus of this discussion is on reconstructing, to the extent possible, the lifeways of the extinct societies that inhabited the RCAP through consideration of four topics: settlement patterns, demographics, technology, and economy. It must be pointed out from the beginning that not all topic areas are fully realizable for all periods. As noted in an earlier section, the data from the reservoir are disportionately representative of certain time periods. For instance, our samples of Paleo-Indian through Middle Archaic occupations are very small. In particular, no in situ Paleo-Indian or Early Archaic deposits were located within the reservoir, and our samples from these periods are limited to artifacts mixed with components from other periods. The Middle Archaic period is only slightly better represented. More artifacts diagnostic of this period are present, but these are still mixed with those from later periods of occupation. As a result, the primary focus of this discussion begins with the Middle Archaic and continues through the Late Prehistoric periods, a temporal range of approximately 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1650. The Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic periods are treated only briefly. The most detailed information comes from the last 3000 years, where evidence of more substantial occupations provides better data on the Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric. Not all sites with evidence of occupation from one or more of the major periods of reservoir prehistory are used in the following discussions. None of the mitigated sites are exclusively single component occupations; all have some evidence of multiple occupations. In some instances a particular occupation may be dominant, such as the Richland Creek Phase occupation at the Irvine site, and in these cases the overall site assemblage is treated as representing this period of occupation. Although artifacts from earlier and later periods may be mixed in, the bias in the sample is clearly towards the dominant occupation. In other cases, such as Bird Point Island, different periods of occupation are largely horizontally separated. Consequently, spatial divisions of the site can be used as components representing different periods. And in still other instances, particular features at some sites are sufficiently distinctive to suggest affiliation with a period other than that which the site overall is thought to represent. In these situations, the feature is analyzed separately from the remainder of the site. Depending on the materials that were recovered, the feature may be included in discussions of some artifact classes and excluded from other discussions. PALEO-INDIAN AND EARLY ARCHAIC: 11,000 B.C. TO 3000 B.C. There is relatively little evidence available concerning the Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic occupations of the Project area. Diagnostic projectile points are known from surface collections and from subsurface contexts where they were mixed with artifacts from later components. Because no radiocarbon dates from these periods have been obtained from middle Trinity River sites, dating of these artifacts is based on their typological similarities to dated materials from adjacent regions. The Paleo-Indian occupants of the Project area are assumed to have been highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers. Low regional population densities and movements over very large territories are thought to be characteristic Paleo-Indian adaptations. This is based on the low density of sites and the fact that diagnostic projectile points were often manufactured from non-local lithic materials. This predominate use of high quality, exotic cherts is considered diagnostic of the Paleo-Indian period for North Central Texas (Lynott 1981:101; Richner and Bagot 1978:51), and for North America in general (e.g., Goodyear 1979; Meltzer 1984). As was noted in Chapter 16, all but two of the Paleo-Indian projectile points from the Project area were made of high quality cherts that may be non-local. The two exceptions are the San Patrice specimens, one made of silicified wood and the other of 233 Pisgah Ridge chert. This tendency for San Patrice points to be made from local lithic materials has been noted previously for North and East Texas, and a relatively lower degree of mobility has been suggested for the groups associated with these types (Lynott 1981:103; Shafer 1973:18-19). The distribution of known Paleo-Indian projectile points from sites along Richland and Chambers Creeks and the adjacent Trinity River drainage is shown in Figure 18-2. As has been noted in Chapter 7 of Volume I, the distribution of Paleo-Indian diagnostics probably tells us less about early settlement patterns than it does about which physiographic locations are most conducive to the exposure and discovery of these artifacts. The sites in Figure 18-2 are invariably situated on either Pleistocene terraces or upland landforms. In most instances, the surfaces of these landforms have been essentially nonaggrading thoroughout the known period of human occupation. The inner valleys of creeks and rivers were no doubt occupied, but Paleo-Indian sites in these locations either were eroded away by post-Pleistocene valley incision or buried deeply by Holocene floodplain sedimentation. It should also be noted that archaeological investigations and collector activities have not been uniform across the area shown in Figure 18-2. Because of the limited and biased nature of the present data base, the Paleo-Indian occupation of the Project area remains poorly understood. Information concerning much of the Archaic period in the Project area is only slightly more complete than that for the Paleo- Indian period. Acceptable radiocarbon dates for all but the Transitional Archaic period derive exclusively from creek bank sites where diagnostic artifacts were rare or absent. Therefore, the time spans assigned to the Archaic period subdivisions are largely hypothetical. This is most obvious in the case of the Early Archaic period (ca. 6000 B.C. - 3000 B.C.). Unlike the preceding Paleo- Indian period, diagnostic artifacts assignable to the Early Archaic occupations of the Project area are virtually unknown. Although Lynott (1981:103) has suggested that the San Patrice projectile point type is diagnostic of this time period in North Texas, this type is considered here to be related to the late Paleo- Indian period. A lack of dated Early Archaic assemblages in East Texas prevents the cross dating of artifact types to that area. Of the artifact types considered by Prewitt (1981) to date the 6000 B.C. - 3000 B.C. time period in Central Texas, only the Wells projectile point and the Clear Fork gouge were recognized within Project area assemblages. Both of these artifact types were very rare, and this may indicate only limited use of the Project area during this time period. However, it seems more likely that this lack of evidence is in part due to our present inability to recognize the local Early Archaic artifact styles.

Locations of sites with Middle Archaic period occupations found within the Richland/Chambers Reservoir. MIDDLE ARCHAIC 3000 B.C. TO 1000 B.C. In Eastern U. S. prehistory, the Archaic stage has been identified as a period during which mobile bands of hunter- gatherers foraged for plant and animal resources (Willey and Phillips 1958). It is also a time during which cultures "settled in" to their respective environmental niches (Caldwell 1958). These statements are generally applicable for the RCAP, although our assessments for the Middle Archaic are handicapped by a limited amount of data. Significant deposits were present at only four of the mitigated sites: 41FT158, 41FT200 (Hardy), 41NV96, and 41NV160 (Figure 18-3). However, at 41 FT158 and 41NV160 the Middle Archaic materials were mixed with substantial deposits of later occupations, limiting the usefulness of these sites for temporal comparisons. The principal Middle Archaic data from these sites consists of projectile points, stone tools, and associated lithic debris. In addition, minimal economic data are available from three of these sites. Less intense occupations were observed at two other sites, but these materials only consisted of a few diagnostic tools or projectile points in contexts mixed with later artifacts. Consequently, for this discussion we rely upon the data from the sites with major occupations to form our conclusions, The environment during this period appears to have been relatively moister than later periods. Since the paleoenvironmental data for the Project are not available for earlier periods, we are unable to draw specific comparisons to previous environments. In all likelihood during the Early Archaic, Texas was experiencing the Altithermal, a large-scale dry climatic episode observed over much of North America (Antevs 1955; Delcourt and Delcourt 1980), although data to support this are few (Gunn and Mahula 1977). The moist conditions of the Middle Archaic would have created a savannah environment in much of the area around the Project that today is covered with tall grass prairie. Specifically, the pre-Euro-American composition of the Post Oak Savannah, consisting of oak and hickory trees interspersed with prairies, is believed to be an accurate model for the area surrounding much of the reservoir during the Middle Archaic. The Middle Archaic appears to be the earliest period for which coeval floodplain deposits are currently exposed in the channels of Richland and Chambers Creeks. Not surprisingly, this is the first period for which both terrace and creekbank site locations have been documented. Unfortunately, neither of the two creekbank sites (41FT180 and 41NV139) with archaeological remains radiocarbon dated to this period were investigated beyond their initial testing. The only evidence from Middle Archaic creekside occupations consists of small rock lined hearths and substantial deposits of discarded mussel shells. The only additional data pertaining to Middle Archaic settlement patterns is the frequency of cherts from site deposits. Grady (1978) has argued that the frequency of chert, which is assumed to be imported into the eastern part of Texas, is a good indicator of the range of interaction of prehistoric groups. Based on his study of East and Central Texas samples, he proposed that a reduction in chert frequencies over time represented a decrease in group territory size. More local quartzites were used in the Late Archaic compared with the Early and Middle Archaic since the reduced territory sizes brought fewer people into contact with imported

The nearest large outcrop of chert is from along the Brazos River, and most of the imported chert for the RCAP came from this area (see Chapter 16). Figure 18-4 graphs the frequency of chert as a percentage of all raw materiais in the lithic debris assemblage from certain RCAP sites. A high frequency of chert, accounting for more than 60%, is observed for the two Middle Archaic sites, Hardy and 41NV96. A marked decrease in the frequency of chert is observed for later periods, and the RCAP data show a similar trend to that noted by Grady. However, the occurrence of chert does not in itself indicate what is happening in terms of group territory size. Instead of a reduction in group territory, the results could indicate decreased interaction and exchange with neighboring groups. An indication of which case is correct can be made by examining the known spatial distribution of Pisgah Ridge chert projectile points in North Central Texas. As discussed in Chapter 16, this distinctive chert outcrops 10 km south of the reservoir and is unique to that area. Figure 16-6 displays the spatial distribution of Pisgah Ridge chert projectile points. By comparing the distribution of expanding stem dart points, indicating Middle Archaic occupations, with arrow points from Late Prehistoric occupations, a clear decrease in areal extent is seen. At the Middle Archaic period sites, few data on internal site organization and activity are available. The principal features encountered were small rock concentrations randomly distributed over the scraped portion of the site. These features were most frequent at the Hardy site, and were proposed to be either subsurface hearths or roasting pits. It seemed doubtful, however, that these features could be subsurface hearths since most were encountered more than 50 cm below the ground surface. The roasting pit hypothesis seems more reasonable since this activity would be expected to have taken place below the ground surface. Complicating this interpretation, however, is the fact that these features were different in some respects from the roasting pits identified at many other sites in the Project area. Specifically, the features at the Hardy site consisted of large pieces of Wilcox 235 sandstone, the local stone available for the activity, concentrated on a horizontal plane 40 to 60 cm below the ground surface. At first, it was thought that these materials were placed on older, and lower, surfaces than are present today. However, careful inspection of the soil profile showed the normal A and B horizons at Hardy were formed on a stable Pleistocene age terrace deposit. A more likely interpretation, then, is that these features were roasting pits used for a short term, perhaps single, episode of use. Unlike the roasting pits observed at other sites, these were not extensively re-used and the rock remained in the features after use. In the other roasting pits, large pieces of rock were scavenged and reused in later roasting episodes, resulting in only small, exfoliated pieces remaining today. Burned rock concentrations like those at site the Hardy site were not common at other Project area sites. They are, however, known from several sites in the middle Trinity River basin and in adjacent areas. One oval-shaped concentration of fire cracked pebbles and bumed clay was discovered at the Wild Bull site at Cedar Creek Lake (Story 1965), and a total of seven similar features was recorded at the Pecan Springs site at Lake Bardwell (Sorrow 1966). Test excavations at site 41FT48 in the Big Brown Lignite Prospect identified three circular concentrations of thermally altered sandstone and quartzite cobbles (Wooldridge 1979), Bumed rock concentrations appear to be even more common in the upper Navasota River drainage, where they have been reported at Lake Limestone (Mallouf 1979) and from the Jewett Mine Project area (Espey-Huston and Associates 1982; Day 1984; Fields 1984). The largest sample of these features was from site 41LN178 (Day 1984), where most were thought to date from the Archaic. With respect to Middle Archaic demographics, if we assume that the number of sites is a reflection of population size, then a case can be made for a relatively low level of population. This is seen by the comparison of the number of Middle Archaic sites to the number of Late Archaic/Transitional period sites. Compared with the seven Middle Archaic sites, 15 Late Archaic/Transitional period sites are noted. A potentially biasing problem in this type of comparsion is the length of time involved during each period. However, in this instance the Late Archaic is actually shorter by 300 years than the Middle Archaic, indicating that the higher numbers of sites cannot be attributed to this factor. Another potential problem is the frequency with which groups moved from one site to another. Groups that move more frequently will produce greater numbers of sites (Prewitt 1983). However, as we argue for later periods in the RCAP, group movement seems tc have decreased through time, and this factor if anything should inflate the number of Middle Archaic sites relative to Late Archaic sites. Consequently, the data are interpreted to indicate a low Middle Archaic population. Technological advances made over time in the RCAP are shown in Figure 18-5. The major hunting technology indicated for the Middle Archic period is the spear and atlatl, which were inherited from earlier periods. Certainly other technologies must have been employed using perishable materials such as reed baskets or “wooden tools, but these items have not been preserved. Consequently, our assessment of Middle Archaic technology is necessarily simplistic. Dart point styles diagnostic of this time period are Bulverde, Carrollton, Yarbrough, and perhaps Dawson. In addition, Waco sinkers and Clear Fork gouges are also present. A variety of stone tools is observed from sites of this period (Table 18-3). Correcting for the lower sample sizes for sites of this period, the variety of tool forms seems similar to that observed in later periods. Looking at the relative occurrence of major tool categories among Middle Archaic sites(Table 18-4), some differences are noted. At both the Hardy site and 41NV96, where sufficient samples for comparison were recovered, projectile points are similar in frequency. However, the relative occurrence of bifacial versus unifacial tools demonstrates considerable variability between the two sites. Work requiring bificially made tools was undertaken nearly twice as commonly at the Hardy site (41FT200), whereas activities using unifacial tools were more commonly undertaken at 41NV96. This suggests that

Comparison of late Holocene climatic, geological, and cultural sequences. some degree of site specialization existed during the Middle Archaic. A small amount of Middle Archaic economic data are available. The frequencies of faunal remains are listed in Table 18-5, and show that sample sizes are quite small. Differential species preservation (Carbone and Keel 1985) is a potential problem in the data. Nonetheless, the relatively high occurrence of turtle from several different proveniences at Hardy suggests that a specialized exploitation for this species may have taken place. Certainly the location of this site on a terrace remnant in the floodplain of Richland Creek would have offered advantages for collection of this aquatic species. Other species that were found at the site include cottontail rabbit and unidentified bird. At 41NV96 a small amount of fish and a larger amount of deer were found. Since both sites also have occupations during subsequent periods, it cannot be established if these faunal remains are exclusively associated with the Middle Archaic occupation, so our conclusions concerning economic behavior are speculative to a degree. Nonetheless, a tendency for site specialization is suggested. A minimal amount of floral remains was obtained from the Hardy site (Table 18-6). Since only .6 grams of carbonized botanical remains were recovered, these have not been quantified in the table but instead are listed as presence or absence. From Hardy, hickory nutshell and an unidentified rhizome were recovered. These few data generally reflect the floral remains that are observed most frequently from later periods. It is interesting that Psoralea tubers were not found since this is the second most common plant remain from most other sites. However, considering the low frequency of all plant materials from the site, this may be due more to sampling vagaries than reality. TRANSITIONAL/LATE ARCHAIC: 1000 B.C. TO A.D. 700 The data base available for this period is significantly better than for the Middle Archaic. In addition to a general Late Archaic period, we are also able to discriminate a Transitional Archaic phase at some sites. The identifying characteristics of this phase, as outlined in Chapter 15, consist of the presence of shell tempered ceramics and/or the construction of a large depression, commonly referred to as a “Wylie focus pit.” Aside from these few characteristics, the sites are similar to the Late Archaic sites within the reservoir, and in all probability the people responsible for these traits also formed the archaeological deposits at many of the other sites. Unless ceramics or a large depression are encountered, we are not able to discriminate this fact. The dates for the Transitional Archaic phase indicate that this period of time extended from 200 B.C. to A.D. 700, or the latter half of the Late Archaic period. The environment during the Late Archaic appears to have been much the same as for the Middle Archaic. Figure 18-5 shows this time period as one of increasingly moister conditions. However, this is largely speculative and in need of testing by analysis of additional pollen cores. In terms of the specific. environment around the reservoir, we have suggested that a savannah condition existed. The floral and faunal resources of the Post Oak Savannah would have been found around much of the Project area, and it is possible that these conditions covered much of the area today occupied by the Tall Grass Prairie in Texas. The floodplain of Richland Creek was rapidly alluviating and would have created a highly varied vegetational mosaic in different stages of succession.

Figure 18-6 shows the types of occupation based on excavations conducted at each site. Major occupations were recorded for seven sites, minor occupations for six, and creek bank occupations for two others. Transitional Archaic deposits consisting of shell tempered pottery and/or large depressions were observed at four sites. Concerning Transitional/Late Archaic (hereafter referred to only as Late Archaic) settlement patterns, several lines of evidence suggest changes from the previous Middle Archaic. First, Figure 18-4, showing the frequency of chert usage in the lithic assemblages from sites, and data presented in Chapter 16, demonstrate that during the Late Archaic the percentage of chert in the lithic assemblages decreased markedly. In addition, Chapter 16 demonstrates that the distribution of Pisgah Ridge chert also shows a significant decrease in spatial distribution. Both of these changes are interpreted to be indicative of decreased territorial size in comparison with the preceding Middle Archaic period. A second line of evidence suggesting a settlement pattern change is the occurrence of the large depressions at the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch sites.

In addition, these pits were used as cemeteries. The locations of these features probably indicate territorial “tension zones” where local bands came into contact more often, due to the restricted distribution of food resources or to cultural factors. Inherent in this interpretation is the assumption that the large pits signified more than feasting, processing, and burial centers but also served as symbols of interband reciprocity and as territorial markers. The occurrence of these structures is hypothesized to be an adaptive response to increased stress upon critical food resources as a result of decreased group territories. Combined with the reduced size of group territories is an apparent increase in population size. This is seen in the greater number of sites illustrated in Figure 18-6. Although as argued previously, site components cannot be translated directly into numbers of people, the greatly increased numbers of sites argue strongly for a higher population. In addition, evidence from some of the sites indicates that large areas were occupied (e.g., 41NV96). Whether this is due to site reoccupation or large resident populations cannot be determined, although we suggest that larger group sizes coupled with long durations of occupation was responsible for the observed pattern. Prewitt (1983:216) has suggested that instead of subjective appraisals of population size,

Although his effort is certainly an improvement over more subjective estimates, it assumes rigorous temporal control. While this may be the case in Central Texas where rockshelters and other stratigraphic contexts have provided good temporal control, this is not the case in North Central Texas. Despite a few radiocarbon dates from Project sites which are relevant to this period, the overall time frame is still only an estimate. Consequently, only a subjective appraisal of population density can be provided here. Several significant changes in technology occurred during the Late Archaic (Figure 18-5). First, ceramics appeared for the first time. Sherds of a thin, shell tempered ware that has been radiocarbon dated between A.D. 200 and 700 were found in the large depression at the Adams Ranch site. The occurrence of these ceramics is enigmatic for North Central Texas since shell tempered wares have long been assumed to be associated with much later groups (Lynott 1981; Skinner et al. 1969:64-67). Story (1981:146) has also observed that ceramics appear within East Texas during this time period and has speculated that there are two separate traditions. A sandy paste tradition occurs in the southem part of East Texas and a grog (and sometimes bone) tempered tradition occurs in the northern part of the area (see also Shafer 1973:27-33, 1975). Story (1981:146) further argues that the ceramic traditions reflect distinctive cultural groups, both of which constructed small, conical burial mounds. The Coral Snake Mound (Jensen 1968; McClurkan et al. 1966) on the Louisiana side of the Sabine River, the Jonas Short Mound (Jelks 1965:22-52; McClurkan et al. 1980) on the Angelina River, and possibly the Westerman Mound (Story 1981:146) in the Neches River drainage are associated with the southern group.

Similarities to Marksville mounds are notable, and limited amounts of Marksville pottery have been recovered from sites of the southern group. It is generally thought that these mounds reflect the emergence of more complexly organized local groups participating in a Middle Woodland exchange network, rather than a population intrusion from the east (Schambach 1982:180; Shafer 1973:32; Story 1981:146, 1985:53). The RCAP data suggest that a third early ceramic tradition, probably representing a cultural group responsible for construction of large "Wylie focus pits," existed on the Prairie Margin. The extent of these ceramics beyond the immediate Project area is presently unknown. Comparably early ceramics have not yet been documented for either Central or North Central Texas. Frequencies of lithic tools and other major categories are listed in Table 18-3 from selected Late Archaic components. Since the goal of comparison in the table is to isolate trends that are indicative of specific periods, only those components with relatively unmixed deposits have been included. This has resulted in only three sites being used for the Late Archaic: Bird Point Island (41FT201, Feature 1, Zone 3), Adams Ranch (41NV177, Feature 1, Zone 3), and 41FT199. The individual sample sizes from each site are small, and it is difficult to make conclusions about differences in tool forms or overall changes in tool diversity among periods. The tools that are present tend to be those most common at other sites, and this suggests that a similar range of forms might be observed if sample sizes were larger. Tentatively, the existing data do not suggest a change in tool types during the Late Archaic in comparison with other periods. Conceming the relative occurrence of major tool categories (Table 18-4), it is difficult to make comparisons since only one Late Archaic site is available for comparison (41FT199). However, from this site the percentages of projectile points, bifacial tools, and unifacial tools ‘are similar to the Middle Archaic 41NV96 and to most of the Late Prehistoric sites. In addition to ceramics, the technological innovations of large scale earth oven roasting seem to have developed. Whether this is actually a technological innovation or simply an increase in the scale of this activity is not clear. We have previously suggested that Middle Archaic populations were conducting this activity, but ona much smaller scale. The Late Archaic data suggest that roasting activities increased markedly. This is most clearly seen in the large depressions at the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch site, and argues for an economic change to a greater reliance upon plant versus animal resources. Although more faunal remains were recovered from Late Archaic contexts, overall they remain poorly preserved. Faunal remains were preserved in definable Late Archaic contexts only from three sites: 41FT199, Bird Point Island (41FT201), and Adams Ranch (41NV177). The samples from Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch come from Zone 3 of Feature 1, the lowest zone of the large depressions. Although other sites with Late Archaic occupations possessed faunal remains, these materials could not be convincingly placed into only a Late Archaic context and therefore have been excluded from consideration. As with the Middle Archaic, the relative abundance of species varies among sites (Table 18-5). Deer is the most common species at 41FT199 and Bird Point Island, whereas turtle is most frequent from Adams Ranch. Generally, a wider variety of species is represented compared with the Middle Archaic sites; however slightly better preservation is at least a partial cause of this trend. Since floral remains were collected from flotation analysis of feature contents and several sites contained features which could be

Locations of sites with Transitional/Late Archaic period occupations within the Richland/Chambers Reservoir. dated by charcoal or chronologically sensitive artifacts, we have more sites with macrobotanical data to compare (Table 18-6). Faunal remains, in contrast, were collected from features as well as habitation areas. In general, few bones were found in features and most fauna came from habitation areas. The frequencies of floral remains are quantified in Table 18-6 if they cumulatively weigh more than 1 g and come from more than four features. This procedure was employed to eliminate small samples that might not be representative. The species present in the smaller samples are denoted by an "X" to signify only that the plant was present. In general, representation of all six major groupings of plant remains from the Project area are present in the Late Archaic components. The consistent occurrence of hickory nutshell, Psoralea tubers, and seeds from all Late Archaic sites with any macrobotanical remains suggest these items were important in the prehistoric diet. Acorns, pecans, and rhizome remains were found from fewer features and may have been less important. However, considering the differential preservation of plant species in the archaeological record (Yarnell 1982), this assessment is at best a rough estimate. Identifiable seed types were found from the Late Archaic context at Bird Point Island (41FT201). The identification of the seeds is listed in Table 18-7. From Zone 3 of Feature 1, 17 identifiable seeds were recovered. The majority of these were sumpweed, with lesser representations of poison ivy, smartweed, sumac, and vetch or peavine. Sumpweed is present in sufficient quantities that it likely represents economic use of this plant, whereas the other plant remains may be incidental inclusions. Particularly, the poison ivy seeds imply some degree of accidental carbonization of seeds. These few seed remains from the Late Archaic sites provide only a glimpse of the variety of plant remains that were undoubtedly exploited during this period. Nonetheless, they suggest an increasingly broad based exploitation system that was dominated by a few key plant foods: hickory nuts, seeds, and Psoralea tubers. RICHLAND CREEK PHASE: A.D. 700 TO A.D. 900 The archaeological record provides somewhat better preserved components for the Richland Creek phase compared with previous periods. In particular the extensively investigated component at the Irvine site (41NV182) provides a good sample for this phase. Sites with Richland Creek phase occupations are shown in Figure 18-7, and overall, fewer sites are recorded for this period. However, when a correction is made for the decreased time frame of this phase (i.e., 200 years versus 1700 years for the Transitional/Late Archaic), a greater population level is likely represented. Major occupations were observed at four sites, less intense occupations at three, and creek bank activity at one. This phase occurs within Environmental Period II, a time of slowly drying climate (Figure 18-5). Since this trend appears to have begun first in the southern part of the state and slowly spread. northward, it is not clear exactly when the impact was felt in the Project area. Palynological analysis of bogs nearby the Project (see Chapter 5, Volume I) suggests that drier conditions began in the area around A.D. 500. However, geological studies of floodplain sediments from within the reservoir indicate that lower rates of deposition in the valley of Richland Creek did not occur until later, sometime after A.D. 800 but before A.D. 1170.

If we risk the tautology of using the large numbers of sites during this phase to influence our decision, a continued moist condition can be suggested. The evidence in terms of Richland Creek phase settlement patterns comes principally from studies of chert distribution within and around the RCAP (see Chapter 16, this volume). As Figure 18-4 demonstrates, a reduction in the percentage of cherts (assumed to be imported) is first detected in the Late Archaic, but this trend continues during the Richland Creek phase. This evidence suggests decreased interaction with groups to the west and probably a reduction in group territorial size. The distribution of Pisgah Ridge chert projectile points shown in Figure 16-6, offers additional information on Richland Creek phase settlement patterns. As noted previously, during the Late Archaic this marker chert showed a significant decrease in areal distribution compared with the Middle Archaic. A further decrease is noted for the Late Prehistoric period overall, and suggests that Richland Creek group territory size decreased. Data on intrasite feature and artifact patterns are available for this phase from the extensive investigations undertaken at the Irvine site. Based on the spatial distribution of A horizon artifacts (see Chapter 12, this volume), scraping was selectively undertaken to expose features which are only visible in the subsurface B horizon. On the basis of this information, three types of features were observed at the site: large pits (generally larger than 9 m in greatest dimension), small pits (between .5 and 3 m in diameter), and post holes. The post holes were found to occur either isolated or ina cluster. At first, the cluster of post holes was suspected to be the location of house, and it was thought that we were simply unable to detect the remainder of the house pattern. However, subsequent work at other sites in the reservoir has shown that this same intrasite pattern existed during other time periods, and we 2 1 1 1 1 i 2 1 3 2 1 47 166 5 7 4 4 2 5 10 2 82 9 2 li 3 11 4 3 1 31 19 72 8 3 205 208 2 114 12 now believe that a complete circular or rectangular arrangement of post holes is not present. Instead, the post hole cluster was the entire pattern, and we simply do not have a neat, circular or square arrangement of post holes. This indicates that instead of the substantially built structures observed at Bird Point Island, less substantial and more impermanent shelters were constructed at the Irvine site. Perhaps something existed on the order of the structures described by Sjoberg (1953:287) for the Tonkawa. These were described as "brush shelters,” with a haphazard framework of poles and branches used to form a cone-shaped structure, with grass thatching and hides placed over top (Sjoberg 1953:287). An additional feature that was encountered at this site is an organic darkening of the soil, or a midden. This is the earliest time period for which this characteristic has been found, and suggests that more intense activity took place at the site during the Richland Creek phase. Specific tasks that could result in this type of soil staining include cooking, food processing, and trash disposal (Cook and Heizer 1965). This evidence, in combination with the presence of the post hole cluster which likely represents a structure location, argues for longer use of the site than occurred during the Late Archaic. More specifically, a semi-sedentary habitation is suggested. This shift to a greater degree of sedentism may be the consequence of the decreased group territorial sizes; this issue is addressed in more detail in a later section of this chapter. An important technological innovation that occurred within this phase was the introduction of the bow and arrow (Figure 18- 5). However, dart points are also found and indicate that both the dart and the atlati as well as the bow and arrow were used. Ceramic containers continued to be used, and are more common in the overall assemblage (Table 18-8). The large pits at the site indicate that subsurface roasting was also undertaken, although these features are considerably smaller than the “Wylie focus”

However, the pits at the Irvine site possess greater numbers of artifacts, particularly fire cracked rock, and indicate more intensive use. The frequencies of major artifact classes recovered from the sites are shown in Table 18-3. Two sites (Irvine and 41FT161B) are used for comparison, since sufficient samples were obtained from both. The frequencies show that most major tool categories are present. Of significance is the first occurrence of drills/awls in the Project lithic assemblages. These tools are a marker of the Late Prehistoric period. Table 18-4, showing the relative frequencies of projectile points, bifacial tools, and unifacial tools, indicates no significant differences are apparent between the two sites. Slightly more bifacial tools are found at the Irvine site; however, this change is small and may not be meaningful. The ratio of these three tool groupings suggests a similar tool kit assemblage to that of preceding Late Archaic. A change in ceramics is observed during this phase. Instead of the shell tempered ware of the Late Archaic/Transitional phase, two new tempering traditions appear. One consists of a sandy paste ware with no surface decoration. The other ceramic tempering tradition is grog, grit, and bone on vessels that were decorated with punctations and incisions. Several of the sherds show design elements similar to parts of the motif on type Canton Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962). - Identifiable faunal remains from Richland Creek phase sites are shown in Table 18-5. Features 16 and 24 from the Little Cedar Creek site have been included since diagnostic artifacts from this context place the feature into the Richland Creek phase. Generally, the samples for the three components are small and suggest a broad based exploitation with deer and turtle the most common species. Given the much larger meat weight of whitetail deer, this animal was certainly more important in the prehistoric diet than turtle. The three components also indicate some degree of site Table 18-8 COMPARISON OF FINISHED TOOLS TO CERAMICS FOR LATE PREHISTORIC PHASES Number Finished Tools!

For example, at 41FT161B deer and cottontail rabbit are most common; at Little Cedar Creek deer, turtle, and fish are important; and finally at the Irvine site deer and turtle are most frequent. The distribution of floral remains among Richland Creek phase components is listed in Table 18-6. In addition to the samples used for the faunal comparison, Feature 1 from Polecat Hill has been included. This feature contained a sandy paste ceramic sherd and likely dates to this phase. The very small sample of plant remains from all contexts of this phase hampers substantive interpretations. In fact, the only reasonable sample was obtained from the Irvine site, and the species present in the other samples are noted by an "X" indicating mere presence. Nonetheless, hickory nutshell occurs most frequently, and indicates this plant food was important in the prehistoric diet. In addition, acorns and Psoralea occur in significant quantities, and these were also most likely important components. Table 18-9 displays the percentage of features with the presence of each floral remain from the Irvine site, the only component with a sufficient sample for this type of comparison. This method of comparison is less sensitive to differential preservation since it is looking strictly at the percentage of species _ present among all features from the site. The results show that hickory, the most common species by weight, is also the most frequent plant among the features. Acorns and Psoralea are also common in many features, where seeds and pecan shells are less frequent. It appears that the major plant food items in the prehistoric diet were hickory nuts, acorms, and Psoralea tubers. However, bias in terms of species preservation (Minnis 1981) is certainly a potential complicating factor that must be kept in mind. Only eight seeds were identifiable from Richland Creek contexts (Table 18-7). Four of these were from the Irvine site and consisted of spurge, goosefoot, and vetch or peavine. Two identifiable seeds were recovered from the Little Cedar Creek site; both were vetch or peavine. On the basis of such a limited sampled few conclusions concerning economic behavior can be made. It is not clear if these seeds were accidentally included into the archaeological record or represent by-products of food preparation. However, the vetch or peavine seeds consistently occur at many sites within the RCAP, and this pattern lends support to their being a probable food resource. ROUND PRAIRIE PHASE: A.D. 900 TO 1300 The Round Prairie phase components provide the best samples of artifacts and features of any time period within the RCAP. In addition, the extensive excavations conducted at the Bird Point Island site have resulted in substantial information on intrasite patterning of a Round Prairie phase community. Consequently, these combined data sets permit more detailed statements to be made on prehistoric lifeways during this phase. Eight sites are observed during this phase: three major occupations, four minor occupations, and a single creek bank location (Figure 18-8). This phase occurs during the Environmental Period II, a time of slowly increasing aridity. As argued earlier, this dry period is part of a large-scale trend that began first in the southern part of Texas and slowly spread northward, The time of arrival of this event in the reservoir is uncertain, and consequently it is difficult to model the area's vegetation. In all likelihood, the savannah environment that is proposed to have dominated the area covered today by the Blackland Prairie would have been declining. Based on records of historical droughts, this shift in vegetation from woodland to grassland would have begun on the western margin of this biotic zone and proceeded eastward. Since the RCAP is located on the eastern margin of this zone, the full impact of the drying trend may not have been felt until after the Round Prairie phase. Several lines of evidence pertaining to Round Prairie phase settlement patterns are discussed here. The first is the relatively high number of components relating to this phase. When the numbers of sites are corrected for the temporal duration of the phase, an overall decrease in components is seen when compared with the preceding Richland Creek phase. More specifically, eight components are observed for the 400 years of the Round Prairie phase, in contrast to the eight components of the 200 year span of the Richland Creek phase. However, it should be pointed out that these temporal ranges are only estimates based primarily on radiocarbon dates. Despite having several dates for each phase, the differences in length of occupation may be due in part to our inability to accurately measure phase lengths. It is perhaps safest to conclude that the number of sites is comparable to the previous Richland Creek phase, and that a similar population level existed. A second line of evidence that pertains to Round Prairie phase settlement patterns is the percentage of cherts in the lithic

As Figure 18-4 indicates, lower levels of chert utilization are evident, and a reduced range of exploitation and/or interaction is indicated in comparison with the Richland Creek phase. The distribution of Pisgah Ridge chert provides some clues as to the nature of the reduction in cherts. As Figure 16-6 shows, and as previously indicated for the Richland Creek phase, a decrease in the distribution of this chert is apparent for the Late Prehistoric period in general. Unfortunately, finer details cannot be provided, and it is impossible to determine when the reduction occurred within the Late Prehistoric period. Nonetheless, the distribution of Pisgah Ridge chert argues for a reduction in territorial size from the Late Archaic. A final line of evidence providing data that pertain to settlement patterns is the intrasite community patterning at the Bird Point Island site. Extensive investigations were undertaken at this site, and a complex pattern of site use and reuse was outlined. For the Round Prairie phase, a sedentary hamlet consisting of three houses was recorded (see Chapter 14, Volume II). Although there is some question as to whether all three houses were occupied simultaneously, the evidence conclusively demonstrates that substantial occupation at this site did occur during the Round Prairie phase, This contrasts with the intrasite pattern noted at the Irvine site, where numerous features and scattered post holes were located, but no complete house pattern was found. In Chapter 14 of Volume I, the Bird Point Island community pattern is interpreted as evidence of a sedentary settlement pattern during this phase. It must be pointed out, however, that a comparable level of intrasite patterning is not seen at other Round Prairie phase sites. At Polecat Hill (41NV203) this may be due in part to the type of occupation that took place. As argued in Chapter 13 of this volume, the site appears to have been used for specialized activities such as overnight camping or seasonal collecting. At the Adams Ranch site, on the other hand, this cannot be the reason for not finding complete house patterns. The site is on a landform similar to Bird Point Island and extensive investigations were instrumental in locating significant deposits related to a Round Prairie phase occupation. However, a pattern similar to that observed at the Richland Creek phase Irvine site was found, consisting of a few large pits, a few smaller pits, and clustered as well as isolated post holes. No complete house patterns were uncovered. In terms of site habitation, a pattern more comparable to the semi-sedentary occupation observed at the Irvine site is suggested. It is important to point out that the radiocarbon dates for the Round Prairie phase occupation at the Adams Ranch site suggest occupation between A.D. 800 and 1000, or a period from the later part of the Richland Creek phase into the earlier part of the Round Prairie phase. All of this evidence provides considerable insight into settlement patterns during the Round Prairie phase. The high density of sites, combined with the evidence of decreased availablity of imported cherts and a reduced distribution of Pisgah Ridge chert, argues for a centrally based settlement pattern suggested for the Richland Creek phase. Under this system, food resources are moved from their source to the population. The sedentary habitation observed at Bird Point Island no doubt resulted in the intensification of this type of organization, whereby most of the food supply was brought to the site. The large numbers of roasting pits distributed around the houses suggest that considerable amounts of food were being roasted. Much of this may have been processed for storage. No new technologies are apparent in the archaeological record for the Round Prairie phase, and all of the technological achievements of the previous time periods were still used (Figure

Summary 18-5). These include the bow and arrow, dart and atlatl, ceramic containers, and large-scale earth oven roasting. What is perhaps most significant here is the continued use of dart points concurrently with the bow and arrow. This is a continuation of a trend observed during the Richland Creek phase, and irrefutable evidence of the concurrent use of these two technologies comes from pits within House 1 at Bird Point Island. Inside this structure, a concentric pattern of artifact and feature clustering was observed. Dart points made up two thirds of the projectile points observed from both features and A horizon artifacts. Further, they were the dominant projectile point type from features within the house. Their occurrence in this context suggests they were not strictly projectile points but were instead multi-purpose tools (cf., Ahler 1970). Unfortunately, most of these tools were made from quartzite and could not be examined for microwear to indicate the types of uses. Frequencies of specific tool types are listed in Table 18-3. Samples are generally large and some statements can be made about inter-component differences. Table 18-4 shows the relative occurrence of projectile points, bifacial tools, and unifacial tools among the three Round Prairie phase components. The Adams Ranch and Bird Point Island sites are similar in frequency, while Polecat Hill is markedly different. The difference between the sites is observed in a higher frequency of unifacial tools and a lower incidence of projectile points from Polecat Hill. The specific unifacial tools that are more common at Polecat Hill are scrapers and notches. And finally, Table 18-8 compares the frequencies of finished tools and ceramics. In this case, Adams Ranch and Polecat Hill are similar, and Bird Point Island is considerably different, showing significantly more ceramics. In fact, the higher frequency of ceramics at this site is part of a trend that continues into the following St. Elmo phase, where ceramics are even more frequent. An increased usage of ceramic vessels for food preparation and/or storage is implied. : In terms of artifact styles, many of the forms popular during . previous periods seem to have persisted. However, more Alba style arrow points are evident, while the Steiner and Scallom varieties of the previous phase are relatively less frequent. The distinctive awl/drill continued to be used. Ceramic decorations of incision and punctation remain most common, with the design element configurations showing greatest similarity to Canton Incised (Suhm and Krieger 1962). The faunal assemblage from this phase is the best for any time period in the RCAP, although, the numbers of identifiable elements remain small. Table 18-5 displays the relative frequencies of fauna by component. Features 8 and 21 from the Irvine site, which dated to this period, have been included. Two patterns emerge from the data. First, Adams Ranch and Bird Point Island are similar, both showing a wide variety of exploited species with deer the most important. The second pattern is the similarity between the Irvine site and Polecat Hill. At both sites, deer decreases markedly while turtle increases substantially. Fish is also more common at the Irvine site. Some indication as to what these patterns might be reflecting in terms of patterns of faunal explotation can be seen by comparing the contents of Features 8 and 21 at the Irvine site, dated to the Round Prairie phase, to the remainder of the data from this site, attributed to the Richland Creek phase. This comparison indicates that despite the temporal differences between the two contexts, no significant difference in the pattern of faunal exploitation is apparent. This suggests that in addition to, and perhaps outweighing, any temporal trends that may exist in species selection (cf., Smith 1975), an opportunistic factor is also at play. The natural presence of species immediately surrounding a given site seems to have determined more the pattern of exploitation than the time period of the occupation. In addition to the above trends, bison and.jackrabbit appear to be slightly more common. This supports the environmental interpretation that the climate was becoming increasingly dry during this time. Both bison and jackrabbit prefer grasslands, and the increased incidence of these species suggests that more grassland area was in close proximity to the reservoir, which is the expected vegetational change due to drier conditions. 245 The average percentage of floral remains from Round Prairie phase sites are listed in Table 18-6. Again some of the best preserved samples of any site are available for components during this phase. The sample from the feature at Polecat Hill has not been included since it contained some sandy paste ceramics and may date to an earlier phase. In addition, Features 8 and 21 from the Irvine site have been included, although the frequencies are sufficiently small that only basic presence or absence of a given species can be obtained. The relative frequencies of major floral groups show that a wide variety of plant species was exploited. The dominant food remain by weight was hickory nutshell, followed by pecan, Psoralea, and seeds. Table 18-9, providing an alternative method of viewing species occurrence, shows the percent of all features with the presence of each species. Only components with more than 15 features are used for this comparison. This method of assessing species importance shows that hickory is consistently found in all features from both sites. At Bird Point Island Psoralea occurs nearly as frequently, but at Adams Ranch it is found in only approximately half of the features. Of potential significance is the increased occurrence of seeds at both components in comparison with the data from the Richland Creek phase Irvine site. In fact, in comparison with the following St. Elmo phase, the incidence of seeds is greater for the Round Prairie phase components. The specific seeds types found at these two sites are listed in Table 18-7. From both sites a variety of seed types is evident, and at both the dominant seed is sumpweed. As Asch and Asch (1978) argue, this species does not occur naturally in sufficiently large stands to have been a major dietary contributor, but would have best been an important supplement. Vetch or peavine is next most frequent at Bird Point Island, and either or both of these species seem to also have been important as supplements to the prehistoric diet. The other seed types are present in low frequencies, and it is difficult to determine if they were of economic importance or represent accidental inclusion into hearths and roasting pits. Interestingly, several of these species occur at other archaeological sites in eastern North America in significant quantities, indicating their economic importance (Ford 1981), and they could have been important food sources at Richland Creek but simply have not been well preserved in the archaeological record. ST. ELMO PHASE: (A.D. 1300 TO A.D. 1650) A reduced number of sites dating to the St. Elmo phase is noted in the reservoir (Figure 18-9). Major occupations are noted at two sites, minor occupations at two, and creek bank activity at one. Despite the reduced number of sites, extensive work has been conducted at two sites (Bird Point Island and Little Cedar Creek), and the data from the St. Elmo components at these sites provides substantial insight into economic strategies and intrasite community patterning during this phase. Consequently, these two sites are used to model most of the following statements about lifeways. The environment during this phase is proposed to have been significantly drier in comparison to previous periods. Overbank flooding along Richland Creek had virtually ceased, and a significant decrease in rainfall is the postulated cause. It must be stressed that these statements are relative, and that the decrease in rainfall was lower in relationship to previous periods. In fact, the data from the RCAP indicate that the climate during this period may not have been significantly different from today's. Several significant vegetational changes within the RCAP can be assumed to have occurred as a result of the climatic change. First, the lack of deposition on the floodplain of Richland Creek and its major tributaries would have permitted a climax forest to become established, in contrast to the highly variable mosaic of vegetational succession that occurred previously. Floodplain vegetation would have been much as depicted in the descriptions presented earlier in this chapter for the Bottomland Forest zone. The upland areas along Richland Creek would have developed into the Tall Grass Prairie that is locally termed the Blackland Prairie.

Locations of sites with St. Elmo phase The savannah environment, postulated to have surrounded the Project area previously, would have moved eastward and assumed its present position as the Post Oak Savannah. _ The data from sites of this phase suggest significant changes in terms of population size and/or settlement patterns in comparison with previous phases. The decrease in the numbers of components dating to the St. Elmo phase argues for a reduced population. Only five components are observed over the approximately 350-year length of this phase. This compares with eight sites for the 400 years of the Round Prairie phase and eight sites for the 200 years of the Richland Creek phase. In the discussion on the Round Prairie population size, it was argued that the apparent drop in numbers of sites was not necessarily due to a drop in population, but may have been more a function of imprecise dating of the phase length. The number of components dating to the St. Elmo phase is significantly fewer and a similar case cannot be made. The reduction in components of this phase almost surely relates to a decreased number of people in the RCAP area. The temporal limits of the phase are based on several radiocarbon dates for the earlier part and on the beginning of the historic time period for the ending date. Although these limits are still estimates, the historic boundary provides a slightly more precise temporal definition for this phase. Additional evidence in support of a change in settlement patterns for this phase is the frequency of chert artifacts in the site assemblages. Figure 18-4 shows that the percentage of chert artifacts increases slightly during the St. Elmo phase. Although the rate from the Little Cedar Creek site is comparable to the higher levels of the Round Prairie phase, the percentage of chert from the St. Elmo phase component at Bird Point Island is significantly Volume HI, Part Two n § . it? 4 088 os h,. | ear <, a i ee wctaot a 7 Fo Ml — . ig RICHLAND- CHAMBERS a“ DAM ae 4INVITI® Ca A Major Occupation e Minor Occupation a Creek Bank Occupation occupations within the Richland/Chambers Reservoir. higher and approaches frequencies observed during the Late Archaic. Unfortunately, the distributions of Pisgah Ridge chert projectile points do not provide precise chronological markers capable of detecting changes among phases of the Late Prehistoric, so they cannot be used to refine our understanding of the changes in chert frequency. Final evidence of a change in settlement pattern is the intrasite data for St. Elmo phase components. At both sites the intrasite pattern is similar to that first observed at the Irvine site. This consists of a midden development, a few large pits, a few smaller pits, and clustered and isolated post holes. As was argued for the Irvine site, a lesser degree of sedentism is postulated in comparison to a site where a complete house pattern is found, such as the Round Prairie phase occupation at Bird Point Island. The less substantially built structures represented by the clustered, but incomplete, post hole patterns imply temporary shelters, perhaps comparable to the huts constructed by the historic Tonkawa (Sjoberg 1953:287). The evidence, in summary, suggests a return to a settlement pattern like that observed for the Richland Creek phase. Relatively substantial occupation was undertaken at some sites, but this was not sedentary to the extent observed at Bird Point Island during the Round Prairie phase. A centrally based settlement pattern is proposed, but a higher foraging element is indicated than during the Round Prairie phase. It is probable that sites such as Little Cedar Creek and Bird Point Island were occupied for significant periods of the year, perhaps entire seasons, followed by movement to sites in closer proximity to other key resources. No major technological changes are observed during this phase (Figure 18-5). However, some relative shifts in the frequency of

Summary use of certain technologies occurred. First, there seems to be a tendency for fewer numbers of dart points to have been used in comparison with arrow points (Table 18-3), although this trend is not entirely consistent. This may indicate increased hunting with a bow and arrow as well as decreased activity associated with the dart points. In addition, and perhaps somewhat related to this, the frequency of occurrence of large pit features is less. At Little Cedar Creek, only one possible large pit feature (Feature 27) can be associated with this phase. The implication in terms of prehistoric lifeways is for a decreased incidence of earth oven roasting in large pits. Roasting activity still took place, but smaller pits were now sufficient. Ceramics continued to be used, although in greatly increased numbers in comparison with finished stone tools (Table 18-8). In terms of specific tool types, a range similar to the Round Prairie phase is found (Table 18-3). The same major classes observed at Bird Point Island are represented at both the Little Cedar Creek and Bird Point Island sites, the two components where sample sizes are sufficient for comparison. However, two projectile point styles do occur with greater frequency: Perdiz and Cliffton. Ceramic styles also show some change. Although the same grog, grit, and bone tempered ware is common, vessel decorations show the dominance of incisions and engraving over punctations and incisions. Several design element configurations are observed which are similar to the Caddoan type Poynor Engraved (Suhm and Jelks 1962). The ratios of major tool categories (Table 18-4) show that projectile points are the dominant tool type and account for more than 50% of all tool forms. There is a suggestion of a slight increase in the frequency of projectile points during this phase compared with the Round Prairie phase, but the frequency changes are small enough that this interpretation should be viewed cautiously. . The percentages of identifiable faunal remains by component are shown in Tabie 18-5. A decrease is observed in the number of species exploited when compared with earlier phases. Specifically, during the St. Elmo phase, no turkey, opossum, or beaver were found. These species either prefer more wooded conditions (turkey; Ellis and Lewis 1967) or occur within close proximity to wetland resources (opossum and beaver; Smith 1975). Interestingly, both the Little Cedar Creek and Bird Point Island sites contain bison. This species is present in very low frequency, but its occurrence supports the environmental interpretation that grasslands were in close proximity to the RCAP. In fact, the decrease in turkey, opossum, and beaver may also be reflecting this drier condition. Since turkeys prefer at least 70% tree cover (Ellis and Lewis 1967), a reduction in the woodland habitat is suggested by the absence of this species. The lack of opossum and beaver may imply that the floodplain environment was not as wet as before. In addition to a decrease in the variability of species exploited, a substantially higher number of deer and a reduced number of turtle were utilized at both Bird Point Island and Little Cedar Creek. A hunting strategy concentrating more upon whitetail deer is evident. The fact that both sites show this trend argues that it represents a broad cultural pattern and is not due to an opportunistic factor, as discussed for previous phases. Relatively well preserved floral samples are observed for the sites of this phase (Table 18-6). In comparison with previous phases, an important change is evident. Maize appears for the first time in the reservoir, and the complete absence of this food resource from all earlier time periods convincingly places its adoption in the RCAP area after A.D. 1300. Maize utilization, however, was very limited, and was clearly only a supplement to a diet based on wild plant and animal exploitation. The low incidence of this food could indicate that either it was grown locally or that it was traded from neighboring groups (Fritz 1985); both methods of maize aquisition are documented for historic Indians of Texas (Newcomb 1961). Other wild plant remains were present in much the same frequencies observed for earlier phases. Hickory nutshell was the most common plant by weight, and representation by all major 247 plant groupings was observed. It is perhaps significant that a drop in the occurrence of wild seeds occurred in comparison with the Round Prairie and the Richland Creek phases (Table 18-6). As Table 18-7 shows, a wide variety of seed was still present, but each type was represented by low numbers. Importantly, sumpweed, the most common species during the previous phases, was present, but not abundant. The low frequency of seeds may in fact represent accidental inclusions in prehistoric hearths and not intentional collection and utilization as foods. Another means of examining the relative importance of the floral remains is by looking at the percentage of all features which possess a given species (Table 18-9). This method shows that corn was more common than is suggested by the weight data alone, although corn was present in only a portion of the features from each site of this phase. Hickory nutshell was the most frequent plant remain, followed by Psoralea and acorn. Overall, other than the presence of maize, the floral assemblage is quite similar to previous phases, and no significant changes in economic strategy are apparent. As noted earlier, the introduction of maize seems to have served only as a supplement to the existing wild food diet. HUNTER-GATHERERS OF THE PRAIRIE MARGIN: BEHAVIORAL TRENDS IN THE DATA In this section we attempt to move beyond the culture-historical and lifeways discussions and examine certain behavioral trends in the RCAP data. Our selection of trends for examination has by no means been meant to cover all, or even a wide number of, possible behavioral problems. A great many important, and potentially answerable, questions are applicable to the RCAP data. Instead, we have chosen as our emphasis what for us are the two most intriguing issues in the overall data base: (1) the persistence of a hunting and gathering economic strategy and (2) the emergence of cultural complexity within the RCAP. The first problem concerns the continuation of a hunting and gathering economic strategy throughout all periods of reservoir prehistory, despite interaction with agricultural groups (the Caddo) less than SO km to the east. Although some evidence of maize use was found in the St. Elmo phase components (A.D. 1300 to 1650), this plant food occurred late in the archaeological record and was only a minor supplement at best. In contrast, the Caddoan groups to the east were much more dependent on this plant food (Briseth and Perttula 1981; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Story 1981), and the hunter-gatherers of the RCAP would have had the opportunity to adopt a similar economic strategy. We examine the reasons behind this difference in economic patterns of two neighboring groups. ~ The second behavioral problem concerns the emergence of cultural complexity along the Prairie Margin. As Price and Brown (1985:3) have recently commented, hunter-gatherers are all too often simplistically characterized as small, ephemeral groups of people who eat, sleep, scrape hides, and only occasionally reproduce. Notions of cultural complexity, as evidenced by permanent habitations, food storage, organized cemeteries, etc., are usually associated with more “advanced” economic strategies (e.g., horticulture). A few notable exceptions to this have been observed (e.g., the Northwest Coast Indians), but these have largely been viewed as unusual cases. An ever increasing body of archaeological data is accumulating which indicates that complex social and cultural forms have arisen many times among hunting and gathering societies (Winters 1969; Hayden 1981; Testart 1982; Price and Brown 1985). It appears that models based on contemporary hunter-gatherers have not provided us with a representative sample of the range of patterns that have existed in prehistory (Price and Brown 1985:6). Along the Prairie Margin, significant changes in hunter- gatherer complexity are apparent over time. These changes are evident in the size and degree of interaction with surrounding groups, in the types and permanence of habitation sites, and in the

248 strategies used for economic pursuit. All of these changes reflect varying degrees of cultural complexity, and this section examines them in an effort to understand the behavioral motivations behind the changes. THE PERSISTENCE OF A HUNTING AND GATHERING ECONOMY As noted above, a hunting and gathering lifestyle was maintained throughout the prehistoric time frame of the RCAP. Some evidence of the use of maize was found late in the archaeological sequence (post-A.D. 1300), but the relative rarity of this food suggests that it served only as a minor supplement. In this section we examine the reasons behind this persistence of a hunting and gathering lifestyle. It is useful for this discussion to make comparisons with the Late Prehistoric archaeological record from the Caddoan archaeological area, located less than 50 km from the Project area. Although evidence from this area on economic plant and animal uses has only recently been systematically collected, sufficient data from several sites are available for comparison. These data offer a useful contrast between neighboring groups which employed different economic strategies, yet based on common ceramic styles maintained close interaction. At a basic level two factors, either individually or collectively, would seem to be responsible for the difference in economic strategies observed between the two areas. The first is the types of soils of the Prairie Margin. It is a well known fact that the Tall Grass Prairie is situated on dense clay soils, unlike the woodlands to the east which are located on lighter sandier soils. Lynott (1981:106) has argued that the tough prairie sod was too difficult to cultivate to permit prehistoric agriculture to become widespread, and that this was the major limiting factor upon prehistoric agriculture. The second contributing factor is differential rainfall. Maize needs adequate moisture during the early part of the growing season to properly mature and to produce kernels for human consumption and for successive plantings. Perhaps deficient rainfall was responsible for the RCAP inhabitants not becoming agricultural. We examine each of these factors in more detail below. SOIL VARIABILITY Soils are the product of five factors: (1) mineralogical composition of the parent material, (2) climate, (3) plant and animal activity within the soil, (4) topography, and (5) the time during which climate and plant and animal acitivity have had to act upon the parent material (Fisher 1965:11). These factors have interacted to produce three broad groupings of soils over North Central and East Texas. In the forested portions of the area (Post Oak Savannah and Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest), alfisols and ultisols are found (Godfrey et al. 1973). These are lightly colored, fine sandy loams and clays with subsoils (B horizons) consisting of red to orange loamy sands to plastic clays (Fisher 1965:14). Although the natural fertility of the soils varies greatly, most are suitable for some degree of primitive horticulture (Keller 1974). In marked contrast, the soils of the Tall Grass Prairie are vertisols, and are the product of weathering of calcareous clays, marls, and chalks (Fisher 1965:14). The resulting soils are dark grey to black, friable clays, with pH values in the alkaline range. Although these soils are often high in natural fertility, the dense structural property results in poor water movement and horticultural crops such as maize often do poorly because of the poor soil drainage. Moreover, as observed earlier, the native Tall Grass Prairie would have created a dense root mat which would have been difficult to penetrate with primitive cultivating tools (e.g., wooden or bison scapula hoes). The final group of soils of the area is found in the floodplains of the creeks and streams that transect the region; these soils are termed alluvial entisols (Godfrey et al. 1973). A wide variety of Volume III, Part Two soil types is actually found in this group since each floodplain reflects the upland soils surrounding the stream (Fisher 1965:14). Within the forested areas of the region, alluvial soils are mostly light gray and light gray-brown colored clays, loams, and sands. Within the vertisols of the prairie, denser floodplain soils of dark colors are found. Although many of these soils have high natural fertility, they are generally poor for agriculture due to periodic inundation and poor soil drainage. Initially, then, there does seem to be support for the hypothesis that the Tall Grass Prairie soils were generally poor for prehistoric agriculture, whereas the soils to the east were better. The chief reason seems to be the permeability of the soils, with the sandy loams of the eastern part of the state draining better than the clays of the prairie. However, within the Post Oak Savannah the sandy loam soils better suited to horticulture are dominant. Since a significant portion of the RCAP is located within the Post Oak Savannah, and in fact much of the Project data is from sites of this zone, the presence or absence of sandy soils cannot be a determining factor for the presence or absence of maize horticulture. In fact, even within the Tall Grass Prairie zone, a "double dendritic” pattern of sandy soils paralleling major creeks and streams is found (Schmidly 1983: 143). These sandy soils are remnants from Pleistocene environments (Sorenson et al. 1976) and tend to occur on terraces within the stream valleys. Thus, even in the prairie environment, significant areas of potentially tillable soil occur which could have been farmed. Soil type could not have been a limiting factor on prehistoric farming activity. DIFFERENTIAL RAINFALL The argument for this factor is quite simple: without adequate moisture you cannot grow maize. The easiest manner in which to judge if sufficient rainfall occurred within the RCAP to support prehistoric agricuture is to examine modern rainfall patterns over the state. Figure 18-10 shows annual rainfall isopleths for North Central and East Texas. An east-west gradient exists, with the OQak- Hickory-Pine forest of the east receiving the greatest amounts of rainfall. However, the RCAP area lies between the 36 and 40 inch per year isopleths, and although it receives less rainfall than East Texas, substantial moisture still is received, Wedel (1961:32) has argued that primitive maize agriculture would have only been possible in the Midwest east of the 97th meridian. To the west of this zone, generally less than 20 inches of rainfall per year is received. Although the distribution of rainfall throughout the year is most important to maize horticulture, generally unfavorable conditions are found below 20 inches in annual rainfall. The RCAP is located to the east of the 97th meridian, and receives almost twice the minimal amount of annual precipitation. Importantly for maize farming, the majority of this rainfall comes during the spring and early summer, the critical period of maize development (Keller 1974), Rainfall patterns, therefore, are adequate in the RCAP for maize horticulture. Affecting these assessments, however, are the potentially complicating problems of paleoclimate and periodic drought. In Chapter 5 of Volume I, the paleoenvironment for the Project area was assessed based on data collected as part of the RCAP and on information from other projects. Significant changes in the past climate of the Project area were outlined, and have been summarized at the beginning of this chapter. Despite these changes which have resulted in periods of markedly different rainfall, the climate of today is thought to be similar to that experienced during the driest period of the last 3000 years, with the exception of periods of severe but temporary drought. This information means that, if anything, the rainfall patterns for past groups in the RCAP would have been similar if not greater than observed today. Drought is a different matter, since historical records show that it influences maize production in the state (Story 1981:Table 2). Periods of drought, moreover, tend to occur more frequently within the Midwest than other parts of the country and tend to occur over consecutive years (Bochert 1950). Both East and Central Texas are plagued by droughts, and often times a dry

Importantly, despite periodic drought, corn was grown and harvested in quantities to be a staple by the historic Wichita of North Central Texas (Newcomb 1961:253-254) and by the historic Caddo of East Texas (Swanton 1942). In addition, significant quantities of corn have been found from prehistoric contexts in North Central Texas at the eleventh century Cobb-Pool site in Dallas County (Fritz 1986) and several Caddoan sites in East Texas (Perttula and Bruseth 1983). Thus, drought would no doubt have created instability in prehistoric farming, but similar detrimental factors were experienced by groups to the east and west of the RCAP who were able to produce maize crops. Periodic droughts, therefore, could not have been a limiting factor preventing the inhabitants of the Project area from adopting an economic strategy dependent on maize agricuture. THE POST OAK SAVANNAH AS AN "AFFLUENT RESOURCE" ZONE We are left then with no clear reason for the difference in economy between the Late Prehistoric inhabitants of the Project area and the Caddo of East Texas. Neither the factor of variability in soil types nor differing rainfall patterns adequately accounts for the persistence of a hunting and gathering economic strategy. To find an alternative solution to this problem, we must first review our understanding about why groups adopt agriculture in the first place. It has, until recently, been an accepted assumption that cultures, once confronted with the option of growing their food instead of having to rely upon wild harvests, will automatically do so. Implicit in this assumption is the belief that self-production is somehow “better” and that all cultures will share this view of food production. More recent assessments of the shift from total reliance upon food collection to combined food collection and food production, view the addition of domestic food products simply as one more supplement to the diet (Testart 1982:530; Hayden 1981:520). In fact, given the option, most groups would 249 instead opt for increased mobility and “mapping onto” wild resources instead of the reduced mobility that horticulture requires (Binford 1980; Cohen 1985; Woodburn 1980). Thus, the relevant question is not "why did the RCAP inhabitants not adopt agriculture?” but "why did the RCAP inhabitants not have to adopt agriculture?” The answer to this question lies in the nature of the environment of the RCAP. As outlined earlier in this chapter, three major biotic zones occur within the RCAP: Post Oak Savannah, Tall Grass Prairie, and the Bottomland Forest. Immediately to the east, the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest is found, and is the heartland of the Caddoan archaeological area. The native resources within each zone which may have supplied important parts of the prehistoric diet are listed in Table 18-10. The abundance of each species within a given zone is indicated as either “highly abundant,” “moderately abundant," “infrequent,” or “absent.” These assessments represent subjective appraisals based on modem biological studies and quantification of data provided in the Texas General Land Office records (see Bruseth 1987). Table 18-10 also shows the total number of highly abundant species within each zone. This figure is used to compare the potential importance of each zone for prehistoric utilization. Two zones tie for the greatest number of abundant species: Post Oak Savannah and Bottomland Forest. Each has five abundant species. Although this would suggest that each zone was approximately comparable for prehistoric exploitation, this is not necessarily the case. For example, the Post Oak Savannah has a high abundance of acorns, Psoralea, and deer-the three species most easily exploited in large biomass quantities, and three of the four species that formed the bulk of the prehistoric diet in the Project area. The fourth species that formed a staple in the prehistoric diet was hickory nuts, and this species would have been moderately abundant in the Post Oak Savannah and highly abundant in the Bottomland Forest. The other two zones, Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest and Tall Grass Prairie, each show only a single abundant resource. In the case of the Tall Grass Prairie this indicates a marginal environment in terms of prehistoric ultilization. However, the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest's total of one abundant resource is misleading since several species are shown that occur in moderate abundance, and the overall biomass potential of this zone would have been substantially greater than the Tall Grass Prairie. Although the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest would have not been as important to prehistoric groups as the Post Oak Savannah or the Bottomland Forest, it certainly would have ranked third in food potential. It is evident, then, that the Post Oak Savannah was a biotic zone with a high number of key resources. Table 18-1 shows that of the trees that were encountered by early Texas land surveyors in the 1850s, oak and hickory trees made up nearly 95% of all species encountered. This means that almost all of the trees of this zone would have represented key food resources for the inhabitants of the RCAP. Comparable data from the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest show that oaks and hickories would only have accounted for 72% and from the Bottomland Forest these trees would have amounted to only 43%. Thus, the Post Oak Savannah would have had the highest relative occurrence of nut producing trees. In absolute numbers, however, this zone would have had fewer trees overall, since by definition it was a savannah environment. The trees would have been either isolated occurrences or in clusters and separated from other trees by small “pocket” prairies. Importantly for prehistoric utilization, such conditions actually favor nut production in trees, since the entire crown can receive ample sunlight (Asch and Asch 1978:317). Forests cause severe competition for light and only the tops of many trees receive sufficient light. Modern studies of nut production have shown that isolated hickory trees average about cight times the quantity of nuts by weight than similar trees in forests (Talalay et al., 1984:342). This factor of nut production would have far more than compensated for the dispersed nature of the tree distribution in the Post Oak Savannah, and in fact would have made the area a prime region for nut collection.

Although this plant is relatively rare today, possibly due to increased grazing and land cultivation, the distributions of modern species show that it prefers sandy soils and limestone outcrops (Correll and Johnston 1970:813-817). Psoralea latestipulata, the species most probably exploited by the Richland Creek inhabitants (Fritz 1982), specifically prefers rocky or sandy prairies (Mahler 1984:159). Thus, in the vicinity of the RCAP, the most likely location of this plant food would have been in the Post Oak Savannah since this is the only area of suitable sandy soils, and rocky soils are not found in the Project area. Although this plant could also have grown in the sandy soils further to the east in the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest, it has not been found in macrofloral remains (cf., Bruseth and Perttula 1981) and may not have been a common element of local flora. Since the plant's omnipresence at RCAP sites indicates it was a staple during much of prehistory, Psoralea was no doubt harvestable in large quantities from nearby sources. Whitetail-deer is another food resource that was important to the prehistoric inhabitants of the RCAP and that would have been abundant in the Post Oak Savannah. Although deer would have been found in all biotic zones, they would have been most frequent in the Post Oak Savannah. Since the primary food of deer is browse (Lay 1969:8), the relative abundance of this animal is tied to the frequency of this resource. Browse, consisting of leaves and twigs of woody plants, is commonly found along edge areas and would have been frequenjin the open woodland of the Post Oak Savannah. In climax forest settings, these plant foods are limited, and as a result deer generally avoid such settings for this reason except during the fall when mast is available (Smith 1975:34). Deer are primarily a species of the edge area environment (Servinghaus and Cheatum 1956:137). Additionally, the higher incidence of nut producton in the Post Oak Savannah would also have contributed to a high deer population. Deer are attracted to fresh green growth of woody plants and forbs (Cook 1984:467), and they would have frequented the disturbed parts of the floodplains where vegetational succession was taking place. We can conclude, then, that deer would have been most frequent in the Post Oak Savannah, less frequent but present in the Bottomland Forest and the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest, and relatively rare in the Tall Grass Prairie. In the Tall Grass Prairie, deer would have been Volume III, Part Two largely confined to forested areas of stream valleys (Schmidly 1983:296). A final important, but non-food, resource that would have been abundant in the Post Oak Savannah is Wilcox sandstone. As observed at Bird Point Island (see Volume II, Part One), this stone was collected and heated for earth oven roasting. The roasting process was used both to prepare foods for immediate consumption and to preserve them for delayed consumption. Hilliard (1980:16), in describing processing of hickory nuts, notes that roasting stops the process of germination by removing the moisture content, makes the shells easier to remove, and kills larvae that might have infested the nuts. Beneficial effects of roasting can also be assumed for some of the other foods. For instance, roasting would also have been a means of drying Psoralea tubers and animal meat. Importantly, many of the plant foods used by the RCAP inhabitants are seasonally specific and require immediate collection and preservation if they are to be used as stores for other parts of the year. Specifically, Psoralea matures and flowers during the first two weeks of May and must be collected during this time. Prior to this, the tuber is too small and premature collection will result in under-exploitation of the resource. After the optimum harvest date, the top withers and blows away, making the detection of the tuber very difficult (Kaye and Moodie 1978:331-332). Acorns and nuts present a different scheduling problem since they fall from trees and lie on the ground. However, studies have shown that non-human scavengers such as squirrels and deer and coverage by leaf litter can severely limit yields (Asch and Asch 1978:317; Talalay et al. 1984). Exploitation is most profitably undertaken immediately after the major period of nut fall, usually shortly before or after the first fall freeze. Thus, the Wilcox sandstone would have been an important resource that permitted the abundant but seasonally specific plant resources of the Post Oak Savannah to be efficiently processed for storage. Getting back to our original question of why a hunting and gathering economy persisted in the RCAP, and the corollary question of why maize horticulture was not employed, we are now in a position to provide some answers. The Post Oak Savannah offered an abundance of all key food resources in close proximity. In this sense, the Post Oak Savannah can be considered to have been an “affluent resource” zone (cf., Thomas and Kayama 1982), where natural abundant resources made maize horticulture unnecessary. In terms of nutrition, deer would have supplied the principal source of protein, acorns and hickory nuts significant sources of fats and carbohydrates, and Psoralea tubers additional carbohydrates. In addition, fruits, berries, and wild seeds would have been available at various times of the year in the Post Oak Savannah and the Bottomland Forest zones, and would have provided important dietary supplements such as vitamins. Com would have merely added carbohydrates to a diet already rich in carbohydrates obtained from acorn and from Psoralea tubers, so it would not have contributed significantly to nutritional quality of the diet. In essence, the natural food base was able to supply the essential food elements to maintain a healthy diet. The occurrence of Wilcox sandstone provided the capability to process these resources, and allowed the seasonal abundances to be turned into year-round staples. Given these locally abundant resources, there was no motivation to change the hunting and gathering strategy by adopting agriculture. EMERGENCE OF CULTURAL COMPLEXITY As noted at the beginning of this section, hunter-gatherers have only recently begun to be viewed as having intricate cultural forms. Complex societies of hunter-gatherers have developed in the absence of agriculture, and the importance of food production in the developmental process is being downplayed (Brown 1985:201). In this section, we examine the emergence of cultural complexity in the RCAP and attempt to explain why it occurred. For the purposes of this discussion, complexity is defined as a condition under which there are "...more parts to the whole, more me bet fA toi ew? ee BS £4 ft £85 Oo™ OS UTA Oe (7) a il”, Pl on @ ls - ee 7, Dk he oe le we 7, De lo Tl’, Et ae -M » Ta @ 2. = oe el ee A

VwvevuoKFrFreiclllCrOSTl Ore lU OOOO Summary differentiation or specialization of these parts, and firmer integration of these parts within the whole” (Service 1978:3). As a heuristic device to facilitate our explanation, we present a model of the organizational alternatives that interact to make a given group complex or simple (Figure 18-11). We realize that our model is somewhat simplistic, summarizing human behavior by the interaction of only a few factors. However, to make any model comprehensible, it is necessary to simplify the multitude of factors contributing to human behavior to a few key elements which account for most of the variability. Our model is intended to serve as a starting point for understanding the development of hunter-gatherer complexity in North Central Texas which can later be ammended when new data come to light. The basic assumption of this model is that hunter-gatherer behavior is directed towards obtaining sufficient food resources to satisfy the needs of the group. Unlike models of optimal foraging where the emphasis is placed on individual foraging behavior (Smith 1983), the emphasis in our model is on group behavior. We argue that the overall group, whether it be an extended family or the entire band, interacts in such a manner as to provide a synergistic effect resulting in a greater diversity of options than are present to the individual. The model furthermore assumes that hunter-gatherers are resource managers, consciously selecting among a series of alternative strategies to provide an adequate food supply. Given a stable and abundant set of resources, equilibrium will exist between people and the environment (Brown 1985:208) and natural biological mechanisms (Hayden 1981:521) will hold population in check. This condition appears to have existed during the Early and Middle Archaic periods, and the RCAP evidence suggests egalitarian bands existed that were characterized by fluid group organization, relatively easy access to resources, immediate consumption of those resources, and lack of food storage technology. Under such a condition, a resource management strategy of high residential mobility was employed (Figure 18-12) whereby the group moved from resource to resource to overcome seasonal and spatial inequities in natural food distribution. Story (1985), in a recent overview of the Archaic of the western Gulf Coastal Plain, has argued for a change from the Early to the Middle Archaic noted by increased population, the first appearance of organized cemeteries, and the probable beginning of group territories. Variations in site size and type additionally suggest that group composition was variable and depended upon the seasonal and spatial variation in resources (Story 1985:41-43), Since within the RCAP few data are available for the Early and Middle Archaic, we cannot evaluate whether this statement holds for the immediate Project area and we are unable to differentiate complexity between these two periods. As noted earlier in this chapter, the first significant data from the RCAP for limits on population and territory size come from the Middle Archaic. This evidence, principally in the form of chert distributions, indicates a large but defined territorial area. Insufficient data exist from the Early Archaic to determine if this pattern was established prior to the Middle Archaic. Against this baseline of low-level hunter-gatherer complexity, we can begin to examine the emergence of complexity and the causes behind it. According to our model, two factors can cause a change in the basic equilibrium between resource abundance and resource need (Figure 18-11). The first factor is population change. Specifically, an increase in the population requires some change in the energy capture strategy be implemented to increase the food base. As the model shows, a number of alternative strategies is available to change the overall resource management approach. It should be added that not all possibilities available to hunter-gatherers are considered in the model, For example, Bender (1978) has argued that social factors have an important place in the development of hunter-gatherer complexity. Our choice of strategies has emphasized those factors that can be tested ‘with the RCAP data, and we do not possess adequate control to test the importance of complexity that may have arisen as a result of social influences. The other factor that can upset the equilibrium is change in the environment. As outlined previously, several 251 VMLABILITY i AVAILA Population (NATURAL) Territorial Marking Risk Sharing New Technology Adoption of Horticulture Mobility Storage Change Population Change in ; Adjustment Resource Mix Figure 18-11. Model of resource management alternatives available to hunter-gatherer populations. , RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (CULTURAL) Resource environmental periods are proposed for the reservoir prehistory, and the net effect of these changes has been to alter the natural mix of wild plant and animal resources available for exploitation. It is probable that neither factor alone caused a change in the balance between the natural resource base and the human needs. In nonfluctuating environments, natural biological controls act to keep population down, and it is in fluctuating environments that populations rise or fall (Brown 1985:208). Thus, although we stress the importance of environmental and population factors as intiating changes in the cultural system, neither is a direct "prime mover.” Together they interact to alter the cost curves of resource management strategies and consequently foster a change in those strategies (Earle 1980). The first period of detectable change is during the Transitional/Late Archaic (1000 B.C.‘ to A.D. 700) where a variety of paleoecological data from along the Prairie Margin of Texas suggests that relatively moist conditions were present (see Chapter 5, Volume I). Specifically within the Project area, this corresponds to Environmental Period I when much of the area today covered by the Tall Grass Prairie is proposed to have been a savannah environment. The floodplain of Richland Creek was rapidly aggrading and would pave contained vegetation in various states of succession. In terms of our resource management model, these more favorable environmental conditions would have permitted population to increase. Greater densities of nut producing trees would have been available, as well as increased populations of deer and other edge area species, The Late Archaic population increase is reflected in the greater numbers of sites and in the higher numbers of artifacts at sites. The distribution of Pisgah Ridge chert, as noted earlier in this chapter, shows that group territorial size significantly decreased, most likely in response to the increased numbers of people. During this time the large depressions were constructed at the Adams Ranch and Bird Point Island sites, and as outlined in Chapter 21 of Volume IT, are hypothesized to have functioned as roasting pits associated with the

Alternative forms of hunter-gatherer mobility strategies (after Binford 1980). coalescence of local bands. The roasting activity was for food preparation associated with ritual feasting and for processing food for later consumption. The latter function is an important technological adaptation, in that this is the first evidence of storage activity within the RCAP and represents a major advancement over previous periods (cf., Testart 1982). As noted earlier, during the Middle Archaic only small, apparently single episode, roasting pits were used, suggesting a strategy of food processing for immediate consumption (Woodburn 1980:99). At a broader level, the large depressions are proposed to have functioned as sociological and ideological symbols. A prominent feature of the Prairie Margin of Texas is the abundance of key food resources (e.g., Psoralea, acorns, and hickory nuts), yet these resources are noted by marked seasonality and spatial inequity. As noted earlier, the Post Oak Savannah biotic zone contained these food items in abundance; however, this zone is a narrow, Volume III, Part Two northeast-southwest oriented strip, and in the vicinity of the Project area this zone is less than 40 km wide. Depending upon the size of the Late Archaic territories, it is quite possible, even probable, that individual group ranges were much larger than could be contained within this area, even compensating for the increased size of the savannah during this mesic environmental period. The distribution of Pisgah Ridge chert demonstrates this fact, with a maximum distance of 70 km between known specimens. Given the increase in population and the concomitant decrease in group territory, environmental and social circumscription (Carniero 1970) would have existed and competition would have occurred over access to key resources. In addition, the reduced territories would have made high residential mobility a risky strategy for resource management, since groups would become more vulnerable to local fluctuations in plant and animal availability (cf., Ford 1979:236). For example, if acorn production significantly decreased in one group's territory, movement to better yielding trees may not have been a possible option if the better trees were in another group's range. A common means by which contemporary hunter-gatherers cope with this problem is through risk sharing (Wiessner 1982; Gould 1982). Generalized reciprocity (Service 1978) is maintained with neighboring groups, and social obligations are stored through feasting, exchange, and gift giving. Band coalescence at the sites with large depressions is proposed to have served this purpose. During periods when local resources were scarce, band aggregation would allow for redistribution of foods to those groups in need. Under conditions of better harvest, feasting and general socialization would serve to store obligations for future resource shortfalls. In addition the depressions were used for human burial, and as such served as cemeteries. This is the earliest known occurrence of cemeteries in the Project area, and marks the emergence of inheritance of critical and restricted food resources. As Charles and Buikstra (1983:121} have noted, “...the remains of one's ancestors on the land...provide a very strong argument for ownership.” Thus, the large depressions at Adams Ranch and Bird Point Island also served as territorial markers for local hunter- gatherer groups. As argued in Chapter 21 of Volume II, the location of these features may indicate prehistoric “tension zones,” where due to factors of geography, vegetation, or social interaction local groups came into contact more often. This pattern of territorial marking through defined cemeteri¢s is part of a larger trend noted throughout the western Gulf Coast Plain (Story 1985). ip summary, during the Late Archaic an increase in population is evident and was likely enabled by a mesic climatic interval. The Early and Middle Archaic strategy of high residential mobility was favored during the Late Archaic, but a reduction in group territorial size necessitated a change in management strategies. The reduction created a certain degree of instability because greater dependence was placed on the resources within a smaller area. Although overall environmental conditions were moister, periodic droughts nonetheless would have occurred and created stress upon certain groups. This resource stress was minimized through risk sharing with other hunter-gatherer groups, and by marking territorial boundaries with cemeteries to identify individual group claims to critical resource areas. Thus, we see a rise in cultural complexity compared with the previous Archaic groups, despite a persistence of the basic strategy of residential mobility. During the Richland Creek phase (A.D. 700 to 900) further changes in hunter-gatherer resource management strategies are observed, and may be related to a further increase in population. However, as noted earlier, this is a period of uncertain environmental impact upon the RCAP area. Corings from peat bogs located around the Project area have provided a pollen record indicating the beginning of a regional drying trend. However, the floodplain of Richland Creek was still actively alluviating and shows that significant moisture was falling within the Richland Creek watershed. As argued in Chapter 5 of Volume I, a time-transgressive drying event was most likely occurring,

Summary first felt in the southern portion of Texas and slowly spreading northward. Under such conditions, the Richland Creek area might not have experienced the drier conditions until the following phase. A further reduction in group territory is clearly evident by the distribution of the Pisgah Ridge chert type and the greater number of sites of this phase suggests a further increase in population. These two factors required fundamental changes in the organizational strategies for effectively dealing with the abundance of natural food resources. The increased population and decreased territories acted together to diminish the food base on a per capita basis as a result of the Late Archaic exploitation system. Four changes in resource management dealt with this imbalance between availability and need: a change in the natural resource mix, adoption of new technology, increased use of resource storage techniques, and a change in mobility patterns. Each change is discussed in detail below. During the Late Archaic, deer and turtle seem to have been the primary faunal species exploited (Table 18-5), and hickory nuts, Psoralea tubers, and seeds were the primary plant foods (Table 18-6), Although the data are somewhat biased by generally poor preservation and small sample size, a case can be made for broader based exploitation during the Richland Creek phase. The relative importance of deer decreased, and a broader range of alternative species assumed a significant part of the diet. For example, cottontail rabbit is more frequent at 41FT161B, turtle is more common at Polecat Hill (41NV203), and fish is more abundant at the Irvine site (41NV182). Moreover, floral remains similarly show the use of a wide variety of plants. Based on the percentage of features with a given species (41NV182), significant representations are observed for hickory nuts, pecans, acorns, | Psoralea tubers, seeds, and rhizomes (Table 18-9). Although it is difficult to assess the relative importance of plant foods versus animal foods based on the economic data, there is support for a shift from K-selected to r-selected species (Hayden 1981:525-527) during the Richland Creek phase. Ecologists use the terms of K-~- and r-selection to describe the relative reproduction rates and abundance of plant and animal species. K- selected species are noted by reproduction with heavy investment in one or a few offspring which take considerable time to mature. These species tend to be mammals such as deer and are usually large in body weight. These species are also susceptible to over- exploitation. In contrast, r-selected species are small, live less than a year, and reproduce in considerable quantities. Plants such as nuts, seeds, and Psoralea would fall into this category. These species are difficult to eradicate by over-exploitation and re- establish themselves quickly. For a given unit of resource, however, they may require more labor input during exploitation. The pattern then, observed during the Richland Creek phase is a shift from reliance upon K-selected species, such as deer and perhaps turtle, to r-selected species. The most important r-selected species are a wider variety of plant foods including hickory nuts, pecans, Psoralea tubers, and seeds. Two important technological changes are observed during this phase: the bow and arrow and the marked increase in the storage of food. Ceramics were also incorporated into the material culture, but these were first observed during the Transitional phase of the Late Archaic and are not unique to the the Richland Creek phase. The importance of the bow and arrow was that it improved hunting effectiveness (Hayden 1981:519), which in tum altered the basic cost-curves for animal explotation. For example, certain species, such as birds, could be exploited more easily. Of even greater importance in terms of overall resource management was the storage of foods. Although we lack direct evidence for this activity (i.e., large numbers of storage pits), large roasting pits are found and contrast with the small, single episode roasting pits found at the Middle Archaic Hardy (41FT200) site. Table 18-11 displays the mean maximum feature length of pits by period or phase; only those features from known temporal contexts have been included. The Transitional/Late Archaic shows the largest pit size, but this is based solely on the two large depressions at the Adams Ranch and Bird Point Island sites since no other roasting 253 pits could be positively associated with this period. Thus the absence of other pits attributed to this phase cannot be taken to indicate that roasting activity did not take place in smaller pits, but only that we do not have adequate evidence for this activity. Comparing the size of pits from the Middle Archiac deposit at Hardy to the Richland Creek phase, a significant increase is observed in the latter. The average pit size is nearly four times greater, which we interpret as an indication of intensive processing of plant resources for storage. As noted previously, many of the key resources of the Post Oak Savannah are noted by marked seasonality and must be collected and processed within a short period of time. Storage technology is a means by which bountiful seasonal resources can be transformed through appropriate methods into year-round staples (Testart 1982:523). Roasting, to dehydrate the foods and prevent insect and bacterial infestation, was a primary means of making these foods delayed consumables. The final change in resource management strategy was a shift from high residential mobility to lower residential mobility and moderate logistical mobility (Figure 18-12). This is seen through two types of data, both concerning the nature of intrasite feature patterns, As noted earlier in this chapter, middens occur for the first time during this phase, and these organically enriched residues are thought to relate to more intensive use of the sites. Activities were repeatedly conducted in certain locations, resulting in the increase in soil organics. The other data relating to a change in mobility patterns is the internal layout of activities at the Irvine site. Here, three separate types of features are found: large pits, small pits, and post holes. The post holes are found either isolated or as parts of clusters, and the clusters are interpreted to represent the locations of houses. The lack of complete circular or rectangular post hole patterns suggests that a less permanent construction was used than observed during the subsequent Round Prairie phase at Bird Point Island. Richland Creek phase sites such as Irvine probably represent semisedentary occupations, and can be viewed as part of a pattern permitting more intensive exploitation of reduced territories (Binford 1980) and are an expectable outcome of an increased population. Foods are being intensively collected by small work groups and brought back to a base camp. In summary, during the Richland Creek phase a further increase in population may have occurred in response to a continued mesic climate for the immediate Project area. In comparison to the Late Archaic, characterized by high residential mobility and control of resource instability through risk sharing and defined ownership to key resources by territorial marking, the increased population of the Richland Creek phase made this strategy unfeasible. The reduced territories became too small to allow high residential mobility to be an effective strategy. Instead, a pattern of semisedentary occupation based on increased logistical mobility was established, with a greater exploitation of r-selected species such as nuts, acorns, and Psoralea. During the following Round Prairie phase (A.D. 900 to 1300), marked changes in the organization of strategies for resource management are evident and the trend is for continued increases in complexity. The changes are a further response to the continued high population coupled with an apparent environmental change in the Project area. As noted earlier, this phase existed during Environmental Period II, a period of a progressive drying that began in the southern part of the state and spread northward. The floodplain deposits along Richland Creek suggest that this dry period was being experienced in the RCAP during this time, and the net effect was a reduction in rainfall for the area in comparison with previous periods (see Chapter 5, Volume I for details). It is impossible to determine if group territories changed in size since the numbers of points made of Pisgah Ridge chert are small, and these were generally not diagnostic of particular Late Prehistoric phases. Nonetheless, the data suggest that a constant group range was maintained throughout the Late Prehistoric (Richland Creek, Round Prairie, and St. Eimo phases). In terms of population, a similar level to the Richland Creek phase is evident, and this combined with the degradation in the environment would

254 have created a further imbalance between the food needs and resource abundance given the Richland Creek phase strategies for resource management. As a result, a variety of adjustments are evident. The first adjustment is a further change in the mix of wild food resources. The shift from K-selected to r-selected resources suggested for the Richland Creek phase seems to have continued during the Round Prairie phase, where the lowest frequencies of deer are noted in the faunal assemblages. In addition, the highest frequencies of turtle use are seen, as well as the continued exploitation of a variety of other faunal resources. In terms of floral remains, a similar pattern of usage is evident with the exception that a slightly greater reliance was placed upon seed resources (Table 18-6). This intensification of seed usage is seen more clearly in Table 18-9, where the percentage of all features containing carbonized seeds is given. Seed use reached its highest point during the Round Prairie phase, when between 66.7 and 81.5 percent of the features contained seeds. Table 18-7 displays seeds types by period or phase. Two seed groups are the most important: sumpweed (Iva annua ) and vetch (Vicia sp.) or peavine (Lathyrus sp.). Sumpweed is a suggested cultigen in eastern North America (Asch and Asch 1978), although the sizes of the specimens from the Project area are within the range of wild specimens (Fritz 1985). The plant grows in edge areas between permanently wet and drier areas, and is harvestable in late summer or early fall (Asch and Asch 1978). Although this plant would have provided an important dietary supplement, it does not grow in sufficient stands to have provided a staple food source (Asch and Asch 1978:315). Less is known about the vetch or peavine specimens, Both are perennial herbs that produce seeds in late spring or early summer (Mahler 1984), and were probably collected to supplement the food base. Bioarchaeological studies of skeletal remains from the RCAP detect a change in dietary emphasis during this phase, supporting the observations made on the bases of the economic remains. Although the skeletal sample from the Project area is small, the trace element data from Bird Point Island indicate significant temporal trends related to dietary change (see Chapter 5, Volume Il). Specifically, the level of manganese and strontium suggests that nutritional changes were occurring around A.D. 1000. An increased reliance upon nuts during the Round Prairie phase in comparison with the Transitional/Late Achaic burials at the site is suggested as the cause. No burials attributable to the Richland Creek phase were available for analysis, and thus it cannot be determined if this trend began earlier. . The technological adoptions of the Richland Creek phase continued into the Round Prairie phase. The occurrence of arrow points was higher than in the previous phase, suggesting more hunting with this tool (Table 18-12). Importantly, the size of roasting pits increased during this phase (Table 18-11), and suggests that larger amounts of plant foods were being prepared for storage. The importance of roasting activity in the economic system can be seen at Bird Point Island where stockpiling of unburned Wilcox sandstone occurred. As noted in Chapter 14 of Volume II, this material is naturally found in a slough along the southern margin of the site. Since this part of the site is periodically inundated by spring floods, the stockpiling was evidently conducted during the dry season to ensure that ample supplies of this rock were on hand for processing. This activity was particularly necessary for Psoralea, since this plant reaches its maturity in the spring when creek flooding could inundate the outcrop of Wilcox sandstone. The most significant change during the Round Prairie phase was the near complete sedentism seen at Bird Point Island. This was a change to high logistical mobility (Figure 18-12), whereby all resources were brought into the central base camp. Although the site was almost certainly abandoned for short periods for collection of certain resources, the overall use of the site was year- round, The evidence for this comes from several sources. First, the substantially constructed houses, noted by complete circular patterns of post holes, argue for more labor involved in the construction of the structure which implies longer anticipated use. Volume III, Part Two Next, the floral and faunal data suggest use of the site during all seasons. For instance, the vetch, Psoralea, and certain fruits indicate a spring harvest. The knotweed and other weedy seeds are from summer flowering plants, and nuts are exploited in the fall. The deer remains from Zone I of Feature 1, which are related to this occupation and to the terminal, or St. Elmo, occupation, include antlers fused to the frontal bones and deer mandibles from individuals aged approximately 1.7 years. Since antlers are shed in the winter and deer are born in the spring, the antler and mandible remains indicate a fall/winter occupation. And finally, the well developed hearth from inside House 1 suggests that it was used for household heating as well as cooking, further supporting a winter use of the site. In summary, the Round Prairie phase occupations are noted by a further increase in cultural complexity in response to a constant high population level and a degraded environmental condition. A broad based economic exploitation was practiced, with increased reliance upon seeds (an r-selected resource) and decreased use of deer (a K-selected species). A settlement pattern of high logistical mobility is evident, whereby complete sedentism was reached at the Bird Point Island site. The final period of prehistory recognized within the RCAP is the St. Elmo phase (A.D. 1300 to 1650), and it records a change to a resource management strategy that is similar in many respects to the Richland Creek phase. The St. Elmo phase occurred within Environmental Period UI, a period of significantly decreased moisture and a time during which climatic conditions similar to today’s were reached. Alluviation of the Richland Creek floodplain virtually ceased, and a forest replaced the previous bottomland vegetation of mixed woodland and grassland. Tall grass prairies were established in the uplands around the western portions of the reservoir. Although the data are inconclusive as to whether a change in group territorial size occurred, the lower numbers of sites do indicate a decreased population, We suggest that the decreased population levels are a cultural response to the continued environmental degradation that began during the previous phase. As the model in Figure 18-11 shows, a possible strategy to bring resource abundance and resource needs into balance is to decrease population size. A number of means to achieve this have been observed ethnographically, including infanticide and limitations on coitus (Hayden 1972). Exactly what methods were used by the inhabitants of the RCAP is not known, but the net effect, based on the density of sites, was to decrease the numbers of people. The economic strategy also changed in terms of resource mix. Although deer, a K-selected species, was the most commonly exploited mammal during all periods, it was more commonly exploited during the St. Elmo phase relative to the Round Prairie phase, and accounts for percentages of all faunal remains similar to that observed during the Transitional/Late Archaic. As far as plant use is concerned, seeds decreased in occurrence and Psoralea was more common. Significantly, maize was introduced for the first time into the economic system. However, as argued earlier, it was found in very low quantities and likely was a minor supplement to the basically wild diet. In fact, the low occurrence of this plant food may indicate that it was traded from other groups rather than grown locally. Table 18-9, showing the percentage of features that contain a given species, records a similar plant mix to that observed for the Round Prairie phase. The major exception, of course, js the inclusion of maize in the diet. The bioarchaeological studies on human skeletal remains from Bird Point Island support the interpretation of dietary change based on the floral and faunal data, The two St. Elmo phase burials from the site had high levels of zinc observed by trace element analysis which was interpreted to indicate an increased level of meat consumption (see Chapter 5, Volume II). In addition, higher frequencies of dental calculus were observed, and this, combined with the high level of manganese for Burial 16, was suggested to indicate the addition of maize to the diet. The same technological innovations that were employed during the Round Prairie phase are observed during the St. Elmo phase.

For example, arrow points indicative of the bow and arrow technology are more common (Table 18-12). Perhaps this is tied to the increased incidence of deer remains, again suggesting a greater emphasis on hunting. Ceramics, first introduced in the Transitional phase of the Late Archaic, reach their most frequent usage. The meaning of this is uncertain, but it implies increased storage in portable containers. Roasting, and the implied processing of food for storage, continues but with some significant changes. As Table 18-11 indicates, the mean size of pits decreases and is similar to that observed during the Richland Creek phase. Interestingly, the standard deviation associated with the pit sizes also decreases and indicates that the pits were more consistent in size. That is, there are fewer of the large roasting pits, and the trend seems to be towards smaller roasting pits, perhaps indicating less processing of plant materials for long term storage. , These data indicate a settlement pattern change during the St Elmo phase to increased mobility. Specifically, a combination of moderate logistical and residential mobility (Figure 18-12), or semisedentism, is suggested. The internal site pattern of features is once again marked by large pits, small pits, and scattered post holes. Middens are also noted, and the overall pattern argues fora temporary site occupation where structures were constructed that resulted in only a few post holes penetrating into the B horizon and remaining to be detected today. These less permanent structures contrast with the more labor intensive houses constructed at Bird Point Island during the preceding Round Prairie phase. In summary, the St. Elmo phase occupation in the RCAP records a return to a more mobile existence. Although sites appear to be semisedentary, perhaps occupied during certain seasons of the year, some indicators suggest a degree of mobility more comparable to the Transitional/Late Archaic. For instance, the greater reliance upon deer, a K-selected species, is more in line with residential mobility whereby. consumers can move to a new area when this species has been over-hunted (Hayden 1981:525- 527). And finally, the lower incidence of large roasting pits indicates that fewer plant resource were being processed. Modern studies of mobile hunter-gatherers have shown that storage hinders group movement and is avoided (Testart 1982:527). Overall, a decrease in complexity is evident during the St. Elmo phase, and we argue is due indirectly to a continued degradation of the environment. SUMMARY During the course of testing and four seasons of mitigation for the RCAP, both paleoenvironmental data and archaeological data were collected in an effort to study the relationships between environmental change and human adaptation in the Richland Creek vicinity. The results of palynological and geomorphological studies were used to reconstruct three major periods of prehistoric environmental change, and the results of archaeological analysis were used to define the periods of prehistoric occupation, with 255 most data available for five major periods. The basic environmental data are presented in Volume I, and the basic archaeological data are presented in Volumes I and III along with interpretations which rely on ethnographically observed hunter- gatherer behavior to reconstruct the adaptive strategies employed during the various periods of prehistoric occupation. These interpretations move beyond the limited conclusions that can be formed by examining the sets of physical items preserved at each site. Instead, they encompass all data within a framework based on modern hunter-gatherer behavior, relating the physical remains of human adaptation (e.g., plant remains, structures) to the social behavior responsible for the creation of. features and the deposition of artifacts (e.g., risk sharing through reciprocity). The net result is a model of hunter-gatherer adaptation along the Prairie Margin based on responses to population change and environmental change, which is amenable to testing by future research projects. The evidence for environmental change within the RCAP is recorded in floodplain sediments from Richland and Chambers Creeks and pollen records from nearby bogs. Environmental Period I (3000 B.C. to A.D. 500) was moister than the present environment, as shown by rapid sedimentation along Richland Creek and high arboreal pollen counts. From A.D. 500 to A.D. 1200, during Environmental Period II, a gradual drying trend began, marked by the deposition of finer sediments (clays) as a result of slower moving floodwaters. Finally during Environ- mental Period III (A. D. 1200 to A. D. 1820) the culmination of the drying trend occurred and floodplain alluviation ceased, causing a decrease in the size of the Post Oak Savannah and an increase in the Tall Grass Prairie environment. Although isolated artifacts related to Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic period occupations have been found in the Project area, the first period for which in situ deposits are found is the Middle Archaic period (3000 B.C. to 1000 B.C.). The fact that only four sites appear to have Middle Archaic components suggests that the population was relatively low during the period. The high frequencies of chert (a non-local resource) in the Middle Archaic assemblages suggest that these groups were highly mobile, ranging over a broad territory. The dart points and floral and faunal remains are all indicative of a hunting and gathering mode of subsistence. Thus, Middle Archaic populations are characterized by high residential mobility, whereby small groups of hunter- gatherers moved frequently to areas of abundant food resources. The Late Archaic/Transitional Archaic period occupations (200 B.C. to A. D. 700) are noted at several sites in the reservoir, which suggests that the population density increased. Lower frequencies of chert and higher frequencies of local quartzite in Table 18-12 PERCENTAGES OF ARROW POINTS VERSUS OTHER FORMAL BIFACIAL TOOLS —_———_— Arrow Points Other Bifacial Tools nM Richland Creek Phase 41FT161B 31.2 68.8 41NV 182 29.3 70.7 Round Prairie Phase 41FT201 46.0 54.0 41NV177 50.6 49.4 41NV203! 60.8 29.2 St. Elmo Phase 41FT201 56.0 44.0 41NV1i73 67.1 32.9 1 This site is proposed to be an extraction camp; the high incidence of arrow points may be related to the deer hunting

256 the lithic assemblages suggest that group territorial size decreased as population increased. The moist climate associated with Environmental Period I provided favorable conditions for the spread of the Post Oak Savannah, the biotic zone with the greatest concentration of staple foods. This abundant food supply supported the increase in population noted for the Late Archaic/Transitional Archaic period. The settlement/subsistence patterns changed little from those of the Middle Archaic period. Groups of hunter-gatherers still followed a hunting-gathering lifestyle marked by high residential mobility. However, the larger populations confined to smaller territories placed more stress on the environment and made survival more precarious. A new adaptive strategy appeared during this period, which was marked by the use of large depressions at Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch for ritual activity involving roasting and mortuary use. The adaptive strategy linked groups of hunter-gatherers by social bonds involving ritual feasting and a communal site for placement of the ancestors. The food sharing behavior and social obligations inherent in this ritual activity provided a form of “subsistence insurance” whereby groups whose territories did not produce well during a given year could call upon related groups to provide assistance. The Richland Creek phase (A.D. 700 - 900) is marked by another increase in population with a concomitant decrease in territorial size, as indicated by lower chert frequencies and higher local quartizite frequencies in the lithic assemblage. The first evidence of structures within the reservoir occurs during this phase as clusters of post holes. Since no definable house patterns are present, these structures are believed to have been temporary dwellings. However, their presence marks a shift in settlement pattern to lower residential mobility (semisedentary). The adaptive response to smaller territorial range observed during the Richland Creek phase is a shift from K-selected to r-selected species which are harder to eradicate by over-exploitation. The Round Prairie phase (A.D. 900-1300) is marked by the lowest level of residential mobility and highest level of logistical mobility observed for any period recognized within the reservoir. A sedentary existence is indicated by the presence of three circular houses at Bird Point Island, and a decrease in chert frequencies, (especially Pisgah Ridge chert) indicates a decreased territiorial Volume III, Part Two size. The drying trend noted for Environmental Period II reduced the extent of the Post Oak Savannah, which led to an adaptive response in the selection of species exploited. An increase in r- selected species, such as nuts, is observed in the macrobotanical assemblage. In addition, an increase in the number of roasting pits used to prepare nuts and other plant foods occurred. Finally, the deterioration of the environment resulting from the continued drying trend of Environmental Period III] caused another major shift in settlement and subsistence patterns during the St. Elmo phase (A.D. 1300 - A.D. 1650). The advance of the Tall Grass Prairie and retreat of the Post Oak Savannah no longer permitted a sedentary existence. Residential mobility increased to the level observed for the Richland Creek phase, as evidenced by clusters of post holes from temporary shelters similar to those associated with Richland Creek phase components. Ceramic frequencies increased, which may indicate storage of food in ceramic containers. Significantly, com was introduced in small amounts to supplement the diet, reflecting the deteriorating condition of the local resource base. The results of archaeological research along Richland Creek document a gradual change in settlement and subsistence patterns through time. These changes were subtle; for the most part, the same species were used during all periods of occupation as a hunting and gathering economy persisted. However, shifts in the relative importance of K-selected and r-selected species were observed when the overall percentage of these species was compared on a period by period basis. As the territorial size of groups decreased, the shift from K-selected to r-selected species was required, and increased social complexity developed to promote group reciprocity as a risk-sharing mechanism. Environmental change and population change are viewed as the major determinants of human ecology in this interpretation. Although we recognize that social factors may have had a significant impact on the direction of settlement/subsistence changes, these factors cannot be measured with archaeological data. We have examined all archaeological data in light of modern hunter-gatherer data in an attempt to describe the social interaction that may be responsible for the archaeological record. However, our interpretations are admittedly simplistic and should be viewed more as hypotheses useful for future testing than as firm conclusions.

LITHIC ARTIFACT CATEGORY DEFINITIONS BIFACES PROJECTILE POINT A projectile point is defined as a symmetrical pointed biface with the proximal end modified (by notching, stemming, or thinning) to facilitate hafting. This category includes basal fragments of the same, but only when the hafting element is present. Possible projectile point tip, medial, and base fragments that do not possess a definable hafting element are included within the Biface Fragment category. In the site assemblage descriptions, projectile points are divided into Dart Point and Arrow Point subcategories, and are assigned to a recognized type whenever possible. CLEAR FORK GOUGE This artifact form was originally defined by Ray (1941). They have prominent, steeply chipped bits and are roughly triangular or subtriangular in outline. The bits themselves were formed with unifacial flaking, but the other edges were worked bifacially. DRILL A drill is defined as a bifacially worked artifact with a long, narrow blade. The blade edges are approximately parallel. The distinctive smaller specimens fitting this definition are included in a separate Drill/Awl category. DRILL/AWL Specimens in this category are characterized by their long, very narrow and thin bifacially worked blades. The bases of most by Daniel E. McGregor specimens are the unworked proximal portions of the flakes from which the tools were made. A few specimens have bifacially worked bases with stems for hafting. They are identical to specimens in Shafer's (1973:220) Awl category. BRISTOL BIFACE A Bristol biface is a bifacially worked artifact with circular or subcircular outline and relatively straight edges. Almost all specimens are without cortex.This artifact category was originally defined by Duffield (1963a:43-44). BIFACIAL KNIFE These are sufficiently whole bifacially worked artifacts not included in the above categories. These are differentiated from the Aborted Biface category below by the presence of at least one Straight blade edge formed by fine secondary retouch, and a complete absence of cortex. Although most specimens are complete, they lack evidence of preparation for hafting. Outline morphology is highly variable, including triangular, subtriangular, leaf-shaped, and oval specimens. ABORTED BIFACES Aborted bifaces are bifacially worked artifacts that appear to have been rejected at some stage in the biface production process. These have been divided into Early and Late Stage subcategories, depending upon the amount of bifacial reduction accomplished prior to discard. Arrow Point Preforms are aborted bifaces which are differentiated primarily on the basis of their small size. Fragments which may represent aborted bifaces, but are not sufficiently complete for confident classification, are included within the Biface Fragment category. 257

258 EARLY STAGE These specimens tend to be thick and somewhat irregular, with sinuous edges formed by the removal of large, thick flakes. They usually retain at least one area of surface cortex, have obvious material flaws, or have an area of hinge and step fracturing on one face. , LATE STAGE These are thinner, with straighter edges formed by the removal of smaller flakes than the specimens in the previous subcategory. Generally, all cortex has been removed, but the fine edge retouch that is characteristic of specimens in the Bifacial Knife category. ARROW POINT PREFORM These are made on small flakes with straight pressure-flaked edges. Although whole, they lack evidence of any modificaiton of the proximal end that would facilitate hafting. Some specimens retain portions of their original striking platforms. It should be noted that the Aborted Biface subcategories and the Bifacial Knife category are cut from what is actually a continuum in the biface production process, and that class assignment of certain specimens is somewhat arbitrary. The Arrow Point Preforms, Late Stage, and most Early Stage specimens could have been utilized as cutting or scraping tools. However, their generally “unfinished” appearance has led to their classification as pro- duction rejects. . BIFACE FRAGMENTS These are artifact fragments with at least one edge showing evidence of bifacial chipping. This is an other category for artifacts that are too fragmentary for confident classification into one of the above biface catgories. For purposes of description, these artifacts are subdivided into possible projectile point tip, medial, and base fragments, as well as an Indeterminate subcategory. UNIFACES STEEPLY CHIPPED UNIFACES Artifacts included in this category possess the following characteristics: 1) A zone of regular retouching rather than a more random pattern of flake scars. 2) Two or more rows of overlapping (stepped) flake scars along the working edge. 3) A working edge angle of greater than two degrees. GOSSETT GOUGE The artifacts in this category were made from rather flat quartzite nodules and have straight, steeply chipped bits at one end. The flat ventral surfaces of all specimens retain their nodular cortex, and many retain some cortex on their upper surface as well. This artifact category was originally defined by Story (1965:208-210). END SCRAPER A thick flake or similar piece of lithic material with one or both ends unifacially retouched to form a straight to convex working edge. Some specimens also exhibit retouch along one or both lateral edges. Volume III, Appendix A SIDE SCRAPER A flake with one or both of its lateral edges unifacially retouched to form a straight to convex working edge. SCRAPER ON TABULAR PIECE OF SILICIFIED woopD A tabular piece of silicified wood with one end unifacially retouched to form a steep, straight to convex working edge. These tools have been termed “Mineola end scrapers" by Johnson (1962:189). SCRAPER WITH GRAVER SPUR An artifact belonging to one of the above subcategories except for the presence of one or more small, pointed tips (graver spurs). GRAVER Members of this subcategory possess a pointed tip or spur formed by the intersection of two steep notches. SPOKESHAVE A steeply chipped uniface with one or more markedly concave working edges. MARGINALLY MODIFIED PIECES Artifacts included in this category are characterized by: 1) a single (non-stepped) row of flake scars forming a relatively acute angled working edge. 2) relatively small flake scars (all are less than 2 mm in width, most are less than 1 mm). GRAVER A piece possessing one or more pointed tips or spurs which have been formed by definite, regular retouch. DENTICULATE A piece on which retouching of an edge has produced a series of three or more pointed “teeth.” BURIN The specimens in this category each have a chisel-like tip formed by the removal of a flake edge parallel to the long axis of the flake. CONCAVE WORKING EDGE OR NOTCH A piece with a regular zone of retouching along a concave edge. STRAIGHT TO CONVEX WORKING EDGE A piece having retouch flake scars along one or more straight to convex edges. This subcategory is further divided on the basis of the nature of retouch: 1) those with one or more zones of regularly pattetned flake scars, and 2) those with retouch flake scars that are more "randomly" patterned.

Lithie Artifact Definitions CORES A core is defined as a nodular or tabular piece of lithic material from which flakes have been intentionally removed. Within this category, the artifacts can be subdivided according to the amount and pattern of reduction that had occurred prior to discard. The following subcategories were recognized. SPLIT OR TESTED NODULE A pebble or cobble with one or very few flakes removed. Although these are included in the core category by definition, their usefulness for technological studies is relatively limited. They probably represent discards from an early material selection stage of the core reduction process. FREEHAND PERCUSSION CORE A relatively large piece of lithic material from which a series of flakes has been detached. The recovered specimens indicate that a variety of reduction strategies was used. This group has been subdivided on the basis of the nature and positioning of its striking platforms. BIFACIAL PLATFORM Flakes were removed bifacially from one or more edges, but with no apparent attempt to thin the parent nodule. In some cases it is difficult to separate objectively these cores from certain specimens in the early stage Aborted Biface category. CORTEX PLATFORM Single Platform A single cortex platform at one end of the core. Double Platform (opposed) Two cortex platforms are present at opposite ends of the core. Double Platform (90-degree) Two cortex platforms are located at an approximate right angle to one another. Multifaceted nodule Flakes have been removed from a number of directions without consistent (patterned) platform development. PREPARED PLATFORM Platform preparation was essentially limited to splitting the nodule. The newly created, flat surface was then used as the striking platform for further flake removal. In some cases, a few additional flakes were removed from the platform surface itself, apparently for purposes of rejuvenation. 259 SMALL BIDIRECTIONAL CORE These are small chert pebbles with a series of flakes removed from opposite ends. They are similar to specimens which have been termed “bipolar cores,” and characterized as resulting from reduction by a hammer-and-anvil technique (Mallouf 1976:157; Shafer 1973:107-114). The small size of these cores would have made hand-held percussion difficult. CORE FRAGMENT A broken portion of a core that is too fragmentary for further classification. GROUND, PECKED, AND BATTERED STONE HAMMERSTONE A nodule of lithic material (generally quartzite) exhibiting evidence of battering on one or more ends or edges. MANO An ovate shaped nodule of quartzite or sandstone with one or more noticeably smoothed surfaces. GRINDING SLAB These are large, thick slabs (generally of sandstone) which have been ground smooth on one or more surfaces. These smoothed surfaces are usually flat, but in some cases are basin-shaped. The edges of some specimens have been shaped by battering and pecking. PITTED STONE These specimens are similar to Grinding Slabs except that they are smaller and exhibit one or more small depressions or "pits" which have been pecked into a ground surface. WACO SINKER These are small, oval quartzite pebbles whose ends exhibit well defined notches. These notches were formed by pecking and grinding. This artifact category was originally defined by Watt (1938). ABRADER These are pieces of sandstone that display one or more linear grooves on a relatively flat surface. GROUND STONE FRAGMENTS These specimens have at least one ground surface, but are too fragmentary for further classification.

ATTRIBUTES USED FOR CERAMIC ANALYSIS by James E. Bruseth The attributes used in the Richland Creek Archaeological Project ceramic analysis fall into three groups: vessel form, ceramic manufacturing, and exterior decoration. Each is discussed below. VARIABLES RELATED TO VESSEL FORM The first group of attributes for ceramic analysis includes four variables that describe various characteristics of vessel form. These variables are (1) location of the sherd on the complete vessel, (2) lip form, (3) rim orientation, and (4) sherd thickness. Each is described in detail below, and should provide a means of describing the sherd assemblage and of examining possible chronological relationships that these variables might have. All of them have been found to have chronological variability at other ceramic sites (Brown 1971; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Hargrave 1982). Sherd location was divided into three attributes: whether a sherd was part of the rim, part of the body, or part of the base. Mention should be made that the base category cannot be consistently’observed and therefore is not a reliable indicator of the presence of this vessel part. That is, bases from flat-bottomed vessels are often easy to recognize whereas bases from round- bottomed vessels are more difficult. This difficulty is increased when the curvature of the base of round-bottomed vessels is similar to that of the walls. Moreover, the small size of the sherds from many sites further increases the difficulty of recognizing bases. A major goal of this variable was to obtain information on the types of vessel forms represented in the sherd assemblage. Since vessel form could be directly observed on only a very small number of sherds because of the small size of individual ceramics, it was hoped that this procedure might provide insight on the range of vessel forms used over time. Specifically, the relative frequencies of body to rim sherds provide an indicator of the overall range of vessel forms, albeit at a much grosser level than direct form observation (cf., Schambach 1970:294-298), For 261 instance, a large number of body sherds relative to rim sherds would indicate a predominance of restricted orifice vessels, deep- bodied vessels, or a combination of the two. Conversely, a high incidence of rim sherds relative to body sherds would imply unrestricted orifice vessels, shallow body vessels, or some combination. The former might indicate more storage forms, such as jars and bottles, while the latter might indicate food preparation and eating utensils. Rim orientation was selected to further examine the forms of vessels, and specifically, to help determine if more or less restricted orifice vessels exist in a given sample. The attributes observed under this variable were straight (i.c., vertical), everted (i.¢., inclining outward), and inverted (i.e., inclining inward). An additional variable used to describe vessel form was lip form, or examination of the cross section of the terminal margin _of the vessel orifice (Brown 1971:120). Five categories were defined (see Figure B-1). The reason for inclusion of this variable is based on the tendency of established ceramic types to show a greater incidence of flattened or rounded lips during the Early Caddo period and a greater incidence of rolled lips in the Late Caddo period of East Texas (Suhm et al. 1954), Since most of the decorated ceramics from the reservoir show similarity to Caddoan types, it was anticipated that temporal change in this attribute might also be found at Richland Creek. The final variable used was sherd thickness. This refers to the average thickness in millimeters of each sherd. This variable was included primarily as a means of increasing the level of -description of the ceramic assemblage. VARIABLES RELATED TO CERAMIC MANUFACTURING Included within this group are several observations which pertain to the manufacturing environment of the ceramics. These variables are sherd temper, color, and petrographic constituents. Sherd tempers were selected to cover the observed range of nonplastic additives to the clay. However, in some instances it is

Lip profiles identified during ceramic analysis: (a) flat, (b) rounded, (c) beveled, (d) exterior rolled, and (e) compound. not clear if certain tempers were originally part of the clay or clearly an additive, such as was occasionally the case with sand. Some of the clays in the vicinity are actually sandy clays and this material could have unintentionally been selected. At the same time, however, some sherds contained considerable quantities of sand and are quite clearly intentionally tempered wares; we refer to this temper as sandy paste. Tempers were megascopically identified unless there was a question, in which case microscopic examination was made. The predominant tempering agents were grog, sand (grit), bone, and shell. In some sherds no temper was visible, and these were identified as such. Sherd colors were identified according to a Munsell color chart to provide a consistent means of identification. All readings were taken under fluorescent light. The exterior, interior, and core colors were identified on all ceramics from the site. Several interpretations can be drawn from this variable. Shepard (1971:105) notes that there are two determinants of sherd color: clay source variability and firing environment. Generally lighter colors such as creams, yellows, oranges, and reds can be inferred to represent oxidized firing environments, whereas darker colors such as browns, grays, and black can be due to either reduced firing environments or clay sources (Shepard 1971:105). Thus, some indication of change or stability in clay sources and in firing environments over time can be obtained from this variable. Volume III, Appendix B A secondary objective of using sherd color was to help determine if the ceramics from the site were manufactured locally or were trade wares. It was reasoned that if all ceramics had been manufactured locally, similar firing techniques would likely have been employed and have resulted in a similar range of colors. On the other hand, if ceramics were being traded, then color variations representing different clay sources should be apparent when compared over time. This analysis assumes that vessels did not consistently originate from the same clay source over time, a situation that seems unlikely. The final variable of this grouping involved the identification of the minerological constituents through thin-sectioning and petrographic analysis of a sample of sherds from some sites to observe clay composition and to quantitatively approach the problem of ceramic exchange. A trial study of ceramic thin- sectioning and petrographic analysis was conducted during the survey and testing phase of the Project with encouraging results (Irvine 1982b), and further examination was considered necessary to resolve the question of ceramic exchange. VARIABLES OF DECORATION The final grouping of ceramic variables that have been used to analyze the ceramic collection consists of those which pertain to vessel decoration. The first is decoration method, and refers to the manner in which ceramic designs were executed on the exterior of the vessel. The specific attributes observed were punctating, engraving, incising, brushing, slipping, and various combinations of these attributes. In addition, decoration element configurations (Braun 1977:178) were noted for the assemblage; these refer to the combination and orientation of specific decorative elements. This is not to be confused with decorative elements alone, which refer to basic, irreducible parts of a design, such as a tool punctation or an incised line (Shepard 1971:266). This variable was only recorded when a sherd was large enough for secure identification of a given element configuration, and a sample size of at least two sherds was required to define an element configuration. This resulted in several decorated sherds not being classified.

PETROGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF A SAMPLE OF CERAMICS FROM THE RICHLAND CREEK ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT The analysis of the ceramics from the testing phase of the project (Irvine 1982) identified several types that are considered Caddoan (i.e., Canton Incised, Carmel Engraved) among the Richland sample. The identification of these pottery types was not unexpected since they have been reported from sites in the surrounding region, but one of the problems they pose is a determination of the way they were introduced into the area. Undoubtedly the original type styles were brought into the area either through trade or by migrating groups. The question to be answered from this analysis is whether or not these styles were then adopted locally and produced within the area or if they were continually being traded from outside. One approach to the problem was undertaken prior to the first mitigation season. A petrographic analysis of thin sections of sherds recovered during testing was accomplished. The purpose of this analysis was to identify mineral inclusions in the paste in order to provide information to help in determining if the pottery was produced using local clay sources. This feasibility study was performed on eight sherds which had been selected as representative plainwares within the sample. The results were encouraging, so it was decided to continue the analysis using sherds from the first season of mitigation. Twenty-one sherds were thin-sectioned for analysis from this season. This represents approximately 10% of the sample collected. The analysis was performed using a Nikon microscope, type #115 with a UXF camera system. The sherds used in the analysis were impregnated with blue epoxy before they were cut for thin sections. This enabled the petrographer to discriminate actual void spaces (which would appear blue) from spaces where minerals had been plucked out during polishing (these spaces are clear}. Only one thin section could not be analyzed due to its destruction during the polishing. All of the thin sections were cut on the cross sections of the sherds to allow examination of the paste mixture. RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS The significance of the combination of minerals within the clay matrix and the make-up of the sand can only be understood if some by Marilee Irvine background information is provided about the local geology and the minerals identified. The minerals that were identified in thin section are commonly associated with an igneous parent material. The presence of this material may be a result of its chemical and physical weathering. A source for this material is the sandstone bedrock (the Wilcox formation) that underlies a portion of the Project area, and outcrops at the southeast end of the reservoir. This material is highly eroded and has changed the soil to a very sandy loam. A second source is the Pleistocene gravels, known as the Uvalde gravels, which occur in the Project area and are found from eastern Texas (Bruseth and Perttula 1981) and southwest into northern Mexico (Byrd 1971). These gravels were deposited in the Project area due to erosion and stream flow from the Llano Estacado area of the Texas Panhandle and northern New Mexico. The gravels are typically composed of waterworn pea gravel to boulder size quartz, quartzite, chert, limestone, silicified wood, a few Cretaceous fossils, and granite.The granite is probably derived from the Llano Uplift region to the northwest (Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Byrd 1971). There are 10 minerals identified from the sample, but not every sherd contains all ten. Only one is common to all the samples, quartz, while the others vary in their amounts. The other minerals include: quartzite clasts (which are basically recrystallized quartz), plagioclase and microcline (these are feldspars), biotite and other types of mica, opaques (such as Fe-Ti oxides), calcite, zircon, and tourmaline (zircon and tourmaline are the ony two heavy minerals present). All of these minerals are generally associated with a granitic parent material, The shape of the grains and their degree of sorting are important to determine distance from source localities. The more angular and poorly sorted the grains the closer to their source, while the more rounded and well sorted the grains the further from their source. Related to this sorting effect is the breakdown and loss of certain minerals over distances. For example, the feldspars (plagioclase and microcline) break down much faster than quartz, which is probably a reason for their low percentages. The fact that the feldspars that are present appear to be fresh (angular, poorly sorted) may indicate that they have not traveled far from their source locality, or that they have been mechanically 263

264 added to the clay matrix (Ren Thompson, personal communi- cation, 1982). Grain size and sorting may also help to determine differences in source localities. Differences in average grain size may indicate that different localities were being exploited. The average grain size of one sherd within the sample was significantly greater than the other sherds, which suggests that it may represent a different source. The other sherds are quite similar in average grain size (100 - 150 microns), which suggests that the sands in the area are comparable since the sherds analyzed come from five sites in the Project area. It is not likely that larger grain sizes would be found within this area but rather in a different locality. With the exception of one sherd, the selected sample that was analyzed appears to be fairly homogeneous in its mineralogical make-up (Table C-1). The proportions of certain minerals is fairly consistent for all sherds as well as the determined grain size and angularity of grains. The clay matrix constitutes an average of 70 to 75% of each sherd ranging from 55 to 90% within the sample. The clays are fairly homogeneous and more than 50% (15) contain traces of hematite-rich inclusions or blebs. These inclusions are secondary inclusions within the matrix. Grog inclusions were identified as components within the matrix and were usually distinguished by a different color and their angular shape. In some instances, it appears that two clays were mixed due to the differences in color, grain size, and volume. Quartz is the major component within the matrix averaging 20 to 25% for the sample with a range of 15 to 35%. Quartzite clasts were also detected in most of the sherds, but in a much lower percentage than the quartz grains. Twenty-five of the sherds contained quartzite clasts that averaged between 4 and 5% of the total matrix.The remaining elements identified are only minor inclusions within the matrix of the sherd. Microcline is present in 16 of the sherds and makes up 1% of the matrix. The Fe-Ti oxides (opaque) make up between 1 and 2% of the matrix in 22 of the sherds. The percentage of oxides would probably be greater, but in cases where the clay was dark the oxides are hard to disinguish within the matrix. The remaining elements (biotite, zircon, tourmaline, mica, and calcite) occur only in trace amounts. Bone was identified in 12 of the thin sections, ranging from only trace amounts to as much as 10% of the matrix. The bone used in the pastes of these sherds was characterized as small reptile, bird, and fish bone. This distinction was based on the bone structure when observed under the petrographic microscope (David Gillette, personal communication 1982). The sand within the matrix (sand refers to a specific grain size classification) was observed to be basically subangular to subrounded in shape and poor to moderately sorted. Grain size for all but one sample averaged between 100 and 150 microns with a range between 40 and 450 microns. A single sherd had an average grain size of 300 microns, which is much larger than the rest of the sample. In some instances where two clays were mixed they could be distinguished by differences in average grain sizes. The single sherd (41FT161B.50.99.F6) that appears to be different from the rest of the sample has several distinguishing characteristics. It has the lowest clay matrix percentage (55%) for the sample as well as the highest quartz percentage (30 to 35%). It also has some 5% quartzite clasts which are basically recrystallized quartz. The feldspars make up 5% of the matrix. These minerals are relatively fresh due to their observed angularity. Traces of biotite and zircon were also recorded.The identification of biotite was the only occurrence within the sample. INTERPRETATIONS Although no definitive conclusions about the location of pottery manufacturing are possible, some more detailed statements about the pottery itself and theories as to its origins can be provided based on the results of the petrographic analysis.The interpretations presented are based solely on the data from the analyzed sherds. Volume III, Appendix C One of the most interesting observations about the sample is the homogeneity of the analyzed sherds. All but one of the sherds have very similar mineral constituents with virtually the same percentages within the matrix. They are also very similar in the grain size observed, amount of sorting represented, and the shape of the grains.The sherds represented within the sample are of all different types and are both plain wares and decorated styles.The amount of homogeneity suggests that the pottery was all made from a common or at least a similar source. The single sherd that appears somewhat different was identified as sand tempered plain ware.The differences in the amount of quartz and quartzite clasts, as well as the larger average grain size and lower percentage of clay matrix, may indicate that this particular sherd comes from a different source area.The larger grain size is particularly significant here in that it is not common to find differences in grain size within the same area, particularly since the rest of the sherds are all averaging 100 - 150 microns for the average grain size.It may be, then, that within the sample submitted for analysis, that only one sherd seems to have a provenience that is different from the others. The minerals identified in thin section, as has been stated earlier, all appear to have an igneous parent material. It has been suggested that the parent material may be granitic. Granite and other igneous materials have been reported for the Project area either within the Uvalde Gravels or as a component of the Wilcox Formation sandstone bedrock underlying the area.Therefore, the minerals identified exist within the Project area and are most likely to be available either as a natural component of the clay or as a temper material available from the creek banks or from deposits on the terraces or in the uplands. , The angularity of the grains and the relatively small amount of sorting that has occurred indicate that the grains have not traveled far from their original source locality. Particularly the fresh nature of the feldspars suggests that they may have been secondary inclusions within the matrix, added as additional tempering for the pottery. The distance from the source may be as much as 200 miles (320 km), which is plausible since both Uvalde Gravels and the Wilcox Formation, as well as other sand formations (such as the Carrizo Sands), occur within that zone. So the problem becomes one of determining if indeed the pottery was made somewhere else and brought into the area, or if it was manufactured locally from the nearby clays. A thin section of a sherd from a Southwest Black- on-White stirrup spout vessel (recovered from Dallas County, Texas) has been analyzed under a petrographic microscope (see McIntyre and McGregor 1982). In contrast to the matrix of the Richland samples which are mainly quartz, this matrix and others from New Mexico (Shepard 1971) contain mostly basalt. Basalt is very common to the west of Richland and would be expected as a component of the clays from this area. Thin sections analyzed from eastern Oklahoma sites (Spiro, Brackett, and Paris Mounds) were also very different from the Richland samples (Ren Thompson, personal communication 1982). The samples analyzed had such small grain sizes that few of the matrix constituents could be identified. All of the sherds were similar in that the matrix was made up of very fine grained material. In contrast, the Richland samples had grain sizes identified as sand grain size. The question of provenience may never be answered, but this analysis has provided some answers to questions about the nature of the sherds. In every instance the temper identified by the archaeologist was confirmed by the petrographer. In several instances the petrographer identified bone in the matrix that was not originally observed, but in each case the bone occurred in the matrix of small grog pieces within the paste and was not observable except with a microscope. The question of the addition of sand (grit) to the matrix appears to be supported by the fresh, angular nature of the feldspars in comparison to the other grains observed in the paste. This seems to suggest that the sand was being mechanically added in addition to what was present naturally in the clay. This is also true for the sandy paste sherd which is somewhat different from the rest of the sample.

Petrographic Analysis It would appear that the pottery from the Project area is being manufactured locally due to the similarity of the samples. Otherwise it would seem that a single area outside of the Project would have had to be used to account for the homogeneity. We find 267 this an unlikely situation since the sherds examined probably span as much as 1000 years, More than likely the prehistoric individuals were using the clays available to them on or near the site where they were residing to manufacture their pottery.

FLOTATION METHODOLOGY FLOTATION DEVICE The Motation device substituted for the froth flotation device was a 50 gallon barrel which had been modified by adding a flotation chamber, an overflow valve and an overflow chute. The flotation chamber was a 5 gallon bucket which was attached to the top of the barrel. A 6.4 mm screen rested on the bottom of the chamber. The overflow chute was designed to carry the float material from the flotation chamber into a series of screens (Nos. 6, 10, and 12). The overflow valve is connected to the barrel and was used to control the water level within the flotation chamber. FLOTATION PROCESS The flotation samples were pre-soaked to aid the breakdown of the soil matrix. No chemicals were used for deflocculation. While in operation, the barrel was filled with water until overflowing. The flotation sample was slowly added to the running water above the heavy fraction screen within the flotation chamber. A garden hose provided the pressure needed to churn the sample within the flotation chamber. Once the soil had been broken down by the churning water and manual stirring, the overflow valve was closed. This resulted in the gradual rise of the water level in the flotation chamber until it reached the overflow chute which directed the water and floated remains through a set of three 269 by Duane E. Peter screens (light fraction). This process continued for 20 minutes. At the end of that time, the overflow valve was opened, the water drained off, and the heavy and light fraction screens were dumped onto newspaper for drying. FLOTATION SORTING Once the fractions dried, they were sorted by means of screening and hand picking of the materials retained by each screen size. Initially, the heavy fraction was sifted through a 6.4 mm screen and all materials remaining on the screen were sorted and bagged. The material that passed through the screen was sifted through a smaller mesh screen (2 mm), and all macrobotanical, charcoal, stone, shell, and bone remains were bagged separately. All material, except stone, less than 2 mm in diameter was bagged and sent to the macrobotanical specialist. The light fraction material was contained within three samples: 1) 3.35 mm, 2) 1.7 mm, and 3) .85 mm. The largest of the light fraction samples was initially sifted through a 6.4 mm screen to remove grass stems and roots. The material that passed through this screen was then sifted through a 2 mm screen and sorted. Everything less than 2 mm in diameter from this sample and the smaller screen samples (1.7 and .85 mm) was sent to the macrobotanical analyst for examination without any preliminary sorting.

ATTRIBUTE ANALYSIS OF COMPLETE FLAKES A detailed attribute analysis of complete flakes was conducted on assemblages from five sites exhibiting good contextual integrity. These sites were 41FT200, 41NV182, 41FT201, -41FT193, and 41NV173. Four continuous variables and six nominal observations were recorded for each specimen. The following discussion presents the criteria employed in this analysis. I. Length - This attribute was measured at the maximum dimension of the flake parallel to the striking force. This dimension was measured to the nearest millimeter for all complete pieces. Il. Width - This attribute was measured to the nearest millimeter at the maximum dimension of the flake perpendicular to the striking force. ; Ill. Thickness - This is the maximum dimension of the flake _which is orthogonal to the length/width plane. This dimension was ‘ measured to the nearest millimeter. IV. Platform Thickness - This attribute is the distance between the inverse and obverse surfaces of the flake at the platform. This dimension was measured to the nearest 0.1 millimeter. All flakes exhibiting crushed platforms were assigned a value of 0.1 mm for this attribute. ‘ V. Platform Type - This attribute records the preparation modes for the removal of spalls from a core. Five attribute states were recognized: 1) Cortex - striking platform is unmodified; original cortex surface is present. 2) Single Faceted - single flake scar forms the platform surface. 3) Multifaceted - two or more flake scars form the platform surface. 4) Crushed - most of the platform surface was destroyed on impact; only a remnant, usually step fractured, remains. by Duane E. Peter VI. Percentage of Dorsal Cortex - The relative amount of cortex remaining on the dorsal surface of a flake. Five categories are recognized: 1) O percent 2) 1-25 percent 3) 26-50 percent 4) 51-75 percent 5) 76-100 percent VIL Dorsal Scar Pattern - This attribute records the complexity of scar patterns on the dorsal surface of a flake. Nine attribute states are recognized: 1) Unidirectional - all flake scars originate from one edge of the flake only. 2) Perpendicular - flake scars originate from two edges of the flake, which are orthogonal to one another. 3) Opposed - flake scars originate from the distal and proximal ends of the flake. 4) Tri-directional - the dorsal flake scars originate from three edges of the flakes. 5) Multi-directional - the dorsal flake scars originate from more than three directions along the flake's edges. 6) Cortex - the dorsal surface is unmodified. 7) Ventral surface - the dorsal surface exhibits the ventral surface of a previously struck flake; usually referred to as “bulb thinning” flakes. 8) Bilateral opposed - flake scars originate from both lateral edges of the flake. VIII. Error Recovery - This attribute records the proportion of flakes struck to remove previous errors such as hinge or step terminations and the method of their removal. Four attribute states are recognized: 1) Absent - no step or hinge terminations on the dorsal surface of the flake. 275

276 2) Present (0°) - flake removed from the same direction as the origin of the step or hinge termination. 3) Present (90°) - direction of removal of the error recovery flake is perpendicular to that of the error scar. 4) Present (180°) - direction of removal of the error recovery flake is opposed to that of the error scar. IX. Flake Termination Shape - This attribute records the presence or absence of errors in force when detaching a flake. Five attribute states are recognized: 1) Feathered - results from adequate force applied to the striking platform. 2) Hinge - the result of insufficient force to clear the projected flake but of enough force to be redirected by the mass of the core or blank. 3) Overpass - the result of a blow with too much force for the intended flake removal; the edge of objective piece opposite the platform is carried away with the flake. 4) Blacky - results from combined effect of striking point being too far from the face of the core and too much force being applied. Volume III, Appendix G 5) Snap - results from too much end shock or vibration, impurities, or fracture planes in material. X. Raw Material - This observation notes the lithic raw materials of the flakes. Most of the raw materials are of local origin which can be found in the upland lag gravels (commonly referred to as Uvalde Gravels) which are present along the drainage divides. Only the Edwards chert is an exotic from Central Texas. The following varieties of raw material are recognized: 1) Chert 2) Edwards Chert 3) Quartzite - commonly referred to as “Ogallala" 4) Pisgah Ridge Chert 5) Silicified Wood 6) Siltstone 7) Sandstone 8) Ironstone, hematite.
