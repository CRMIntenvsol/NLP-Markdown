LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 i ABSTRACT Human skeletal remains were found eroding from the lake bed of Lake Ray Hubbard in September 2011 in the area of archaeological site 41DL8. The fisherman that found the remains reported their presence to the local police department. The Dallas Homicide Squad and a representative from the Dallas Medical Examiner’s Office exhumed the remains. Initially determined to be animal remains, the exhumed skeletal elements were taken to the Medical Examiner’s Office for identification, where they were determined to be human. The following day, Dallas Homicide and the Medical Examiner’s Representative returned to the scene and continued the exhumation until a dart point was encountered. Mark Ingraham from the University of North Texas was consulted and further removed parts of the remains. Dallas Water Utilities contracted with AR Consultants, Inc., to complete the recovery of all bone fragments from the discovery site and insure no further burials were in the immediate vicinity. AR Consultants, Inc. completed excavations and surveyed the shoreline to explore for the presence of any additional human skeletal remains or burials. Analysis of the remains and associated artifacts indicates that they are of Native American ancestry and radiocarbon dating of the bone attributes the burials to the early Late Archaic Period, BC 1380-1130 and BC 1120- 930. Radiocarbon dating of two femora from separate individuals occurred with permission of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. Four adult males were interred in the burial pit; one had a developmental defect resulting in complete external auditory atresia. All of the individuals were middle- aged adults, between 35-45 years-at-death. Seven dart points were found in association with the remains. Remains will be repatriated to the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes and housed at AR Consultants, Inc. until repatriation occurs. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 1 INTRODUCTION Archaeological site 41DL8 was first reported in 1941 by Robert C. Hatzenbuehler of the Dallas Archeological Society during survey of plowed fields located south of Rowlett Creek just upstream from the junction with the East Fork of the Trinity River (Figure 1). At the time, the site was described as being 300 yards from Rowlett Creek and resting on yellow clay which probably corresponds to the Altoga silty clay that is described as being present by the Soil Conservation Service (Coffee, Hill, and Ressel 1980: Sheet 21). Artifacts on the farmed surface of the site included arrowheads, blades, scrapers, flakes, potsherds, and mussel shells (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas 2011). The site was revisited in the summer of 1963 in conjunction with the anticipated construction of Forney Reservoir which is now known as Lake Ray Hubbard (Harris and Suhm 1963:17). The site was reported as a small, temporary Wylie Focus campsite that was badly eroded and had occupational debris exposed over an area roughly 100 by 75 yards. No investigation was recommended at this site which is described as being at the edge of the uplands. The site was apparently inundated by the lake and was not visible when the John Paul Jones Park was constructed on the lake edge by the City of Garland, Texas (Nunley 1984; Skinner 1985; Coleman and Davis 2010). On September 22, 2011, Steve Wallace discovered what he believed to be human skeletal remains eroding from the lake bed at Lake Ray Hubbard, west of the John Paul Jones Park boat ramp. Recent extreme drought conditions had resulted in the lake level dropping significantly. He reported the location to the Garland Police Department and they notified the Dallas Police Department, who then advised the Dallas Homicide Division of the discovery. An officer with the Dallas Police Department Homicide Unit (DHU) and a representative from the Dallas Medical Examiner’s Office (DMEO) responded to the scene. Ultimately, the University of North Texas Laboratory of Forensic Anthropology (UNTLFA) was involved in the recovery of human bones from the site. AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) was asked by Dallas Water Utilities (DWU) to gather the bones, records, and other information and then to conduct excavation at the site of the apparent burial in order to retrieve any potentially remaining bones and artifacts and to explore the site area from which the bones had been recovered. The Texas Historical Commission (THC), Archeology Division, was consulted; they did not believe this constituted an unmarked grave, which would require a report to the county clerk and a disinterment permit. However, an Antiquities Permit was required from the THC. Permit 6112 was issued to Dr. Whitley to conduct testing for limited bone recovery, a cursory survey of the adjacent lake edge, as well as analysis of the bones recovered from the site. Although the grave and burial had been disturbed, it was expected that the site could be put into a regional perspective based on previous investigations within the East Fork Watershed. Consultation with Native American Tribes and Nations under NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) regulation was required in this case. Dallas Water Utilities meets the definition of “museum” under NAGPRA regulations since it receives federal funds. As a museum, DWU, with AR Consultants, Inc. acting on their behalf, contacted the ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

The Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma, Mescalaro Apache Tribe, Tonkowa Tribe of Oklahoma, Caddo Nation, Comanche Nation, and Wichita and Affiliated Tribes were contacted with a consultation letter followed by a phone call. The two closest culturally affiliated tribes, due to the age of the remains, were the Caddo Nation and Wichita and Affiliated tribes. The Caddo Nation deferred to the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. The Wichita and Affiliated Tribes requested repatriation of the remains. Figure 1.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 4 METHODOLOGY AND CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS Work conducted by ARC was designed to address concerns about the continued presence of human skeletal remains at the site and whether additional remains might be eroding from other locations along the shoreline. The scope of work was designed to recover skeletal elements left by earlier excavations, to survey the shoreline from 41DL8 to 41DL9 to investigate if any human skeletal elements or archaeological deposits were present and eroding from the surface, and to make recommendations regarding any possible future research in the area. If in-situ remains were located, then, due to their endangered location adjacent to the lake, they would need to have been mitigated. The field team walked the shoreline in parallel transects 5 meters apart. Notes were made regarding the presence of human remains, artifacts, ground exposure, and vegetation. Most of the shoreline was not inspected because a retaining wall ran the length of the area surveyed and shovel tests were not employed during the survey. Due to the heavily eroded lake bed, it was decided that shovel testing would not increase the potential of finding archaeological deposits. Photographs were taken along the shoreline and GPS coordinates of any features and concentrations of debris were recorded with a handheld Garmin GPSMAP 60CSX. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 5 PROJECT BACKGROUND Recovery by the DHU and the DMEO On September 22, 2011, Steve Wallace discovered human skeletal remains eroding from the lake bed while fishing on from the lake bed of Lake Ray Hubbard, west of the John Paul Jones Park boat ramp. Recent extreme drought conditions in Texas resulted in the lake level dropping significantly and exposing a section of lake bed near the John Paul Jones Park boat ramp. The lake bed exposure provided a good location for fishing and Mr. Wallace proceeded to fish from the lake bed. While fishing, Mr. Wallace looked to the side of his lawn chair and noticed bones and teeth eroding from the lakeshore. He discovered the remains that evening around 7:30 p.m. and reported the location to the local police department around 6:30 a.m., Friday, September 23, 2011. The Garland Police Department notified the Dallas Police Department, who then involved the Dallas Homicide Unit (DHU) of the discovery. An officer with the DHU and a representative from the Dallas Medical Examiner’s Office (DMEO) responded to the scene. Mr. Wallace and his sister, Tracy Thomas, met the officers at the scene to direct them to the location. The image taken by DHU indicates the remains were still in-situ (Figure 2). Figure 2.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 6 Once on the scene, exploratory digging commenced that morning by the DHU officer and the DMEO representative, Tran Loan. The remains were determined to be animal after a portion of the location and several skeletal elements had been recovered (Tran Loan, personal communication, Dallas Police Department Report 2011). The remains were taken to the DMEO at that time. Mr. Wallace and Ms. Thomas were still in the vicinity and were notified that the investigator was relatively sure the remains were animal in origin and not human (Steve Wallace and Tracy Thomas, personal communication). Several skeletal elements were exposed in the backdirt piles left by DHU and DMEO exploratory digging. Ms. Thomas, not convinced the remains were animal, collected several pieces of bone and teeth that were visible on the top of the backdirt piles (Tracy Thomas, personal communication). She intended to take the remains to a veterinarian that is a personal friend for identification and confirmation (Tracy Thomas, personal communication). Remains taken to the DMEO were determined to be of human origin. The DHU and DMEO representative returned to the scene to complete recovery of the remains Saturday morning, September 23, 2011 (Figure 3). Ms. Thomas returned the remains Saturday morning after Mr. Wallace informed her that the medical examiner determined they were of human origin (Steve Wallace and Tracy Thomas, personal communication). Detective Quirk also confirmed she returned the remains and kept the remains collected by Ms. Thomas separate from those collected by the DMEO and DHU officers. The DHU detectives set a grid dividing the excavation area into four quadrants, with the center of the grid approximately in the middle of the location of the remains (Figure 3). Figure 3. Staked burial location with four quadrants. Photograph courtesy of DHU. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 7 Figure 4. In-situ skeletal elements exposed by University of North Texas Laboratory of Forensic Anthropology. The size of the grid is not available. Shovels and rakes were utilized in the recovery process and the remains were collected by quadrant. Since the quadrants were not established until after the exploratory digging, some of the collected materials may be out of their original context. Neither notes nor a map of the excavation were produced; however some pictures of the excavation are included in this report. Detective Quirk (personal communication) could see the orientation of the remains during recovery; he indicated the body was lying on its side in a fetal position. Excavations ceased when a dart point was found. At this time, the detectives contacted the University of North Texas Laboratory of Forensic Anthropology (UNTLFA). Mark Ingraham and one graduate assistant responded to the scene. They completed the excavation of the remaining in-situ skeletal elements which consisted mainly of the lower limbs (Figure 4). Two additional dart points were encountered during Mr. Ingraham’s excavations. Backdirt was not screened for additional remains or points. Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the skeletal elements in- situ while Mr. Ingraham was excavating, but the photographs do not show element portions that can assist in determining the orientation of the remains. The photographs do allow some reconstruction of the leg flexure. From these photographs, Detective Quirk’s assessment that the individual was in a “fetal position” were confirmed and Figure 6 shows that at least one individual was buried in a flexed or semi-flexed position. The size and shape of the excavated pit also suggests all individuals were buried in a flexed or semi-flexed position. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 9 Figure 7. Dart points photographed in the field by DHU. Skeletal elements were taken to the DMEO for cleaning and storage until their disposition or next actions could be taken. A “Cause of Death Report” was generated by the DMEO, dated October 11, 2011, noting the cause of death was undetermined, the manner of death was undetermined, and that the skeletal remains collected are from multiple humans of archaeological interest and likely Native American. The remains were housed by the Southwest Institute of Forensic Sciences at Dallas until released to ARC for full osteological examination. Six points were included in the material stored by the DMEO. It is unclear at what time the additional three points were uncovered because only three of the points were photographed in the field (Figure 7). At least two points, B and C in Figure 7, were excavated by UNTLFA. Once excavations were complete and DWU was determined to be the party responsible for this portion of the lake, the scene was barricaded and patrolled by the Dallas Police Department and DWU until complete recovery could be accomplished. ARC Excavations Alan Skinner conducted a site visit in October. During his inspection, he noticed numerous bone fragments and teeth on the surface. He also found a single dart point in the location of the backdirt pile in the center of Figure 10. In September, the location had been relatively dry and photographs of the scene and Mark Ingraham indicate the sediment was easily excavated (personal communication).

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 10 excavations were postponed by several days due to precipitation. Excavations commenced on December 8, 2011 and were completed December 12, 2011. The lake level at the time of discovery on September 22, 2011 was 429.93 feet. Precipitation in early December resulted in a gain of 1.01 feet between December 3 and December 6, 2011 (Lakes On-Line, http://rayhubbard.uslakes.info/Level.asp, accessed January 30, 2012), and resulted in extremely sticky, wet clay at the scene during ARC excavations. Figure 8. 41DL8 site map. A thin layer of ice coated the surface of the lake bed and the weather was cloudy and 31 degrees on the morning of December 8. Upon arrival at the scene, it was apparent the excavated pit was filled with some of the backdirt from DHU, DMEO, and UNTLFA excavations. Fragments of human skeletal remains were scattered across the site, however all collected fragments were found within the barricaded area (Figure 8). Heavy concentrations of fragmented remains were located near the DHU pit; these were not individually point plotted. A grid was set using the retaining wall as a baseline and the northeast corner of the retaining wall as the main datum. This wall is 19 degrees off magnetic north. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 11 All remains and lithics outside the concentrated areas of bone were point plotted. Several debitage flakes were piece plotted and may have been scattered with the bone elements. Most of the piece plotted items were skeletal element fragments and include small pieces of long bone, crania, mandible, femur, and possibly acetabulum. Figure 9. Map of 41DL8 indicating DHU pit and surface area scraped. A five- by six-meter area was gridded for scraping and recovery within the location with heavy concentrations of bone. The initial research design designated a three- by three-meter grid for excavation, however the extensive scatter of bone required the larger grid. Setting up the grid proved difficult due to the wet clay and shoes quickly became coated with large amounts of the very sticky clay. Only one individual was allowed within the grid area while staking the site. Boot scraping was completed in each grid to prevent loss of bone or tracking bone across the site. Also, to control further site disturbance, since clay adherence to footwear was significant and the excavator tended to sink several inches in some locations while trying to stake the grid, two by two meter sections were initially gridded and strung, with the southwest corner ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 12 designated N0E0 (Figure 9). All units were identified on paperwork by their northeast corner and consist of a one by one meter unit. As the excavator cleared the external units, grids were further divided into one by one meter sections with string. Surface scraping of the sediments to collect the numerous bone fragments commenced in N5E6. The crew worked in a counter clockwise direction, scraping N5E6, then N5E5, N5E4, until the shoreline was reached and then moved to the south. Scraping of the sediment occurred until hard-packed, sterile sediment was reached, approximately 10 cm in depth. No bones were evident on the surface after scraping was completed. The outermost area was scraped first, and then the crew moved in one-meter intervals toward the location of the DHU pit. All units were hand troweled. Shovel scraping to five centimeters was attempted in N5E6 as a method of removing backdirt left by the DHU and UNTLFA excavations, but the clay was too thick and sticky making it impossible. Each unit, instead, was hand-scraped to 10 cm. Field screening was impossible, thus all sediment was bagged and brought to the lab for water screening. Approximately four 30-40 pound bags of sediment were collected per one by one meter unit. The number of bags collected depended upon the thickness of piled backdirt left after DHU, DMEO, and UNTLFA excavations (Figure 10). At the time of excavation, most areas were flattened from rain and backfilling. In unit N2E2, numerous teeth and several small mandibular fragments were found in a concentrated pile on the surface. The concentration included molars, incisors and pre-molars, and two additional teeth were found within the first two centimeters in the unit’s southeast corner. This unit was chosen to test to a 20 cm depth to look for additional remains as the original DHU pit had not yet been located and the concentration resembled the original find. Three quadrants of this unit were excavated to a depth of 20 cm to search for additional in-situ remains and garner an understanding of the sterile sediment depth and appearance. Sterile sediment was encountered at approximately 8-10 cm in depth, depending upon the amount of backdirt present. All bones and teeth were found in the first 10 cm. The sterile sediment was mottled clay (33% each 2.5Y 6/2, 7.5YR 6/8, and 10YR 6/3). The backdirt was clay (10YR 6/4 to 10YR 5/3), depending upon the amount of drying of the clay before the Munsell color was recorded. The sediments below 10 cm were extremely waterlogged and digging was difficult and slow. Within 10 minutes of digging to 15-20 cm, groundwater began seeping into the excavation pit (Figure 11). The image in Figure 11 was taken a few hours after excavation of that unit on December 9, 2011. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 14 A small pocket of skeletal elements was encountered at the northwest corner of Unit N3E2 and southwest corner of Unit N4E2, labeled Feature 1. The pocket measured six by six centimeters. Two long bone shafts were perpendicular in the soil. Depth to the top of the remains was 11 cm and the base of the feature was 18 cm. Reconstruction from DHU photographs indicates a backdirt pile was located in this vicinity and the stake for the DHU grid would have been located in this general area. The feature contained two long bone shafts and a mix of rib and cranial fragments. It is highly probable the remains washed into the hole that remained after DHU collected the stakes for their grid. No definitive feature outline could be determined. Scraping in the center of the gridded area resulted in the discovery of the original pit excavated by DHU, DMEO, and UNTLFA. The area was delineated and all sediment to sterile was collected. The pit contained backdirt from prior excavations and bone fragments were mixed throughout pit fill. The pit continued to fill with water once a depth of 15 cm was reached, however, removal continued until 25 cm was reached. Due to the waterlogged conditions, it was difficult to ascertain the base of the pit, however a distinct change was apparent in soil texture as sterile was reached. No additional remains were found at the level of the sterile sediment or the pit walls. Between Thursday, December 8, 2011 and Friday, December 9, 2011, the water line rose approximately 10-20 cm towards the excavation units. Excavation proved difficult due to the water logged conditions and texture of the wet clay and units excavated to 10 cm had standing water at the base within 30 minutes. Due to the need for water screening, any skeletal elements found while excavating were bagged separately to reduce fragmentation. Piece plotting of remains within each unit was not recorded due to the small size of the fragments, no elements were found in-situ, and skeletal elements were mixed across the site. Only the concentration of teeth was recorded in unit N2E2 since the concentration resembled the original find. Additionally, it was unclear if certain backdirt piles corresponded with the DMU and DMEO quadrants since excavations occurred over several days, with the grid only being employed on the second day of excavation, shovels and rakes were utilized, and no notes were taken during excavation. Survey The survey area consisted of a 1022-meter long section of lake bed extending from the John Paul Jones Park boat ramp southwest to the platform present for construction of the George Bush Highway ramp and bridge and southwest edge of the John Paul Jones Park (Figure 12). A pedestrian survey of the area revealed no evidence of eroding cultural materials or human skeletal elements; the surface debris washed onto the edge of the lake inside the retaining wall impeded surface visibility and the retaining wall precluded visual inspection of the shoreline for approximately 940 meters of the survey area. The retaining wall ended approximately 82.5 meters from the southwest end of the survey area; however, thick vegetation, piled decaying lumber, and debris prevented close inspection of most of the embankment and lake bed. No bank profiles could be constructed due to the obstructions. The survey crew was stopped by a police officer at 9:30 am; he made sure they were not looters. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 15 Figure 12. Survey area from the John Paul Jones Park boat ramp to the southwest edge of John Paul Jones Park. Within the survey area, between 8 and 15 meters of shore was visible. In most areas, erosion prevention materials were piled along the retaining wall, precluding the potential of visually inspecting the area. The entire shoreline was heavily littered with modern trash, including plastic bottles, chairs, fishhooks, and tires. Large pieces of cement were heavily scattered across the southwestern portion of the survey area, including historic brick in the immediate vicinity of a spillway, with “PALMER” stamped on the surface. A few sherds of salt glaze ceramics and one fragment of milk glass were also present. Heavy debris cover was present near the southwestern portion of the area, creating a rise in the topography. A heavily weathered human distal humerus1 bone fragment was found at that rise, on the thick pile of cement and road construction debris (Figure 12). The weathering of this fragment, along with significant water damage indicated that it had been exposed for a long time. No burial could be found near the location, or at any point along the survey area, and it is probable that this bone was found at some point and carried to this location or was moved by the lake. Its presence does not represent another burial, since it was found on top of the large pile of construction debris. The age of the fragments cannot be determined without radiocarbon dating, which may be difficult due to the weathering and taphonomic processes. This bone fragment was found near the 1991 burials (Hibbs and Hibbs 2006), and was also repatriated to the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes.1 ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 16 Screening and Sorting Recovered Matrix All sediment excavated was water screened in the laboratory at ARC. An estimated 2,340 pounds of sediment were brought to the lab for water screening and, due to the amount of clay; water screening took two weeks to complete. The collected sediment was mixed with baking soda and water to dissolve the clay so the slurry could be easily screened. This procedure prevented the necessity of searching through larger clay pieces which could result in greater fragmentation of the bone. All material was screened through 1/8 inch mesh in order to recover small bone fragments. The process was highly successful, recovering over 12,000 countable bone fragments, including a malleus, a middle ear Ossicles. Once the sediment was water screened, the screened material was dried and re-bagged, according to original unit. Calcium carbonate nodules were present in all screened material in large amounts. Thus, all skeletal fragments were hand sorted from the calcium carbonate. Any remains larger than 1 mm were separated from the debris, trash, and calcium carbonate. Identifiable fragments that could be assigned to a skeletal element or category of skeletal element were then sorted and stored by unit from the remaining unidentifiable bone fragments. Both identifiable and unidentifiable bone fragments collected via the screening process were counted and cataloged per collection bag and the total gram weight per bag tallied, with 998 total identifiable fragments and 11,298 unidentifiable fragments collected during screening (Appendix A and B). Bone fragments less than 1 mm were not sorted or counted and the matrix, consisting of small bone fragments and calcium carbonate nodules, was combined and saved for repatriation. A total of 12,913 fragments were collected and are described below (Appendices A and B). ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 17 HUMAN REMAINS ANALYSIS Methods, Reconstruction and MNI Laboratory methods followed Stodder et al. (2010) recommendation for working with comingled remains. All fragments were sorted according to element, when possible, and counted. Long bone sorting included categories for bone that could not be identified by element and were sorted as large long bone fragments (tibia, femur, and humeral fragments) and small long bone fragments (radius, ulna, and fibula). Fragments were matched, when possible, to larger elements. Reconstruction efforts focused on the bones that would yield the most information, such as the femur, tibia, and humerus. Only a few refits were possible on the crania and very few identifiable cranial fragments were present. Minimum number of individuals (MNI) was calculated after refitting was complete. Non- repeatable skeletal elements for features were counted. Only one element or feature could be identified in several cases, however, several elements, including the talus, anterior crest of the tibia, medial deltoid attachment on the humerus, complete patella, and right radial notch on the ulna all indicate a MNI of four individuals (Table 1). Skeletal elements could not be matched between individuals; however skeletal elements could be paired within the element in many cases. For example, two femora could be identified as belonging to the same individual, however, reconstructing which set of femora belonged with which set of humeri or tibiae was not possible. Reconstruction of most skeletal elements was also impossible due to the highly fragmented condition of the skeletal elements and trabecular bone. The bone fragmentation was due to a combination of the age of the skeleton and the use of shovels and rakes by DHU and the DMEO. Auricular surfaces were present on some fragments of ilium, however the surface was either too highly eroded or had evidence of fresh breaks precluding analysis. The extreme fragmentary condition of the ilium, ischium, and pubis prevented using these bones from sex or age estimation. Table 1. Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) Count per Skeletal Element.

Though some fragments were larger in size, the portions needed for assessment of sex were damaged. The greater sciatic notch was visible on several ilia fragments, however, most were too small for an accurate identification. On the skull, only 6 supra orbital edges were available for analysis, but none were larger than 10 mm in width. Of the three temporal bones identifiable, two had fresh breaks through the mastoid processes. Sex of the individuals was determined by talus measurements. Measurements followed the protocols set in Steele (1976) and Barrett et al. (2001) Barrett et al. (2001) used the talus to estimate the sex of individuals in an Archaic Native American Population. Their sex determinations were based upon volume of the talus, calculated by obtaining the product of the ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 19 talus length, width, and height. Only two tali from 41DL8 were complete for volume measurements and both indicate the individuals were male ( Table 2). Wilbur (1998) utilized talus dimension to estimate sex in prehistoric Native American remains from West Central Illinois and tested the results against additional populations, including the Arikara. Comparisons with Wilbur’s (1998:185) talus breadth section points indicate that all tali trochlea breadth measurements are consistent with males. One temporal bone had a complete mastoid process. This mastoid process size is consistent with a male/probable male, with a score of 4/5. Scoring was based upon criteria in Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994). A developmental defect of the external auditory meatus is present on this bone and it is unclear if this condition affects the size of the mastoid process. Table 2.

Age The fragmented nature of the remains precluded the use of typical aging methods on the remains. Of the skeletal elements that could be assessed, the most accurate post-cranial age that could be identified was “adult”. The best preserved skeletal elements of these individuals were the teeth. Wear patterns were significant (Appendix C), and the amount of wear on the molars indicated the individuals were at least in their mid-30s, based upon Lovejoy (1985) criteria. However, using wear patterns for aging is difficult because cultural factors, such a types of food consumed, texture of the foods, and tool use of the teeth, can alter the rate at which teeth wear. Scuilli (1997:231) indicates that Ohio Valley Late Archaic populations had extreme rates of wear with low frequencies of pathologies. Root transparency is a more accurate method for aging individuals than tooth wear. Lamendin (1992) and Prince and Ubelaker (2002) used root transparency for dental aging and Prince and Ubelaker (2002:114) found the technique is most accurate for individuals 30 to 69 years of age. Prince and Ubelaker (ibid) also indicate that sex should be taken into account when employing this method and may result in an over estimation of age of some individuals. Unfortunately, their formulae correcting for ancestry and sex did not ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 20 include Native American root transparency calculations, therefore Lamendin (1992) calculations are utilized. Due to the lack of bone preservation, this method of aging was the best option. Before age could be estimated, teeth were sorted by “individual” based upon wear patterns, presence of alveolar bone in which teeth could be refitted after being sorted by tooth type, and color of the teeth. Maxillary and mandibular molars were also checked for fit, ensuring wear patterns matched. Lamendin (1992) methods were used on single rooted teeth. Only a few teeth could be measured for root transparency since many of the teeth had taphonomic changes in which calcium carbonate infiltrated the root of the tooth, starting at the apex. Tooth root transparency was measured using Mituyoto Digital calipers to the 0.01mm level. Teeth were placed on a light board and tooth root transparency was measured on the labial side of the tooth. Root height was measured from the apex to the crown on the labial side of the tooth and periodontosis height was also measured on the labial portion. The formula used to calculate age was (0.18xP)+(0.42xT)+25.53= age estimation. All age estimates fell in the middle adult range, with individuals in the late thirties ( Table 3), and are being categorized as Middle Adult (30-50 years of age-at-death). Table 3.

P=(Periodontosis Height x 100)/Root Height; T=(Transparency Height x 100)/root height Stature Stature estimates were calculated on long bones in which segments of reconstructed bone could be measured. Complete reconstruction was impossible on the tibia, femora, and humeri, with most epiphyses missing. Femoral heads had the greatest survival rate of the epiphyses of the tibia, femora, and humeri, although only two could be refit. Long bone lengths were reconstructed from segment analysis (Appendix D). Segment analysis calculations were based on formula found in Steele and McKern (1969). Their regression formulae were based upon prehistoric American Indian populations of Mississippian cultural affinities. Genovés (1967) stature formulae were used because the Genovés sample probably most closely resembles the population under study. Scuilli et al. (1990:276) also designed stature regression formulae which included Late Archaic skeletal remains and represented almost half of the ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 21 skeletal sample. The stature estimates were similar to those calculated utilizing Genovés (1967) formulae (Table 4). Bone numbers for each skeletal elements were generated randomly and do not correlate to each other across elements. Thus, the humerus under “Bone No. 1” is not from the same individual listed as “Bone No. 1” femur. No stature estimates could be calculated for bones 4, 5, 6, and 8 for all elements. Stature reconstructions from Genovés (1967) formula indicate that the males range in height from 156.77 cm to 172.04 cm, with a great range in height in the males in this sample. Average stature of the individuals, including all results of the tibiae and femora from the Genovés formula is 163.81 cm and the use of the Scuilli et al. (1990) formulae resulted in an average 163.70 cm. Femora 3 and 7 were matched and resulted in similar stature reconstructions. Stature estimates that were based upon more segments have greater accuracy than those based upon one segment, thus there is the potential that some of the calculations have underestimated the height of the individual.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 22 indicate that at least one stature estimate from 41DL8 (158.96 cm) was less than the shortest stature listed in the ranges of the other reports, with 41AU36 and 41AU37 reporting the lowest male stature at 163.3 cm (Table 5). It is unclear to what degree the use of segment analysis influenced the stature estimates at 41DL8. It is also unclear whether the short statured individual was also the same individual with the external auditory atresia, and, as a result, was malnourished during childhood due to the developmental defect or whether there was a condition associated with the disease that resulted in stunting (See Pathology for a description of the condition).

(1966).Only males were included (n=3) and stature was reconstructed from femoral length. d Recalculated from Navey (1974). Average includes males only (n=5). Pathology Little pathology was present on the skeletal remains. There was no evidence of porotic hyperostosis or any changes associated with malnutrition or nutritional deficiencies. Dental caries were minimal and were present on six of the fifty-four teeth (Appendix C). Caries included occlusal and mesial dental caries and were small, between 1 to 2 mm in size. One ante- mortem loss was recorded.2 Periodontal degeneration was minimal and could be observed on several molars. Use of the dental aging technique by Lamendin (1992) required recording periodontal degeneration. The measurements all indicate minor to moderate periodontosis. Periodontal disease was not present on the few fragments of alveolar bone available for analysis. Dental wear was moderate to severe on all teeth. Dental wear patterns were recorded according to the scoring in Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994). Most first and second maxillary and mandibular molars were worn until dentin was exposed across the surface of the tooth. Wear was greatest in individual 3’s teeth and all had dentin exposure across the entire surface. Although attrition was significant on the Molar 1 and Molar 2, secondary dentin formation was not present and wear had not exposed the pulp cavity. 2 Very little alveolar bone was present and many of the teeth missing may have been due to ante-mortem loss. However, the rate could not be calculated due to the absence of much of the alveolar bone. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 23 Polishing indicative of occupational use was present on the incisors of individual 3 and 4. The lingual portion of the upper incisors was worn smooth on the lingual surface and almost obliterated the presence of shoveling. In individual 4, polishing was also present on the lingual side of the maxillary incisors. The maxillary left canine and right second incisor also had evidence of wear on the labial surface of the teeth. A flattened location was evident across the labial surface, consistent with material being pulled across the surface or filing. The flattened area was oriented in a mesial/distal pattern and was present only on inferior portions of the teeth closest to the occlusal plane. Figure 13. Right temporal bone with a developmental defect of the external auditory meatus. The only temporal bone with an undamaged external auditory meatus exhibited a developmental defect. In this case, the external auditory meatus and the tympanic bone failed to develop. As a result, only a bifurcated, slight depression was present at the location where the external auditory canal should have developed (Figure 13). This condition is known as external auditory atresia and this case is the most severe expression of the condition. Complete atresia results in a tympanic plate that does not develop and the styloid process is usually missing or is not fully formed (Barnes 1994:198). Aplasia of the external auditory meatus can also result in malformation of the external ear. Although auditory atresia can be acquired, complete atresia is generally the result of congenital defects (Hodges et al. 1990). Atresia can be associated with many different syndromes and congenital defects, such as Treacher Collins syndrome. However, the condition can also occur as an isolated phenomenon. Isolated incidences of the defect are more common in males than females (2:1) and more commonly occurs on the right than the left ear (65%) (Gorlin et al. 1995).

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 24 the internal structure of the ear, the presence or malformation of the ossicles could not be observed but the breakage revealed a pneumaticized area in the location the internal acoustic meatus should have been present. The sulcus sigmoideus was also absent. Atresia of the auditory meatus is classified into three conditions, ranked by severity, with Type III most closely associated with Treacher Collins Syndrome. This individual must be ranked a Type II since the deformity of a tympanic cavity is not able to be observed and radiographs are not present to evaluate the degree of pneumatization of the mastoid process ( typology defined in Gorlin et al. 1995: 92). The condition affects Native Americans at a five-fold rate to the general occurrences, with a rate at 1:2000 Native American births as compared to 1:15,000 white births (ibid). With the severe form present in this case, this individual likely suffered from complete hearing loss in this ear, which would have made life challenging. Unilateral hearing loss can result in an inability to localize sound on a horizontal plane (Humes et al. 1980), as well as communication issues associated with speech and language delays (Lieu 2004). There is the potential this individual suffered from associated syndromes that could have resulted in further life complications and challenges; such information would require further DNA analysis since the fragmentary nature of the bones prevented observations for additional bone developmental defects. Only a few accounts of the condition are reported in the archaeological literature and are from seven cases found in Peru, a cave in New Mexico, and a mound in Arkansas (Hrdlicka 1933), historic Canada (Swanston et al. 2011), the Late Woodland in Iowa (Hodges et al. 1990), and Anglo-Saxon England (Wells 1962), and a historic case from Slovakia (Masnicova 2001). This case is the oldest radiocarbon dated example of this developmental defect and possibly the oldest known archaeological case. The only additional case that may date to a similar period and be from an individual with a hunter-gatherer subsistence pattern is the New Mexico case. It is listed by Hrdlicka (1933) as being “collected by Edgar B. Howard” and was found in a cave west of Carlsbad, New Mexico. Howard did excavate several Basketmaker Period (BC2000-AD500) burials in Burnett Cave (Heffner 1932) before Hrdlicka’s report was published in 1933. Radiocarbon Dates and Isotope Results With the permission of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, cortical bone from the femora of two individuals was submitted to Beta Analytic, Inc. for radiocarbon dating. These segments of bone were chosen due to the good cortical bone preservation and the fragments could be specified as belonging to two distinct individuals. Beta Analytic, Inc. reported that bone collagen was well preserved and each sample provided adequate amounts of carbon for the analysis and measurements to proceed normally (Appendix E). Segments of bone were randomly chosen from two individuals, with samples taken from Femur numbers 5 and 7. Each bone sample was washed with deionized water, the surface was scraped free of the outer layers, a small portion was crushed gently, and a cold and dilute hydrochloric acid was applied until the apatite was removed. Any rootlets present among the collagen were removed. A sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pretreatment was applied to be certain no secondary organic acids were present (Beta Analytic collagen extraction protocols, http://www.radiocarbon.com/pretreatment-carbon-dating.htm, accessed August 22, 2012). ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 25 Radiocarbon analysis results indicate the remains date to the early Late Archaic period and confirm expert opinion dating the dart points to the same period. Radiocarbon age on Femur number 5 was 3010 ± 30 BP, with a two sigma calibration BC 1380 to 1130 (Table 6). Femur number 7 radiocarbon tests resulted in a conventional radiocarbon age of 2860 ± 30 BP, and calibrated dates to a two sigma calibration were BC 1120 to 930 (Table 6). Table 6. Radiocarbon δ13C and δ15N results from 41DL8. Sample Conventional Intercept 2 Sigma 1 Sigma 13C/12C 15N/14N Radiocarbon Calibration Calibration Age Femur 5 3010 ± 30 BP BC 1260 BC 1380 to 1340 BC 1310 to 1260 - 19.6 + 9.6 BC 1320 to 1190 BC 1240 to 1210 BC 1180 to 1160 BC 1140 to 1130 Femur 7 2860 ± 30 BP BC 1010 BC 1120 to 970 BC 1050 to 1000 - 18.4 + 9.5 BC 960 to 930 The lack of overlap in the dates suggests these two individuals that were buried in the same pit, were not alive at the same time. The insufficient contextual data associated with the excavation prevents evaluating the remains depositional relationship. Since we are unsure of the exact association of the remains and whether the remains were articulated or disturbed, we offer three scenarios that may have resulted in the differing radiocarbon ages. One, the pit could have been re-opened for subsequent burial of individuals on multiple occasions. Due to the good preservation of the cortical bone, it is more likely that the remains were covered between burial events if this scenario occurred. Two, at least one of the individuals, represented by Femur 5, was bundled and retained until being interred with the individual represented by Femur 7 and the additional two non-dated individuals. Since radiocarbon dates were not obtained for the other two individuals, it is unknown if they would have been bundled or died at the same time as the Femur 7 individual. Three, a minor discrepancy in the preservation of the collagen could have resulted in the 10 year gap between the two sigma age ranges. It would have been difficult to dig into a grave without disturbing the original burial. Due to the dearth of contextual evidence, it is difficult to assess whether the burials had been disturbed by multiple interments. Beta Analytic indicated the cortical bone was well preserved and provided plenty of carbon for accurate measurements. While the potential exists that the first two scenarios could have occurred, it is possible a minor discrepancy in the collagen preservation could have resulted in the incongruent radiocarbon dates even though Beta reported good collagen preservation. When obtaining radiocarbon dates on bone, it is recommended that nitrogen isotope values are also obtained. This preference is due to the fact that the consumption of fish can results in a reservoir affect requiring a correction to radiocarbon dates in individuals with an aquatic component to the diet (Cook et al. 2001). Though archaeological evidence did not support an interpretation that fishing was a component of the early Late Archaic diet, little is known regarding the diet during this period in the North Texas area. Additionally, with the proximity of the burials to the riverine environment, it was logical to conclude that there was the possibility that the inhabitants may have relied on fish for a portion of their diet and exploited the aquatic resources near the burial site.

Nitrogen isotope analysis not only provides important information needed for the proper correction of radiocarbon dates on bone, but also provides significant information on protein consumption and the type of protein being consumed, whether terrestrial or aquatic. The carbon isotope δ13C also provides information regarding the types of plant material being consumed, whether C plants (grasses, trees, shrubs, tubers, walnuts) or C plants (maize, amaranth, 3 4 chenopodia). Consumption of CAM plants (cacti and succulents) have values that overlap C 3 and C plants and their consumption can be identified as well (Bousman and Quigg 2006). 4 Ratios of δ13C can be affected by the type of plants consumed by animals used as protein sources in humans. For example, bison and marine animals may consume a diet with more C than C 4 3 plants, resulting in a less negative δ13C value than animals feeding on a C based diet. This can 3 alter the δ13C values of humans who have a diet high in these types of protein sources. Due to the lack of research on faunal isotope values for North Texas, comparisons and interpretations are based on general published averages of δ13C values (Larsen 1997; Schoeninger and Moore 1992), δ15N values (Schoeninger and Moore 1992; Bousman and Quigg 2006; Cook et al. 2001), and interpretations of values reported from other Archaic and Woodland burials in Texas (Bousman and Quigg 2006). Enrichments values, differences in the prey- predator values of carbon and nitrogen in the bone collagen, are based on the case studies of Bocherens and Drucker (2003), indicating δ13C values will increase 0-2% and δ15N will increase 3-5%. Isotope values of consumers of a diet based on C plants will generally have δ13C values ranging 3 from -22% to -38% (Larsen 1997) or -20% to -24% averaging approximately -26% (Schoeninger and Moore 1992). Those with a diet mostly comprise of C will range from -9% to -21% (Larsen 4 1997) or -9% to -16% with a mode of -12% (Schoeninger and Moore 1992). Consumers of cactus and succulents will have a range falling somewhere between the two, with rates closer to C (Schoeninger and Moore 1992). Bousman and Quigg (2006) place the division between C 4 3 and CAM/ C diets at -14% δ13C. Nitrogen values for terrestrial diets generally falls between 4 +8% to 10% δ15N. Evidence of fish or marine protein sources generally results in higher δ15N values, above +12% (calculated from Schoeninger and Moore 1992 data), however data from Katzenberg and Weber (1999) indicates some fish may have lower δ15N, with one reported as +7.3%, and that fish δ15N can widely vary (Cook et al. 2001). Thus, future studies in the isotope values of terrestrial and freshwater resources in the North Texas region would be extremely useful in interpreting subsistence patterns since a baseline from the local animals is needed to accurately calculate enrichment values. The δ15N values at +9.5% and +9.6% from Femora 5 and 7 indicate the neither of the individuals consumed freshwater fish (Table 6 and 7). The values fall within the typical values of a terrestrial based diet, in which individuals consume mammals such as deer and elk. Therefore, though they resided, or were buried, next to the riverine environment, fish were not exploited by these individuals for protein resources. Freshwater fish should have resulted in a much higher nitrogen component than found in these δ15N results, closer to δ15N values of +12% to 16%. If we compare these to results found in Shoeninger and Moore (1992), the meat consumption is consistent with mule deer at Pecos Pueblo (δ15N between 9-11%).

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 28 The δ13C data, at -19.6% and -18.4% (Table 6 and 7), indicate concentrations on C plants and 3 consumption of protein sources that relied more heavily on C plants for their diet. Though 3 slightly outside the range stated by Schoeninger and Moore (1992) of -20% to -34%, the values represent a diet almost purely based on C plants with the individuals from Lake Ray Hubbard 3 probably consuming some C plant materials, CAM (cactus or succulents), or occasional bison 4 which resulted in the slightly higher δ13C values. When compared to the CAM based diets reported in Bousman and Quigg (2006), it is easily discerned that the values reflect a greater C 3 component in their diet (Table 7). Only a few individuals from Seminole Sink have δ13C values comparable to the individuals from Lake Ray Hubbard. Thus, the δ13C and δ15N values for both individuals indicate they had a hunter-gatherer subsistence pattern focused on browsing mammals. These results are consistent with overall subsistence patterns reported for Cooper Lake sites (Fields 2004). Late Archaic patterns from this East Texas area entailed hunting of animals found in woodland and woodland-edge areas, with gathering of wild plant foods, including nuts, tubers, and seeds. Fields (2004) does report use of aquatic environments within the hunting zone; however, the isotope values from Lake Ray Hubbard do not suggest the use of freshwater resources even though they were found within meters of the confluence of two drainages. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 29 ASSOCIATED FUNERARY OBJECTS Besides the presence of several pieces of fine-grained quartzite lithic debris, the only artifacts found directly associated with the grave were seven dart points which are described in Table 8 below and three of which are previously shown in Figure 7. Each point is almost complete and the tip of dart point 1 was found during matrix washing. The three incomplete points are missing the tip or the base. The points have been inspected by a variety of authorities and their consensus is that the points are probably early Late Archaic in age (Elton Prewitt, personal communication). Prewitt, Karl Kibler (personal communication), and Dan McGregor (personal communication) say that they are similar to Untyped Group 1 dart points described from the Higginbotham site at Lake Waco (Mehalchick and Kibler 2008:300-307) which has been dated between 1270 and 380 B.C. at that site. However, all three authorities agree that the stems of the specimens from 41DL8 are too short for the points to fit into that type. Several of the pieces show evidence of having been reworked. There is no evidence that the raw materials were heat-treated before they were manufactured. The raw materials listed in Table 8 were identified by Larry Banks of Paradise, Texas (personal communication) and Don Wyckoff of Norman, Oklahoma (personal communication). Detailed descriptions of the three raw materials are contained in the book “From Mountain Peaks to Alligator Stomachs” (Banks 1990). Table 8. Description of Dart Points from Site 41DL8.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 30 The Edwards chert is from central Texas and is distinct from the Uvalde or Ogallala gravel cherts that are found in the Dallas/Fort Worth area (Banks 1990:60-61). Ogallala quartzite (Banks 1990:56-57) is found in the upland gravel fields that have been described as being present in north central Texas (Byrd 1971; Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Trask 2005). The Johns Valley chert is from southern Oklahoma but actually contains older Arkansas gravels that were mixed in the more recent Johns Valley formation (Banks 1990:45-47). The presence of Late Archaic dart points with the four skeletons in a single burial pit would seem to lead to the conclusion that the grave is Late Archaic in age. However, this conclusion is uncertain since no other datable artifacts have been reported from the site and no datable materials other than the human bones were recovered from excavation. Figure 14.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 31 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The discovery of four prehistoric Native American skeletons associated in a single pit at site 41DL8 presents an interesting opportunity to review a wealth of information about prehistoric burials from sites in the well-studied East Fork Watershed. Burials from 14 sites (Figure 15) in the watershed are tabulated below (Table 9) based on a compilation provided by W.W. Crook, III (personal communication) and with the addition of more recent information from sites along Spring Creek (Peter and Clow 2000; Linder-Linsley 1996) and Rowlett Creek (Cliff, Peter, Hunt, Shannabrook, Carter, and Green 1996; Hibbs and Hibbs 2006) above where it empties into Lake Ray Hubbard. This sample presents the extensive results of various professional and avocational investigations of this one watershed in north central Texas and all of the sites except 41DL8 and 41DL396 date to the Late Prehistoric (AD 800-1400). Comparable data are not presently available from other watersheds in the Trinity River Basin, such as the Elm Fork, West Fork, Mountain Creek, White Rock Creek, Richland/Chambers Creeks, and Cedar Creek, although major investigations have been done in each of these areas. In addition, no comparable mass of information is available from the upper parts of the Neches, Sabine, Sulphur, or Brazos rivers. In part, this opportunity is due to the foresight of the members of the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) to get permission to conduct excavations before lake construction began after World War II throughout the East Fork valley. Subsequent studies at Lake Lavon and Lake Ray Hubbard were further facilitated because DAS members had published the results of their studies in their journal, The Record. This publication highlighted the presence of sites containing features, such as Wylie Focus pits and house floors, site locations, which are near the margin of the Caddo Area, and emphasized that site and artifact preservation was excellent. Site 41DL8 stands out from the other sites listed in Table 9 because it is the only site that dates to the early Late Archaic and where seven dart points are associated with the four adult male skeletons that were discovered. While evidence of Late Prehistoric occupation was not reportedly found at the site when it was first recorded or again before Lake Ray Hubbard was surveyed for archaeological sites, the presence of the seven dart points in association with the remains indicates that these remains represent the oldest known burial along the East Fork. The summary of burials within the Lake Lavon and East Fork Watershed in Table 9 also reveals a pattern unusual to North Texas. An apparent Late Prehistoric pattern of interring multiple individuals within a single pit is demonstrated by the reported findings of 95 burials at thirteen other sites that occur in the middle reaches of the East Fork Watershed between Interstate Highway 20 and the upper end of Lake Lavon.3 The burials contain a combination of adults or adults and children in flexed positions. On the East Fork, 57 individuals are buried individually in flexed positions, while the remaining 42 individuals are buried in a total of 12 pits in multiples of from two to seven. The majority of skeletons are adults and it is expected that infants are 3 It is important to note that this pattern would not probably be apparent or stand out from the surrounding parts of north Texas if it had not been for the active involvement of members of the Dallas Archeological Society in the locating and excavating of burials in the respective lake areas long before there was a wealth of state and federal laws which now mandate investigations. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

In rare cases decapitated bodies were apparently placed in pits but with no grave goods except that burial 40 had three dart points in it. A review of the literature reveals that sites with burials are not reported for the area upstream from Lake Lavon nor are any reported at sites south from Interstate 20 to the Trinity River junction. Upstream in Dallas County, burials are reported from the White Rock Spillway site (Kirkland and Harris 1941; Harris 1949; Hatzenbuehler and Harris 1949), from the Dalbey site (Skinner, Bousman, Todd, Craver, Jennings, Bush, and Tawater 2005), and from Mountain Creek (Peter and McGregor 1988:113-115; Skinner, Todd, and Todd 2007:1). Of these burials, no confirmed multiple burials are reported, however Feature 1 at the Baggett Branch site at Joe Pool Lake could have been a two individual grave but the description is inconclusive. Otherwise, all of the reported burials are single interments as those itemized in Table 9 for the East Fork, had few or no artifacts and appear to be Late Prehistoric in age. Almost no burials were found and reported at excavations in the West Fork and the Elm Fork Watersheds and the few found were also single interments with no associated grave goods. A burial containing two flexed females and an expanding stem dart point is reported from the Pecan Springs site (Sorrow 1966:8) at Lake Bardwell, in Ellis County. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 37 To the east, no multiple burials were found in the Sulphur River Watershed despite years of excavation at nearby Cooper Lake and only single interments are reported from Lake Fork Reservoir (Bruseth and Perttula 1981) and the Yarbrough site (Johnson 1962:220-224) in the upper Sabine River Watershed. No burials were found at the Limerick site at Lake Tawakoni (Duffield 1961) but the author notes that artifacts from the site do not show any affinity to those described from Wylie Focus sites located in the adjacent East Fork Watershed (Duffield 1961:111-112). The only comparable data come from the Sanders site in Lamar County (Krieger 1946:175; Jackson, Goldstein, and Krieger 2000) where 60 individuals were uncovered and twelve were in individual graves and the remaining 48 were in nine graves containing from three to eight bodies. Other Red River Watershed sites and multiple burial graves have been reported downstream at the Sam Kaufman (Roitsch) site (Skinner, Harris, and Anderson 1969:26-36) and the Belcher Mound site (Webb 1959:66-116). It is interesting that marine shell artifacts indicative of the Southern Cult are common at these three prehistoric Caddo sites (Skinner 1980) and that shell artifacts are prominent among the graves found at several sites in the East Fork, although these sites are not considered to be Caddo sites by various authors or by the Caddo Nation. In the East Fork, grave goods were found in less than half of the graves and the common artifact types are bone tools and marine shell ornaments. No locally made pottery is reported to have been found with any of the burials and Sanders Engraved pottery, a water bottle and another vessel, is the only pottery type reported. Miscellaneous artifacts include dart points but not arrowpoints, a boatstone, a mano, a mussel shell paint pot, a chipped stone knife, calcite crystals, a round stone, and red ochre. Grave goods are not as prominent as they are in the Caddo area to the east and northeast. In summary, the discovery of a burial pit containing four adult male Native Americans is consistent with a Late Prehistoric pattern of burying multiple individuals in a single burial pit. This pattern appears to be primarily unique to the East Fork Basin within the Trinity River Watershed and to the Red River to the northeast. Elsewhere, single interment is the primary burial pattern. However, the grave at site 41DL8 appears to be an exception since the associated dart points and the radiocarbon dates indicate at least two of the individuals had been placed in the ground more than a thousand years before the Late Prehistoric sites listed in Table 9. This lends support to the argument that the Wylie Focus is an obsolete concept (Bruseth and Martin 1987) or at least that it is poorly defined in light of more recent investigations. The excavations at site 41DL8 support an interpretation that Late Prehistoric occupants of the East Fork valley were linear descendants of earlier Late Archaic Native Americans. Training Opportunities The unexpected discovery of the 41DL8 graves and the resulting disinterment can provide an opportunity for training and developing processes to insure that graves are documented when encountered. Police departments would benefit from programs available to teach recognition of historic and pre-Columbian sites and skeletal remains, as well as training from the THC on protocols when such remains are encountered. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

HUMAN REMAINS AT LAKE RAY HUBBARD 41DL8 38 Testing Recommendations Destructive analysis is typically done on human bone on a case by case basis after consultation with potentially culturally affiliated tribes or nations. In some cases, the need for radiocarbon dating of bone is essential because of the lack of additional material that can provide an accurate date to which the individuals can be securely associated. The remains excavated from Lake Ray Hubbard are one example. Typically, if there are additional features associated with the human remains which contain datable materials, it is more appropriate to date those features giving the sensitivity of destructive testing on human remains. However, in the case of the remains from 41DL8 at Lake Ray Hubbard, the associated lithics were not able to be typed, other than an early Late Archaic association, and no additional material was available to use as a correlate. The remains were also highly fragmentary, precluding reconstruction of most of the bones and the crania and, thus, most analysis of the remains or identification of cultural modification, such as cradle boarding. In addition, since the initial removal was conducted during a possible homicide investigation, information regarding the placement of the lithics with the remains and notes or sketches denoting the context was not collected. While it was estimated the dart points date to the early Late Archaic, the inability to type the points indicates that there is a potential they are a not yet identified style and could be much older, or younger, than the estimated time frame. Thus, the radiocarbon dates from the bones provided the best information on context, if not the only context, available in this situation. This site is also unique as no other burials in the immediate vicinity have been dated or assigned an age earlier than the Late Prehistoric period, approximately AD 800-1400 (see Table 9). Dating of the bone was useful because the pattern of multiple interments is only found in Late Prehistoric burials but several of these burials also contain dart points. The dates identified the presence of an early pattern of interment and cultural continuity of this practice through time since the radiocarbon dates support the early Late Archaic date estimated from the dart points, and potential evidence for cultural affiliation of the site 41DL8 burials to those dated in the Late Prehistoric. The question of radiocarbon dating was taken to the Tribal Governing Council of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, and radiocarbon tests were conducted with tribal permission. Accurate radiocarbon dates on human bone require testing of δ15N to assess reservoir effects and both radiocarbon and nitrogen isotopes were analyzed. No reservoir effects from the consumption of freshwater fish or marine resources were present. Dates on the two individuals indicated that at least these two individuals were not alive during the same period, however the small burial location suggests they were buried simultaneously. Calibrated radiocarbon dates for the individual represented by Femur 5 are BC 1380 to BC 1130 (intercept BC 1260) and Femur 7 BC 1120 to BC 930 (intercept BC 1050). The presence of a multiple burial within the vicinity of numerous Late Prehistoric sites, also containing multiple burials, indicates to us that there is the potential that additional multiple burials could be expected within this watershed. It is recommended that during times of drought or low water levels, lake shores should be monitored for the exposure of additional human remains, archaeological features, and sites. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.
