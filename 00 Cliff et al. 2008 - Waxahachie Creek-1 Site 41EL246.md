Abstract PBS&J conducted geoarcheological investigations at the request of the Texas Department of Transportation for the proposed reconstruction of U.S. Highway 77 in Waxahachie, Ellis County, Texas. The project involved backhoe trenching in the floodplain of Waxahachie Creek. Proposed new right of way is estimated to be 500 feet (152 meters) for an estimated area of potential effect of 1.3 acres (1,190 feet [362.7 meters] long by 50 feet [15.2 meters] wide). One new archeological site was recorded. The Waxahachie Creek-1 site (41EL246) is a buried prehistoric site located within the floodplain south of Waxahachie Creek. The site contains prehistoric lithics and faunal remains, and it is believed to have a high research potential. By analogy with other prehistoric sites identified near the top of the West Fork soil in the upper Trinity River Basin, the site may date to the early part of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 700–1700). Because the project had a no-collection policy, there are no artifacts requiring curation. Final project records and photographs will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of the University of Texas at Austin. 052054302/080074 ii

Management Summary PBS&J conducted geoarcheological investigations at the request of the Texas Department of Transportation for proposed reconstruction of U.S. Highway 77 in Waxahachie from approximately 600 feet (ft) (182.9 meters [m]) south of Farm-to-Market Road 66, on the south end, to approximately 100 ft (30.5 m) north of McMillan Street, on the north end, in the City of Waxahachie, Ellis County. This linear project involves the construction of a new southbound bridge across Waxahachie Creek. The overall project is approximately 0.9 mile (1.4 kilometers [km]) in length and covers about 9.7 acres. The existing U.S. Highway 77 bridge over Waxahachie Creek is a two-lane, multiple-span structure supported by piers. It is 38 ft 11 inches (11.9 m) wide overall and 1,120 ft (341.4 m) long and consists of two travel lanes. The existing right of way (ROW) for the bridge is 50 ft (15.2 m) wide. The proposed project will add a new southbound bridge west of the existing bridge, which will become a northbound bridge only. The new southbound bridge will be 38 ft 11 inches (11.9 m) wide overall, 1,190 ft (362.71 m) long, and will also consist of two travel lanes. The bridge will be a two-lane, multiple-span structure supported by piers. The area of potential effect (APE) is approximately 39 ft (12 m) deep, while the proposed ROW for the new bridge will be 50 ft (15.2 m) wide. The depth of the APE is estimated from typical construction designs and practices. The new bridge will fall on privately owned land, and the Texas Department of Transportation will have to acquire new ROW. Landowner access was granted for all of the proposed new ROW. The fieldwork included geoarcheological investigations of the floodplain of Waxahachie Creek. The geoarcheological investigations were conducted in January of 2008 by Dr. Maynard Cliff and Josh Perry. Dr. Cliff served as Principal Investigator for the entire project. Five backhoe trenches were excavated within the floodplain of Waxahachie Creek, and one new archeological site was recorded. The Waxahachie Creek-1 site (41EL246) is a buried prehistoric site located within the floodplain south of Waxahachie Creek. The site contains prehistoric lithics and faunal remains, and it is believed to have a high research potential. By analogy with other prehistoric sites identified near the top of the West Fork soil in the upper Trinity River basin, the site may date to the early part of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 700–1700). It is recommended that further work be conducted within the proposed right of way to determine its National Register of Historic Places and State Archeological Landmark eligibility. In the event that unanticipated archeological deposits are encountered during construction, work would cease in the immediate vicinity of the discovery and Texas Department of Transportation’s archeological staff would be notified to initiate accidental discovery and emergency procedures under the provisions of the First Amended Programmatic Agreement among the Federal Highway Administration, the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservations, and the Texas Department of Transportation; and the Memorandum of Understanding between the Texas Historical Commission and the Texas Department of Transportation. 052054302/080074 vi

I. INTRODUCTION The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) proposes to reconstruct an existing segment of U.S. Highway 77 (US 77) from approximately 600 feet (ft) (182.9 meters [m]) south of Farm-to-Market Road 66 (FM 66), on the south end, to approximately 100 ft (30.5 m) north of McMillan Street, on the north end, in the City of Waxahachie, Ellis County, Texas (Figure 1). This linear project involves the construction of a new southbound bridge across Waxahachie Creek. The overall project is approximately 0.9 mile (1.4 kilometers [km]) in length and covers about 9.7 acres. The existing US 77 bridge over Waxahachie Creek is a two-lane, multiple-span structure supported by piers. It is 38 ft 11 inches (11.9 m) wide overall and 1,120 ft (341.4 m) long and consists of two travel lanes. The existing right of way (ROW) for the bridge is 50 ft (15.2 m) wide. The proposed project will add a new southbound bridge west of the existing bridge, which will become a northbound bridge only. The new southbound bridge will be 38 ft 11 inches (11.9 m) wide overall, 1,190 ft (362.7 m) long, and will also consist of two travel lanes. The bridge will be a two-lane, multiple-span structure supported by piers. The proposed ROW for the new bridge will be 50 ft (15.2 m) wide. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the new southbound bridge covers an area of about 1.3 acres (1,190 ft [362.7 m] long by 50 ft [15.2 m] wide) and is approximately 39 ft (12 m) deep. The depth of the APE is estimated from typical construction designs and practices. The new bridge will fall on privately owned land, and TxDOT will have to acquire new ROW. Based on the Ellis Central Appraisal District website, it appears that the portion of the project area north of Waxahachie Creek and south of the Burlington Northern Railroad ROW is owned by the City of Waxahachie; while the portion of the project area south of Waxahachie Creek and north of Cantrell Street (FM 1446) is owned by James J. Justice, of Waxahachie, and Brekenglenn Ltd., of Frisco, Texas. Based on a reconnaissance survey of the project APE, it was concluded that the proposed TxDOT US 77 bridge construction has the potential to impact previously unrecorded Historic Properties (36 CFR 800.16.[1]), or State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) (13 TAC 26.12) buried within the floodplain APE of Waxahachie Creek (Pemberton and Cliff 2007). As a result, backhoe trenching was recommended in the undisturbed floodplain areas north and south of the creek prior to construction of the new bridge. No further archeological work was recommended in the nonfloodplain portions of the project APE since those areas had already been disturbed by residential and commercial development. Five backhoe trenches were excavated within the floodplain of Waxahachie Creek. One new archeological site (41EL246) was recorded. It contains prehistoric artifacts and appears to have a high research potential. It is recommended that further work be conducted within the proposed ROW to determine its National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and SAL eligibility. These investigations were performed in compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code of 1977, as revised through 1995 (Texas Natural Resource Code: Title 9, Chapter 191), and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended through 1992 (PL 89–665 through PL 102–575; 80 Stat. 915; 052054302/080074 1

II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING PHYSIOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY The proposed reconstruction of US 77 in Waxahachie is located in Ellis County. Physiographically, the APE lies in the Blackland Prairie natural region of Texas. The APE contains grasses and remnants of a floodplain forest along the banks of Waxahachie Creek, with a wider belt to the north. Approximately, 50 percent of the project area is in woodland, and the remaining 50 percent consists of grassland. Geologically, most of the APE is mapped as the Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk (Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG] 1988). The Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk consists of chalk and microgranular calcite with some interbeds of calcareous clay and thin-bedded marl that weathers white (BEG 1988). SOILS The soil survey for Ellis County was used to identify and characterize the soils that are crossed by the proposed ROW. The APE is mapped as being on the Frio silty clay, frequently flooded (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service [USDA, SCS] 1964). The Frio silty clay map unit is described as well-drained, nearly level, granular silty clay and loamy soils with porous subsoil on floodplains (USDA, SCS 1964:15). No alluvial deposits are distinguished along Waxahachie Creek within the project area, although patches of Holocene alluvium are mapped upstream and downstream of the project area (BEG 1988). CLIMATE The climate of Ellis County is warm temperate and subhumid with long, hot summers, cool, fairly short winters, and moderately heavy precipitation throughout the year (USDA, SCS 1964). During the spring, summer, and fall seasons, air masses off of the Gulf of Mexico dominate, while during the winter, the climate is significantly affected by cold arctic air masses. Monthly temperatures for Ellis County, recorded in Waxahachie for the period from 1930 to 1961, ranged from an average of 7.8 degrees Celsius (°C) (46 degrees Fahrenheit [°F]) during the winter, to an average of 29.5°C (85.1°F) during the summer. The average annual precipitation of Ellis County is about 35.11 inches (89.1 centimeters [cm]), about half of which usually falls between April and September. July and August are the two driest months of the year. The average rainfall during these two months drops to 4.65 inches (6.7 cm), while April had the highest average rainfall, 5.04 inches (12.8 cm). Hailstorms are most common in the spring but are not widespread. The average annual snowfall for Ellis County is less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) and in many winters the snow is not measurable at all (USDA, SCS 1964). 052054302/080074 4

II. Environmental Setting HYDROLOGY The APE lies entirely within the Trinity River basin. The basin is bounded on the north by the Red River basin, on the east by the Sabine and Neches River basins, on the west by the Brazos and San Jacinto River basins, and on the south by the Neches-Trinity Coastal Basin. The Trinity is approximately 550 river- miles (885 km) in length and drains an area of 17,969 square miles (46,539.5 square kilometers [km²]) (Texas Water Development Board [TWDB] 1997). Bardwell Lake is the largest lake that occurs near the APE. Lake Waxahachie occupies a much smaller surface area but is closer to the APE. Bardwell Lake lies west of the city of Ennis and is at the confluence of Mustang and Waxahachie creeks. This lake has a drainage area of 178 square miles (461 km²) and was built for flood control and water conservation. The Trinity River Authority provides regulatory authority for water to the city of Ennis and other cities within Ellis County through Bardwell Lake (TWDB 1997). Lake Waxahachie lies south of the city of Waxahachie and impounds Prong Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River. This lake has a drainage area of 39 square miles (101 km²) and was built for municipal and industrial usage. The Ellis County Water Control and Improvement District Number One owns and operates this lake (Handbook of Texas Online 2001). Only one spring occurs in Ellis County, which flows from the Austin Chalk formation. Hawkins Springs is located approximately 9½ miles northeast of the APE (Brune 1975). A historical marker is located at the springs, which supplied water for the Peters Colony in 1848 (Brune 1975:42) VEGETATION The APE lies within the Blackland Prairies natural region of Texas as delineated by Gould (1975). In this area, the Blackland Prairies is bordered by the Post Oak Savannah region to the east and the Cross Timbers and Prairies region immediately to the west. The Blackland Prairies was once a sea of tall native grasses, including little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), and yellow indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans). However, the majority of the native landscape is now in cultivation or in range or improved pasture, while only small, fragmented remnants of native grassland, used for grazing or native hay crops, remain (Hatch et al. 1990; Texas Parks and Wildlife [TPWD] 2004). The vegetation in the APE, as indicated by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s Vegetation Types of Texas (TPWD 1984), consists largely of crops and other native and/or introduced grasses. Cropland is land used for the production of cultivated cover crops or row crops and grasslands that are associated with crop rotations. Common grasses found in the Blackland Prairie region include splitbeard bluestem (Andropogon ternarius), lovegrasses (Eragrostis spp.), bristlegrasses (Setaria spp.), threeawns (Aristida spp.), brome grasses (Bromus spp.), and species of Panicum and Paspalum. Typical forb species include brown-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta), partridge pea (Cassia fasciculata), croton (Croton spp.), rushes (Juncus spp.), goldenrods (Solidago spp.), asters (Aster spp.), thistle (Cirsium spp.), and American basketflower (Centaurea americana). Occasional woody species include common persimmon (Diospyros 052054302/080074 5

II. Environmental Setting virginiana), sumacs (Rhus spp.), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and southern dewberry (Rubus trivialis). Riparian forest stands generally occur in narrow floodplains along minor streams, and are limited to narrow bands of woody vegetation immediately adjacent to the drainages (Figure 2). Dominant species typically include water oak (Quercus nigra), sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), American elm (Ulmus americana), and slippery elm (U. rubra). Additional species frequently present in the bottomland/riparian forest include southern red oak (Q. falcata), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), black willow (Salix nigra), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), Osage orange (Maclura pomifera), Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense), and American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana). Saplings of the overstory, in addition to red maple (Acer rubrum), possumhaw (Ilex decidua), and hawthornes (Crataegus spp.), form the understory of this community type. Woody species that typically represent the shrub stratum include American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and common elderberry (Sambucus canadensis). Among the numerous vines that occur in the lower strata of this community type are Alabama supplejack (Berchemia scandens), Carolina jessamine (Gelsemium sempervirens), greenbriars (Smilax spp.), Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), and poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Species commonly occurring in the herbaceous cover of the bottomland/riparian forest community are inland sea oats (Chasmanthium latifolia), Virginia wildrye (Elymus virginicus), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), and sedges (Carex spp.). Vegetation in aquatic habitats is typically limited to the shallow edges of the water. Plant species common to this habitat type include rushes, sedges, cattails (Typha spp.), flatsedges (Cyperus spp.), spikesedges (Eleocharis spp.), and common buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis). Additional species covering portions of the water's surface include yellow nelumbo (Nelumbo lutea), American waterlily (Nymphaea odorata), pondweed (Potamogeton spp.), and duckweed (Lemna spp.). The hydric habitats in this region are generally associated with streams, creeks, impoundments, and low topographic areas. Associated with the streams and creeks are primarily bottomland/riparian forests and marshes. Impoundments generally result in either permanent or ephemeral freshwater flat wetlands, marshes, or fringe marshes. Low topographic areas generally result in those hydric habitats associated with impoundment, though most often on a smaller scale. The majority of the hydric areas in this region are primarily located within the floodplains of creeks. The wetter portions of bottomland forests that could be classified as hydric habitat undergo seasonal inundation and/or maintain saturated soils. Typical plant species in these bottomlands include water oak, willow oak (Q. phellos), water hickory (C. aquatica), pecan, and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica). Marshes are typically found as narrow bands along the edges of ponds and streams and support such species as cattails, rushes, sedges, flatsedges, smartweeds (Polygonum spp.), yellow-eyed grasses (Xyris spp.) and, occasionally, woody species such as common buttonbush and black willow (Salix nigra). 052054302/080074 6

II. Environmental Setting Figure 2. General view of floodplain south of Waxahachie Creek and west of the existing viaduct, including area of proposed bridge, facing northeast. FAUNA The APE lies within the Texan biotic province, as described by Blair (1950). This province represents a transitional area between the forested Austroriparian biotic province to the east and the grassland provinces to the west. Such integration of forests and grasslands results in a mixture of vertebrate species typical of the two general habitats. At least 49 species of mammals are known to have occurred in the Texan province in recent times, in addition to 39 species of snake, 16 species of lizard, 2 species of land turtle, 18 species of frog and toad, and 5 species of salamander and newt (Blair 1950). No endemic vertebrate species have been identified in this region. According to Blair (1950), only five species of salamander and newt occur in the Texan biotic province, which is a barrier to the distribution of the endemic fauna that occurs in the Balconian biotic province to the west and the fauna of the Austroriparian province to the east. These five species also occur in the Austroriparian biotic province. Salamanders and newts that could occur in the project area include the smallmouth salamander (Ambystoma texanum), eastern tiger salamander (A. tigrinum tigrinum), central newt (Notophthalmus viridescens louisianensis), and western lesser siren (Siren intermedia nettingi), all of which are restricted to moist bottomland or hydric habitats (Dixon 1987; Garrett and Barker 1987). Frogs and toads expected to occur in the APE include Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans blanchardi), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii woodhousii), eastern narrow-mouthed toad (Gastrophryne carolinensis), Great Plains narrow-mouthed toad (G. olivacea), Strecker's chorus frog 052054302/080074 7

II. Environmental Setting (Pseudacris streckeri), upland chorus frog (P. triseriata feriarum), bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), southern leopard frog (R. utricularia), and Hurter’s spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii hurterii). Several treefrogs, including the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea), Cope’s gray treefrog (H. chrysoscelis), and gray treefrog (H. versicolor) also can occur in the project area (Dixon 1987; Garrett and Barker 1987). Common reptiles expected to occur within the APE area include turtles, such as the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina serpentina), western chicken turtle (Deirochelys reticularia miairia), red- eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans), and three-toed box turtle (Terrapene carolina triunguis). Lizards that can occur in the APE are the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), six-lined racerunner (Cnemidophorus sexlineatus sexlineatus), five-lined skink (Eumeces fasciatus), broadhead skink (E. laticeps), southern prairie skink (E. septentrionalis obtusirostris), ground skink (Scincella lateralis), southern prairie lizard (Sceloporus undulatus consobrinus), and western slender glass lizard (Ophisaurus attenuatus) (Dixon 1987; Garrett and Barker 1987). Snakes in this area include the eastern yellowbelly racer (Coluber constrictor flaviventris), Texas rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta lindheimeri), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), prairie kingsnake (Lampropeltis calligaster calligaster), western coachwhip (Masticophis flagellum testaceus) diamondback water snake (Nerodia rhombifer), and rough green snake (Opheodrys aestivus). Several venomous species, such as the southern copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix), western cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma), Texas coral snake (Micrurus fulvius tener), and timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus), also can be found in the APE (Dixon 1987; Tennant 1998). Numerous avian species are also found within the APE. Common bird species in this area include year- round residents, such as the great blue heron (Ardea herodias), turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), belted kingfisher (Ceryle alcyon), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus), red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), great-tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus), brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), and house sparrow (Passer domesticus). Mammals that occur along the APE include the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), least shrew (Cryptotis parva), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), evening bat (Nycticeius humeralis), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), eastern fox squirrel (S. niger), southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans), Baird’s pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), hispid pocket mouse (Chaetodipus hispidus), American beaver (Castor canadensis), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern woodrat (Neotoma floridana), common muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), nutria (Myocastor coypus), coyote (Canis latrans), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), common gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), ringtail 052054302/080074 8

II. Environmental Setting (Bassariscus astutus), common raccoon (Procyon lotor), mink (Mustela vison), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (Davis and Schmidly 1994). According to Lee et al. (1980) and Hubbs et al. (1991), up to 100 species of freshwater fish are known to occur in this region of Texas. Based on the size and characteristics of the various water bodies, not all of these species would occur in the particular habitats available in the project area. Most of the creek segments in the area are too small or ephemeral to offer habitat to larger species, especially gamefish. The headwater segments of the feeder tributaries probably host minnows (Notropis spp.), mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), topminnows (Fundulus spp.), and darters (Etheostoma spp.), with some younger members of larger species. Along the larger drainages, especially in pooled areas, the fish community tends to be heavily dominated by sunfish (Lepomis spp.) that are probably widely distributed in area streams when sufficient water is present. Impoundments in the project area also support various gamefish, such as the largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), white bass (Morone chrysops), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), white crappie (Pomoxis annularis), and various species of sunfish. 052054302/080074 9

III. ARCHEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND CULTURAL HISTORY The APE lies within the Prairie-Savanna Archeological Region (P-SAR), as defined by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). The general cultural history of this area, based on previous research, can be divided into four primary chronological and developmental periods — Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic (Table 1). These divisions are believed to reflect changes in subsistence and cultural development as reflected by material remains and settlement patterns. The following discussion of these periods draws on previous summaries by Peter and McGregor (1988) and Prikryl (1990). Table 1: Cultural Sequence for the Prairie Savanna Archeological Region (after Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990) Period Approximate Dates Paleoindian 10,000–6500 B.C. Archaic 6500 B.C.– A.D. 700 Late Prehistoric A.D. 700–1700 Historic post–A.D. 1700 Paleoindian Period (ca. 10,000−6500 ) B.C. The Paleoindian period is the earliest defined cultural period in North America. Chronologically, it extends from the terminal Pleistocene into the early Holocene. Subsistence may have been based, in part, upon hunting the now-extinct megafauna of the late Pleistocene, including mammoths and extinct species of bison (Bison antiquus), as well as on the collecting of plants and small animals. Social organization probably consisted of loosely structured, highly mobile social groups composed of several nuclear families. Such groups are generally referred to as “bands.” Archeological sites of this period often seem to be representative of transient camps along small streams occupied by band-sized or smaller groups. Larger occupation sites, often referred to as “base camps,” are relatively rare. Overall population density is thought to have been rather low during this period. Diagnostic artifacts of this period include a variety of finely chipped, sometimes fluted, lanceolate projectile points, such as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Scottsbluff, and Angostura. The latter is a transi- tional point type, which has also been found in Early Archaic sites in this region (Prikryl 1990:Figure 24). Archaic Period (ca. 6500 B.C. to A.D. 700) The Archaic period, beginning about 6500 B.C., is characterized by a diversification in subsistence patterns with an increased reliance upon the hunting of modern species of game, including deer and rabbit, as well as the collecting of edible plants. Changes in material culture during the Archaic period are 052054302/080074 10

III. Archeological and Historical Background believed to reflect somewhat larger and more-localized populations, as well as changes in the methods of food procurement and food processing. Although Early Archaic populations made their living in much the same way as their Paleoindian ancestors, the Archaic period as a whole can be characterized as having more-specialized resource-procurement activities as well as more-specialized technology to accomplish these activities. Scatters of lithic debris (the residue of stone tool manufacture) are one of the most common archeological site types of the Archaic period in this region. Early Archaic sites (ca. 6500–4000 B.C.) are generally characterized by surface scatters consisting of burned rocks, hammerstones, heavy utilitarian bifaces (i.e., choppers), gouges, and occasional dart points. Gouges, especially prevalent during the Early Archaic, declined in occurrence during the Middle (ca. 4000–1500 B.C.) and Late Archaic (ca. 1500 B.C.–A.D. 700) periods. By the Late Archaic, artifact assemblages were characterized by corner-notched dart points, ovate knives, thick end scrapers, and ground stone artifacts. Characteristic diagnostic artifacts of the Early Archaic include what are called Early Split Stemmed points; characteristic artifacts of the Middle Archaic include Basal Notched, Carrollton, and Wells points; and characteristic projectile points of the Late Archaic include Yarbrough, Trinity, Ellis, Edgewood, Elam, Godley, Dallas, and Gary types (Prikryl 1990:Figure 24). Late Prehistoric Period (ca. A.D. 700 to 1700) The Late Prehistoric period represents a significant change from earlier patterns in the region. It is marked first by the appearance of arrow points and subsequently by the introduction of ceramics. Several researchers (Ferring and Yates 1997; Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990) have distinguished an early and a late phase for this period. The early phase (ca. A.D. 700–1200) is generally characterized by sand-and-grog- tempered ceramics, Scallorn and Alba arrow points, and a continuation of the foraging subsistence pattern of the Late Archaic, although horticulture is present at some sites in the upper Trinity River drainage (Peter and McGregor 1988). The late phase (ca. A.D. 1200–1700) reflects a Southern Plains influence with the appearance of shell-tempered Nocona Plain ceramics, various unstemmed triangular arrow points (e.g., Fresno, Harrell, and Washita), and Perdiz points. Evidence for horticulture and bison hunting also appears in sites of this late phase. Contact began with the arrival of European and later American immigrants in this region. That was the time of the early Spanish missions and French explorations. Native American groups either remaining or moving into this area during this time include the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai (Kichai), Yojuane, Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo (Prikryl 1993). Trade items from this era include glass beads, European-made ceramics, gun parts, and metal arrow points. Sites dating to this time in this region include the Stansbury site (41HI9; Gregory 1973; Jelks 1970), the Gas Plant site (41ML28; Jensen 1967), the Walton site (41ML65; Story 1985), and the Vinson site (41LT1; Smith 1993). 052054302/080074 11

III. Archeological and Historical Background Historic Period (post-1700) The Historic period of the greater Texas area effectively began with the explorations of the Spanish conquistadors, such as Hernando de Soto, Coronado, and Cabeza de Vaca, who first explored the region beginning in about 1528 (Arbingast et al. 1976). The proposed ROW is north and west of a series of Spanish missions developed in east and central Texas throughout the eighteenth century. Following the founding of the French colony of Louisiana in the early 1700s, French explorers and traders were an important presence in this area of Texas. Following Mexico’s independence from Spain in 1821, the early period of Anglo-American immigration and settlement began. For the duration of Mexico’s control over Texas, there was very little Anglo- American or other immigrant European settlement in the north Texas area. The few settlers that did arrive were usually small farmers or traders. During the Republican period, before Texas was annexed as a state by the United States in 1845, settlement spread primarily along major waterways, such as the Trinity River, and trading paths that ran overland. Since the proposed ROW is in an area that was some distance from the major cotton-producing areas along the Red, Brazos, and lower Trinity rivers, the regional population at this time was largely white, with only a few African Americans. Nevertheless, the region’s population as a whole generally supported the South’s secession immediately prior to the Civil War. As a result of the Civil War, the arrival of rail transportation into the area was delayed until well into the postwar Reconstruction period. Ellis County was established on December 20, 1849, with Waxahachie as the county seat, as a result of a bill sponsored by General Edward H. Tarrant. The county was drawn from Navarro County and probably named for Richard Ellis, president of the Convention of 1836 (Handbook of Texas Online 2008). Many of the early settlers in Ellis County were from the southern United States, and they brought with them their farming methods and their slaves. During the 1850s, the slave population of the county increased to 1,104. Other ethnic groups that settled in Ellis County included Czech, Hungarian, and German immigrants. Cattle ranching was one of the first major businesses in the county. By the 1870s, however, the area began changing from cattle range to agriculture. This was a result of the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad that made markets more accessible. Eventually cotton became the leading money crop, and Ellis County was recognized as one of the leading cotton-growing areas in the United States (Handbook of Texas Online 2008). A decline in population, and in the number of farms, began during the 1930s as a result of the Great Depression, and this trend continued into the 1980s. By 1990, the economy of Ellis County had become more balanced, with manufacturing, agribusiness, and commerce about equally represented. 052054302/080074 12

III. Archeological and Historical Background PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS J.E. Pearce of the University of Texas conducted the earliest professional work in the P-SAR. This research was conducted using funding from the Bureau of American Ethnology. During the 1920s and 1930s, A.T. Jackson conducted archeological reconnaissance in several P-SAR counties (Jackson 1938). The Work Progress Administration conducted survey work in Freestone County during the 1930s. Avocational archeologists have also made many contributions to the knowledge of aboriginal peoples in the P-SAR (Prikryl 1993). Some of the earliest work in the region was conducted in the 1930s and 1940s by members of the Dallas Archaeological Society (DAS). The work of the DAS founders, R.K. Harris and Forrest Kirkland, focused largely on the location and investigation of sites in the upper Trinity River basin. The efforts of the DAS in Dallas, Denton, and other nearby counties greatly expanded the database of sites that were known at the time. However, it was not until 1946 that the information gathered by the DAS was incorporated into a cultural chronology by Alex Krieger (1946). Following World War II, Robert L. Stephenson of the Smithsonian Institution’s River Basin Survey program conducted several archeological surveys in connection with planned reservoir development projects in the upper Trinity River basin. While Stephenson made significant finds in Collin County, at the then-proposed Lavon Reservoir, little important archeological evidence was recovered from Grapevine Reservoir, located in Tarrant and Denton counties. Archeological data recovered from Lewisville Reservoir in Denton County and Lavon Reservoir in Collin County were integral to the development of the first major cultural chronology for the state (Suhm et al. 1954). Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks placed the area that today includes the proposed ROW in the southeastern edge of the north-central Texas culture area, and incorporated four regional cultural foci — Carrollton, Elam, Wylie, and Henrietta. During the 1950s and 1960s, additional archeological research was conducted by a variety of institutions and individuals, primarily along the Elm Fork and the East Fork tributaries of the Trinity River. Most of that work was directed toward validating and refining the cultural chronological concepts and patterns published in Suhm et al. (1954). With the passage of state and federal laws to protect cultural resources from the potential adverse effects of construction projects, the number of archeological investigations began to increase. The principal goal of such investigations was to identify archeological sites that might be impacted and to mitigate the adverse effects through avoidance or data recovery. The Richland Creek Archaeological Project made significant contributions to the archeological record of the P-SAR during the 1980s (Bruseth and Moir 1987). The fieldwork connected with the project recovered data relevant to prehistoric subsistence strategies and local and regional human adaptive patterns from the Middle Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods. In addition, investigation of historic archeological sites (ca. 1850–1940) contributed to the archeological, architectural, documentary, and ethnographic studies of rural lifeways in the area, including regional trends in material culture, architecture, and cultural geography. 052054302/080074 13

III. Archeological and Historical Background Between 1989 and 1993, extensive archeological surveys were conducted for the proposed Superconducting Super Collider near Waxahachie (Adovasio et al. 1998; Southern Methodist University 1990, 1991, 1992). These investigations resulted in the recording of numerous sites in Ellis County. In all, 154 sites were recorded, of which 112 were historic, 19 contained prehistoric and historic components, and only 23 were purely prehistoric. These studies contributed to enlarging the database of cultural resource sites within Ellis County, and the investigation of a small number of these sites with deep shovel tests and probes further contributed to the growing knowledge of prehistoric and historic settlement in the area. An archeological survey conducted for Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in 1998 within the floodplain of Waxahachie Creek crossed the present project area (Kent et al. 1998). The survey was conducted to clear construction of a park trail running parallel to the north bank of Waxahachie Creek, and included limited subsurface testing but apparently no backhoe work. No archeological sites were recorded within the floodplain of Waxahachie Creek. SWCA conducted an archeological impact evaluation for the reconstruction of the existing US 77 bridge over Waxahachie Creek in 2002 but recorded no archeological sites and recommended no further investigations (Houk and Skoglund 2002). 052054302/080074 14

IV. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY BACKGROUND RESEARCH AND RECORDS CHECK A reconnaissance survey of the project APE was conducted in 2007 to determine whether or not further archeological investigations were warranted (Pemberton and Cliff 2007). A records search to locate known archeological sites within or close to the proposed APE was also conducted as part of this work. The files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) were examined for previously recorded archeological sites, as well as the files and maps at the THC. The list of Official Texas Historical Markers was also consulted. An examination of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas revealed one previously recorded archeological site located within a mile (1,609 m) of the project area. This was 41EL31, an historic trash scatter on the east side of Waxahachie Creek, about 0.7 mile (1.1 km) southeast of the proposed new US 77 bridge. This site was found as a result of a survey for a Texas Power & Light transmission line. The trash deposit yielded bottle glass, window glass, purple glass, brown glass, white porcelain glazed ceramics, and galvanized tin, and the site was recommended to have no research potential (Broussard 1985). The next nearest recorded archeological site is the County Farm site (41EL58), a late-nineteenth-twentieth-century prison farm with preserved architecture located approxi- mately 3.6 miles (5.8 km) east of the project area (Smolik 1989). The nearest prehistoric sites appear to be 41EL86, an isolated find located approximately 6 miles (9.8 km) southwest of the project area (Chada and Weston 1990), and 41EL151, a possible bison kill site located approximately 8 miles (12.9 km) north of the project area (Jurney et al. 1992). Numerous historic markers and properties are within a mile of the project area, specifically in the downtown area of Waxahachie. Among others, these historic markers and properties include the Rosemont House (1894), the Ellis County Courthouse (1895–1897), and the Rogers Street Bridge (1889). As noted above, the reconnaissance survey of the project APE conducted in 2007 concluded that the proposed TxDOT US 77 bridge construction has the potential to impact previously unrecorded Historic Properties (36 CFR 800.16.[1]), or SALs, (13 TAC 26.12) buried within the floodplain APE of Waxahachie Creek (Pemberton and Cliff 2007). Prior to the initiation of fieldwork, PBS&J conducted an additional records search with TARL and the THC in order to identify any recent archeological investigations that may be of relevance to the project area. The land on which the APE is located is privately owned, and permission was obtained from the current owners prior to initiating fieldwork. GEOARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS The geoarcheological fieldwork for this project was conducted between January 28 and January 31, 2008, by Dr. Maynard Cliff, with the help of Mr. Joshua Perry. In accordance with the Research Design submitted to the THC with the Antiquities Permit application, a program of backhoe trenching was undertaken along the proposed project APE within the floodplain of Waxahachie Creek, in the central 052054302/080074 15

IV. Research Design and Methodology portion of the proposed project area (Figure 3). The backhoe trenching was conducted to (1) evaluate the floodplain deposits in regard to their likelihood of containing buried archeological properties, (2) locate such properties, if possible, and (3) evaluate the floodplain deposits in regard to the utility of hand-dug shovel tests. Elsewhere in north Texas, up to a meter or more of historic sediment has been deposited by alluvial processes in the floodplains of the Trinity River and its larger tributaries, and it was thought possible that the same held true for the proposed project area. For example, buried floodplain sites have been encountered at depths of 2 to 5 m below surface (6.5–16.4 ft) at Richland/Chambers Reservoir, in Freestone and Navarro counties to the southeast of the proposed project area (McGregor and Bruseth 1987:29–52, 79–85), at depths of 2.5 to 3.5 m below surface (8.2–11.5 ft) at Joe Pool Lake in southwest Dallas County to the northwest of the proposed project area (Peter and McGregor 1988:43–58), and at depths of 1 to 3 m below surface (3.3–9.8 ft) along the main branch of the Trinity River in Dallas, north of the proposed project area (Buysse 2000). Excavation was conducted within the current proposed APE using a backhoe with an arm reach of approximately 3.8 m (12.5 ft) and a 60-centimeter (cm) wide (2-ft) toothed bucket. Four backhoe trenches were excavated south of Waxahachie Creek, and one more was excavated north of the creek (see Figure 3). Trenches 1, 2, and 3 were placed south of Waxahachie Creek, immediately east and south of a shallow drainage channel that was originally thought to represent an older creek channel, but which may actually be an artificial channel of more-recent origin (Figures 4, 5, and 6). Trench 4 was also placed south of Waxahachie Creek, west of the shallow channel, on the lower slope of what appeared to be a large disturbed berm (Figure 7). No trenches were placed south of Trench 2 because that area was believed to be disturbed. Trench 5 was placed north of Waxahachie Creek, between a paved jogging trail and the creek channel, in the approximate center of the proposed ROW (Figure 8). No other trenches were placed north of Waxahachie Creek due to the presence of, from south to north, (1) the jogging trail, (2) a large slough, and (3) disturbance along the edge of the railroad ROW (Figure 9). Dimensions and depths for all of the backhoe trenches are presented in Table 2, while locational data are presented in Table 3. The pedology and stratigraphy of each backhoe trench were recorded and profiled in detail in order to identify high probability strata for containing archeological remains. All trenches were initially excavated to about 150 centimeters below the surface (cmbs) (4.9 ft), at which point the trench was widened and the profile was cleaned and examined in detail from within the trench. For safety reasons, strata deeper than this were recorded from the surface, examining sediments as they were excavated by the backhoe. Consequently, descriptions of these deeper strata are not as detailed as the descriptions of the shallower deposits. Samples of approximately 25–50 liters (i.e., 5 to 10 shovel loads) of fill were taken from each trench at depth increments of 50 cm and were hand screened through 64-millimeter (mm) (¼-inch) mesh. Apparent cultural remains were identified in Trenches 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since most of these remains were identified in the respective trench profiles, no 50-x-50-cm test columns were hand excavated. 052054302/080074 16

Each trench was also examined for the presence of prehistoric cultural remains or other associated materials. Sediments and soils were described following the guidelines and terminology established by the National Soil Survey Center (Schoeneberger et al. 2002). Soil colors were recorded using a Munsell Soil Color Chart while samples were moist. Profiles were initially described in “zones” without differentiating between lithologic or pedologic features and were later given soil horizon designations. All depths were measured from the ground surface. The location of each trench was recorded using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates obtained from a hand- held geographic positioning system (GPS) unit. 052054302/080074 21

V. RESULTS The additional records search conducted prior to the fieldwork for this project revealed that there were no previously recorded archeological sites within the APE. GEOARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS Following the approved research design, backhoe trenching was conducted within the floodplain of Waxahachie Creek in search of buried archeological remains. Four backhoe trenches were excavated south of Waxahachie Creek and one north of the creek, to an average depth of 2.65 m (8.7 ft) below surface (see Figure 3). Prehistoric remains were identified in all four of the trenches south of the creek (Trenches 1, 2, 3, and 4), and the cultural remains were recorded as the Waxahachie Creek-1 site (41EL246). The floodplain soils along this portion of Waxahachie Creek are mapped as Frio silty clay, frequently flooded. The Frio series consists of deep, well-drained, silty clay and loamy soils on floodplains. They are granular with a porous subsoil and formed in strongly calcareous, alluvial sediments. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent, and the soils are strongly calcareous, silty clay, thermic Cumulic Haplustolls (USDA, SCS 1964:15–16, 62–63). A typical pedon of Frio silty clay consists of: A1p 0 to 20 cm (0–8 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) when moist; strong, medium, granular and fine, subangular blocky structure; hard when dry, firm but crumbly when moist; strongly calcareous; gradual smooth boundary. A12 20 to 30 cm (8–12 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) when moist; moderate medium platy structure; compacted; very hard when dry, firm when moist; few very fine concretions of calcium carbonate; strongly calcareous; gradual smooth boundary. A13 30 to 102 cm (12–40 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) when moist; moderate to strong medium to granular and fine subangular blocky structure; hard when dry, firm but crumbly when moist; few small concretions of calcium carbonate less than 3 mm in diameter; strongly calcareous; gradual smooth boundary. AC 102 to 122 cm (40–48 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) when moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard when dry, firm but crumbly when moist; many small concretions of calcium carbonate less than 3 mm in diameter; strongly calcareous; gradual smooth boundary. C 122 to 152 cm (48–60 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) when moist; weak subangular blocky structure; soft when dry, very friable when moist; many small concretions of calcium carbonate less than 3 mm in diameter; strongly calcareous. 052054302/080074 22

V. Results As previously noted, Trenches 1, 2, 3, and 4 were excavated south of Waxahachie Creek (see Figure 3). Descriptions of the soil zones identified in each trench are included in Appendix B, while the profile drawings of all four trenches are presented on Figure 10. Trench 1 was excavated immediately south of the present channel of Waxahachie Creek, east of a shallow drainage channel that was originally presumed to be an old channel of the creek. This apparently placed the trench just outside the proposed new ROW of US 77. It was characterized by recent alluvial material overlying older intact alluvial sediments (see Figure 10 and Appendix B). The older alluvial deposits, capped by a buried soil, were encountered at about 80 cmbs (Figure 11). The buried soil was about 160 cm thick. The recent deposits yielded a white glazed historic tile from the upper 50 cmbs; a small bone fragment and a small stone chip, possibly natural, from 50 to 100 cmbs; and a small chip or flake of what appeared to be silicified shell, also possibly natural, from 70 cmbs. The older alluvial deposits yielded a possible deer tibia and bone fragments from a possible medium-sized mammal at 130 cmbs, 50 cm below the top of the buried soil. Additional animal bone fragments and a few fine charcoal fragments were noted from 100 to 150 cmbs, and a few coarse charcoal fragments were identified from 150 to 200 cmbs. Finally, a few possible animal bone fragments noted at about 250 cmbs, but these may have come off the side walls of the trench. These remains were given a temporary field number and recorded as site 41EL246. Trench 2 was excavated about 30 m southwest of Trench 1, south of the shallow drainage channel and in the approximate center of the proposed new ROW of US 77 (see Figure 3). As was the case with Trench 1, Trench 2 revealed what appeared to be older alluvial sediments, overlain by a thick deposit of what appeared to be recent disturbed deposits and a modern soil (Figure 10 and Appendix B). The buried soil was encountered at about 120 cmbs and was about 160 cm thick (see Figure 12). Recent and historic remains were encountered above the buried soil, and included a disturbed layer of gravel with glass, metal, and brick at 10–18 cmbs, an old brick recovered from the screen at 50–100 cmbs, and a piece of cellophane noted in the trench wall at 100 cmbs. No cultural remains were observed in the upper portion of the buried soils, but fragments of animal bone were recovered from about 270 cmbs, indicating that site 41EL246 extended this far south of the creek. Trench 3 was placed between Trenches 1 and 2, east of the shallow drainage channel, to collect additional data on site 41EL246. It was excavated approximately 20 m southwest of Trench 1 and about 10 m northeast of Trench 2, on the eastern edge of the proposed new ROW of US 77 (see Figure 3). Trench 3 revealed a profile similar to those of Trenches 1 and 2, with a thick deposit of recent disturbed sediment overlying an older buried soil (see Figure 10 and Appendix B). The upper 70 cm or so of the trench contained a large amount of historic trash, including fragments of concrete blocks, pieces of brick, and even a potato chip bag. A sloping layer of black clay with charcoal and yellowish red mottles was present between 35–55 cmbs and 65 cmbs, and is believed to represent the residue of historic trash burning (Figure 13). Additional evidence of burning seemed to be present between 65 cmbs and the top of the buried soil, including fragments of what appeared to be reddish burned clay from 80 to 100 cmbs. A piece of burned bone and a historic sherd were also recovered from about 100 to 150 cmbs. The top of the buried soil appeared to be uneven and sloped from about 125 cmbs on the southwest side of the trench to about 135 cmbs on the northwest side. Otherwise, it was similar in appearance to the soil in the previous 052054302/080074 23

V. Results two trenches. No cultural remains were identified in the upper portion of the soil, but at a depth of 190– 195 cmbs, approximately 55–65 cm below the top of the soil, what appeared to be poorly preserved long bone fragments were noted in the screened sediment, and in the side wall and floor of the trench, which was terminated rather than destroy more cultural remains. Trench 4 was placed along the western edge of the proposed new US 77 ROW, west of the shallow drainage channel and at the foot of what appeared to be a large disturbed berm. Trench 4 was located about 20 m west of Trench 1, about 20 m north of Trench 2, and about 15 m northwest of Trench 3 (see Figure 3). As expected, Trench 4 revealed a zone of disturbance overlying a zone of historic alluvial sediments, which in turn overlay an older buried soil (see Figure 10 and Appendix B). The upper 35 cm of Trench 4 contained recent historic remains, including brick fragments and an iron rail spike. The older buried soil was identified between about 90 and 180 cmbs and was similar in appearance to the soil in the previous three trenches (Figure 14). Prehistoric cultural remains were recovered from Trench 4 as well, suggesting that the shallow drainage channel running through most of the new ROW in this area is not an old creek channel, but a more modern drainage feature, probably artificial. The prehistoric remains from Trench 4 included a fragment of fire-cracked rock recovered from the screen at between 50 and 100 cmbs, a flake found in the screen at 100 cmbs, and another piece of fire-cracked rock and a small splinter of bone from the trench wall at about 140 cmbs. Due to a high level of disturbance, Trench 5 was the only trench placed north of Waxahachie Creek. A description of the soil zones identified in Trench 5 is also included in Appendix B, while the profile drawing is presented on Figure 15. It was located about 5 m north of the creek, and in the approximate center of the proposed new US 77 ROW (see Figure 3). Trench 4 revealed a 40-cm-thick deposit of brown clay, probably of recent origin, overlying an older fining-upward sequence of sandy clay loam- sandy loam-clay loam-clay, believed to be indicative of point bar deposits (see Figure 15 and Appendix B). This older sequence of deposits was capped by a relatively thin, 25-cm-thick soil of similar appearance to the buried soil revealed in the trenches south of the creek. No cultural remains were found in Trench 5 (Figure 16). The alluvial stratigraphy, soils stratigraphy, and geomorphology of the upper Trinity River valley have been investigated by a wide variety of studies over the last several decades, and the interested reader is urged to consult these references (Cliff et al. 1998, 1999; Ferring 1986, 1990a, 1990b, 1995; Ferring and Yates 1997). Ferring (1990b) recognized five floodplain stratigraphic units of Late Pleistocene to modern age in the upper Trinity River valley. In order of decreasing age, these are the Carrollton alluvium, the Aubrey alluvium, the Sanger alluvium, the Pilot Point alluvium, and Recent alluvium (Table 4). Ferring (1990b) also describes the Arlington paleosol capping the Sanger alluvium, and the West Fork soil capping the Pilot Point alluvium. 052054302/080074 28

All of the sediments penetrated by the current trenches along Waxahachie Creek are believed to be late Holocene to modern in age. A great deal of geoarcheological research at a number of locations throughout the upper Trinity River basin has shown that the most widespread alluvial unit throughout the floodplain is the Pilot Point alluvium, capped by the distinctive West Fork soil. Recent alluvium may locally cover this unit near the present Trinity River channel. Recent overbank deposits may cover it in selected locations farther removed from the present channel, or it may occur on the surface. The West Fork soil, which caps the Pilot Point alluvium, is a thick, cumulic soil that is extremely dark and very distinctive. The West Fork soil is easily recognizable throughout the upper Trinity River basin. It has been identified on the main branch of the Trinity River at Dallas (Buysse 2000; Cliff et al. 1998, 1999; Shanabrook et al. 2002), on the West Fork of the Trinity in Arlington (Ferring 1986, 1990b), on the Elm Fork in western Dallas County (Peter et al. 2002), along Rowlett Creek in north Garland (Sills and Cliff 2003), and at Lake Lewisville and Lake Ray Roberts to the north of Dallas (Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring and Yates 1997, 1998; Lebo and Brown 1990). On the main branch of the Trinity River in Dallas, the West Fork soil has been identified anywhere from the surface to 2.8 m (9.2 ft) down, and it may range between 0.45 and 2.3 m (1.5–7.5 ft) thick (Buysse 2000; Cliff et al. 1999; Shanabrook et al. 2002). Although the West Fork soil is generally considered to have formed between about 4,500 years before present (B.P.) and the present (Ferring 1990b:48), dates on charcoal from archeological contexts within it range from 2,140 years B.P. from near the base of the West Fork, to 480 years B.P. near the top (Buysse 2000:169, Table 54). 052054302/080074 32

V. Results THE WAXAHACHIE CREEK-1 SITE (41EL246) The Waxahachie Creek-1 site (41EL246) is a newly recorded prehistoric site identified in all four of the trenches south of Waxahachie Creek, at the proposed crossing of the new southbound bridge for US 77 (see Appendix A). The site is buried within the floodplain of Waxahachie Creek, which is also the closest natural water source. The ground surface in this area varies in elevation from about 159.9 to 160.5 m (523.3 to 526.7 ft) above mean sea level (amsl). The site area is mapped as Frio clay, frequently flooded. The Frio series consists of Mollisols, deep silty clayey and loamy soils formed in recent alluvium on floodplains (USDA, SCS 1964:15–16). The current vegetation at the site generally consists of short grasses, with scattered trees and forbs, and riparian woodland along the creek (see Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7). Due to the scope of the project, no final determination could be made for site size, but it is estimated to measure at least 45 m north-south by 30 m east-west, given the distances between the four trenches (Figure 17). As noted above, site 41EL246 was originally identified in Backhoe Trenches 1, 2, 3, and 4, at varying depths below present ground surface (see Figure 10). Trench 1 yielded a possible deer tibia and bone fragments from a possible medium-sized mammal at 130 cmbs (Figures 18 and 19). Additional animal bone fragments and a few fine charcoal fragments were noted at 100–150 cmbs, a few coarse charcoal fragments at 150–200 cmbs, and a few possible animal bone fragments at about 250 cmbs, but these latter may have dislodged from the walls of the trench. Trench 2 yielded fragments of animal bone at about 270 cmbs, but these may also have been dislodged from the walls of the trench. Trench 3 contained what appeared to be poorly preserved long bone fragments in the side wall and floor of the trench at 190– 195 cmbs (Figures 20 and 21). Finally, Trench 4 yielded a fragment of fire-cracked rock at 50–100 cmbs, a flake at 100 cmbs, and another piece of fire-cracked rock and a small splinter of bone at 140 cmbs (Figures 22 and 23). All of these remains were noted between 50 and 150 cm below the top of a very dark gray clay soil, believed to be equivalent to the West Fork soil, which formed subsequent to about 4500 B.P. in the upper Trinity River basin. The buried soil was about 160 cm thick in Trenches 1 and 2, at least 70 cm thick in Trench 3, and about 90 cm thick in Trench 4 (see Figure 10). By analogy with other prehistoric sites identified near the top of the West Fork soil in the upper Trinity River Basin, site 41EL246 may date to the early part of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 700–1700). In summary, site 41EL246 is a buried prehistoric site, probably of Late Prehistoric age, located within the floodplain of Waxahachie Creek. The site appears to have good preservation of faunal remains and possibly good macrobotanical preservation. For this reason, the site is believed to have a high research potential and may be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. It is recommended that the site be tested to determine its final NRHP status and to allow the development of a data recovery plan if it cannot be avoided by the proposed realignment. 052054302/080074 33

VI. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS PBS&J conducted geoarcheological investigations at the request of TxDOT for the proposed bridge reconstruction of US 77 over Waxahachie Creek, in the City of Waxahachie, Ellis County, Texas. The proposed project will add a new southbound bridge west of the existing bridge, which will become a northbound bridge only. The new southbound bridge will be 38 ft 11 inches (11.9 m) wide overall, 1,190 ft (362.71 m) long, and will also consist of two travel lanes. The bridge will be a two-lane, multiple-span structure supported by piers. The APE is approximately 39 ft (12 m) deep, while the proposed ROW for the new bridge will be 50 ft (15.2 m) wide. Landowner access was granted for all of the proposed APE. Backhoe trenching was recommended in the undisturbed floodplain areas north and south of the creek, totaling approximately 450 ft (137 m) between Sta. 23+50 and Sta. 28+00, prior to construction of the new bridge. In total, five trenches were excavated within the proposed APE in an effort to locate archeological sites. As a result of the backhoe trenching of the Waxahachie Creek floodplain, one previously unrecorded archeological site was identified that will be affected by the proposed project. Site 41EL246 is a buried prehistoric site located south of Waxahachie Creek and is believed to have a high research potential. As a result, it is recommended that additional archeological testing be conducted at the site to determine its final NRHP status and to allow the development of a data recovery plan if it cannot be avoided by the proposed realignment. The potential importance of site 41EL246 hinges, in part, on the presence of faunal remains that can provide data on prehistoric subsistence practices in the upper Trinity River basin, the presence of artifactual remains in sufficient numbers to allow interpretation of site age and function, and the presence of discrete features that could provide data on spatial organization. It is recommended that additional archeological testing of 41EL246 be conducted when the proposed ROW of the new bridge is staked and cleared and include the following: 1. Instrument mapping of the site within the proposed ROW. 2. Mechanical excavation of a minimum of five trenches, including reopening Trenches 1, 2, 3, and 4, and excavating one new trench south of Trench 2, in the center of the proposed ROW. Trenches should be excavated to at least the base of the West Fork soil, and the fill examined for cultural remains. 3. Manual excavation of ten 1-x-1-m units for a total of 10 m3 of manual excavations. These units should be placed according to the field director’s judgment, based on the results of trenching and excavation, to optimize recovery of artifacts, faunal and macrobotanical remains, and features. In all units, the upper alluvial fill (overlying the West Fork soil) should be mechanically removed, and the sediment of the West Fork soil itself should be manually excavated. 052054302/080074 38

VI. Summary and Recommendations 4. Collection of soil samples for flotation from any intact cultural deposits or features located by excavation. In the event that evidence of additional archeological deposits are encountered during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity of the discovery and TxDOT archeological staff should be contacted to initiate accidental discovery and emergency procedures under the provisions of the First Amended Programmatic Agreement among TxDOT, the THC, the Federal Highway Administration, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, as well as under the Memorandum of Understanding between TxDOT and the THC. 052054302/080074 39
