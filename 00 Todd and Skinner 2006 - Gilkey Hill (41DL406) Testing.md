ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE i ABSTRACT In the winter of 2005/06 and in the following April, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted archaeological testing within a proposed sixty foot wide sewer pipeline corridor that is on the south edge of the western knoll at the Gilkey Hill site (41DL406). The major portion of the site where the late R.K. Harris of the Dallas Archeological Society found burials, hearths, and two middens is located east of the knoll along a ridge that juts into the floodplain and well outside the pipeline corridor. Eight backhoe trenches and 16 test units were utilized to explore the buried deposit in the pipeline corridor. The artifacts, primarily lithic debris and fire-cracked rock, were found scattered in the plow zone and generally not deeper than 50 cm above the uneven sterile subsoil that ranges from 32 to 105 cm below the surface. No burials or human bone, no distinguishable midden deposit, and no cultural features were encountered in the test units or trenches. Likewise, no features or midden were apparent in looter holes that are concentrated the crest of the knoll north of the corridor. One decorated rim sherd, an arrow point base, and four dart points were recovered. The artifacts indicate Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupation. A radiocarbon date (Beta-216538) of 290±40 BP (AD 1490-1660) was obtained on a sample collected at 40 cm below the surface. The date’s situation indicates that most artifacts in the pipeline corridor are in derived contexts and that very little in situ deposit is present. Based upon the absence of cultural features, middens, and burials as well as the dispersed artifacts and low tool count, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further testing is unwarranted in the pipeline study area. Installation of a pipeline in the heavily tested alignment will do no significant damage to significant resources on this edge of the site. The future upslope pipeline should be bored under the site deposit or rerouted to avoid the western knoll. Trenching in the site area should be monitored. If cultural features or artifact concentrations are discovered during installation of the proposed pipeline, work should stop immediately and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission and the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers should be consulted. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 1 INTRODUCTION The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) intends to construct the Buffalo Creek Interceptor across the floodplain of the East Fork of the Trinity River. The pipeline will be centered in a 30 feet wide corridor and is to parallel and be north of two existing pipelines. A future pipeline route situated upslope from the proposed route was studied as part of this investigation. The proposed Buffalo Creek Interceptor route will extend from the Mesquite Wastewater Treatment Plant in Dallas County to an existing lift station located in Kaufman County (Figure 1). The proposed pipeline route is to be buried from 7 to 10 feet below the ground surface and the pipe will be 18 inch in diameter. In 2001, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an archaeological survey of a proposed water pipeline route located within the present sixty foot wide study corridor. During that survey, AR Consultants, Inc. tested the southwestern edge of the previously recorded Gilkey Hill archaeological site (Harris 1942) which is situated on a finger ridge known as Tucker Ridge (Skinner 2001:36). Both proposed NTMWD pipeline routes (hereafter referred to as the pipeline corridor) will encroach on the southwestern edge of the site. The Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission determined that the pipeline corridor should be tested to determine if significant buried deposits are present within the study corridor. Both agencies determined that the rest of the Buffalo Creek Interceptor pipeline route did not warrant further cultural resource investigations due to the shallow impact of the proposed sewer pipeline route and the negative results of the previous surveys done by AR Consultants, Inc. and R.C. Goodwin and Associates, Inc. (Vandenbosch et al. 2001). In late December of 2005 and early January, 2006, and again in April, AR Consultants, Inc. tested the pipeline corridor on the southwestern edge of the Gilkey Hill site. This was done through Freese and Nichols, Inc. which is providing engineering and environmental permitting for NTMWD. The investigation was done because NTMWD is a political entity of the State of Texas as defined by the Texas Antiquities Code. In addition, permitting will be required from the Corps of Engineers because the pipeline corridor will impact waters of the US. The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission will review this report as part of the Antiquities Permit process and as the Section 106 review agency for the Corps of Engineers. This report has been written in accordance with the report guidelines prepared by the Council of Texas Archeologists (ND) and adopted by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission. The following report presents a brief description of the natural and cultural environment of the area. This is followed by the research design and methodology. The results of the investigation follow and constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations that arise from the study. A list of references cited concludes the report. Appendix 1 presents the analysis of mollusca recovered during testing and Appendix 2 contains the faunal analysis. Appendix 3 presents a radiocarbon date from the site. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 3 NATURAL ENVIRONMENT The Upper Trinity River Basin, of which the East Fork is a part, lies within North Central Texas. The basin is located within the northern portion of the Gulf Coastal Plain and in the Texan biotic province. Sandy soils support oak-hickory forests while clay soils support tall grass prairies. The site location is mapped as a Quaternary fluvatile terrace deposit and the adjacent East Fork floodplain is mapped as containing Quaternary alluvium (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988). The soil association is Trinity-Frio (Coffee, Hill and Ressel 1980:General Soils Map). The soil within the East Fork floodplain is mapped as frequently flooded Frio and the site location is mapped as Lewisville silty clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes (Coffee et al. 1980:Sheet 49). The B horizon for the Lewisville silty clay is described as being 15 inches below the ground surface (Coffee et al 1980:63). North Central Texas is divided into two biotic zones, the Blackland Prairie and the Eastern Cross Timbers. The Blackland Prairie, which surrounds the site location, got its name from the black, clay soils derived from the underlying Cretaceous limestones. The area drains quickly, due to the clay soils promoting runoff, which results in frequent flooding and deposition of sediment on the floodplain (Mahler 1972:68-69). Kuchler (1966) classified the prairie as being dominated by Andropogon-Sipa grasses. There also are some small stands of timber (elm, oak, pecan, etc.) in the prairie. However, the prairie environment is one of low biotic diversity. Forty-nine species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including deer, raccoon, rabbits and opossum. Two species of terrapene (Terrapene ornata and Terrapene carolina) occur, as do nine species of lizards. In addition, thirty-nine types of snakes can be found, along with thirteen species of anuran fauna (Blair 1950:101-102). Determining the paleoenvironment for North Central Texas is problematic. Recent work on the paleoenvironment of North Central Texas was done by Reid Ferring (1994) who examined terraces of the Upper Trinity River. Ferring believes the Early Holocene (11,000 to 7,500 years ago) was moister than today. During the Middle Holocene (7,500 to 4,500 years ago), there was a period of decreased rain, but moist conditions returned to North Central Texas during the Late Holocene (4,500 years ago to the present). Brown (1998) studied the oxygen isotopes from mussel shells at site 41DL270. His conclusions were that warmer, drier conditions existed during the Middle Holocene also, and that it was subsequently wetter. The conditions became dryer approximately 3,450 years ago and after that, the climate has been similar to that of today. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 4 CULTURAL HISTORY A definitive chronological framework for the Upper Trinity River Basin and North Central Texas has been difficult to establish for several reasons. Many sites are not vertically stratified, bioturbation has impacted stratified deposits and plowing has mixed artifacts in shallowly buried deposits. However, deep Holocene alluviation preserves buried occupation surfaces, both in the Holocene as at the Rough Green site in eastern Tarrant County and during the Pleistocene at the Aubrey site on the Elm Fork in Denton County. Without alluviation, these once surface deposits would still be on the surface and mixed with bottles, nails and other historic trash as well as with occupations between. Another problem has been plowing which usually mixes artifacts together that exist within 15 centimeters of the surface (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968:6). Prehistoric Native American settlement in North Central Texas began at least 10,000 years ago as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points at the Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957) and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001). Moreover, artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff and other Paleo-Indian points from the surface of sites in the region (Meltzer and Bever 1995). The presence of exotic, i.e., non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled a territory where higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a system of raw material trading. These early people hunted now-extinct large game, but certainly also foraged off the land. The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from as early as 7,000 or 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as A.D. 700 to 800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the counties but particularly along the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native foods. Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are common artifacts found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making and using exotic cherts for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics for chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde Gravels (Menzer and Slaughter 1971). Large Archaic sites are generally located on terraces or ridges that overlook the Elm Fork of the Trinity. Smaller lithic scatters have been recorded in upland areas throughout the counties. These sites appear to be Archaic in age, but none have been thoroughly studied (Prikryl 1990). The definition of the Late Prehistoric which ranges from approximately A.D. 700 to 1750 has been problematical. Krieger (1946:137-141) attempted a chronological framework for North Central Texas when he defined the Henrietta Focus. The type site was the Harrell Site along the Brazos River in Young County, Texas. Among the traits for the Henrietta Focus, Krieger listed small, triangular points, Alba-barbed points, Harrell and Washita points, contracting Perdiz points, Nocona Plain pottery, antler tines with blunt tips, bone awls, and trade pottery from the Southwest and Southeast. Prikryl (1990:12) states that the artifacts and features from the Henrietta Focus bear strong similarities to those at Plains Village sites in the Southern Plains area. However, Peter and McGregor (1988:367) believe that further research should be done on defining the Henrietta Focus. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 5 Stephenson (1952:305-312) tried to create a chronological sequence for the Upper Trinity River Basin when he defined the Wylie Focus, which was dated to A.D. 1300 to 1600, based on shell and clay-grit tempered pottery which, he believed, was Caddoan in origin. The Wylie Focus was characterized by large circular pits, no indigenous pottery, flexed burials (both single and multiple and in poorly defined burial pits), maize agriculture and villages. The Wylie Focus was discarded when Bruseth and Martin (1987:280) dated pits at the Bird Point Island and the Adams Ranch sites to the Late Archaic period. Lynott (1977:99-100) used the previously used term, the Neo-American Stage but this term has been renamed the Late Prehistoric. However, the chronology for the Late Prehistoric today is from Prikryl (1990) who surveyed the Lower Elm Fork Branch of the Trinity River and created a chronology based on the projectile points from mostly surface collections. Influenced by Lynott's earlier work, Prikryl (1990:62) divided the Late Prehistoric into two phases, the Late Prehistoric I, dating from 1250 to 750 B.P. and Late Prehistoric II, dating from 750 B.P to 250 B.P. Late Prehistoric I diagnostic traits consisted of maize horticulture, house remains, grog-tempered and sand-tempered pottery and Scallorn, Alba, Steiner and Catahoula arrow points. Prikryl implied a subdivision of the Late Prehistoric I phase because the Steiner, Alba-Bonham, Scallorn and Catahoula arrow points are more common in the earlier portion of the Late Prehistoric I than the later. Late Prehistoric II seems to occur about the time that the climate of northern Texas became drier. Diagnostic traits include an emphasis on bison hunting, Washita, Fresno and Harrell arrow points, bison scapula hoes, "Plains-like" lithic artifacts, and settlements on sandy terraces above the floodplains (Late Prehistoric I people had lived on floodplains). It is important to note that Prikryl suggested that site placement is suitable for agriculture, even though there appears to be no evidence of agriculture except for the bison scapula hoes. Todd (1999) believes that some form of agriculture existed in the Upper Trinity River basin drainage based upon the presence of shell hoes. Experiments proved that shell hoes would have worked to till sandy and loamy soils. At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general abandonment of the North Central Texas area based on an absence of sites with trade goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish, or English traders (Skinner 1988). This simplistic interpretation is tied to a general drying trend and attempts to factor in an absence of positive information generated by professional and avocational archaeologists who have conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region. There is very little evidence of historic era Native American occupation anywhere in the counties although historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the early 1800s. There is tantalizing evidence found on the Trinity River in Dallas County of a possible visit by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto (Bruseth 1992). Artifacts found consist of a chain-mail gauntlet, a halberd and a spur. Current research, however, seems to indicate that Anglo settlers were the first non-Indians to settle in North Central Texas. Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, the aboriginal inhabitants continued to play a role in the history of the region. Garrett (1972:24) states “Indian hostilities almost depopulated North Texas (of Anglo dwellers) after 1839. It dwindled to ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 6 less than half.” Hostilities continued until the Treaty of 1843 was signed by the State of Texas and ten Native American tribes. This treaty provided the impetus for settlement of several North Central Texas counties. Today North Central Texas is a growing area. The expansion of Dallas and Fort Worth due to the ever increasing influx of industries has extended the suburbs and it appears that retirement commTest Unities are also on the rise. Previous Investigations Archaeological surveys and excavations were conducted at Lake Lavon and Lake Ray Hubbard [formerly Forney Reservoir]. The surveys were not systematic or comprehensive as would be required by the Corps of Engineers and the Texas Historical Commission today, as they focused on prehistoric sites and on areas which had high probability for containing preserved site deposits. Nevertheless, 25 sites were recorded at Lake Lavon (Stephenson 1949b and c) and subsequent excavation defined the Wylie Focus (Stephenson 1949a and 1952). This work built on earlier investigations by members of the Dallas Archeological Society (Harris 1948; Wilson 1946). In the 1960s and 1970s, further survey and excavation was done which added to our understanding of the local archaeology (Lorrain 1965; Lynott 1975, 1977). In 1963, the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) surveyed the area of Lake Ray Hubbard and recorded 33 archaeological sites (Harris and Suhm 1963). This survey described 20 sites already known to the DAS membership (Hannah 1941; Hannah and Harris 1948), and located 13 previously unrecorded sites. Only limited excavations were subsequently conducted (Ross 1966), but along with the previous DAS excavations, they did provide evidence of the way of life practiced by the prehistoric peoples who occupied this part of the East Fork valley. Since the 1970s, numerous small-scale cultural resources surveys were conducted of transmission corridors, pipelines, and Soil Conservation Service floodwater retarding structures throughout Kaufman County (Ferring 1975). The overall impression from these studies is that historic and prehistoric cultural resources are present, but are widely scattered and sites are small in size and frequently are surface deposits in the upland. Of note is the fact that lithic procurement sites are found in upland areas where metaquartzite gravels occur. Habitation sites are reported to be near available water sources. Very limited work has been done in the East Fork of the Trinity River downstream from the Lake Ray Hubbard dam. R.K. Harris surveyed the area in 1936 and recorded a number of sites. A survey of the river channel was done as part of planning for channelization (Richner 1976). This survey was limited in scope due to reliance on surface exposure of sites in areas where flooding, plowing, and erosion had removed vegetation or sediment. No shovel tests were excavated and it is likely that sites along the banks of the East Fork and within its floodplain were overlooked. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 7 A pipeline route in the East Fork was monitored by AR Consultants, Inc. (Skinner et al 2002) that would provide natural gas to the Forney Electric Power Plant. An interesting result of this monitoring was that a bois d’arc tree trunk located approximately a meter below the floodplain surface was radiocarbon dated at 120±50 B.P. (Beta-170374). This indicates that a meter of alluvium has been laid down since the late 1800s. As previously mentioned, AR Consultants, Inc. (Skinner 2001) conducted an archaeological survey of a proposed pipeline route across the floodplain of the East Fork. During the survey, a site initially designated the School Desk site and numbered 41DL406 was recorded. Subsequent archival research indicated that the site was actually the Gilkey Hill site which had been recorded by Harris (Harris 1942) as being in Kaufman County. Harris (1942) referred to the site as the Gilkey Hill pottery site. He found several cooking pits and middens containing flint chips, burned projectile points, bone and shell. Lithic tools recovered included arrow and dart points, drills, knives and scrapers. Polished stone artifacts include a boatstone fragment, gorgets, a net sinker, and a grooved axe. Several deer flaking tools along with bone needles and a mussel shell hoe were also found. In addition, several East Texas pottery sherds were collected. Importantly, three burials or parts of burials were recovered. An adult male skeleton and the skeleton of an individual that was possibly between 12 and 18 years old were recovered. A skull was also found. The site consisted of approximately 15 acres in two locations. The larger portion of the site consists of about 14 acres, was nearer the river and located on a small rise which extends to the bottoms. The smaller portion of the site is about 1 acre and is located on top of the high hill which overlooks the river and the larger portion of the site. The portion of the site on the high hill is probably Archaic and the rest site appears to be Late Prehistoric in age. He also mentions the presence of cooking pits, burials. A private collector has collected 292 artifacts from the site including such items as pottery, dart points, arrow points, bone tools, metate, bifaces, a gorget, etc. from along the ridge. Dart points consist of Gary, Ellis and Yarborough and arrow points include Alba, Catahoula, Perdiz, Scallorn, Fresno and Washita. Also, 119 pottery sherds were recovered from the site. Also, according to the collector, the Smithsonian has 24 lots of artifacts from Harris’s collection from the Gilkey Hill site. However, the hill/rise that the proposed pipeline route is to be placed adjacent to was not intensely investigated by Harris. Mr. Wilson Crook III, who helped Harris record the site mentions that a few scattered pieces of lithic debitage were present on the ground surface. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 8 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY Research Design Harris’ (1942) excavations at the Gilkey Hill site reported the presence of two midden deposits but failed to document their location in relation to the general site area which also was not defined. However, Harris visited the site with Dub Crook in the early 1980s and Crook prepared a site map for our use. Based on the map and accompanying notes, it was concluded that both of the middens are located to the east outside the pipeline corridor. The western knoll overlooking the old river channel was not tested by Harris and was considered to have little potential. Based on testing of the main site area by Goodwin and Associates, Inc. (Vandenbosch et al. 2001), it appears to the bulk of the site has been destroyed leaving only the small western knoll. Since most of the site has been destroyed, looters have been digging in the top of the knoll where they have apparently uncovered a deposit slightly more than a meter deep and resting on sterile clay subsoil. There looting has apparently found less material to the east and southeast in the pipeline corridor based on fewer, smaller, and shallower holes which have only a few shell fragments and fire-cracked rock on the backdirt piles. Shovel testing along the southern flank of the knoll found small numbers of artifacts at depths of over 50 cm (Skinner 2001:Table 4) but found no distinct midden as described by Harris or any buried features. With all this in mind, the goal of testing was to determine if a midden, occupation features, or burials were present within the pipeline corridor which is situated downslope from the knoll crest. Based on the sloping topography, it was expected that the pipeline corridor was outside the knoll deposit and that artifacts were likely to be in derived situations. Furthermore, plowing was likely to have disturbed the upper 20-30 cm of sediment, thus leaving little undisturbed buried deposit. Methodology The potential area-of-effect for the proposed pipeline routes is the 60 foot wide corridor north of the proposed center line. The Buffalo Creek interceptor pipeline is to be 18 inches in diameter and buried from 7 to 10 feet below the ground surface. In order to test for a buried deposit in the pipelines’ area of potential effect, AR Consultants excavated five backhoe trenches along the proposed Buffalo Creek Interceptor centerline. The remaining trenches were placed upslope within the proposed pipeline corridor. The purpose of the trenches was to determine if midden deposits were visible in trench profiles and to determine if deeply buried sediments with associated artifacts were present. It was expected that the site deposit was generally less than half a meter deep in the study corridor and that excavation to a depth of about two meters would reach into the underlying sterile strata. All eight of the backhoe trenches were 5 m long and were terminated about 180 cm below the surface which was well into the clay subsoil. At the same time, fifteen 50 by 50 cm test units were excavated throughout the corridor with their purpose to gather quantitative data about artifact types and density of artifacts, associated sediments, and to look for features. Test units were first placed along the ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 9 centerline and then upslope in order to achieve coverage of the entire corridor but not to make it so regular that artifact patterns might be missed. This spreading was also forced by the tree cover and the scattering of looter’s holes. Test unit 16 was excavated adjacent to Backhoe Trench 6 in order to determine if a charcoal stain found in the trench walls was a cultural feature. Test units were dug in 10 cm levels and fill was screened through ¼” mesh screens. Based on these investigations, a revised site form was prepared and submitted on May 9, 2006 to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory and to the Texas Historical Commission. The results of this investigation are presented in the following chapter. All the work described herein was done as part of Texas Antiquities Permit No. 3972. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 10 RESULTS In this portion of the report, the investigation of the Buffalo Creek Interceptor is discussed first and is followed by the future pipeline route. Cultural materials are discussed next in the Discussion portion of the chapter and Conclusions end the chapter. The southern edge of the proposed pipeline corridor is shown in Figure 2 and the backhoe trenches and test units locations within both pipeline corridors are plotted on the site map (Figure 3). Figure 2. The centerline of the proposed Buffalo Creek Interceptor pipeline corridor is marked by flagged stakes. View is to the northeast and the scraped ground surface is apparent. The western knoll of the Gilkey Hill site is to the left of the picture and outside the pipeline corridor. Buffalo Creek Interceptor The proposed pipeline route for the Buffalo Creek Interceptor was surveyed first. Ground visibility ranged from 20 to 100 percent but no cultural materials were found on the surface. Five backhoe trenches (1, 2, 6, 7 and 8) were excavated along the proposed pipeline centerline. Test unit excavation followed. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 12 Five soil zones were encountered in Backhoe Trench 1, hereafter BHT 1, (Figure 4). Zone I extended from the surface to about 23 cm below the surface. The soil was a very dark gray (10YR3/1) clay that was extremely hard. The structure was very coarse and angular blocky. Clay films were moderately thick on ped faces and slickensides were present. The yellowish-brown (10YR5/4) fine sandy clay in Zone II varied in thickness and extended from about 23 to 50 cm. The structure ranged from moderately weak to slightly hard. It was very fine columnar and no clay films were observed. A few fine rootlets were present and the horizon boundary was clear and wavy. Zone III extended from 50 to approximately 150 cm. This clayey loam is light yellowish-brown (10YR6/4) and abundant calcium carbonate nodules were present. The soil was structureless and the texture was massive and soft to slightly hard. Very few fine rootlets were present but clay films were not. The horizon boundary was clear and smooth. Zone IV consisted of light yellowish-brown to yellowish-brown loamy clay that extended from 150 to 170 cm. The description was the same as for Zone III except that calcium carbonate nodules were present. The boundary was clear and smooth. The final zone, V, ranged from 170 to 183 cm below the surface and was a yellowish-brown (10YR5/6) clayey medium sand that contained calcium carbonate nodules. It was structureless and soft. Scattered mussel shell fragments, flakes and fire-cracked rocks were present in Zone I in the trench walls, but no artifact concentrations or features were found. Five soil horizons were present in BHT 2 (Figure 5). Zone I ranged from the surface to 35 cm below the surface and consisted of very dark grayish-brown (10YR3/2) clay which has been mechanically disturbed. The structure was moderate and the texture was slightly hard and very fine columnar. Abundant roots and rootlets were present. Ranging from 35 to 82 cm below the surface, Zone II consisted of very dark grayish-brown fine sandy clay that was moderately strong, very hard and medium prismatic. A few clay films were present on ped faces and were thin. Slickensides were also present. Roots and rootlets were abundant. Zone III ranged from 82 to 105 cm and was yellowish-brown loamy clay that contained abundant calcium carbonate nodules and filaments. The matrix ranged from soft to slightly hard. No clay films were present and there were few fine rootlets. The horizon boundary was clear and smooth. From 90 to 105 cm, a layer of calcium carbonate nodules was present that averaged 2 cm in size. Zone IV from105 to 150 cm consisted of yellowish-brown and light yellowish-brown loamy clay. The soil description is the same as Zone III. Although calcium carbonate nodules are abundant, no layer was present. Zone V ranged from 150 to 179+ cm below the surface and contained yellowish- brown loamy clay with abundant calcium carbonate nodules that averaged 2 cm in length. Scattered mussel shell fragments, quartzite flakes and fire-cracked rock were present in Zone II below the disturbed Zone I, but no artifact concentrations or cultural features were found in the trench walls. Backhoe Trench 6 encountered four soil zones. Zone I ranged from the surface to 40 cm. The soil was brown (10YR4/3) clay which was strong and very hard. The matrix was very coarse columnar and no clay films were noted. Abundant roots were present and the horizon boundary was smooth and abrupt. A concentration of burned clay associated with some charcoal was exposed in both trench walls ranging from approximately 20 to 39 cm ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 14 below the surface. The location of the burned clay and presumed charcoal scatter is shown as part of the unconformity in Figure 6. The depression ranged from approximately 20 to 39 cm below the ground surface in a lopsided lunate shape in the south wall, but as a narrow flat line in the north wall. Part of the depression was removed by the backhoe trench. A soil change (Zone II) was noted east of the burned clay and charcoal layer which suggests that a soil unconformity lies between the charcoal and the soil change. A sample was taken from the charcoal and sent to Beta Analytic (Beta 216538) to be radiocarbon dated. According to an e-mail from Beta Analytic (5/8/2006), the material is not charcoal but some type of burned sediment. The radiocarbon date is 290+40 BP (AD 1490-1660). Dispersed artifacts, snails and mussels were present in the matrices of zones I/III but none were seen in the depression. Originally thought to be part of a man-made pit, subsequent close inspection and a test unit excavated on its south side determined that this was a natural depression from tree fall that was subsequently filled in with debris and artifacts by the frequent floods. Zone II extended from 40 to 60 cm. The soil was yellowish-brown (10YR5/4) clay containing minute quantities of loam. The texture was weak and soft. The matrix was very coarse angular blocky. No clay films were noted. Figure 6. South wall profile of Trench 6 showing soil unconformity. The outlined depression shown in red, which was thought to be a man-made pit, is probably a tree fall. Heavy disturbance, attributed to worm activity, was noted which is different than from the upper levels. The boundary was clear and smooth. Ranging from 60 to 88 cm below the ground surface, Zone III consisted of brownish-yellow (10YR4/6) clay that contained calcium carbonate nodules that increased with depth. The texture was very soft and weak. Massive structure was present. No clay films were present and a few roots and rootlets were present. The horizon boundary was clear and smooth. Zone IV extended from 88 to 110+ cm below the ground surface. The matrix was brownish-yellow (10YR6/6) clay and otherwise is the same description as Zone III. However, a much higher percentage of calcium carbonate nodules were present. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 15 Zone I in BHT 7 extended from the surface to 30 cm. The matrix was very dark grayish- brown (10YR3/2) clay that contained minute particles of silt. The texture was moderately hard and the structure very hard medium columnar. No clay films were noted and abundant roots were present. The horizon boundary was clear and smooth. Dispersed fire- cracked rock, lithic debris, shell fragments were seen but bone and charcoal were absent. Brown (10YR4/3) clay with a moderate and very hard texture ranged from 30 to 45 cm below the ground surface in Zone II. No clay films were noted and abundant roots were present. The horizon boundary is clear and smooth. Scattered artifacts were present but fewer in number than in Zone I. Zone III extended from 45 to 85 cm. The matrix was yellowish-brown (10YR5/4) clay which was weak and soft. The structure was very coarse angular blocky. No clay films were noted and some roots were present. Massive bioturbation from worms is evident and the artifact count dropped dramatically. The horizon boundary is clear and smooth. Zone IV extended from 85 to 145+ cm and consisted of light yellowish-brown (10YR6/4) clay with a very weak to weak and from soft to very slightly hard texture. The structure was very coarse angular blocky. No clay films were noted. A few fine rootlets were present. Massive nodules of calcium carbonate were present, some of which measure 7x4 mm. A clear and smooth horizon boundary was present. Zone V extended from 145 to 156+ cm and consisted of brownish-yellow (10YR6/6) clay. The soil description is the same as Zone IV, but fewer calcium carbonate nodules were present, but still within the same size range as Zone IV. Five soil zones were found in BHT 8. The upper 24 cm was fill probably from the adjacent pipeline. Zone I ranged from 24 to 51 cm, Zone II from 51 to 92 cm, Zone III from 82-162, and Zone IV from 162 to 201+ cm below the ground surface. The soil descriptions are the same as those in BHT 7. However, no cultural materials were exposed in the trench walls or in the back dirt. Four 50x50 cm test units were excavated within the Buffalo Creek Interceptor route, three (1 through 3) of which were close to the center line and TU 4 was placed north of the center line. The test units and artifacts numbers and types are discussed below. A 100x100 cm test unit (16) was placed south of BHT 6 with a 10 cm wide balk between it and the south wall of the trench. The test was placed so that the black stain could be horizontally defined. The southern half of the test unit was excavated to 70 cm below the ground surface first so that the extent of the stain scatter might be determined. Based upon the excavation of the south half, the northern half was only excavated to 50 cm which was well below the stain. Dispersed artifacts were encountered. A diffused layer of mussel shells and bones were found from 30 to more than 40 cm below the ground surface, but no features, charcoal, burned clay, or fire-cracked rock were present. Neither the shell nor the bone was burned; therefore, it is believed that the “bone and shell layer” were not associated with the organic debris found in the trench. Scattered mussel and snail fragments were found throughout the levels, but only identifiable specimens were collected. From levels 4 to 7, the soil matrix was heavily disturbed due to bioturbation from worms as well as roots which was not seen in the prior levels. Burned roots were found that ran almost perpendicular to the surface as well. Bioturbation easily could have ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 16 been responsible for large artifact downward movement. The soil types and number of artifacts are presented in Table 1 and the artifact count by type is presented in Table 2. Proposed future pipeline route Three backhoe trenches were excavated within the proposed future pipeline corridor as were nine test units. Like the Buffalo Creek Interceptor pipeline route, the route was surveyed first but no cultural materials were found on the ground surface which varied from being stripped clear of brush and leaves to having a distinct leaf cover. Occasional artifacts, primarily mussel shell, were found in the backdirt from the small shallow looter holes. BHT 3 had four soil zones (Figure 7). From the surface to 51 cm b, the matrix was very dark gray clay. It was strong, very hard with fine columnar structure. Very few thin clay films were on ped faces. Abundant roots and rootlets were seen. The horizon boundary was clear and smooth. Zone II ranged from 51 to 81 cm. It was brown (10YR4/3) loamy clay. It was moderate, hard and with no clay films. Calcium carbonate filaments were present. From 81 to 188 cm, the matrix in Zone III was light yellowish-brown loamy clay that contained abundant calcium carbonate filaments. It was slightly hard and very fine columnar. A very few fine rootlets were present but clay films were not. The horizon boundary was gradual and smooth. Zone IV ranged from 170 to 188 cm below the surface and contained yellowish-brown clayey loam that was weak, soft, and slightly hard and very fine columnar. A few very fine roots and rootlets were present but clay films were not. Massive calcium carbonate nodules were scattered within the zone. The description for BHT 4 is the same as BHT 3 except that Zone III ranged from 81 to 107 cm and was terminated at 190 cm below the surface. No artifact concentrations or cultural features were present in the trench walls but flakes, fire-cracked rock and mussel shell fragments were widely scattered in the upper 51 cm of both trenches. Zone I in BHT 5 (Figure 8) extended to about 60 cm below the ground surface. The zone consisted of very dark gray clay that was strong, hard and very fine columnar. No clay films were present and there were abundant roots. The horizon boundary was clear, but broken by Zone II. Zone II which is an upside down bowl-shaped historic ash scatter that contained glass, metal and wood ranged from 10 to 60 cm below the surface and was about 70 cm long. Zone III draped over a rise in elevation in Zone IV and ranged from 50 to 120 cm below the surface. The matrix was very dark grayish-brown clay which was structureless and massive. The horizon boundary was diffuse and wavy. Zone IV extended from 120 to 185 cm below the surface where the backhoe trench was terminated and consists of yellowish-brown clayey loam with abundant calcium carbonate nodules and filaments. It was moderate, slightly hard with very fine columnar structure. No clay films were present. Historic artifacts along with prehistoric artifacts were found scattered in Zones I and II, but no cultural features or artifact concentrations were noted. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

As previously mentioned, no artifact concentrations or cultural features were found in the backhoe trench walls. However, the yellowish-brown subsoil was encountered shallower [32 cm] in BHT 1 than in the other trenches. For the rest of the site, the subsoil was encountered at depths ranging from approximately 60 to 105 cm below the surface. Artifacts were found usually in Zones I and II. Backhoe Trench 5 contained burned metal ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

Discussion of cultural materials Despite extensive testing, only six stone tools were found. Five hundred eighty-eight artifacts (37.6%) were recovered from the upper 20 cm of the test units which corresponds to the plow zone. Diagnostic artifacts consisted of a clear glass shard, a hammerstone, 2 dart points, an arrow point base, a decorated sherd and a biface tip. The second 20 cm level (20 to 40 cm) contained almost as many artifacts, 584, which make up 37.4 percent of the assemblage. A total of 1,172 artifacts (75 percent) were recovered in the upper 40 cm of the test units which according to the radiocarbon date from Test Unit 16 are less than 500 years old. Levels 5 and 6 contained 256 artifacts (16.4 percent) and 134 artifacts (8.6 percent) were found in levels 7 through 9. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 21 The dispersed nature of the 1,172 artifacts in the upper 40 cm suggests that a midden is not present and the artifacts found in levels 5 through 9 probably moved downward due to vertisolic cracking and bioturbation, especially from the amount of worm holes noted. Heavier artifacts such as the broken dart point would move downward, but finer artifacts could easily have moved downward into the worm burrows. Five diagnostic tools were recovered (Figure 9). Dart points include a Gary (Figure 9b), Yarborough (Figure 9d), Yarborough broken in manufacture (Figure 9c), and a Keithville variety San Patrice (Figure 9a) or a Keithville point (Turner and Hester 1999:134-135; Young 2006). In addition, the base of an untyped triangular arrow point was recovered. The dimensions and weights of the few lithic tools are presented in Table 3. The only other tool recovered was a cobble hammerstone. Figure 9. Dart points from the Gilkey Hill site. A. Keithville; b. Gary; c. Yarborough; and d.

(Turner and Hester 1999:134). However, the Keithville point (Figure 9a) was found in the upper 20 cm of TU 8. The point is not in the lower levels of the test unit; therefore, it must be out of context. Although one would like to state a Paleo-Indian component was discovered in the test units, no other clearly Paleo-Indian artifacts were found and the presence of a broken Yarborough dart point (Figure 9d) from the 70 to 80 cm level of TU 7 suggests that the earliest site occupation would be during the Late Archaic (Turner and Hester 1999:197). Furthermore, the presence of the Gary point indicates either Late Archaic or Late Prehistoric occupation (Turner and Hester 1999:123). The broken base of an arrow point indicates that a Late Prehistoric component was present. Other evidence for a Late Prehistoric component is the decorated rim sherd recovered from the upper 10 cm of TU 16. The grog-tempered sherd is punctated (Figure 10) and the interior surface was scraped during manufacture. The rim is lipped and the dimensions are 22x18.4x5 mm. Unfortunately, the sherd is not typeable, but is similar to Caddoan sherds to the east. The number of artifacts recovered from the investigations at the Gilkey Hill site as well as the number and types described by Harris are unusual along this portion of the East Fork. Richner (1976), in his investigations along the East Fork, did not find sites Figure 10. Punctated sherd as large as the Gilkey Hill site, nor did he find sites recovered from TU with large middens. Site 41KF43, recorded by Forrester 16. in 1941, is located on a knoll, but its dimensions are only 150x200 feet (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas 2006). A similar site would be the Lower Rockwall site (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968) which is located on a small knoll in the East Fork floodplain. Numerous shells, lithic debris, dart points, gouges, lithic debris, grinding stones, pottery, fire-cracked rock, bones (including bison) and bone artifacts were present. The site also contained a “Wylie Focus” pit and burials, one of which was a skull burial. The amount of lithic debris may be attributable to the use of Uvalde gravels. Peter and McGregor (1988:282) illustrate the location of known quarry sites west of the Gilkey Hill site along ridges approximately four miles west of the East Fork Floodplain. These quarries could have been used by the aboriginal inhabitants of the site. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 23 Dispersed bones and shells indicate the presence of deer, small and medium mammals, turtles and mussels. Bison may have been present based upon the possible bison bones from Test Unit 1, level 10 to 20 cm. Environmentally, levels 4 through 7 may have been grassier than the area today. Shell analysis from the initial testing of the site (Todd 2001) stated that the terrestrial environment was mainly grassland that occasionally flooded. The river was muddy and probably shallow based upon the presence of Plectomerus dombeyanus which was recovered from many of the test unit levels. Mollusca recovered from the present investigation supported the environmental conclusions derived from the earlier investigation. A schematic profile of the buried sediments along the proposed Buffalo Creek Interceptor pipeline route is shown in Figure 11. The “zones” do not reflect the specific zones described in the backhoe trench descriptions but refer to similar sediments. As can be seen, a swale occurs in Trench 2. The artifact density in the trench can be explained by eroding cultural materials being deposited in a low lying area. Artifacts are present in zone HII to deeper depths but generally begin to decline in numbers at 30 or 40 cm below the surface. Likewise, the subsoils become prominent at these depths and it was apparent that most artifacts below 40 cm had arrived in these sediments by natural causes and were no longer in primary contexts. Trenches 1, 2, 6, and 7 essentially spanned the southern edge of the buried artifact scatter which is a distance of seventy meters. In sum, the trenches represent almost thirty percent of the distance and based on their proximity and spacing, it is logical to conclude that the archaeological potential of the proposed Buffalo Creek Interceptor route is low. This conclusion is further supported by finding similarly diffused sediments upslope toward the knoll ridge and by an absence of any evidence of occupation features, midden deposits, or burials in any of the trenches or test pits. Conclusions The Gilkey Hill site included two artifact rich middens located on a ridge that extends into the East Fork floodplain. As described by Harris (1942:48), one midden covered 14 acres and the second covered one acre. In addition, a knoll west of the main site was recognized as being small and having a shallow deposit. The present study area is on the south side of the western knoll. The top of the knoll has been heavily looted and several small, shallow, and apparently unproductive looter holes were found in the study area. Testing and trenching in the pipeline corridor failed to find any evidence of buried features above or below the base of the plow zone and artifacts are most dense between 10-20 cm and 30-40 cm. Approximately 135 artifacts were recovered from the 10-20 cm level in Test Units 7, 10, 15 and 16. Few or no artifacts were found to the east in test units 2, 5, and 12 but more than 30 were recovered from Test Units 11, 13, and 14.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 24 Figure 11. Schematic profile of buried sediments exposed in trenches along proposed Buffalo Creek Interceptor pipeline route. Distances between trenches are not to scale. distinct concentration of buried artifacts is apparent in the 20-30 cm level where more than 30 artifacts were encountered in Test Units 11, 13, 14, and 16. This concentration forms a crescent pattern that extends east-west and upslope within the pipeline corridor. A similar pattern is apparent in the 30-40 cm level where more than 20 artifacts were present in Test Units 1, 4, 10, 11, 13 and 15. However, this pattern also shows that artifact density is dropping off with depth below 40 cm and virtually no artifacts were found below 40 cm in test units 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 12. Interestingly, the only tools recovered from all the excavation were four dart points, the broken base of an arrow point, a hammerstone, and one ceramic sherd. Trenching and testing demonstrated again and again that a distinguishable midden deposit is not present and that artifacts are widely scattered throughout the clayey soil which overlies the subsoil. Some artifacts were encountered in the subsoil and this in apparently the result of cracking and bioturbation. Furthermore, no pits, hearths, floors, or burials were encountered in any of the trenches or test units. While Harris described features from his excavations, it is apparent that these residential and burial features were located on the ridge to the east of the western knoll. Fortunately, the major part of the site is well outside the pipeline corridor. The western knoll of the Gilkey Hill site is estimated to cover an area of approximately 1.5 acres. The main site area is on the knoll crest and the western end of the knoll has been extensively looted. A soil profile from the largest looter hole recorded no lithics, ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 25 three pieces of bone and two shells at 26 cm along with various scattered shells at 64, 93 and 96 cm below the ground surface. Based on the small sample of temporally diagnostic artifacts from testing, it is apparent that the knoll was occupied during the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric periods, but no midden deposit was developed and occupation is represented by a featureless artifact scatter.. The site must have been a seasonal campsite which was repeatedly and regularly occupied despite the fact that it no doubt was regularly inundated or isolated during major floods. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 26 RECOMMENDATIONS The purpose of archaeological testing at the western edge of the Gilkey Hill site was to determine if buried cultural features including middens, storage pits or burials were present in the proposed pipeline corridor, which consists of both the Buffalo Creek Interceptor route and the proposed future pipeline route. ARC concludes that installation of the Buffalo Creek Interceptor is not likely to disturb any significant cultural resources on the toe slope of the west knoll of the Gilkey Hill site. Testing resulted in the following observations that have direct bearing on the recommendations below. 1. The western knoll was outside the artifact rich middens where Harris found hearths, pits, and burials and he considered the knoll to have low archaeological potential. 2. The upper 20 cm of the pipeline corridor have been farmed in the past and any features in the plow zone have been disturbed or destroyed. 3. Almost 30% of the Buffalo Creek Interceptor on the south edge of the site area was excavated by ARC and no features, burials, or midden were encountered. 4. Testing below 20 cm revealed that artifacts are present, particularly between 30-40 cm, but that deeper materials are not in their primary contexts. 5. Overall, the top 40-50 cm sediments have been extensively churned by natural activities over the centuries since they were left behind and their original contexts have been obscured or destroyed. 6. Almost a third of the proposed pipeline route already has been excavated. Based on the results of this investigation, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that construction of the Buffalo Creek Interceptor pipeline should be allowed to proceed with cultural resource monitoring during construction along the south edge of the western knoll at the Gilkey Hill site. The future pipeline should be bored under the site deposit or routed to avoid it. However, if cultural features are encountered during construction of the Buffalo Creek Interceptor, work should cease in that immediate area and the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Texas Historical Commission should be consulted. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE 31 ENVIRONMENT OF THE GILKEY HILL SITE BASED UPON THE RECOVERED MOLLUSCAN SPECIES Jesse Todd Due to the fragmented nature of the molluscan shells recovered from shovel test Test Units at site 41DL406, species identification was difficult at times. Of the gastropod species, five were recovered which are Rabdotus dealbatus, Linisa texasiana, Helicina orbiculata, Mesodon thyroidus and Planorbella (Helisoma) trivolvis. The abundance of R. dealbatus indicates grassland and H. orbiculata indicates permanent vegetation. Only two shells of P. trivolvis were recovered which indicates that some flooding occurred. It may have been grassier in the floodplain during levels 4 through 7 times based upon the abundance of R. dealbatus shells recovered from TU 16. Six species of bivalves were recovered, Lampsilis hydiana, Plectomerus dombeyanus, Quadrula morton, Amblema plicata, Quadrula apiculata and Potamilus purpuratus. The pelecypod (bivalve) species recovered are generalists. However, the presence of P. dombeyanus indicates shallow, muddy water or a channel that was shallow close to the banks. Lampsilis hydiana prefers medium sized rivers and P. purpuratus prefers deep pools. The presence of only one valve may indicate that the shell was brought in from another portion of the river. The small size of shells recovered from ST 16 indicates that they were probably deposited by flood waters as either float or carried along on the bottom. Shells of medium-sized Corbicula sp. shells are found on the floodplain which would indicate they were carried there by flood waters. If the small mussels were used for food, it would indicate that the aboriginal inhabitants were not selective, but were procuring mussels as they encountered them. No molluscan species were recovered that would indicate a change in the environment from that described by Todd (2001) from earlier testing at the site. ________________________________________________________________________ AR CONSULTANTS, INC.
