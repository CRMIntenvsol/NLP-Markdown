ABSTRACT A study of prehistoric archeological remains from the lower Elm Fork of the Trin ity River and vicinity indicates that the Carrollton, Elam, and Wylie foci are outdated concepts. A new chronological sequence with six periods is proposed. In detailing each period, information on topics such as diagnostic artifacts, site features, and set tlement patterning is provided. The integration of paleoenvironmental and landform data with the archeological record reveals several important trends. From Paleoindian times until approximately 4000 B.P., archeological materials in the Elm Fork region are not unlike those of adjacent geographic areas. However, with the emergence of the contrasting Cross Timbers-prairie biotic regimes, a distinctive regional lifeway began to evolve. This local cultural development is most obvious between approximately 2000 and 1000 B.P. and is characterized by the presence of Wylie pit features, a more intensive use of local stone resources, and a greater density of sites. Significantly, this era coincides with the development of the West Fork paleosol, an indicator of increased moisture and floodplain stability in the study area. Such favorable environmental conditions would have resulted in a more abundant mast (nut) crop that was important to prehistoric people and to many of the animals they hunted. After 1000 B.P., a drier climate apparently contributed to an influx of bison into North Central Texas. Appearing in the archeological record of that time is a cultural assemblage that, like those of surrounding areas, indicates increased emphasis on bison hunting.

APPENDIX Introduction Creek survey sites are designated by the abbreviation BCS and an accompanying The project compiled data on 238 archeolog number, and Elm Fork survey sites are designed ical sites. This Appendix presents information by the abbreviation EFS and an accompanying on each, in tabular form. The first column, Site number. and Investigations, lists the numbers and names The first column also presents data on the (if any) that have been assigned to a site. The extent of investigations at each site. The cate first number that appears is that of the Texas gories for the types of investigation are Survey, Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), Surface, Testing, and Excavation. The notation based on the Smithsonian Trinomial Designation of the type of investigation is followed by an System. In this classification, 41 stands for enumeration in parentheses of the institutions, Texas; DL, DN, or TR for Dallas, Denton, or archeological societies, and individuals (either Tarrant county, and the final number labels the named or anonymous) that conducted the work. individual site within its county. Site numbers The second column, References, lists works that are preceded by an X are trinomial numbers that provide substantive data about the site. The assigned by SMU, which maintains a separate third column, Location and Landform, lists the site archive. closest drainage and the appropriate landform A second set of numbers that appears for designation. Terrace numbers are provided for some sites involves the quadrangle system uti most Dallas and a few Denton County sites. The lized in Texas before 1957. One-degree blocks terrace numbering system utilized is Taggart's divided along longitudinal and latitudinal lines (1953) rather than that of Crook and Harris were employed. The first number in the quad (1952, 1957). Taggart's is more detailed, and rangle designation is for the one-degree block in his master's thesis includes a large-scale map which the site occurs. This number is followed with terraces indicated for most of Dallas by an A, B, C, or D which denotes one of the County. block's four quads.
