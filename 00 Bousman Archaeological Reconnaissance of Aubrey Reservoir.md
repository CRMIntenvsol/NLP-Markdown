ACKNOWLEDGEMENT S The archaeological reconnaissance of the proposed Aubrey Reservoir area was carried out by the Archaeology Research Pro­ gram at Southern Methodist University with support provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District. We wish to thank the Corps of Engineers for their help throughout the duration of the project. Colonel Floyd H. Henk, District Engineer, had the foresight to see that a start be made to record the archaeological resources at Aubrey and through the guidance of Mr. L. E. Horsman, Chief, Environmental Resources Section, and his staff an initial evaluation has been made. We are grateful to the volunteers who participated in the actual field survey. These include Dallas Archeological Society members (Tony Myers, Bud and Pat Mills), Southern Methodist University student (Jerry Humphreys), and North Texas State University students (Floyd McCoy and Kathy Dolan). Personal friends of the authors Pat Flanary and Hank Schlinger also aided in the survey work and Charles Blome conducted initial work of field reconnaissance. Robert D. Hyatt and Olin F. McCormick, III, Research Archae­ ologists for the Archaeology Research Program at S.M.U., gave helpful and constructive advice during the preparation of this report. We thank Dr. Lee Knox of North Texas State University for loan of aerial photographs of the reservoir area, Dr. Dale Odom for locating two sites for us and all the authors of the Environmental Impact Statement prepared by North Texas State University for their help and consideration. To Mrs. Kathleen Gilmore and Doye Doty we owe gratitude for the loan of collections to photograph for this report. Dr. Barbara Butler Marks and Dr. R. A. Miller of N.T.S.U. pro­ vided volunteers, lists of local collectors and information from previous surveys of the area. Mrs. P. C. Wiley of Gains- ville donated a list of cemeteries in the proposed lake. Special thanks are due to Mr. R. King Harris who relocated sites, donated collections for study and lent us constant sup­ port. Mrs. Bill Reed who located artifact collectors, and Mrs. Margaret P. Hays of the Gainsville Archeological Society proved invaluable in gaining permission to survey private property.

INTRODUCTION This report describes the result of an archaeological reconnaissance conducted within the area of the proposed Aubrey Reservoir. Within the limits of the reservoir 26 archaeological sites were located and recorded. The period of occupation represented by these sites extends from approxi­ mately 2000 B.C. to A.D. 1870. Hunting and gathering were the main subsistence activities of the Indians who inhabited the area. No evidence of occupation during the Paleo-Indian stage was recorded in the reservoir. The earliest evidence of occu­ pation began during the Carrollton Focus of the Trinity Aspect of the Archaic stage and aboriginal occupation continued through the historic period. The reservoir will inundate a 35,050 acre area in northeast Denton, southeast Cooke, and southwest Grayson Counties. The dam site will be located one quarter of a mile south of the junc­ tion of Elm Fork and Isle du Bois Creek. Flooding will involve the floodplains of the two above creeks plus Walnut Branch, Wolf, Buck, Range, Indian, and Spring Creeks. The flood con­ trol pool elevation will be 636.00' m.s.l. The area was originally covered by a mixed hardwood forest except in the Grand and Blackland Prairie districts, but pres­ sures for cultivatable land and fuel has reduced the timber stands to a small percentage of their original territory. Re­ cently large portions of the cultivated land has been developed into pasture lands, which are being utilized for cattle grazing. Also the fuel needs of the people have changed from wood to gas and electricity, but the environment displays a lag in its res­ ponse to the elimination of this pressure, probably because of the pressures applied by cattle grazing. The reconnaissance was conducted by two Southern Methodist University students who selected archaeologically productive areas in the lab and then evaluated these areas in the field. Artifacts were analyzed at the sites and no collections were made. These methods were employed because they best suited the purpose of the project. The purpose of this research project was to locate and evaluate the archaeological resources of the reservoir area. This project was not intended to be an in-depth, comprehensive survey of the reservoir, but rather a reconnaissance to discover if there is archaeological material in the region and to help answer questions about what types of prehistoric remains to expect. This information will be utilized to estimate the in­ tensity and nature of archaeological survey that will be necessary 1 "T

to prepare an adequate inventory and evaluation of the historic and prehistoric resources endangered by the planned construction. ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Within the Trinity River Basin of Texas systematic archaeo­ logical surveys of the Garza-Little Elm, Forney, Lavon, and Grapevine Reservoirs, the Elm Fork of the Trinity, the Denton Creek Watershed, and Dallas County have been carried out by pro­ fessional and amateur archaeologists (Stephenson 1950; Harris and Suhm 1963; Stephenson 1949; Humphreys 1972; Benham 1969; Gibson 1969; Harris 1936; see summaries by Smith 1969, Skinner 1972). Numerous sites have been recorded within this extensive area. Most of the sites are situated either on low rises in the flood­ plain of the Trinity River and its tributaries or on alluvial terraces of the river. These sites include small seasonal camp­ sites, flint chipping stations and large permanent village sites. In 1954, Suhm, JeIks and Krieger outlined a chronological sequence of aboriginal stages which is used throughout Texas. This is: Paleo-Indian stage--9500-5500 B.C. Mammoth, bison hunting, seasonal movement, small bands composed of several families (evidenced by kill or butcher sites; Clovis, Folsom, Angostura, Plainview, Scottsbluff projectile points). Archaic stage— 5500 B.C.-A.D. 800 Hunting of small game, gathering wild plants, sea­ sonal movement, small bands composed of several families, (small seasonal campsites; characteristic Elam, Carrollton, Gary, Scottsbluff, and Yarbrough projectile points, Waco net sinkers) Neo-American stage— A.D. 800-1600 Hunting and gathering, marginal agriculture in some areas, tribal and confederacy groups. (Introduction of ceramics and the bow and arrow, semi-permanent to permanent village sites.) Historic stage— A.D. 1600-1800 Introduction of the horse and eventual extermination or removal of the Indians. (Advent of European trade goods. Beginning of a horse-dependent Plains adapted economy.) Areal variation in these stages is generally typed using McKern's Midwestern Taxonomic system (McKern 1939:309) where aspects (i.e.. Trinity Aspect) are subdivided into foci (Crook and Harris 1952:7-38). 2

Sites located by the aforementioned surveys in this area, for the most part are fitted into this chronologic framework on the basis of their material culture. However, there are several incongruities in the site panorama for the upper Trinity reg ion. The most controversial of these is the Lewisville site, now submerged in the Garza-Little Elm Reservoir. Lewisville, excavated by the Dallas Archeological Society under the direc­ tion of W. W. Crook and R. K. Harris (1951-57) , is located on the Pemberton Hill-Lewisville Terrace (T-2) or the Upper Shuler Formation, a Pleistocene stratum composed of 35 feet of basal gravels, yellow sands, yellow sandy clay, and dark gray alluvium (Crook and Harris 1957:38-40). The site was exposed after 21 feet of earth had been re­ moved in bulldozing operations for the Garza-Little Elm dam- site. Lewisville consists of 21 seemingly man-made hearths containing disarticulated bone of Pleistocene fauna, hackberry seeds, logs, and six flint and quartzite tools. The site has been the subject of extreme controversy. The bones, seeds, and logs are apparently burned but it has been postulated that decay processes could have caused the charred appearance. Two log samples have yielded radiocarbon dates of more than 37,000 years B.P. (before present). The dating pro­ cess has been repeated several times, each time with the same result. The dates on the samples are unquestionably valid. The topic of question at Lewisville is the association of a large Clovis point with the "hearth" material. The accepted date for Clovis is about 9500-9000 B.C. The radiocarbon dates and the presence of the Clovis point at Lewisville have given rise to all kinds of hypotheses to explain this incongruity. Whether Lewisville is indeed the earliest Paleo-Indian site or whether it is a freak occurence due to land shift, gopher disturbance or whatever, cannot be said at this time. A similar find, the Lagow Sand Pit Man, has been recently disproved on the basis of comparing the florine, nitrogen, and uranium content of recent and old bones (Oakley and Howells 1961:543-545). The bones of the Lagow Sand Pit Man were located in 1920 in apparent association with extinct Pleistocene fauna in the Upper Shuler Formation. The only other comparable site in this area is Pemberton Hill where Pleistocene fauna and a broken center section of a "Clovis" type knife blade or spear point had eroded out of the Upper Shuler Formation (Crook and Harris 1957:75). Further evidence at Pemberton Hill has been destroyed through gravel pit operations. The Paleo-Indian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin remains little known and will remain so until excavation uncovers additional information about the way of life of these early men. 3

In the Archaic stage, the Trinity Aspect represents the already mentioned succeeding period in this area of North Cen­ tral Texas. This aspect is subdivided into the Elam and Car­ rollton foci (Crook and Harris 1952). An Archaic occupation pertinent to this report is the Louis Obshner site, south of Seagoville, known primarily for the two Scottsbluff dart points found there. This site was the first evidence of the association of Scottsbluff points with the Carrollton focus. Previously this type of point had cropped up in collections in which site locations were unknown as well as in sites located on the High Plains region. Its occurence in Texas was decidedly rare (Crook and Harris 1955: 75-76). Other Carrollton focus traits from the site include dart points. Clear Fork Gouges, gravers, flake scrapers, "Waco net­ sinkers," Carrollton axes, side scrapers and knife blades (Crook and Harris 1955:79, Shiner 1970). The Scottsbluff point is known to be found in association with Paleo-Indian material in sites preceding Obshner (Worming- ton 1957:123). Its association here with the Archaic Carrollton focus indicates an overlap of the Scottsbluff style in the Paleo- Indian and Archaic stages during the period 7,000-4,000 B.C. The Neo-American stage is represented by the advent of a Nocona Plainware ceramic tradition diagnostic of the Henrietta focus and appearing as tradeware in the Wylie focus. It appears in the Henrietta focus at approximately A.D. 1200 and somewhat later in the Wylie focus (Suhm and Jelks 1962:115) . This cera­ mic type is recognizable by its usual lack of decoration and ground mussel shell temper. Characteristic points of this stage are Fresno and Harrell and Maud. Historic sites are archaeologically determined by the presence of Spanish and French trade goods such as glass beads, gun flints and gun barrels, brass and iron ornamental tinklers, assorted pieces of brass, pewter, and iron as well as by native artifacts both of lithic and metallic material (Jelks 1967) . In the North Texas area, the Norteno focus (perhaps descen­ dant from the Henrietta focus), is attributed to Wichita speak­ ing peoples during the historic period (Duffield and Jelks 1961: 75). The Aubrey Reservoir area can be expected to contain sites with similar material cultures to those described above and to be located primarily along creeks and drainages. Four sites within the reservoir area have been partially collected or excavated. The first site was collected by R. K. Harris in the 1930's. This site (41DN5) is described as Neo­ American on the basis of the Nocona Plainware pottery that is present (Harris, personal communication). The site is located on the floodplain of Elm Fork. The site still exhibits cores, flakes, arrow points, fire cracked rock, bone and mussel shell fragments. 4

The Ramsey site was excavated in 1938 by R. K. Harris. This burial site is presently on the property of John McCuiston. Four cremated burials were exposed near the old barn which has since been destroyed. The site is situated on an alluvial ter­ race of Elm Fork. Grave goods associated with the burials include a number of projectile points, celts, woven matting, bone awls and needles, and Nocona Plainware pottery, all of which are dated to the Neo-American stage. Unfortunately, the report of the excavation was lost in a fire, but it was noted by the excavators that more burials were located beneath the barn proper (Harris, personal communication). Of interest in the site area are two mounds. Whether these are natural mounds or artificial is unknown. A third site is an Archaic occupation (410016) located on a natural levee between isle du Bois Creek and an old meander. This is northwest of the town of Pilot Point near the Saint James Baptist Church. The previous property owner was Sam Riley. This site was tested in 1963 by Hoffrichter and Gilmore (Gilmore, personal communication). It proved to be a surface scatter of flakes, quartzite cores, and Archaic dart points. The last site (41C015) was collected by Kathleen Gilmore in 1963. It is located on a ridge overlooking Isle du Bois Creek. This site is classified as Archaic on the basis of Gary points and "Waco net-sinkers," but it was occupied at some time during the Neo-American stage as indicated by Fresno arrow points. In addition, the site yielded flakes, cores, core fragments and bone. It covers an area of 300 Meters N-S by 100 meters E-W and may represent a series of minor occupations (Gilmore, personal communication). From the collected data in the Aubrey Reservoir, the abori­ ginal peopling of the area seems to be in agreement with that of the North Central Texas region. The material cultural re­ mains indicate an extensive utilization of the Trinity River basin by Archaic and Neo-American groups. Aubrey Reservoir must be viewed as a means of extending the knowledge of aboriginal cultures, for there are many gaps in the prehistoric record. Questions raised by sites such as Lewisville and Pemberton Hill may be resolved by intensive survey and scientific excavation at Aubrey Reservoir. HISTORY Wichita sites in the area surrounding the Aubrey Reservoir are Spanish Fort (Montague County), Vinson (Limestone County), Gilbert (Rains County), Stone (McLennan County), and Stansbury (Hill County) now under the Whitney Reservoir (Harris, Blaine, and Blaine 1965:288). The Pearson and Garretts Bluff (Womack) sites are related to the above mentioned sites (Duffield and Jelks 1961:69). 5

These historic Indian sites of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries are distinguished from their prehistoric counterparts on the basis of cultural remains and the presence of European trade goods. The sites are attributed to occupa­ tion by the Southern Division of the Wichita Confederacy (Norteno focus peoples). A total definition of the cultural assemblages of these sites is not yet possible since the number of sites are few and only four of these can be linked to Wichita peoples. "...The dating of these sites is difficult and rests mainly on poorly known European trade goods" (Harris, Blaine and Blaine 1965:289). A general list of aboriginal artifacts includes chipped stone projectile points (Fresno, Clifton, Scallorn, Alba, Dari, Yarbrough, Ellis), snub-nosed scrapers, spoke-shave scrapers, alternately beveled knives, Womack Engraved, Nocona Plain, and Goliad Plain pottery, pottery pipes, and ground stone tools (Duffield and Jelks 1961:71-73), (Stephenson 1970). The Wichita tribes presumably migrated from Kansas and Northern Oklahoma into North Central Texas in the early eighteenth century. However, Bolton and Krieger have postulated a Wichita subtribe living 150 miles south of the Red River in 1650. This is based on historic documentation of the Martin-Castillo expedi­ tion (Duffield and Jelks 1961:73-74). In 1719, explorer La Harpe encountered the majority of the Wichita subtribes in North Cen­ tral Texas. Whether these peoples migrated southward into Texas or whether their origin lies in the Henrietta focus is a point in question (Duffield and Jelks 1961:75). By 1848, the Wichita had been moved into the territory north of the Red River due to the influx of white settlers. Denton, Cooke, and Grayson Counties in which the Aubrey Reser­ voir lies were settled in the 1840's. Settlers were plagued with Indian raids until 1870, at which time settlements became so numerous that the Indian desisted in their raiding, except for minor cattle rustling (Smith 1955:39-49). Four cemeteries dating from colonial times (Bloomfield, Jones, Davis, Strickland) and four early family plots lie in the Aubrey Reservoir. In addition, the late 1800 towns of Old Bloomfield and Vaughantown will be submerged. Cooke County is reputed to contain Cove Hollow, the hideout of outlaw Sam Bass (1851-1878) . The Aubrey Reservoir area, then, contains sites of his­ toric importance ranging from the Spanish and French contact period to the late 1800's. 6

ENVIRONMENT The reservoir will be situated in the Texan biotic pro­ vince, which is an ecotone between the forest of east Texas and the grasslands from the western regions of the state (Blair 1950). Three biotic districts, which in part, characterize the Texan biotic province are present in the proposed area, and they are the Grand Prairie, Eastern Crosstimbers, and Blackland Prairie districts (Fitzpatrick 1972). The major and central portion of the reservoir is within the Eastern Crosstimbers district, an oak-hickory forested belt which extends north-south. This district is restricted to sandy or sandy loam soils which are derived from the Wood­ bine Formation. The topography varies from gently rolling to hilly. The major drainages of the reservoir, the Elm Fork and Isle du Bois, are within this forested district, and many of their tributaries, the Indian, Wolf, Buck, Clear, and Spring Creeks are also in the district. The valleys are wide but shallow with meandering streams. Overflow of streams on to the floodplains occurs during periods of heavy percipitation and the floodplains often have pools of standing water. In the western portions of the reservoir the Grand Prairie district predominates. It is a mid-grass prairie, little blue- stem, which is restricted to dark calcareous clays that overlie the Grayson, Mainstreet, and Paw-Paw Formations. Relief is of a gentle rolling nature within this district. Some of the biological relationships which characterize the Eastern Cross­ timbers are also found in the Grand and Blackland Prairie flood­ plains. This is due to the alluvial deposits and the proximity of water. This creates a mixture of ecological zones. The Blackland Priaire, in the extreme eastern portion of the reservoir, is a mid-grass prairie with little blue stem as the dominate botanical element. The soils in this district are mostly calcareous clays which overlie the Eagle Ford Forma­ tion. Topography is gentle and rolling and the area is well dissected by drainages. Six microenvironmental zones have been delimited on the basis of the relationships between the biology, geology, and physiography of the region. The zones are: 1) Rivers and drainages 2) Floodplains 3) Floodplain rises 4) Fluviatile terraces 5) Upland slopes 6) Uplands 7

The purpose for dividing the environment into microenviron­ ments is twofold. 1) It serves as a tool for explaining why there are inter- and intra-site variations. It provides a basis for interpretating why there were similar and dissimilar activities performed at sites as reflected by the artifact as­ semblages of sites. The sites have not only been classified by the artifact assemblages, but also by the macro- and micro­ environmental zone in which a particular site occurs. 2) This section also presents a basic idea of the medium in which the prehistoric inhabitants were living. It informs the reader of the resources and conditions to which humans adapted in order to survive within the area. The six microenvironmental zones are described as follows: 1) Rivers and drainages: The biology of this zone is characterized by the invertebrates Crustacea and mollusca, 31 species of fish including catfish, sunfish, crappie, carp, gar, and carsuckers. The reptiles and amphibians are represented by toads, turtles, frogs, salamanders, and snakes. During dry periods many of the smaller streams quit flowing and water is restricted to isolated lentic pools, but during wet periods some streams overflow. 2) Floodplains: This zone is represented by a southern hackberry dominated forest community. Common associations are burr oak, red ash, and elderberry. The animals characteristic of the zone are toads, frogs, turtles, muskrats, nutria, and swamp rabbits. Drainage in the zone is poor, streams often overflow in this zone, and pools of standing water in sloughs or old stream meanders are common. The deposits are recent alluvial clays, silts, sands, and sandy loams. 3) The floodplain rise: The same basic biological re­ lationships of the floodplains are also characteristic of the floodplain rises. The major difference is that drainage on a floodplain rise is good and it rarely is flooded. The flood­ plain rise may be either a natural levee or a remnant projection in the floodplain. The deposits of clays, silts, sands, and sandy loams are recent in age. 4) Terraces: The botanical community on a fluviatile terrace is dominated by cedar elm with honey locust, red mul­ berry, and elderberry as its common associates. Zoological elements include opposums, armadillos, skunks, coyotes, squirrels, rabbits and deer; many of these animals are also found in other zones as well. The deposits are of a Pleistocene age and consist of sands and sandy loams. Drainage is excellent and this zone is never flooded. 5) Upland slope-. This zone is dominated in the Eastern Crosstimbers by a post oak community with black jack oak, winged elm, Texas hickory, and corralberry as its main associations. 11

In the prairie districts the dominate plants are little blue- stem, big bluestem, Indian grass, sideoats grama, and switch grass. The coyote, gray fox, and armadillo are characteristic of both the communities. Drainage within this zone is very rapid and the soils are either sands or calcareous clays de­ pending on whether or not it is a timber or prairie zone. The deposits are of a creataceous age. 6) Uplands: This zone has the same basic relationships with biological and geological components as the upland slopes. The major difference is that the drastic changes and variations of altitude within the upland slope zone are not present in the uplands. Runoff is rapid, and this is the highest zone in terms of elevation. Using the environmental information a model may be hypo­ thesized about settlement patterns of the aboriginal inhabitants First settlement patterns in relation to the three macro-environ mental districts will be discussed, then the various uses of the microenvironmental zones. The two priarie districts have been combined because the resources in both are quite similar, thus both would offer the same advantages. It is hypothesized that the Eastern Crosstimbers district was utilized more often for base camps, and the prairies were utilized for specific activities, i.e., hunting. The evidence to support this hypo­ thesis is that: 1) The major and permanent sources of water of the area are within the timbered district. 2) The concentration of wood offers an excellent source of fuel which is lacking in the prairie zones. 3) The sandy soils of the timbered district offer better drainage during periods of heavy rainfall as compared to the clays of the prairies, thus camping conditions are better in the Eastern Crosstimbers. 4) A more stable supply of native plants and animals existed in the forest, although a large biomass of herbivores, buffalo and antelope, resided on the prairies the Indians could not exploit this very mobil resource until they began to use the horse for transportation. The varying utilization of the microenvironmental zones is hypothesized that zone IV, the fluviatile teracces, in par­ ticular the terrace projections into the floodplains, functioned most often as a base camp, while the other zones were utilized when the season and/or conditions best suited an efficient ex­ ploitation of the resources of a particular zone. The base camps would be sites where a large range of activities were performed and a large group of people lived. Other sites would reflect a smaller range of activities and a smaller group of people, which may represent families, peer groups, etc. 12

The environmental evidence to support this hypothesis is that: 1) The position of the terraces on either side of the river, is the midpoint of the zones; the river, floodplain, and flood­ plain rise are downhill while the upland slope and upland are uphill. This would allow an efficient exploitation of all zones from a central position. 2) A terrace projection would always be near a permanent source of water, unlike the upland slope, and upland. 3) The terrace would never be flooded because of its height above the drainage, but the floodplains and occasionally the floodplain rise would be inundated. The sandy soils of the terraces would not hold moisture like the clay soils of the floodplains. 4) Movement into peripheral zones would be selected for when the variables allowed a more efficient exploitation of the resources of a particular zone. For example during wet periods groups could gather wild vegetable resources or hunt in the uplands and upland slopes for long periods of time and have water available. During dry seasons many animals have to obtain water from the permanent sources and in many areas fish would be restricted to small isolated pools in the once flowing streams. These phenomena were most assuredly known and may have been exploited; if so it would be reflected by the settlement pattern. This environmental deterministic model does not represent the true patterning of the aboriginal culture, but rather a logical construct of the most efficient use and exploitation of the environmental resources. Differences would be expected between the model and the true settlement pattern due to the effects of inter- and intra-social group organization and re­ lations, religious elements, taboos, and other restrictions. Testing of these hypotheses or others more pertinent to specific problems could be executed with the completion of further sur­ veying and excavation. METHODOLOGY The archaeological reconnaissance of the proposed Aubrey Reservoir was conducted in one month's time. Since the entire 35,050 acres could not conceivably be covered, only the most promising situations were surveyed. The areas were decided upon by evaluating several factors: 1) proximity of the area to a stream or water source, 2) altitude and drainage of the area, (many locations are flooded periodically by rain or stream overflow), 3) condition and type of soil in the area (drainage, fertility), 13

4) density of brush and ground cover“affecting visibility, and 5) landowner's attitude. U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 minute maps and aerial photo­ graphs were utilized to determine numbers 1,2, and 4 of the above factors. Generally speaking, landowners were unable to provide information about the location of prehistoric sites but were willing to allow access to their property. Two persons conducted the majority of the reconnaissance and volunteers were welcomed when they were available. Crews never exceeded five in number. Rainy weather was a definite hindrance to a more complete survey by prohibiting access to several probable site locations. Sites were located by walking over property, noting the presence of any aboriginal artifacts or utilized material such as flint tools, pottery, bone, mussel shell, or burned rock. Collections were not made at any sites located in this survey. The decision not to collect artifacts is based on the facts that 1) the work was on private property, 2) the purpose of the study was to record sites, and 3) collection of surface artifacts would damage the distribution of surface artifacts for later controlled collection. Sites were recorded on survey forms and on the USGS maps. The altitude above mean sea level, nearby drainages, and site microenvironments were noted. Also described were soil types, artifacts present, name and attitude of landowners, and the probable time period and length of occupation of each site. Each site area was mapped and photographed. SETTLEMENT DATA In the area of the proposed reservoir 26 archaeological sites have been located and recorded; no attempt has been made to locate all of the sites in the region, just a sample. A majority of the sites exhibit evidence of prehistoric occupa­ tion ; the exception is 41C021, which is the remains of the McKenzie log cabin. The prehistoric sites have been classified according to the environmental resources affiliated with a site and the types of activities performed at the sites as reflected by the artifact assemblages of a particular site. Also the time-cultural period is noted when possible. 14

ARTIFACTS The presence of artifacts is assumed to represent a variety of phenomena. The artifacts are interpretated to be evidence of the general level of technological development of a cultural group, and the different types of activities performed at a site, but the mere nature of the evidence re­ stricts the types of inferences which may be drawn; therefore, hypotheses usually pertain to subsistence activities of a cultural group. Cultural groups are delimited and defined archaeologically by the type of artifact "populations", and particular artifacts, i.e., projectile points and ceramics, are assumed to be gross indicators of a time span involved at a site. "Artifacts are things of any kind that have been altered of constructed by man." (Hole and Heizer, 1969). A large variety of artifacts is present in the Aubrey area, and these have been grouped into chipped stone, pecked and ground stone, ceramics, fire cracked rock, and faunal remains. The chipped stone artifact category consist of flakes and chips, retouched flakes, cores, choppers, bifaces, pre­ forms, scrapers, knives, drills, gouges, and projectile points. These artifacts were made of either a coarse grained local quartzite or a variety of fine grained flint of which no local source has been found. The gouge was made of a fine grained sandstone which was also found to occur locally. Carrollton, Dari, Elam, Ellis, Gary, Palmillas, Trinity, and Yarbrough dart point types were found to occur in the reser­ voir area, and they represent a time range from 2000 B.C. to A.D. 1000. The time range represented by the arrow points was from A.D. 500 to A.D. 1800, and the types of arrow points found were Fresno, Harrell, Hayes, Livermore, Perdiz, and Scallorn (Suhm and Jelks 1962). The pecked and ground stone category consist of manos, metates, a celt, and a Waco sinker. The Waco sinker, which is characteristic of the Carrollton focus only, is made from quartzite, while the manos and metates are made of a fine grained sandstone. Manos and metates are characteristic of both Archaic and Neo-American periods. A celt was found in relation to the burials at 41DN9 and is an uncommon artifact for the area, but it is not known if the celt is characteristic of a particular period. Two types of ceramics were found in the area, one of which is shell tempered and the other is grog tempered. Only one sherd of grog tempered pottery was found and it was unidentifiable. The shell tempered pottery has been identified as Nocona Plain, 22

and is usually affiliated with the Henrietta focus of the Neo-American stage (R. K. Harris, personal communication). The fire cracked rock group is composed of rocks, both quartzite and limestone, which show evidence of being cracked by heat. The type of faunal remains which were present included mussel shell and bones from a large mammal which is assumed to be deer. 23

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS An archaeological reconnaissance of the area in and adjacent to the proposed Aubrey Reservoir was conducted in order to determine the nature of the archaeological remains and to prepare an estimate of the work necessary for conduct- an in-depth inventory and assessment of the archaeological and historical sites. The investigation was conducted during the winter of 1972-73 and the findings are described above. A total of 26 archaeological sites were located, recorded and evaluated in the course of the survey. On the basis of surface artifacts and information provided by amateur archae­ ologists, there is evidence for occupation during the Late Archaic, Neo-American and Historic periods. Although evidence for occupation of the area during the Paleo-Indian stage and Norteno Focus was not found, we expect that detailed studies will uncover remains attributable to these periods. Sites within the reservoir range in size from small con­ centrations of lithic debris which mark the location of inter­ mittently used tool manufacturing locales to large village sites which were occupied repeatedly during the Archaic and Neo-American periods. The numberous limited activity sites include quarry sites, mussel shell gathering sites and hunting camps. Although gathering sites were not recorded, it is ex­ pected that they occur in the upland area which is above the reservoir floodpool. Most notable of the sites within the reservoir is the Ramsey site which was recorded by R. K. Harris and members of the Dallas Archeological Society before it was destroyed by gravel quarrying. The site appears to have been a Neo-American village which was occupied for a long period of time during which several Indians were buried at the site. Dis­ covery of similar sites which can be excavated will mitigate the loss of the Ramsey site but it is only due to the concern of amateur archaeologists that we have the information that is available. The alluvial sediments of Elm Fork have buried many pre­ historic deposits under a mantle of sand and clay. Bone is well preserved in these sediments and recovery of faunal re­ mains should allow reconstruction of the prehistoric subsis­ tence patterns. in some instances silting has buried single occupation living surfaces and in others silt has repeatedly covered living floors at sites which were occupied intermit­ tently year after year. Due to these circumstances it will be possible to develop a chronological sequence and to uncover the remains of a single prehistoric visit to a site. 34

Historic sites within the reservoir "are marked by stone chimneys and trash deposits scattered throughout the area. As outlined in the report by North Texas State University (Odom in Fitzpatrick 1972:270-274) there are several important cemeteries and family burial plots which will have to be moved before flooding occurs. Although presently unimposing, the archaeological potential of the abandoned towns of Vaughantown and Old Bloomfield will have to be determined. The results of the archaeological reconnaissance in the Aubrey Reservoir area suggest that there are many prehistoric and historic sites which will be inundated when the lake is built or be endangered by construction of facilities, houses, etc. adjacent to the lake. We recommend that a systematic survey of the reservoir area be carried out in order to have an adequate assessment of the resources present. On the basis of the fieldwork associated with this study, it is suggested that the summer would be a better season in which to conduct the survey. Controlled collection of surface artifacts and test pitting of subsurface deposits should be done as an inte­ gral part of evaluating the archaeological resources. We es­ timate that an in-depth program of survey and testing will require 2^-3 months of fieldwork. The prehistoric and historic archaeological remains of Middle and Upper Trinity River Watershed are at present poorly understood. At the same time these nonrenewable resources are slowly but constantly being lost. Once destroyed the story of man's occupation in this area will be lost for future generations. Systematic and comprehensive archaeological site surveys provide a means by which to record and evaluate these important histori­ cal resources so that a representative sample may be preserved through scientific excavation and thereby add to today's under­ standing of man's past. 35
