Usually a red-brown, coarse, sofi, porous paste. The surface can be unglazed, glazed with « clear glaze, hand painted, or treated with slip. Includes creamware, pearlware, ironstone, semi-porcelain, semi-vitreous, and hotel ware. Has a white/ofT white, fine, porous and sofi paste or a white/grey-white, fine, non-porous, hard paste with a clear glaze and can be decorated by such techniques as relief mold, transfer print, flow blue, hand painted, decal, and gild Evro-Amencan - paste is usually grey or buff, coarse, non-pourous, and hard, Surface treatments include salt glaze, “Albany” slip, and blue hand painted designs Asian - paste is usually buf] to brown sometimes with bits of gravel visible in the paste, non-porous, and hard. Surface treatments include thick brown glaze (called jian you or “Tiger”), an iridescent black-brown glaze, and turquoise blue and white glazes over relief molded or impressed designs. Euro-American - paste is usually light grey or buff, fine, non-porous, hard. Surface treatments include clear glaze and colored glaze with hand painted designs Asian - paste is usually light grey with « few small, dark inclusions, and is decoreted with a blue tinted clear glaze with a hand painted underglaze design such as the “Bamboo”, suggesting that these bows are a crude porcelain. Euro-American - paste is pure-white, fine (almost glassy - sugary appearance), transluscent, non- porous, hard. Surface treatments include clear glaze, relief mold, decal, gild, band painted, and hand painted with lustre designs. Utility porcelain is not as white and glassy, nor is it transparent.

Common Ceramic Decorative Techniques The process of decoration pottery from paper impressions taken off inked copperplate engravings. The design is made of many colored dots, barely visible to the casual observer. Dots are always underglaze in contrast to decal overglaze dots. Transfer printing is an English invention dating from the Butterses enamel-works (1753-56) (Norman- Wilcox 1965). A method of multiple color decoration introduced about 1860. Decal colors will appear in slight relief when light is reflected from the vessel's surface. The design is composed of hundreds of raised dots, similar to transfer prints, but over the glaze. Applied by hand with a brush or fingers. Irregular uneven designs are the usual result. Brush marks are clearly visible in most cases. Raised decoration which is an integral part of a vessel mold or form. Molded relief is particularly popular on clear glazed white ironstone dating from the second half of the 19th century (Wetherbee 1974). Mottled, colorful designs applied with a sponge or brush. Spatter or sponge was particularly popular from 1798 to 1865 (Sperry Wood 1959). Applied relief design usually in the form of small leaves and flowers. Decorative rings around the exterior rim and base of a vessel, usually in earth tones, applied with a stationary brush and rotating wheel, The technique is often called “engine tuned”. This type of decoration is common on yellow ware and pearlware mugs and bowls.
