Lintz and Prikryl—A Steatite Vessel Fragment from 41SS178, San Saba County, Texas 159 Aboriginal Ceramics from the North Central Region of Texas Linda W. Ellis, Timothy K. Perttula, and Wilson W. Crook, III ABSTRACT Ceramics began to be made and used by the aboriginal populations of North Central Texas possibly as early as ca. A.D. 200 in the Trinity River basin, but more generally are found in sites dating between ca. A.D. 900-1600 in most other parts of the region. Only among aboriginal populations in the upper Red River, upper Trinity River, and the East Fork of the Trinity River were ceramic vessels an important technological part of artifact assemblages; ceramic assemblages are especially sparse in the Brazos and Colorado River basins in the region. In this article we discuss the diverse character of the aboriginal ceramic assemblages documented to date in North Central Texas, which primarily feature plain shell-tempered wares of Late Prehistoric Plains Village age and/or grog-, bone-, and grit-tempered plain wares and decorated wares that strongly resemble East Texas Caddo ceramics in decorative styles. INTRODUCTION North Central Texas archeological region can be viewed as a geographic transitional zone whose ar- North Central Texas is an environmentally cheology reflects cultural influences from adjacent diverse ecoregion with respect to its geology, archeological regions and whose margins are often physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, wildlife, defined more by what they are not than by what and hydrology (Bureau of Economic Geology they are (Fields et al. 2002; Kenmotsu et al. 1993; 1996a, 1996b; Raisz 1957). Its western margins are Perttula 2004). Much of the region falls within bounded by the Rolling Plains (Figure 1). Moving what is generally believed to be the southernmost eastward, the region encompasses the river valleys extension of the Plains Village adaptation after ca. of the Oak Woods and Prairies and the grasslands A.D. 1200 and thus the aboriginal communities of the Blackland Prairie.

160 Texas Archeological Society any of these wares were actually manufactured in North Central Texas during the Late Prehistoric period is an intriguing research question that remains to be fully addressed, as does the meaning of the appearance of Puebloan trade wares from north central and southern New Mexico in North Central Texas sites (see Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Crook 2013). Ceramic-bearing archeological sites are relatively scarce in North Central Texas, and the frequency of ceramic sites appears to decrease from east to west. This east/west gradient may simply be a factor of the relatively low number of sites recorded in many of the western counties; however, this does not ap- pear to be the case if we look at the results of an intensive survey con- ducted in the South Bend Reservoir area in the late 1980s (Saunders et al. 1992). The survey area included portions of Throckmorton, Young, and Stephens counties in the Rolling Plains (see Figure 1) and followed the main channels and associated Figure 1.

At the Upper Farmersville site (41COL34) there is a significant pot- tery assemblage (n=1099) (Crook and Hughston 2009). As noted in other Late Prehistoric sites along the East Fork and its tributaries, plain shell- tempered sherds (n=691) represent the majority of the ceramics present (over 60 percent of the total sherds recovered from the site). Sherds from grog-tempered (32 percent) and bone- tempered (5 percent) vessels account for the remainder of the assemblage (see Table 2).
