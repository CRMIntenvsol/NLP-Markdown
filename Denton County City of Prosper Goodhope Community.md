Denton County City of Prosper Goodhope Community 1.1 Historical Background Well before Anglo settlers and frontiersmen began migrating into Denton County and the surrounding region, the area was primarily occupied by Tonkawa Indians with scattered hunting parties pertaining to the Wacos, Bidais, Anadarko, and Kickapoos tribes, as well. The first Mexican, American, and European settlers arrived in this area prior to the Texas Revolution in 1836 when the Mexican government granted the land to several prominent settlers. After the Republic of Texas was established in 1836, 180 million acres were opened for settlement. To entice settlers from the United States, large land grants, bounties, headrights, and premiums were issued out to those who qualified. One such land grant was issued to William S. Peters, an English businessman who immigrated to the United States in 1827. Peters was an empresario (or immigration agent) who received several land grant contracts from the republic. The first of these contracts resulted in the formation of Peter’s colony (Figure 3.2). The terms of the contract required the empresario to recruit settlers from outside the republic at a rate of 200 families within a three-year period. In return, the colonists were to be granted 320 acres per single man and a maximum of 640 acres per family. The empresario was allowed to retain up to one-half of a colonist's grant as payment for services rendered, including land surveys and title applications. The empresario provided powder, shot, and seed and in some cases built settlers' cabins. The empresario also received 10 sections of premium land from the republic for every 100 families they settled (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1958). Figure 3.2: Map of Peters Colony (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 2000) Denton County was formed in 1846 out of the larger Fannin County. By 1859, all Native American tribes within North-Central Texas had been removed to Oklahoma, which in turn brought more settlers to the region from Europe (including Czechs, Hungarians, and Germans) and the southern United States, who preferred to settle near streams for cattle grazing and growing subsistence crops (Odom 2016).

In 1860, the population reached 4,780 residents and 20,000 cattle. Population continued to increase, and in 1880, the population was 18,143 with 50 percent of the county was being cultivated. Railroads also entered the county during this time. As a result, the production of subsistence crops like corn and vegetables declined, and farmers turned their efforts towards the production of cotton and wheat. Between 1880 and 1920, the number of cattle declined, while cultivation increased to 89 percent of the total county (Odom 2016). In 1914, the town of Prosper incorporated and featured a population of 500. This town served as a market center for cotton and corn farmers in the county. Within 20 years, Prosper provided its residents with electricity, natural gas, water, paved roads, a high school, a bank, and housed 25 businesses. Community growth was halted during the Great Depression. The population dropped to 271 and continued to decline into the 1950’s. It was not until 1970 that Prosper’s population reached 500 again (Minor 2016). By 2000, the population increased to 2,097 and hosted numerous businesses that served the residents and farmers who livered nearby. The Good Hope community included the families of Jacob and Lewis Rue, Ben Armstrong, Pete Hucherson, and Reverend W.P. Rennison. Arriving in 1854, these families settled and founded a small community in the Ben Rue survey, which they called Rue Settlement. Ben Rue later sold all but four acres of this land before moving to Fannin County. These acres were reserved as school and church sites. In 1875, Good Hope Baptist Church was established and Rue Settlement adopted the Good Hope name. The church was moved to Parvin, one mile north. Burials had ta ken place in Good Hope by at least 1856. In 1904, Ben Rue deeded the cemetery land to the Good Hope Cemetery Association. The school was known as Good Hope, Good Hope Parvin, or Parvin, and in use until 1949 (Maxwell 2010).
