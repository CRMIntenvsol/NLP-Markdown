River Legacy Park Archaeology ABSTRACT In the late fall and winter of 1997-1998, AR Consultants (ARC) conducted an archaeological excavation of the Rough Green archaeological site (41TR162) and tested site 41TR164 which are prehistoric sites both located in Arlington's River Legacy Park. The investigation was done because the corridor of the proposed Arlington to TRA Trinity River Sewer Pipeline passes through the sites on the south bank of the West Fork of the Trinity River downstream from its confluence with Village Creek, and opposite the mouth of Walker Branch. Both sites contained buried deposits and mussel shells and soils from site 41 TRI 64 dating in the period between 5690±70 BP and 2018±53 BP. The Rough Green site was occupied first at the end of the Late Archaic and continued until the end of the Late Prehistoric period. The function of 41 TRI 64 is unsure although it certainly was a temporary campsite at which hunting and gathering activities were conducted. It is proposed that the Rough Green site coincides with a family's bur oak grove that was occupied seasonally to harvest acorns. It is further concluded that both sites were situated along the bank of an abandoned meander of Walker Branch, and that at the time of occupation the West Fork of the Trinity River was flowing south ofthis location. A Late Prehistoric settlement model is proposed in which base camps/residential camps were situated on Pleistocene terraces along tributary streams of the West Fork and seasonally occupied sites were in the floodplain of both the tributaries and the West Fork. Very restricted special purpose sites were in upland settings. Evaluating these conclusions will require further survey, site testing and excavation, and advanced geomorphological and environmental analyses. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology INTRODUCTION The Rough Green site (4 1 TRI 62) is a prehistoric archaeological campsite that was encountered during the archaeological survey of a wastewater pipeline that crosses the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity River (Figure 1). The buried deposit was located by backhoe trenching in mid-1997, because the Corps of Engineers, as part of their Section 404 Permit review, requested that the City of Arlington, Texas determine if any significant historic or prehistoric sites were in danger of being disturbed by construction of the proposed pipeline, which is known as the Arlington to TRA Trinity River Sewer Project. The pipeline crosses the West Fork channel opposite the mouth of Walker Branch which joins the river from the north and downstream from Village Creek in east central Tarrant County. The Rough Green site is located near the western end of Arlington's River Legacy Park. When first found, it was interpreted that the site represented a buried shell lens site where the shells of river mussels were discarded by the prehistoric Native Americans who inhabited this area (Skinner and Caran 1997:30). A second site (41TR164) is an earlier buried deposit that was also located by trenching and is described in this report. The pipeline is designed to carry wastewater from Fort Worth's Village Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant to a Trinity River Authority (TRA) pipeline that exists west of Highway 157 in north Arlington. This required the construction of a new pipeline that is approximately 3.75 miles (6.0 km) long. Gravel mining and other earth modifying activities have disturbed an estimated two miles of the route; thus 1. 7 miles of the route were investigated archaeologically. The pipeline is centered within a fifty-foot wide permanent easement. The construction corridor was narrowed within River Legacy Park in order to protect the native trees that grow in this undisturbed bottomland hardwood forest. The pipeline consists of a 72" diameter concrete pipe south of the river and a 78" pipe on the north side. The pipes have been installed in a trench that has been excavated to an average depth of20-25' (6.1-7.6 m) below the present ground surface. The cultural resource survey was required because the City of Arlington is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, and the Antiquities Code of Texas directs cities and other political subdivisions of the state to evaluate the impact of planned projects on cultural resources. In addition, a Section 404 (of the Clean Water Act, as amended) permit was required from the Fort Worth District office of the U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers. When it was determined that potentially significant archaeological sites were present, AR Consultants (ARC) prepared a statement of significance and a detailed Research Design that was reviewed by the Corps of Engineers in Fort Worth and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission. The City of Arlington agreed to have the excavation conducted as a stipulation to the 404 permit that was issued by the Corps of Engineers. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 4 NATURAL ENVIRONMENT River Legacy Park is located in the valley of the West Fork of the Trinity River which is bordered to the north and south by the Eastern Cross Timbers plant community of North Central Texas. The Fort Worth Prairie, a part of the Grand Prairie of Texas, is to the west and the Blackland Prairie is to the east. The Eastern Cross Timbers is a north-south trending plant community which is dissected by drainages which flow into the West Fork and the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. A resistant ridge of sandstone known as the Woodbine Formation underlies the Cross Timbers. The valley walls are composed of horizontally-bedded sandstones, clays, and shales which comprise the Cretaceous-age Woodbine Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988). Erosion has rounded the valley walls, but they are still prominent facades when viewed from the valley floor. Small pebbles are present within the sandstone. Gravel deposits are contained buried in the alluvial deposits within the valley, and upland gravel deposits have been mapped north of the West Fork valley. None have been noted south of the West Fork from the Clear Fork on the west side of Fort Worth to east of Dallas (McGregor 1995:Figure 4). The closest gravel deposit to the south is near Alvarado near the drainage divide between the Trinity and Brazos Rivers. Young (1999) reports large gravels as being present at site TA9 near the mouth of Hurricane Creek to the north and east of the study area. The West Fork has incised a wide floodplain through the Woodbine and reached its lowest base level about 18,000 years ago (Perring 1986: Figure 4.). Since then, it has alluviated as carrying capacity varied and aggradation incre~sed. The meandering channel has left behind a series of sloughs and cut-off meanders which apparently stabilized about 2,000 years ago (Perring in Shaunessy, Jurney, and Yedlowski 1994:5). These geological processes have buried a complex web of channel and levee deposits which span the past 20,000 years. The park is located in the center of the West Fork of the Trinity River valley on the south bank of the river. The valley in this area is approximately 2.5 km wide and the valley floor is relatively level. The valley walls are sloping where erosion and downcutting has exposed the Woodbine. The Woodbine is exposed in the river banks downstream from the study area, but very little bedrock is presently exposed in the river bed. The General Soils map of Tarrant County, Texas (Ressel 1981) shows the floodplains of Village Creek, Walker Branch, and the West Fork of the Trinity River as being included in the Frio-Trinity soil association. Where not disturbed by gravel mining [designated as Arents soils], the surrounding area is mapped as Trinity clay that is frequently flooded (Ressel 1981:Map 33). Trinity clay is described as being a nearly level floodplain soil that is a dark gray, alkaline clay that extends to a depth of 63 inches. It has very dark grayish brown mottles below 32 inches. Annual flooding is common. The soil is poorly drained and permeability is slow (Ressel 1981 :5 7, 110). Arents soils are surrounded by or AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 5 adjacent to Trinity clay areas, as they represent the disturbed overburden from areas where sand and gravel were mined in the past. These areas could be treated as Trinity clays. The gravels are not exposed in the banks of the West Fork or its tributaries, and were not readily available to serve as quarries which provided knappable gravels in the past. Limestone and sandstone might have been available in gravel bars along the active river channel. A ridge covered with Silawa fine sandy loam is on the north bank of Walker Branch just upstream from its intersection with the West Fork of the Trinity River. Silawa occurs on high terraces above major streams, and above normal flooding. Its A-horizon extends to six inches and rests on 40 or more inches of sterile sandy clay (Ressel 1981:50, 106-107). This is the location of prehistoric site 41TR168 on the east bank of Walker Branch and north of the West Fork channel. The bottomland hardwood forest is a western extension of the forest from East Texas and downstream on the Trinity (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1985). In its native state, elm and postoak were the dominant trees, along with hackberry, Spanish oak, and elm. Various fruit and nut producing species included bur oak, red haw, walnut, pecan, gum bumelia, and mulberry. Upland tree cover outside of the valley was composed primarily of post oak and blackjack oak (Peter and Jurney 1988). Although not quantified, nuts were available in both the river valley and the Cross-Timbers, but the upland forests had a more erratic production history than the bottomland forest. The bottomland hardwood forest occurs in the floodplain and on the terraces along the West Fork and provides habitats for quail, dove, rabbit, squirrel, raccoon, and deer (Ressel 1981 :57). The river channel environment supports fish, mussels, turtles, frogs, and snakes, along with a variety of water-adapted plants. The adjacent upland prairies were inhabited historically by now-extirpated bison and antelope, along with other, and smaller, prairie mammals and birds. The prairie would have been the major environmental zone through which the narrow riparian river corridor passed. A consensus about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North-Central Texas over the past 12,000 years has not been reached. Discussions by Prikryl (1993), Ferring (1997), Humphrey and Ferring (1994), and Brown (1998) offer disparate interpretations based on different analytical approaches. The following discussion relies heavily on Ferring's investigations and focuses upon the past two thousand years. Correlating periods of rapid alluviation with higher precipitation and slow alluviation with drier conditions, Ferring has concluded that the Late Holocene [5000 yr BP to the present] was a wet period with moderate alluviation, except for a dry period between 2000-1000 yr BP [A D 1-1000]. It was during this dry period that the West Fork Paleosol was established on the stable surfaces of the river meanders along the Upper Trinity and its tributaries. This interpretation is supported by changing patterns seen in stable isotope analysis. Brown (1998) offers a differing interpretation based on isotopic analyses of mussel shells from a prehistoric site (41DL270) on Denton Creek. He concludes that the period from 1500- 2500 yr BP was cooler and/or wetter and that before and after the environment was warmer and drier, but he points out that this interpretation may only be applicable for the Elm Fork tributary and not the region.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 6 CULTURE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Introduction For several decades, cultural resources investigations in Tarrant County have lagged behind those in Dallas County, and therefore the data base of information to which this project can be compared is limited. This situation is due in part to the absence of major construction projects, and was also due to the absence of an active avocational archaeological society and a lack of professional archaeologists. This situation has radically changed in the past decade by the emergence of an enthusiastic, well-trained society, the Tarrant County Archeological Society. In addition, there are professional archaeologists working in the offices of the U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers, although not in any of the Fart Worth universities. Over the past fifteen years, a variety of research and cultural resource investigations in the immediate area have gathered information that is discussed below (Figure 2). Previous Work in the Area River Legacy Park is a City of Arlington park that extends west from FM 157 almost to Greenbelt Road and is situated along the south side of the West Fork channel. Ferring's survey of the park area (1994) located four prehistoric sites [41TR143-146] exposed in the river bank. No evidence was found of historic or prehistoric sites on the floodplain surface. He also describes the Old Bridge Geologic Section from the south bank of the West Fork just to the east of the Rough Green site. The Old Bridge section includes four units [A-DJ. Unit A consists of laterally accreted sands and silts and is related to the Sanger Alloformation which is mid-Holocene in age. Units B and C are correlated with the Pilot Point Alloformation and contain all of the archaeological sites reported by Ferring. Unit D consists of recent alluvium. Av ocational archeologist Bill Young surveyed the area north and east of the project area over a number of years and recorded sites located primarily on the northern terraces of the West Fork (Young 1992). Young's site TA9 is a large lithic scatter and possible Uvalde Gravel quarry that was immediately south of Mosier Valley Road across from the southern boundary of the Euless Sports Complex (Whorton and Skinner 1995). This site has now been destroyed by sand and gravel mining. The site contained primarily Middle and Late Archaic points and no evidence of Late Prehistoric occupation. AR Consultants

In 1994, the Archaeology Research Program (ARP) of Mercyhurst College recorded two sites (4 1 TRI 41 and 142) east of the project area within the floodplain and north of the West Fork of the Trinity River (Shaunessy, Jurney, and Yedlowski 1994: 1). Testing at site 41 TRI 41 yielded a Middle to Late Archaic Palmillas dart point, as well as other artifactual and ecofactual materials_ Subsequent testing of site 41 TRI 42 and other floodplain deposits for buried cultural horizons was conducted in 1996 by Geoarch Consultants (Perring and Byers 1996). Testing revealed the presence of an abandoned meanderbelt system in the floodplain west of site 41TR142_ The site was shown to contain a preserved Late Archaic deposit over an area of about 20,500 square meters. The floodplain site is considered to be the largest such site in the West Fork below Lake Bridgeport (Perring and Byers 1996:12). Preservation was shown to be good in that mussel shell and animal bone were present, in addition to lithic artifacts and fire-cracked rock. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 8 Testing of an additional prehistoric site [4 1 TR 167] was conducted by the Texas Department of Transportation in conjunction with planning for a hike and bike trail between FM 157 and Highway 360 (Ellis 1998). While it was concluded that the site was an example of a " ... zone containing a large number of 'localities' (Binford 1980) where small-scale, limited-function resource exploitation events occurred (Ellis 1998: 11 ), no further work was warranted due to the anticipated impacts upon the buried sediments." Based on this site evaluation however, the site may be eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The First Street Bridge site (41TR138) is located on the east side of Fort Worth and well upstream from the mouth of Village Creek (Largent, Hunt, and Peter 1994). The site consists of four concentrations of mussel shell and/or burned rock on the east bank of the West Fork. This site deposit extends from one to four meters below the surface in what the authors refer to as a deposit topped with the West Fork paleosol. The site shows evidence of repeated occupation and inundation which is common for sites on the West Fork. The Gateway Section (Ferring 1990:60) is located immediately to the south of the First Street Bridge site. Nine meters of Holocene alluvium are exposed here, and the lowest alluvium unit is Sanger alluvium that has been radiocarbon dated at 8,940±185 BP (Beta- 14905). A thick section of Pilot Point alluvium is above the Sanger and is topped with a soil referred to as the West Fork Paleosol. A date of 1,406±100 BP (Beta-14904) was obtained from the top of the soil A-horizon. Modem levee deposits bury the West Fork soil. The River Bend site (41 TR68) was located on the north side of the West Fork midway between the Gateway section and the mouth of Village Creek. The site was tested in 1987 (Peter 1987) and is an example of a specialized foraging camp that was repeatedly reoccupied between AD 850 and 1350. Low quantities of artifacts and virtually no curated tools were found, although a wealth of burned rock and mussel shells was present. Fauna! remains included bones of deer, bison, rabbit, frog, and turtle, but it was concluded that the large mammals were butchered elsewhere (Peter 1987:32). Four rock features were uncovered and radiocarbon dates of AD 1200±50 (Beta-22487) and 1330±100 (Beta-22488) were obtained from charcoal. Archaeomagnetism yielded dates between AD 1350-1450. Village Creek has been the site of major geomorphological investigations with regard to the construction of Green Oaks Boulevard and other projects. While the investigations (Andrews and Caran 1990a and b; Ferring 1988; Prikryl 1995) did not result in the location of buried cultural resources, the information contained in the most northerly study (Caran 1990a) provides specific data about sedimentation and deposit dating that is most useful to site evaluation of the deposits found in River Legacy Park. In particular, buried fluvial channels were exposed in the bank of Trench 5 (Caran 1990b:A-11), with an associated radiocarbon date of 2,210±90 BP (Beta-34052) at a depth of 175-195 cm AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 9 below the surface. A date of 4,970±80 BP (Beta-34051) is from 376-382 cm. The older date is from a fluvial channel deposit. The University of Texas at Arlington has conducted major excavation at the Fountain site upstream on Village Creek (Hanson and Kvemes 1997). The site is an extensive lithic scatter located on a high terrace on the east side of Village Creek. Excavation has uncovered hearths, postholes, and a possible cache pit and a deposit which spans the period from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. The most intensive occupation was between AD 1000-1400. Chert is the primary (96%) lithic raw material, and primary (3%) and secondary (14%) flakes are few in relation to tertiary flakes from the 13,000+ flakes recovered. This suggests that initial tool making was not done at the site, but that final biface thinning and tool repair were. Arrowpoints are common at the site, and are accompanied by a variety of chipped stone tools, but primarily scrapers. A small sample of pottery has been recovered, along with bones of deer and bison. There is an apparent absence of vertebrae, crania, and upper limbs which suggests that butchering was done elsewhere. Some of the bones show evidence of butchering and marrow/grease extraction. Culture History The following prehistoric culture history is derived largely from the Joe Pool Lake monographs (Peter and McGregor 1988; Jurney, Lebo, and Green 1988). A Historic European period has been added. Paleo-Indian ca. 11,000 B.C. -6,000 B.C. Archaic 6,000 B.C. - A.D. 700 Late Prehistoric A.D. 700 -A.D. 1600 Early A.D. 700 -A.D. 1000 Middle A.D. 1000 -A.D. 1400 Late A.D. 1400 -A.D. 1600 Protohistoric A.D. 1600 -A.D. 1800 [ Historic Native American] Historic European A.D. 1800 to Present Using the above temporal framework, the following paragraphs present a brief description of the culture history of the area. The Paleo-Indian period is distinguished by distinctive projectile point styles (Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, and others) attributed to this period. Surface artifacts generally come from deposits on stream terraces above the level of the active floodplain. Many of the points are made of cherts that are not native to North-Central Texas. To date, no Clovis points have been reported from Tarrant County (Meltzer 1987: Meltzer and Bever 1995). The Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site in Denton County are the only excavated Paleo-Indian sites in the region (Crook and Harris 1957; Ferring 1989), and both are on AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 10 the Elm Fork to the north. During this period, large mammals became extinct, and their extinction is attributed in part to a general drying of the environment. During the Early Archaic, rapid alluviation is equated with a wet period, and sites are found on stream terraces. There is a hint of population increase, and Lynott (1981: 103) suggests that there was increased emphasis on the use of bottomland food resources. On the Elm Fork, Prikryl (1990:71) reports fewer bottomland sites than during the Middle Archaic while sites are predominantly found on the first terrace above stream floodplains. As earlier, sites tend to be along the Elm Fork rather than along the smaller tributaries. The population density continued to be low. Late Archaic sites increased in number over the previous period, and sites are located both along the Elm Fork and its tributaries. There appears to be an increased use of tributary streams, and a pronounced population explosion. Within the Elm Fork basin, local Ogallala quartzite was being used prominently at this time, and this observation is taken by some authors (Skinner 1981; Prewitt 1983) as evidence of increased territorial constriction. On Mountain Creek, it appears that the earliest occupation was during the Late Archaic, and that use of the area was only on a seasonal, not year-round, basis. Moreover, unlike the Elm Fork sites and most of Dallas County, lithics are predominantly cherts which may have been obtained to the southwest near Alvarado (McGregor 1995). During the early Late Prehistoric period, the bow and arrow and pottery appear in artifact assemblages (Shafer 1977) and this is interpreted as a dry period. Houses and probable evidence of agriculture first appear during this period, as shown at the Cobb-Pool site (Raab and Woosley 1982; Fritz 1993 ). Early Late Prehistoric site locations mirror those of the Late Archaic, and chert continued as the common material for chipped stone projectiles and tools within the Mountain Creek basin and the West Fork Watershed. The West Fork Paleosol is tentatively dated to this period, although it has been dated earlier than A.D. 800 in some places (Ferring 1990). The late Late Prehistoric was once again wet as had been most of the Late Archaic. Buffalo bones are common in late Late Prehistoric sites (Dillehay 1974; Lynott 1979), along with tools normally expected to occur at sites on the High Plains. It ·has recently been suggested (Hanson and K vemes 1997) that the dichotomy between late and early Late Prehistoric does not hold at the Fountain site, and may not apply in North-Central Texas because the authors conclude that comer-notched points [primarily Scallorn] and Perdiz points are contemporaneous. Protohistoric Native American occupation in the Tarrant County is reported by numerous authors who describe the regional history. Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been found in the area (Peter, Cliff, and Green 1996:2). This pattern of finding virtually no physical evidence of historic Native American in the form of artifacts [beads, gun-flints, cooking utensils, etc.] is seen throughout much of North-Central Texas (Skinner 1988), and has been related to the abandonment of the region in the 1500/1600s. The 1830s and 1840s were decades of Anglo expansion into North-Central Texas. Garrett, a well-respected Fort Worth historian, has stated that "Indian hostilities almost depopulated North Texas [of Anglo settlers] after 1839. It dwindled to less than half AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 11 (Garrett 1972:24)". According to tradition, many Indians of several tribes roamed Tarrant County until well into the 1860s. Strategies for dealing with the illusive aboriginal population ranged from armed confrontation and pursuit to across-the-table dialogue. Rising from a domestic background of dealing with Indians, President of the Republic of Texas, Sam Houston, realized rapprochement was preferable to direct confrontation. In the summer of 1843, a council with the Indians was called, and in September of that year ten tribes signed a treaty which was approved by the Senate the following January. The treaty provided the needed impetus for settlement of several counties in the North-Central Texas area. The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around 1841, and Lonesome Dove, settled in 1845. Lonesome Dove, located near present-day Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant County (Garrett 1972:55). The county itself was organized in 1850, but it was not until 1860 that Fort Worth was officially named the county seat, that designation having been transferred from Birdville (Webb 1952:708). Settlers, however, had been steadily arriving in the county during those 20 years. Many came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although only 160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57). AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 12 RESEARCH DESIGN AND QUESTIONS The following discussion outlines the general research issues which directed the investigations at sites 41 TRI 62 and 164. Specific data collected during the investigations were used to organize and direct the discussions of the research issues outlined below. Chronological control bears directly on the placing the occupation(s) in time and being able to relate one to the other. This was critical to relating occupation to the broad framework of the regional contextual framework, particularly as it relates to datable geological and climatological events. It was anticipated that the horizons represent one time or short-term occupations which might allow for comparison of similar contextual events. It is also likely that temporally-diagnostic artifacts were going to be scarce, and dating would have to be done using radiometric techniques, which complemented the geomorphological assessment. Paleoenvironmental issues focused on placing natural occurrences and human activities at the sites in a relationship that could be understood with regard to the different contexts. Understanding paleoenvironmental contexts [including climate, hydrology, local plant and animal resources] provides insights into subsistence and societal maintenance opportunities and constraints. These insights provide an interpretative context for the archaeological remains, as well as a basis for interpretation of the human selection of available plant and animal resources. An understanding of different prehistoric activities may be directly derived from features and artifacts, along with the plant and animal remains recovered. These data were important, since it was anticipated that occupation was on a seasonal basis and from this we anticipated reconstructing scheduling ventures to the West Fork floodplain, selection of site locations, and population size projections. Technological issues were primarily concerned with the knowledge, methods, and techniques involved in the gathering of natural resources, and subsequent manufacture, processing, use, and discard of tools or debris. In this light, it was important to collect sufficient samples of tools and debris in order to pinpoint work, living, and discard areas within the sites, and to have adequate information for intersite comparisons, and also between these occupations and those outside of the project area. Along with the manufacturing stages of converting raw resources into usable materials reflected in the broken and discarded tools, food stuffs, and debris, the tool kits used to process these locally obtained resources were of particular importance. The interrelationships of the tools and discarded debris were most easily understood, if the excavation and analyses focused on specific kinds of activities including stone tool processes, animal (mammals, fish, birds, and mussels) processing, and the processing of plants. Intra-site patterns concern task or activity organization and social arrangements on an occupation surface as interpreted from the patterns of artifact use and discard on that AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 13 surface. It is for this reason that additional trench excavations, as suggested by the Texas Historical Commission, searched for occupation surfaces that represented short-term occupations. Likewise, the selection of deposits representing brief occupations allowed for the definition of the unique activities present in the deposits in the West Fork floodplain. While we excavated through overlying deposits of aggrading sediments, it was our expectation that distinct occupation surfaces would be isolatable. Such surfaces were defined at the River Bend site upstream (Peter 1987), but were delimited horizontally. While monitoring the Central Wastewater Treatment Plant in Dallas, we observed distinct surfaces marked by shell concentrations being exposed by heavy equipment (Skinner and Whorton 1995a). Social organizational issues are definitely more intangible that other research issues. Included in these issues are the number of individuals in a group, and age/gender composition of a site's inhabitants as may be reflected by maintenance activities, and intracultural relationships as reflected by the presence and sources of exotic goods. The presence of exotic materials may allow inferences about trade networks and limits of societal maintenance areas. The following hypotheses guided the field investigations, artifact analyses, and site interpretations: It was hypothesized that the individual occupations at sites 41 TR 162 and 164 represented short-term occupations at campsites located in the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity River for the primary purpose of gathering [harvesting?] seasonally available food resources between the late spring and the end of the summer. The most prominent food resource at these sites was freshwater mussels, while at the same time, the family groups that occupied the camps gathered other riverine/floodplain plant and animal resources. The site functions were decidedly different from the River Bend site (4 1 TR68) where the number of pieces of fire cracked rock almost equals that of mussel shells, although the artifact assemblages and occupation periods appeared to be about the same (Peter 1987). Hunting within the floodplain was practiced and forays out of the valley to hunt on the prairie also occurred. At the times of occupation [there are at least 2 occupation zones at 41TR164, and an aggrading surface at 41 TRI 62 with two zones present], the meander just to the south of both sites was the active channel of the West Fork. It was further hypothesized that the regional climate changed between the earlier occupation at 41 TRI 64 and the more recent occupations at both sites. It was anticipated that the early occupation at 41 TRl 64 occurred between 2000 BC and AD 1, and was associated with a climate and biotic community comparable to modem times, while during the first millennium AD there was increased moisture in the Upper Trinity River Basin (Perring 1987:44; Hall 1988), but with a return to a modem climatic AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 14 regime during the past thousand years (Prikry I 1993: 191; Collins and Bousman 1993:58; Dillehay 1974; Lynott 1979). The bolded topics are discussed below with regard to expectations that guided methodology and analyses which are subsequently presented. short term occupation at camps 1. short-term occupation will be reflected by restricted areas and thin occupation surfaces on which limited artifact assemblages, i.e. little trash accumulation and ephemeral residential features such as stone-lined hearths, will be uncovered. It was not anticipated that trash dumps such as at the Aiken site on the Brazos River (Skinner 1971 :208-227) would be found, but that shell accumulations and possibly associated hearth features such as observed at the Central Wastewater Plant and in the banks of the East Fork and the Trinity River, would be found (Richner 1976; Richner and Bagot 1978; Ferring 1986). 2. Repeated reoccupation would be shown by the presence of overlying and overlapping occupation surfaces. 3. Tool assemblages for occupation surfaces would contain little evidence of tool manufacture or repair, and would be dominated by discarded tool fragments and expedient flake tools. Hammerstones, grinding tools, and typological chipped stone tools were likely to be absent. 4. The presence of developed middens was not anticipated at these short-term camp occupation surfaces. primary site function was gathering freshwater mussels 1. In terms of numbers of individuals (MNI), the protein/meat value, and assemblage volume for each occupation surface, mussels would be the most prominent animal meat, ie, they were a food staple at some time of the year (Claassen 1986), although they were a supplemental food at other times of the year. 2. Other riverine resources, specifically fish and turtles, would be present, but would be less prominent than mussels. We also wished to determine which animals were present in the landscape, but apparently were not utilized at these sites. 3. Small mammals would be represented by relatively complete skeletons, while larger mammals [d eer and bison] would be represented by specific meat cuts that reflect distance to the kill/butchering sites and meat selection as noted at the River Bend site (Peter 1987:23). Marrow extraction, as reflected in bone breakage, may provide a measure of occupation permanence, or lack thereof, when compared to samples from other excavated floodplain sites on Mountain Creek, such as Baggett Branch. We are unaware of any circumstances where this has been done, but expect that if occupation was very brief that marrow may have been extracted only incidentally, and might result in the presence of larger bone fragments. It was anticipated that evidence if specific animal selection would not be found, due to the convenient appropriation of whatever made itself available. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 15 4. Plant remains, particularly walnuts and pecans, were likely to have been harvested in the fall at these sites, although it is possible that mast harvesting was done at different times of the year than when the mussels were collected, and might have been done as a day foraging activity from more permanent seasonal camps or base camps located away from the river channel in the uplands or along tributaries. 5. Intra-site features would include stone-lined hearths or possibly burned clay and ash/charcoal which mark the locations of unprepared fireplaces [hearths] surrounded by small accumulations of discarded mussel shells and fire-cracked rock. 6. Seasonality [late spring and all summer] would be reflected independently in the growth histories of animals found, and by nut shells, and possibly other plants, possibly by mussel growth rings, and by the sedimentary history of the occupation surfaces. It was anticipated that floral and faunal materials, sealed in features by subsequent flooding/silting, would provide seasonal information as was done at the Baggett Branch site on a broader scale. It has been suggested that the mussels were collected along Mountain Creek and the Trinity during the late spring and summer (Martin 1988:335, 337, 338, and 348), but this has not been confirmed for sites on the mainstem of the Trinity. 7. It was anticipated that there would be a decrease in mussel shell size over time that was due to the increased harvesting of mussels resulting from population increase and the resulting shortening of animal life longevity as the prehistoric Native American population continued to grow. This shell size decrease over time has been observed in shells at contemporaneous sites in Kansas (Mandell, personal communication with C. Caran), but to our knowledge has not been quantified in Texas. family groups 1. It was anticipated that trenching and subsequent block excavation would locate and uncover occupation surfaces which would be definable on the basis of artifact litter surrounding central hearths or fire locations. These areas would be related to ethnographic examples of modem hunting and gathering groups which occupy small task/living areas where single or extended family groups occupied seasonal or expediency camp sites (Wiessner 1974; Binford 1980). 2. It was anticipated that a variety of food acquiring activities, both gathering and hunting, would be reflected in the floral and faunal assemblages recovered from normal screening and fine (water) screening and from flotation of sediments from the sites. This would be a reflection of maintenance multi-tasking conducted by family groups, rather than task-specific male or female groups. This pattern can be inferred from the River Bend, First Street Bridge, 41 TRI 19, and Baggett Branch sites. active meander I. It was anticipated that the geomorphological analysis in the upper part of the site at 41 TRI 62 would be able to demonstrate on the basis of alluviation and sediment size, that the now cutoff meander was active at the times of occupation and was carrying a bed load AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 16 similar to that of the West Fork today. This was important because the sites are oriented parallel to and are closer to the meander than they are to the present river channel, which is where Ferring's River Legacy Park sites (1994) and the River Bend site are located. 2. It was further anticipated that there would be similarities between the alluviation at the two sites, and that increased deposition would be demonstrated between the lower occupation in 41TR164 and the upper occupation there, and the occupations in 162, due to the moister period attributed to the region by Ferring (1987:44) and by Hall (1988) between AD 1 and 1,000, and accepted by most regional researchers. 3. It was anticipated that radiocarbon dates from sealed archaeological contexts would provide a temporal framework for relating the sedimentary histories to the different occupations uncovered, and to the changing environment. regional climatic change 1. It was anticipated that a dated sedimentary history of the sites' sediments would allow evaluation of the presently very general description of the climatic changes and associated sediments. This was important because at present the West Fork Paleosol spans a period of more than 1,500 years and is not a temporally limited horizon marker. Moreover, too frequently every undated and buried soil in the area has casually been called the West Fork Paleosol. 2. It was anticipated, based on the Joe Pool Lake excavations (Martin 1988:348), and regional environmental reconstructions, that the plant and animal remains recovered from feature contexts attributed to the early and more recent occupations would reflect similar natural environments, unless occupations between AD 1-1000 are uncovered and show differences in the geomorphology, site deposits, and environmental reconstruction. 3. If there was an increase in moisture between AD 1 and 1000 as indicated by Hall (1988), then the oak savannah may have become a true oak woodland which would have supported an increased mast yield for both the prehistoric Native Americans and the animals which they hunted. 4. It was anticipated that bison bones corresponding to Dillehay's bison presence periods, at least his last one, would occur with the upper occupation horizons, but would not be found during the earlier time period that was a more moist environment.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 17 METHODOLOGY During the survey, the limits of the two sites had been defined horizontally and vertically within the pipeline corridor (Skinner and Caran 1997). Site 41TR162 had been defined vertically with the use of three backhoe trenches and a series [31] of bucket auger holes. A buried deposit was defined buried under 30 cm of sterile clay and extending to a depth of possibly a meter. The auger holes also served to define the apparent horizontal extent of the buried deposit. A single test pit was excavated in order to quantify the types of artifacts that were present. Based on the apparent high number of mussel shells, the low number of animal bones, and the virtual absence of lithics, it was concluded that the site represented brief occupations of the floodplain for the purpose of harvesting freshwater mussels. No features were noted in the tests at site 41 TRl 62 and no temporally diagnostic artifacts were found during the survey. In contrast, site 41 TRl 64 was defined using eight backhoe trenches since the major evidence of occupation was a shell lens encountered two and a half meters below the present ground surface. A shallower [1.3-1.5 m below the present ground surface] and very diffuse occupation horizon, represented primarily by a stone-lined hearth, was recognized in a backhoe trench but primarily outside the pipeline corridor. The geomorphology of the deeper deposit at site 41 TR164 indicated that occupation was earlier than that at site 41 TRl 62, and it was determined that testing the deeply buried deposit and having the soil and shells from the deep horizon radiocarbon dated were important to understanding the archaeology of the West Fork floodplain. Our focus was directed to gathering contextual data from the lower horizon at site 41 TRl 64 because it was expected to be a deposit that was left when the now abandoned meander channel was active. These data were to be compared to the upper and major occupation horizon at site 41 TRl 62, ~hich may have been deposited when the meander was still active, but several hundred or thousand years later. In addition, it was planned to uncover an upper occupation surface at 41 TRl 64, as it certainly postdates the early occupation and might be contemporaneous with 41 TRl 62, but was considered to represent a set of tasks different from those represented by shell-lenses based on the absence of mussel shells in the profile and the presence of a single mano fragment from the backdirt. Excavation at both sites was aided by the mechanical removal of sterile overburden, this was done using a backhoe and operator provided by the City of Arlington. Vertical and horizontal control was maintained using the alignment centerline markers. Hand excavation was done using units that are 1 by 1 m in size and using a combination of natural and arbitrary 10 cm levels. Excavated matrix was screened through 1/4" (6.25 mm) mesh, except when selected samples were washed through fine window screen. These techniques were used to recover micro-debris, seeds, nuts, and faunal fragments, AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 18 and it was anticipated that they would be used m conjunction with excavation of occupation surfaces and cultural features. Site mapping was conducted by a team from Veselka Engineering Consultants, Inc. which used a total data station to map the site. A base map was prepared at the beginning of the field investigation, and was then updated just before the completion of the investigation. At site 41 TR162, additional backhoe trenches were excavated before hand excavation was conducted. It was anticipated that this would locate areas which would then be opened up as blocks. It was planned to clear 20 to 30 square meters of occupation surface within the site, since this would expose the limits of several occupation areas similar to those noted at the Baggett Branch site at Joe Pool Lake and the Aiken site at Lake Granbury. Although the pipeline right-of-way confined the limits of excavation, good results were obtained from an even narrower corridor at the Rush site in Tom Green County (Quigg and Peck 1995). At site 41 TRI 64, an excavation approximately four meters square was to be centered over the deeply buried shell lens exposed during initial testing. Besides the mapping of the occupation surface and the recovery of cultural materials, samples were to be collected for dating the sediments using soil humates, shell organics, and carbonate organics. This would have allowed for the comparison of humate dates. A block excavation was excavated to sample the upper, and more recent, occupation zone at the site. We expected this block to be four to five meters square, depending upon the results of clearing. The artifact samples resulting from these excavations were expected to include large numbers of mussel and snail shells [200 to 300 per cubic meter], along with significantly smaller numbers of animal bones and fire-cracked rock. We expected to find no more than two pieces of lithic debris and chipped/pecked/ground stone tools per cubic meter based on the testing at 41TR162 (Skinner and Caran 1997:Table 6), Peter's work at the River Bend site (1987), and Ellis' ( 1998) recent testing near Metro vest just east of Highway 157. Using Joe Pool Lake as an example, plant remains were likely to be scarce, but animal bone was to be expected in well-preserved condition. Datable organic materials from reliable contexts should be present and features should be found by further testing at 41 TRl 62 and 164. An important part of this investigation was the involvement of the general public in the field investigation. During the testing phase of the survey, there was considerable interest in the presence, age, and significance of the sites shown by the many Arlington residents who use the river-edge trail through River Legacy Park for exercise. The public had already been notified by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and the Arlington paper that the excavation was going to occur. Likewise, we had advised members of the Tarrant and Dallas Archeological Societies of the investigation. We invited members of the general public and interested avocational archaeologists to assist our field crew in the excavation. This included limited excavation and concentrated on the screening of materials. Our AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 19 desire was to allow the general public to become fully involved and informed about the fieldwork and to understand just why the work was being done. We coordinated with the Living History Museum at River Legacy Park, and increased their exposure to the wider community. Much of the volunteer work was done on the weekends. In addition, we gave a guided tour of the site to interested people when requested. Because the City of Arlington was paying for this investigation, we wanted residents to be aware of it and to support it. All recovered material was bagged and labeled by unit and level provenience. A small label with provenience data was placed in each zip lock bag. Artifacts recovered in situ were piece plotted and bagged individually. Features were recorded on Feature Forms along with profiles and photographs. Bulk matrix samples of seven to nine liters were collected from each feature for flotation. Similar samples were collected from individual excavation levels. Collected cultural materials were initially washed and labeled. Some materials such as stone tools, ceramics, and burned rock were not initially washed in order to allow for analysis of residues that might be present and might be washed off and also to prevent the creation of wear caused by brushing. Besides providing basic descriptive data for intra site and inter-site comparisons, the analysis procedures provided information directly relevant to the research questions outlined above. Dating: We anticipated preparing charcoal, organic materials, and sediments for radiocarbon dating. Samples were prepared by S. Christopher Caran (Caran and others 1995) as well as at the Illinois Geological Survey. Dating was done at the Illinois Geological Survey and at Beta Analytical, Inc. since The University of Texas Radiocarbon Lab was closed soon after the samples had been prepared. We expected to date the major cultural horizons by collecting samples from sealed features and individual occupation surfaces, as well as dating the geologic sequence, most specifically to contribute to a better understanding of the West Fork Paleosol. Water-screened Analysis: Bulk matrix samples from individual features and all other proveniences were water-screened and the resulting light and heavy fractions allowed to dry. After drying, we sorted the matrices into appropriate analytical categories. Macrobotanical Analysis: Individual chunks of charcoal from reliable contexts were submitted for identification to Dr. Heather Trigg. Seeds and nuts were not recovered from any reliable contexts and were not found in the flotation samples. Faunal Analysis: The entire vertebrate faunal assemblage was examined to identify specific taxa or general taxa size, morphological element, element part, skeletal maturity, evidence of burning, human modification, and various other observations, including meat weight and animal processing patterns. Fragmented bones were classed into different size categories. Freshwater mussel shells were identified and information regarding mussel type, size, meat potential, breakage, opening techniques, and natural environment was collected. Gastropods were also studied. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 20 Burned Rock Analysis: After being washed, rocks were recorded and observations made about size, material, fracturing, and residue staining. We were not optimistic about finding organic residues on the rocks. Likewise, we did not expect that chemical analyses would yield meaningful information. Stone Artifact Analysis: Stone tools were separated from lithic debris as the first step in the analysis. Tools were categorized using formal tool types and were individually analyzed. Raw material is one of many variables that was recorded as a means of linking the floodplain occupations to upland or tributary sites in the surrounding area. Lithic debris analysis separated cores from flakes/blades, shatter/chunks, and heat spalls. The terms primary, secondary, and tertiary [interior] flakes were used to evaluate the reduction process. Breakage and debris size were recorded. We expected that chipped, pecked, groundstone tools will be scarce based on the results of previous surveys and testing at similar sites in the Upper Trinity Basin. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 21 RESULTS The following chapter begins by presenting a brief review of historic use of the River Legacy Park area. This is followed by sections which describe each of the archaeological sites investigated. The site descriptions include an initial evaluation, the excavation procedure, artifact descriptions, and an overall summary of each site. The sites are placed in a local and regional context in the following chapter. Historic Landuse Overview Sam Street's map of Tarrant County (1895) does not show any residences in the park area, nor does it show any roads that cross through the immediate area. Based on the large landholdings, it is likely that the tracts were primarily farmland. The section of the Loving tract on the south side of the West Fork coincides with River Legacy Park and probably was not cleared due to difficult access from the Loving house across the river. The 1924 Tarrant County soils map includes all of the park within the Trinity clay (U. S. Department of Agriculture 1924). Landuse is not mapped, but the absence of roads in the park area suggests that residences were not present and that parts of the land were probably being farmed. These early historic maps indicate that the pipeline route and more specifically the park had not been significantly disturbed prior to the mid-1920s. The Euless and Hurst, TX 7.5' USGS maps were prepared using aerial photographs flown in the mid-l 950s. These show that much of the land was farmland, but that an area immediately to the northwest of the east end of the pipeline route had been mined for gravel. As before, no residences were present nor do roadways pass through the study area. The 1981 USGS map updates indicate that gravel mining had continued and that wastewater lagoons and the wastewater treatment plant had been built. The area that now includes River Legacy Park as well as a narrow strip of land along the north side of the river are mapped as being wooded. The recent soil survey book (Ressel 1981 :Map 32) shows a roadway through the park area that connects with an abandoned railroad spur bridge (Rudy 1997) that once crossed the West Fork. The roadway, railroad, and bridge are east of the pipeline's river crossing. Gravel was moved over the bridge from pits south of the river to the main railroad north of the river and out of the floodplain. The railroad does not show on either USGS map; it probably was used and then abandoned between the mid-l 950s and late 1970s. Historically, landuse in the park area has not changed significantly over the years, except that gravel mining south of River Legacy Park disturbed a section of the floodplain that had been farmed for years. Most of River Legacy Park was never farmed, rather it is an essentially unmodified remnant bottomland forest. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 22 Site Descriptions The following section presents a description of findings at the Rough Green site and at site 41 TRI 64. Each site description begins with a brief summary of the findings at the site during testing, and then continues with the results of excavation. Artifact descriptions are contained as part of the individual site description. The summary of the prehistoric site findings is contained in the last section of the chapter. Rough Green Site (41TR162) Site 41 TRI 62 is an accumulation of prehistoric refuse, i.e., a "midden" deposit, contained in the dark brown to black clays that are deposited by the annual flooding of the West Fork of the Trinity River at River Legacy Park. The site area is roughly oblong in shape and is bisected by the 100' wide pipeline corridor (Figure 3). The top of the deposit was first exposed in the walls of three backhoe trenches (TT5-7 on the figure) from 30 to 52 cm below the present ground surface. Subsequent augering of the dense clay soils defined the apparent horizontal and vertical limits of the site deposit which is roughly 130 m long as it parallels the pipeline route. The horizontal limit of the buried deposit is beyond the / 41TR162 / * . TT6 * 0 8 I__J m Figure 3.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 23 west edge of the corridor and generally ten to fifteen meters east of the centerline based on the negative shovel tests shown on the figure. Augering revealed that mussel and snail shells are the most prominent artifact class, but were accompanied by well-preserved deer, bison, and turtle bones, along with a few pieces of lithic debris and fire-cracked rock between 40 to 90 cm below the present ground surface (Skinner and Caran 1997 :21- 31 ). Two occupation zones were apparent in the profile (Figure 4) and are reflected in the artifact densities from a single lxlm test pit (Figure 3). A dense zone extends from approximately 40 cm to 60 cm, and there is a dispersed zone apparent between 75 and 80 cm. Both zones were considered to be examples of Upper Trinity River shell-lens sites (Skinner 1993) based on the abundance of mussel and snail shells along with the limited presence of animal bone, fire-cracked rock, and lithic debris. Small pieces of burned clay also were found throughout the deposit. Site excavation was initiated by the excavation of five backhoe trenches that spanned the width of the pipeline corridor and were numbered from southwest to northeast (Figure 5). A sixth short trench was excavated to explore for an expected buried deposit that had been projected based on auger testing; this proved not to be a factor. The trenches were excavated to depths below the base of the buried prehistoric deposit. Definition of the base of the deposit was facilitated by the presence of mussel shell and fire-cracked rock that were observed in the trench walls. Based on the observation of artifact concentrations in the trench walls, three areas were designated as block study areas. The sterile overlying fill in each of these areas was then removed by the backhoe in order to facilitate excavation of the cultural deposits in each of the block areas. The site was mapped and control points were installed in order to provide vertical and horizontal control within the site area. During the course of trench excavation, the field crew encountered several Rough Green snakes (Opheodrys aestivus), and it is for these reptiles that the site was named. Subsequent investigation also located numerous small copperhead snakes in the area surrounding the site. The trenches complemented the information uncovered during site testing. Three of the trench profiles are illustrated as Figure 6. As shown in the profiles, the ground surface is generally level the width of the pipeline and the site area from south to north. There are no distinct elevation changes in the site area that is located within the pipeline corridor where almost all investigations were confined. It should also be noted that Test Trench 5 had been excavated between the concrete trail and the river bank and no further testing was done in this area. It should further be noted that the site deposit appeared to be oriented in a perpendicular manner to the flow of the West Fork but to be parallel to the toe of the bank and the associated abandoned channel shown on Figure 5.

Profiles of the north walls of Trenches 1, 3, and 5. Horizon II is the major zone containing evidence of prehistoric occupation. The upper zone (Horizon I) in each of the trenches is a very dark grayish brown (1 0YR3/2) loamy silty clay. The zone ranged from 20 to 30 cm in thickness and was generally devoid of cultural materials. As revealed in Test Trench 5 (Figure 4), this zone extended to a depth of 52 cm and was also devoid of cultural materials. It appears that the site deposit was dropping off the end of the low ridge that was parallel to the abandoned channel. The main occupation bearing zone (Horizon II) extends from the base of Horizon I to the top of Horizon III; this is a thickness of 30 to 60 cm and equates with the BAlbl horizon described in Test Trench 5. This is a black (I0YR2/I) clay that is moderate fine subangular blocky. Bivalve and snail shells are prominent, along with bone fragments, burned clay, fire-cracked rock, and occasional chipped stone artifacts. Horizon II varies in thickness in each of the trenches, but the difference in thickness does not appear to correlate with intensity of occupation or any recognized difference in occupation throughout the site.

This horizon was deeper in Test Trench 5, but in all instances the filaments mark the base of the culture bearing deposit as indicated by the presence of Horizon IV at the base of the eastern end of Trench 3. An area in the center of Trench 3 was not excavated once it was determined that mussel shells appeared to be concentrated in that area, but subsequent exploration of the surrounding area did not reveal any concentration. The adjacent units in the north wall of Trench 3 are noted on Figure 6. Excavation in Block 1 was concentrated in eight 1x 1m units, five are on the north side of the trench and three are on the south side (Figures 7-8). No occupation surfaces were recognized in any of the test units, and although the deposit contained artifacts from 20 to 70/80 cm below the datum, no distinct artifact horizon was noted on the basis of soil color, feature origin, or artifact association (Table 1).

River Legacy Park Archaeology 30 Unit 8 and an unfinished, probably comer-notched, arrow point was also found in the same horizon in Unit 3. Three Scallorn arrow points were found in the 40-50 levels of Units 2 and 5, but also at the same level as two Gary dart points and an untyped dart point. A few other chipped, pecked, and ground stone tools were recovered between 40- 50 cm and 60-70 cm in various units within Block 1. Inspection of Table 1 also shows that the densest concentration of lithic debris, fire-cracked rock, bu.med clay, animal bone, and mussel shell is with the 20 cm from 40 to 60 cm, although Unit 8 has a high fire-cracked rock count in the 60-80 cm level. Wood charcoal flecks and occasional chunks were found throughout the matrix of Horizon II in Block 1, but no concentration of charcoal was recognized and no charcoal was found directly with any features. A charcoal sample collected from between 50-60 cm in Unit 1 yielded a oC13 corrected date of 1330±60 BP (Beta-136242) that converts to a calibrated date of CAL AD 675 (CAL AD 655-760). See Appendix C for more information about the Beta dates. This appears to date the early occupation at the site based on the presence of dart points and shell tempered pottery above the sample. A probable stone-lined hearth (Feature 1) had been exposed in the north wall of Trench 3 in the area designated as Unit 8 between 60-70 cm. A slab-lined hearth was the only recognizable feature (Figure 10) uncovered in Block 1 and is represented by essentially the north edge of the hearth, since the majority of the hearth was apparently removed during the trench excavation. The hearth rocks include primarily sandstone chunks and fragments and although formed into the concentrations shown on the figure, they present a level surface and do not form the edge of a basin. Two pieces of a single broken large mammal bone fragment are the only artifacts found on the same level as the rock. Test Unit 9(unexcavated) 0 10 +- Trench 3 -+ 1...-.....J cm Figure 10.

River legacy Park Arc/raeology 31 Block 2 was located near the northwestern end of Trench 4. No features were found in the single unit and testing revealed that the density of artifacts was significantly lower than in Block 1. Further evaluation of the scraped surface of the cleared block area did not reveal any features and excavation was discontinued with the single unit. Cultural material density (Table 2) was lower than that found in the Block 1 units and the only level with a high density was 50-60 where five pieces of lithic debris, 29 pieces of fire-cracked rock, 3 I 4 pieces of burned clay, and thirteen pieces of bone were recovered. Bone was more than five times as abundant in the 60-70 cm level, although no lithic debris, half the number of fire-cracked rocks, and about twenty percent the number of fired clay pieces were present. No temporally sensitive artifacts were found in Unit 1 or in the cleared area. Block 3 was placed near the northwestern end of Trench 3 and was initially explored with units 1-3 shown on Figures 7 and 9. Cultural materials (Table 2) are concentrated between 40-80, but continue below 80 cm in Unit 3 where a post hole was uncovered (Figure 11). Charcoal from units 1-3 include pecan (Carya illinoinensis), white oak (Quercus macro-carpa), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), and sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) The post hole was first encountered at 76 cm below the datum and was recognized as an eight by ten cm oval filled with strong brown (7.5YR5/6) clay matrix. This was surrounded by a ring of black (1 OYR2/1) clay matrix. The post hole was nineteen cm in diameter and 42 cm deep. There is a sharp interface between the matrix in the hole and the subsoil into which the post hole had been excavated. There was a significant amount of burned clay in the top of the post hole and the burned clay dropped off to the base of the hole. No evidence of a post was found in the fill of the hole and the generally black matrix contained some artifacts and charcoal. The area surrounding the apparent top of the post hole was meticulously troweled, but no floor or occupation surface was apparent. Based on finding the post hole and with a vertically stratified sample from units 1-3, it was decided to expand the cleared area and to excavate to the apparent level of the posthole in order to explore for additional post holes with the anticipation of defining a residential or work structure. Using information from post hole patterns recorded at Cobb-Pool, Butler Hole, and site 41DN79, the surrounding area was cleared. Unfortunately, no further post holes were uncovered within two to three meters of the post hole in Unit 3, although we were confident that they would have been encountered had they been present. A localized concentration of burned clay, FCR, and bone fragments was exposed in the floor of Units 14 and 15 between 68 and 72 cm, and extended into the northern wall of the units (Figure 7). Troweling revealed the concentration to be a thin (1-2 cm) sheet of burned clay measuring 20 cm square. The concentration was surrounded by an area of discolored soil. No stone tools were found in association with this surface, but a sample of burned clay was recovered along with lithic debris and a single piece of bone. A concentration of burned clay was found in Unit 17 (Figure 7) at the same depth as the concentration in Units 14 and 15. The concentration included an estimated 1000+ pieces of burned clay; the majority of which are less than one centimeter in size and are blackened. Four pieces contain twig and leaf impressions. It is possible that this concentration was associated with the hearth found in the adjacent Unit 24. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 34 of unburned mussel shells was lying directly above the hearth. The basin was ringed with chunks of limestone as shown on the figure, but there was no evidence that the rocks formed the lining of a basin, but rather appeared to have been raked out of the depressed basin. The soil underlying the hearth did not appear to have been heavily oxidized and was not a prepared hearth basin. A similar hearth has been described from site 41 CO 141 at Lake Ray Roberts (Prikryl and Yates 1987:62-65). The wood charcoal was keyed as winged elm (Ulmus alata), but it is likely that it is cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia) since winged elm does not grown in this area and there is an abundance of cedar elm in the West Fork floodplain. A charcoal sample yielded a radiocarbon date of oC13 520±50 (Beta-136243) [CAL AD 1420 (CAL 1405-1435)]. No temporally sensitive artifacts were found in the hearth, and in fact no pottery or projectile points were recovered from Block 3. The charcoal samples from Features 1 and 2 were collected from approximately the same depth below the present ground surface, and yet the dates are 745 years apart. Without independent evaluation from the geology or associated artifacts, and because they appeared to have been collected from good contexts, we do not have an explanation for this apparent anomaly. The assemblage from Block 2 is similar to that from Block 1, except that no tools and very little lithic debris were recovered. The relative numbers of other discarded artifactual materials are similar, although density appeared to be lower than in Block 1. In addition, no features were located by the single unit exc_avated. Density in Block 3 is also lower than in Block 1. The absence of temporally sensitive stone tools made the presence of the lone post hole, the stains, burned clay concentrations, and the rock-ringed hearth hard to evaluate without extensive radiocarbon dates. Overall, there is a lower density of artifacts in Blocks 2 and 3, although occupation was carried out in both areas. There is a general sense that occupation or the discard of occupational residue was heavier along the eastern edge of the site as reflected by the materials in Block 1. Although outside the pipeline corridor, we had the backhoe operator continue Trench 3 southeast and then south to the top of the bank of the cutoff meander. The profile of this trench extension is shown as Figure 13. There is a slight drop in elevation between the north and south end of the trench, but it is not significant in this distance that is just over 20 m long. The upper horizon (I) is a thin zone of very dark gray loamy silty clay that is devoid of cultural materials. Horizon II mirrors that recorded elsewhere throughout the site. At least two stone-lined hearths were encountered in the trench wall as were several mussel-shell concentrations. A possible pit was noted in the profile. Excavation of this trench demonstrated that the site deposit extended southeast of the edge of the pipeline and continued to the edge of the meander cut. No evidence of occupation was found on the slope of the meander, but the leaf and organic cover did not provide a means to see surface artifacts. However, the trench did show that the augering done in conjunction with site definition [s ee Figure 3 herein], was of insufficient rigor to discover the widely scattered artifacts contained in the buried Horizon II. Although investigation outside of the corridor was not possible, the trench shows the lateral extent of the buried deposit. AR Consultants

Trash pit(?) Figure 13. Profile of the east wall of the southeastern extension of Trench 3 showing the undisturbed and buried deposit that extends to the edge of the cutoff meander. In order to explore the cutoff meander as part of our research problem to determine if the meander belonged to the West Fork or one of its tributaries, four auger holes were excavated in a line oriented south from the end of Trench 3 before the extension was excavated (Figure 5). The first hole was excavated near the top of the meander bank. No cultural materials were found in the hole that extended only to 103 cm where it was impossible to continue deeper in the very compact clay. The clay was moist from the surface to 80 cm where it became compact. The clay was a very dark grayish brown (1 0YR3/2) color throughout. Auger holes 2 and 3 were excavated on the north and south edges of the meander base. The upper 40 cm of each hole was a moist, black (1 0YR2/1) clay. Below this is a very dark grayish brown clay with red mottles that contained calcium carbonate filaments and charcoal flecks but no cultural materials. This second layer extended to a depth of 110 cm in the second hole and to 130 in the third hole. The third layer in each hole is a 20 cm thick layer of dark grayish brown (1 0YR4/2) clay that contains light gray ( 10 YR 7/ 2) mottles. These two lower layers are sterile clay subsoils. Auger hole 4 is not shown on the figure but was located 10 m back from the top of the meander bank on the inside of the hairpin curve that is created by the meander. This hole was excavated to a depth of 150 cm and was a sterile, slightly compact very dark gray (10YR3/1) clay. This layer equates with the deposit in the first auger hole and with Horizon III shown below the occupation layer in the Trench III extension (Figure 13). If the trench had been extended down the slope, it is likely that evidence that Horizon II dipped toward the meander. Stone Tools A sample of chipped, pecked, and groundstone tools were recovered from throughout the deposit in Blocks 1 and 3. No tools were recovered from the single unit excavated in Block 2. These specimens are described individually below. The designation contained in brackets [] indicates the block number, ie Bl is Block 1, unit number, and excavation level. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 36 Chipped Stone Tools Dart Points (5) Specimen I [BIU6 40-50) (Figure 14e) This complete Gary point was made on a grainy mottled red quartzite. It weighs 4.7 gr. and measures 36xl9.5x9.0mm. Specimen 2 [BIUI 40-50) This complete Gary point was made using gray quartzite. After manufacture, the point was burned and a heat spall was removed. The dart point weighs 4.2+ gr. and measures 4 l .5x I 8x8.0mm. Specimen 3 [BI U2 50-60) (Figure 14f) This untyped comer-notched dart point was alternatively resharpened on both lateral body edges. This point weighs 2.1 + gr and is made on a tan chert. The specimen measures 31.0x I 8.0x5 .0mm. Specimen 4 [BI U I 40-50) This untyped dart point has a side-notched base and had a wide body. Heat spalls have removed part on one side of the body and part of both faces from this point made on mottled gray fine-grained quartzite. A knot on one face near the base and the absence of later edge retouch indicate that the point was never completed. It weighs 6.3+ gr and measures 38.5x I 8.5+x9.5mm. Specimen 5 [B3 U 13 East wall at 64 cm] This untyped dart point was reworked in order to resharpen it due to previous breakage. The specimen is missing its base and was made on gray chert. It weighs 2.5+ gr. and measures 30.0xl 7.75x6.0mm. Arrow Points (4 ) Specimen l [BIU6 40-50) (Figure 14b) This complete Scallorn point was made on gray chert and is a good example of the type. The point was made on a fine-grained gray quartzite. It weighs 0.8 gr. and measures 20.8xl3.5x3.5mm. Specimen 2 [BI U6 45-50) (Figure 14a) This Scallorn arrow point was made on a fine-grained red quartzite. The tip and mid-section of the body are not present. The incomplete point measures 1.1 + gr. and measures l 8.5x 17 .8x4.5mm. Specimen 3 [BIU2 45) (Figure 14c) This Scallorn arrow point is made on a heat-treated red chert. The point is complete. The point weighs 2.1 gr. and measures 29.5xl7.5x5.0mm. Specimen 4 [BIU3 30-40) (Figure 14d) This specimen is an unfinished comer-notched arrow point made on a tan chert triangular blank which it was impossible to thin near the base where a small knot was created by hinge fractures. The body edges were not finished with secondary retouch and the comer notching was not completed. It weighs 1.4 gr. and measures 29.5x I 7.0x5.0mm. Bifaces (4) Specimen I [BI U3 50-60) This biface of gray chert was broken during manufacture. There is no secondary retouch on the edges. This fragment weighs 1.5+ gr. and measures 34.0x20.0x6.2mm.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 38 Specimen 2 [B 1U 3 50-60] This is the tip of a biface was probably heat treated and was made on a gray chert. It is likely to have been a dart point that was broken during thinning or resharpening. It weighs 1.5+ gr. and measures 14.5xl2.8x4.8mm. Specimen 3 [B1U7 30-40] This is a reworked biface that had a patinated outer surface and the removal of subsequent flakes revealed a darker gray chert. The biface includes variation in the matrices which did not flake uniformly. Specimen weighs 5.6 gr. and measures 39.2xl8x8.5mm. Specimen 4 [B3U13 68] This biface was made of grainy red quartzite which was unable to be thinned and in the process a knot was created on one face. This specimen weighs 21.3 gr. and measures 46.0x27.5x17.0mm. Cores (2) Specimen I [B1U7 30-40] This small piece of chert gravel is covered with cortex on most of the rounded faces. Two unfaceted platforms were used and resulted in hinged fractures, but the removal of no useable flakes or the effective thinning of the cobble. The core weighs 17.7+ gr. and measures 38.5x28.0x15.5mm. Specimen 2 [B 1U3 60-70] (Figure 15a) The cortex was almost completely removed from this grainy quartzite cobble. The core had been thinned bifacially, but the grainy nature of the matrix resulted in hinging on both faces from the unfaceted platforms. The core weighs 65.8 gr. and measures 73.0x41.0x20.0mm. Drill Bit [B 1U 8 30-40] The tip of the narrow bit of a drill was snapped off from the base just above where the bit extends from the wider base. It was made by tan chert and the incomplete specimen weighs 0.2+ gr. It measures 22.0+x9.5 [at the base] x 3.0mm. Graver [B3U3 60-70] A single graver was made on a secondary flake of tan chert which has an unfaceted platform. The graver is located at the junction of two edges and was created by unifacial retouch. The graver weighs 3.5 gr. and measures 3 l .0x3 l .0x6.0mm. Retouched Pieces (4) Specimen I [BI U3 50-60] The distal edge of this secondary flake has unifacial nibbling retouch on the ventral surface. The chert flake has an unfaceted platform and was burned or heat-treated. It weighs 1.1 gr. and measures 15.5x24.5x3.0mm. Specimen 2 [B1U3 40-50] This retouched piece of gray quartzite is roughly triangular in plan shape and is a secondary flake with a faceted platform. It is primarily retouched laterally on the dorsal surface but there are a couple of retouch flake scars on the ventral surface. Although a preform in plan shape, it is too thin to have been bifacially worked, thus it is not an arrow point preform. It weighs 1.2 gr. and measures 29.5xl5.0x4.0mm. Specimen 3 [BI U5 40-50] This retouched piece is on a secondary flake that has an unfaceted platform. The tan chert flake is discontinuously retouched on the left and right lateral edges of the dorsal surface. The specimen is 1.2 gr. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 40 Specimen 4 [83U2 40-50] This interior chip of tan chert is unifacially retouched on the distal end of the dorsal surface. The retouched piece weighs 2.1 gr. and measures 27.2xl6.5x5.7mm. Pecked and Groundstone Tools (8) Hammerstones and fragments of grinding surfaces from two different metates were recovered from excavation and are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Hammerstones (6 ) Specimen I [BI U3 50-60] A large [226.2 gr.] quartzite cobble has light and limited pecking on one lateral edge. This cobble measures 73.0x5 l .0x43.0mm. Specimen 2 [BI U3 70-80] This quartzite cobble hammerstone is represented by a fragment. The edges of the cobble are heavily blunted and rounded. The hammerstone weighs 126.7 gr. and measures 56.0x58.5x34.5mm. Specimen 3 [83U3 80-90] The lateral edges of this roughly cubical-shaped quartzite cobble were heavily smoothed by repeated pecking. Numerous flakes were removed from the faces of the cobble as a result of pecking. The specimen weighs 163.5 gr. and measures 67.2x55.5x36.0mm. Specimen 4 [B3U4 70] A gray quartzite cobble that weighs I 48.2+ was used as a hammerstone. Cortex remains on only a quarter of the cobble and the prominences are dulled. The specimen measures 64.2x46.0x3 l .0mm. Specimen 5 [B3Ul3 83] (Figure15b) This quartzite cobble weighs 128. l gr. and measures 50.0x55.0x30.0mm. About half of the cortex remains. Heavy pecking is present on the point and along a main ridge line on the cobble. Specimen 6 [B3Ul5 30] This cobble retains about sixty percent of the cortex. The interior of the cobble is a red quartzite which was exposed by flake scars from the pecking. The cobble is 304.8 gr. and measures 85.2x75.0x48.5mm. Metate (2) Specimen 1 [B1U4 50-60] This is a small fragment of a single faceted grinding surface from a metate. The metate was manufactured of sandstone. The specimen weighs 62.6+ gr. and measures 92.3 ... x38.rxl3.2+mm. Specimen 2 [BI U6 50-60] This is sandstone fragment is part of a slab or basin metate that had a single grinding surface. The specimen weighs 73.8+ gr. and measures 60Sx48.0. .. x23.0mm. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 41 Ceramics (3) Specimen 1 [B 1U 8 20-30] This body sherd is from a bowl or a bottle which has a very dark gray (1 0YR3/l) scraped but not polished interior surface. The exterior is dark gray (1 0YR4/I) and was scraped but not polished. Based on the presence of the shell temper, the pottery is considered to be Nocona Plain (Krieger 1946: 109-110). The specimen weighs 3.0 gr. and measures 28.0x20.2x5.0mm. Specimen 2 [B 1U 8 30-40] This shell-tempered vessel base sherd is flat in profile and is from a bowl or bottle based on the color difference between the black interior and the brown (I 0YR5/3) exterior. Both surfaces were scraped, but no polishing was found. The piece weighs 4.6 gr. and measures 30.5x20.5x5.5mm. Specimen 3 [B 1U 8 30-40] This small specimen of shell-tempered pottery has a heavily eroded exterior surface and a scraped interior. No polishing was found on this body sherd that weighs 0.9 gr and measures 17.0x13.5x4.0mm. Lithic Debris The sample of lithic debris is described in Table 3 below. The float sample [61 specimens] makes up more than a quarter of the entire sample and its origin from the water-screening is demonstrated by the fact that all the float sample specimens are less than 1.0gr in weight, in fact most are 0.1 or 0.2gr in weight and only 2 pieces weigh 0.3 gr. Nevertheless, the sample consists entirely of small flakes and chips when the pieces of hammerstones and cores are excluded; these larger pieces are those specimens over 5.0gr. As noted elsewhere at sites in the surrounding area, chert is the most common raw material and represents more than three quarters of the lithic debris. However, there is very little evidence of initial tool manufacture as indicated by the small number of primary flakes and chips, the higher numbers of secondary and interior pieces, and the overall low weight of the individual pieces of debris. There are very few pieces that evidence biface thinning and the number of faceted platforms is half the combined unfaceted and cortex platforms. Overall, the lithic debris indicates tool repair and this is reflected in the chipped stone tools which also evidence resharpening of dart points, little biface working, and virtually no cores. The density of lithic debris was higher than predicted in the research design where based on excavation of a single lxl m square we had recovered a single chert flake, but the numbers are consistently low and concur with the judgement that this is not primarily a quarry site or a more permanent campsite where a variety of chipped stone tools were manufactured and reworked. Fire-cracked Rock Fire-cracked (FCR) sandstone and limestone was found throughout the site deposit in all areas and levels. As described above, rock was found in two hearth areas, one in Block 1 and the other in Block 3. Sandstone represents 70.3% of the fire-cracked rock while the remainder is limestone. Although a few large pieces of rock were found during excavation [largest pieces of sandstone are 175 and 203 gr, while limestone is 378 and 444 gr], most pieces are less than 100 grams in weight; in fact, 85-95% of the sample is AR Consultants

Several differences were noted about FCR composition and distribution. Sandstone is the prominent material in Block 1, making up 79.3% of the sample, while in Blocks 2 and 3 sandstone is only 49.4% of the sample. Small [less than 20 gr] pieces of sandstone make up 90% of the sample in Block 1, but· only 79.9% in the other two blocks. These differences may be related to differential heat breakage, stone preferences, available source areas, trail locations, or any number of other possibilities. We do not know if these differences are cultural significant. Although the number of pieces of FCR is high when compared to other artifact classes listed in Tables 1 and 2, the combined sample of excavated rock is less than 25 kgs. and could have been carried across the floodplain to the site in one or two trips by two individuals if they had baskets or other containers in which to carry the rock. Investigation of source areas was conducted by Steve Maxwell of the Sociology and Anthropology Department at The University of Texas at Arlington (1999). It is his conclusion that the rocks at the Rough Green site could have been easily gathered or quarried out of formations that are exposed in the West Fork valley wall south of the site or from later formations [Eagle Ford limestone] that were deflated onto the earlier Woodbine Fm. Therefore, it would be a relatively short distance, less than two kilometers, to carry the rocks from a likely source to the Rough Green site. It would have been an even shorter distance to have secured the rock from similar geological settings on the north side of the West Fork River valley to the north of the Quaternary terrace deposits on which sites T A9 and 41 TR7 0 are located. Certainly, the rocks are imported to the site from the valley walls or possibly active river gravel bars. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 43 Burned Clay A total of 4090 pieces of fired clay was recovered and analyzed. Analysis focused on three categories: size, color, and presence of impressions. Specimens were measured on their long axis and divided into four groups: greater than 3 cm (8), 2-3 cm (172), 1-2 cm (1595), and less than 1 cm (2323). In addition, five bags were selected and average weight per class was noted. Specimens from 2-3 cm averaged 3.8g, specimens 1-2 cm averaged l.0g, while specimens less than 1cm averaged 0.3g. Average weight was 1.7g. The following Munsell colors were noted: very pale brown (IOYR 7/4, IOYR 8/2), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), dark gray (IOYR 4/1), reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6, 7.5YR 8/6, 5YR 6/6), and red (2.5YR 5/8). Very pale brown was the most common color present. Different colors occurred on the same specimen, with one side generally being darker than the other. This is thought to be a factor of differential heat exposure. Specimens with impressions (79) were generally semi-rectangular in shape and exhibited multiple colors. Impressions were of twigs and cedar elm leaves. Twig impressions are not larger than 1.5mm with the average size being 1mm. Initial interpretations are that wet clay was pressed on the outside of a branch-covered shelter. Unfortunately, no conclusive evidence of a shelter was found during excavation, nor did the clay found scattered in the matrix between 30-70 cm in Block 1 and from 30-90 cm in Block 3 help to distinguish other features or living surfaces. However, the widespread occurrence of burned clay throughout the site deposit, but not in the non-cultural sediments outside the site, tends to support the conclusion that the clay was_ used by the prehistoric inhabitants. While it is possible that the clay was burned in conjunction with cooking, it seems more likely that this burned clay is the remains of clay daub that burned after a temporary shelter had been abandoned. This burned clay is similar to that reported from Lake Fork Reservoir (Bruseth and Perttula 1981 :96-98). Burned clay was found in the North Block at the Baggett Branch site (Peter and McGregor I 988:239-241), but no evidence of a structure was found even though the mapped distribution of clay recovered by excavation led to the suggestion that a possibly burned and clay-covered structure might have been present. Shells A large sample of mussel and gastropod shells was recovered from excavations at the Rough Green site. Detailed analysis of these materials is contained in Appendix A. The gastropods, both terrestrial and aquatic, indicate that the prehistoric environment was similar to that found at the site today. The mussels reflect a similar environmental pattern. The mussels probably were gathered during the summer or fall by the prehistoric inhabitants for subsistence purposes. An almost negligible amount of shells were burned; therefore, the mussels were probably steamed or roasted. No shells indicated modification except for the extraction of meat. Over the length of prehistoric occupation, the site residents increased their use of mussels for subsistence until the mussel population declined in both number and size. The decrease in the number and size would increase the time necessary to acquire the mussels, and this may be a reflection of site abandonment. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 44 Animal Bones A well preserved faunal sample was recovered from the site and is described in detail in Appendix B. The bones show considerable breakage, along with weathering and burning. Little evidence of cut marks was found on the bones, and most of the larger mammal bones were broken in order to extract the marrow. The animals that dominate the sample are turtles, deer, cotton rats, and cottontail rabbits. These represent a diverse sample and it appears that hunting, if you can hunt turtles, was not focused on a specific animal. Two bison bones were recovered, although the bones are not from meat producing parts of the animal. The number of individual animals is low, and the low percentage of non-meat carrying bones indicated that the animals were killed off-site and that bones with substantial meat yield were returned from the kill site to Rough Green. The sample does not provide good evidence of the season or seasons of occupation. Water-Screened Sample The materials recovered from water screening have been incorporated into their respective artifact category. For example, the drill bit is from the water-screened sample, as is lithic debris included in Table 3. These materials demonstrate that the samples recovered from screening provided comparable samples, although the water-screened sample provided an increase in the number of small pieces of lithic debris, gastropods, and bone flecks. Unfortunately, the additional charcoal samples did not contain any evidence of edible plant remains, specifically nut shells, and the charcoal is from trees that exist in the surrounding floodplain today. Discussion Excavation of the Rough Green site revealed a buried deposit that is concentrated in 30- 40 cm of sediment buried under the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity River and adjacent to an abandoned meander that is significantly shallower than the present river channel. Although initially estimated to be 60x20/25m in area, trenching has indicated that the site deposit is wider than initially projected and extends 15-20 m southeast to the bank of the cutoff meander. The low number of artifacts in Block 2 and in Units 1-3 in Block 3 tends to confirm the projection that the site deposit does not extend a further distance to the northwest. Certainly, there is no evidence to suggest that this site deposit was oriented perpendicular to the axis of the present West Fork channel, rather that is was utilized as a living area along the bank and on top of the overbank flooding levee adjacent to the now cutoff meander. Testing found no evidence of the West Fork paleosol in the profiles of the trenches or the excavation units, but the radiocarbon dates bracket the time period during which this soil horizon is know to occur. The depositional history of the site indicates that occupation spans a period of slow and then moderate alluviation (Ferring and Yates 1997: Figure AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 45 7.5), and this helps to explain the absence of any clear-cut occupation surfaces being present in the excavated areas. The dates bracket the end of the Late Archaic and the late Late Prehistoric period. Artifacts found in Block 1 (Figure 16) confirm the initial occupation during the end of the Late Archaic based on the presence of a heavily resharpened dart point from 50-60 HORIZON I cm at the same horizon as the AD 675 radiocarbon date (Beta-136242). Likewise, the presence of two Gary dart points and three Scallorn points in the level just above may indicate that these point styles were contemporaneous. Similar patterns have been described at the Bobby D site at Lake 20cm ~---------~ Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997: HORIZON If Figure 10.8), while at the Perry site at 1 shell-tempered sherd Richland/Chambers Reservoir the dart and the arrow points were vertically separated 30 (McGregor 1988: Figure 3). While different stratigraphic interpretations have been 2 shell- offered for the Fountain site (Hanson and tempered sherds K vernes 1997), it would appear that the t , ~, 40 dominance of arrow points, including Alba, Bonham, and Scallorn, which comprise more than seventy-five percent of the arrow point assemblage, supports the conclusion 50 that the major site occupation was during the early Late Prehistoric period. The untyped /;:,_ A.D 675<60 " arrow point from 30-40 cm is similar to Class 5 arrow points from the Sister Grove 60 ~Fe-atur-e 1. - site at Lake Lavon (Lynott 1975: Fig. 340 and p). These points are from a burial pit HORIZON Ill noted as Feature 15 and radiocarbon dated A.D. 1160±90 (Lynott 1975:33). Lynott 70cm '---------------' further notes (1975:51) that these points are similar to points that have been called Catahoula at other East Fork sites. Figure 16. Composite profile of Block 1. The superposition of the shell-tempered pottery tends to confirm patterns from excavated sites at Joe Pool Lake and Lake Ray Roberts where shell-tempered pottery is generally associated with Perdiz, Cliffton, and Washita points and with radiocarbon dates in the period from AD 1300-1600, although at the Cobb-Pool site 18% of the pottery is shell tempered and associated with Alba arrow points. A similar pattern probably occurs at the Fountain site where the few shell-tempered sherds would be expected to be associated AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 46 with a few Perdiz [ 1] and Cliffton [ 1O J points and possibly with the later radiocarbon dates. However, the probable pedoturbation that occurs in terrace sites such as Fountain has apparently mixed the limited late Late Prehistoric artifact assemblage with the more prominent earlier component(s); this presents a challenging opportunity for the archaeologists who are reporting this important multi-year investigation. The few features found in the trench walls and in the excavation blocks indicate that occupations were brief. The hearths are not well-defined stone-lined basins, and the only evidence of below occupation surface features are the lone post mold in Block 3 and the probable pit shown in the eastward extension of Trench 3. Contexts were poor throughout the site for the recovery of sediments from sealed deposits. However, the presence of occupation surfaces at numerous floodplain sites at Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997:47- 199) and at Joe Pool Lake emphasize the potential of excavating blocks in such sites. Even within Block 1 at Rough Green, differing patterns of vertical distribution of artifacts (Table 4) reveals several patterns that reflect changes in site use over time. The most intensive occupation appears to have been during the Late Archaic as represented by the highlighted zones on Table 4. This is particularly apparent when considering that most of the Late Archaic occupation was found between 50-70 cm. While this may in part be attributed to the slow alluviation and pedogenesis of this period, it also may indicate that the site location was more heavily occupied before the Late Prehistoric. A shift in subsistence may also be reflected in the prominence of animal bone during the Late Archaic with a decided decline in animal bones in the upper 30 cm, while freshwater mussels were negligible between 60-70 cm but became prominent between 50-60 and continued to the end of prehistoric occupation. The lower artifact numbers during the Late Prehistoric may be a measure of shorter occupation periods as well as changes in subsistence activities as reflected in the major percentage decreases of animal bones and lithic debris between 20-40 cm. The artifacts recovered from the site reflect a variety of activities with no recognizable concentration on a specific activity. Hunting and mussel shell gathering certainly went on at or near the site, but there is evidence that only select pieces of large mammals were returned to the site. Hunting seems to have been primarily confined within the floodplain, since two bison foot bones are the only evidence of prairie-adapted animals, while the other animals are readily found in the floodplain. Occupation was sufficiently intense to allow time to cook the meat and extract the marrow. Likewise, the absence of chipped stone tools such as scrapers and the low number of retouched pieces indicates that hide processing was probably not a major activity at the site. The lithic debris sample reflects tool maintenance, but not tool manufacture, and yet there are very few biface flakes that indicate biface tool creation. The primary use of chert lithic debris agrees with findings at surrounding sites Joe Pool Lake, Lake Lewisville, and Lake Ray Roberts where the use of cherts from upland gravel shields and possibly regional cherts (Ferring and Yates 1997:29) and demonstrates that the lithic debris sample from Rough Green conforms with the pattern of contemporaneous sites in this part of North-Central Texas. Thus, there is good reason to expect that this site can be effectively incorporated within a regional settlement system at the end of the Late Archaic and in the Late Prehistoric. AR Consultants

Since the rock is broken into small and heavily fractured pieces, it is apparent that it was heated and might have served to line hearth basins or as a heat retaining medium. Discovery of the rock throughout the deposit indicates its continued use through time, but without better contexts than unit levels it is impossible to know how the rock was used or why there are different percentages of sandstone and limestone between Blocks 1 and 3. Mussel shells are prominent throughout the deposit, but were not found in concentrations that might have confirmed that a major activity at the site was the gathering and processing of fresh-water mussels.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 48 must have been a dietary supplement and not a mainstay. The presence of burned clay and the single post hole may be an indication that clay covered above-ground structures were constructed at the site. However, the lack of additional post holes in the area surrounding the lone post hole in Block 3 and the scattered presence of burned clay throughout the aggrading levee fill lead to the conclusion that occupation was brief and may have lasted a few days at a time. Environmental indicators including charcoal, gastropods, animal bones, and leaf impressions on burned clay indicate that the floodplain environment did not change significantly during the occupation period. Although this is the case, no evidence was found of nut preparation in the deposit, so acorn and pecan nut processing could not be confirmed at the site, although charcoal from both trees was found. No good evidence was found of the time or times of year during which the site was regularly occupied. Site 41 TR164 Site 41 TRI 64 is a deeply buried deposit that was exposed near the base of backhoe test trench 8 which was excavated during the site evaluation phase of the project. The trench was located in the apparent center of the site and exposed the major occupation at a depth of 2.5 to 2.8 m (Figure 17). The horizon appeared to be a thin occupation surface that is marked by a layer of discarded freshwater mussel shells. Subsequent trenching served to delimit the extent of the deeply buried deposit, and also isolated an upper occupation zone approximately 1.5 m below the present ground surface. This upper zone contains an occupation surface and a rock-lined hearth that was exposed in backhoe trench 13. The site area covers approximately 25 m north-south by 15 m east-west. The deposit sediments and contents are similar to those at site 41 TRI 62. Caran predicted that the lower deposit might be dated more than 3-4,000 years ago based on the testing and work in adjacent areas (Caran 1990a, 1990b). No temporally sensitive artifacts were recovered during testing, but the preservation of the shells and the isolated occupation zones provided reasons for testing at the site (Figure 18). A two level sloping-sided block was excavated with a backhoe in the area immediately east of backhoe trench 8. The block was five meters wide and 10 meters long (Figure 19). The north half of the block was excavated to a depth of approximately 80 cm below the present ground surface and the southern half of the unit was excavated to a depth of 1.1 m below the upper level to the approximate depth of two meters. The western walls of the block were troweled, but no clear occupation surfaces were visible in the scraped profiles. It should be noted that the block filled with rainwater on several occasions, and although that slowed down excavation, it did not impact the buried deposits. Four additional backhoe trenches [7-10] were excavated within the pipeline corridor and outside the projected limits of the site deposit. These trenches did not locate any additional buried deposits or any evidence of the cutoff meander in the profiles or the backdirt. AR Consultants

Test Units 1 and 2 were excavated in the center of the lower surface and were contiguous 1 m square units. Unit 1 was in the center of the floor and Unit 2 was to the west and closer to the wall of the original test trench [backhoe test trench 8]. The upper 80 cm of Unit 1 matrix was a moist clay that contained scattered mussel umbos which had apparently been rolled and rounded (Todd 1997). The shells were not present at any level or in any place within the unit. Virtually no snail shells were noted. Several pieces of sandstone were contained in this zone, but not in any apparent association with the mussel shell fragments. Small pieces of orange clay were also found in the matrix and natural organic staining [decomposition] were also noted in the matrix. The unit was discontinued at 80 cm and a soil auger was used to excavate to a depth of 1.5 m. The upper zone was a layer of tightly packed light brown clay containing an abundance of calcium carbonate, which transitioned into very tight compact clay and then into a loose sandy clay which had no calcium carbonate. No cultural materials were retrieved from the auger hole in the floor of Unit 1 or from Unit 1. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 53 Test Unit 2 was excavated to a depth of 105 cm below the level of the block floor. The matrix is a moist dark grayish brown (1 0YR4/2) clay throughout the upper 40 cm. Heavily rolled mussel shell umbos are present in this zone but no patterning was apparent. The upper graded into 25 cm of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) clay that was drier and contained flecks of charcoal and calcium carbonate, along with very small snail shell and mussel shell body fragments. An occasional small piece of limestone was found in the matrix, and may have been transported to the site area in the root ball of a tree or in some other natural manner. No evidence of prehistoric occupation was found in this zone. The lowest level is a very dry and compact basal clay that contains some calcium carbonate filaments and is between brown and dark brown in color (10YR4/3). No shells were found in this unit and the clay broke into large peds. Test Unit 3 was placed in the center of the upper surface and was excavated to a depth of 80 cm but without the recovery of any cultural materials. The few mussel and gastropod shells recovered in the black (1 0YR2/1) clay matrix had been broken into small pieces and showed extensive rounding due to water erosion. The excavation of three units in site 41 TRI 64 did not isolate a buried cultural horizon although previous testing had located a rock-lined hearth feature just outside of the construction easement. However, the collection of shell samples from the site did allow for dating of the deposition history as discussed in the following section. Results of Radiocarbon and Carbon Stable-Isotope Analyses at site 41TR164 Artifact recovery efforts are the mo:;t direct means of assessing the distribution and concentration of cultural material in strata within the current project area. There are, however, other indirect indicators of cultural resource potential. The likelihood that artifacts may be preserved in coherent stratigraphic contexts is affected by a site's depositional and post-depositional history, particularly the vertical and horizontal continuity, internal integrity, and age of the deposits. Geomorphic and stratigraphic studies provide insights regarding each of these factors, including relative and approximate numerical age. At most sites, the age of the deposits can also be measured isotopically. Radiocarbon dating can provide a reliable chronology of deposition and pedogenesis, but the analytical results must be evaluated carefully. Radiocarbon and Carbon Stable-Isotope Analyses Excavation and description of the stratigraphic profile at site 41 TRI 64 revealed a variety of potentially datable materials in a series of soil horizons associated with nondiagnostic AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Arcltaeology 54 artifacts (Skinner and Caran 1997). These materials included soil humates, calcareous pedoconcretions, and mollusc shells (mussels). New analytical methods were employed in preparing the humates and pedoconcretions for dating (Table 6). The humate samples were pyrolyzed in an argon (inert) atmosphere, separating them into volatile and nonvolatile components that generally correspond to humic acids and humin, respectively (Jack Liu, unpublished). This approach avoids possible contamination of the samples, which can occur during standard treatment of humates with sodium or potassium hydroxides to extract humic acids, leaving humin as a residue. The volatile and non volatile (residual) components were dated by the liquid scintillation counting technique. The pedoconcretions and shells were processed similarly. Pedoconcretions were dissolved in hydrochloric acid solution, thereby separating the acid-soluble and - insoluble components (see Caran in review; Caran and others 1995; Winsborough and others 1996). The insoluble component includes organic matter trapped during formation of the concretion. This organic residue (kerogen) and the dissolved carbonate (inorganic carbon) components were dated separately by atomic mass spectrometry (AMS). The mollusc shells were dissolved in phosphoric acid solution, yielding carbonate in solution and an insoluble organic laminate known as concheolin (see Gillespie and others 1986). Because the shell sample was small, the amount of concheolin extracted was insufficient for dating, even by the AMS technique. The dissolved carbonate was dated by liquid scintillation. Carbon stable-isotope ratios were determined for each sample, even the concheolin. Table 6 summarizes data concerning the radiocarbon and carbon stable-isotope samples [see Table 7 for dendrocalibrated ages]. It is immediately apparent that the individual components of a single sample may yield discrepant ages. There is also an apparent disparity in the radiocarbon ages of different samples from the same general depth interval and stratigraphic context. For example, the radiocarbon ages (813C-corrected, but uncalibrated) of samples 8-1, 8-2, and 8-5, although from approximately the same depth ± ± (230-268 cm), range from 2018 53 BP to 5100 70 BP. In the absence of other evidence, this wide discrepancy might seem to invalidate these data entirely, or make determination of the "correct" ages impossible. The data do, however, provide some basis for interpretation. When the ages for each sample type are plotted against depth, they are stratigraphically coherent, i.e., they increase with increasing depth (Figure 20). The same trend can be seen when the sample ages are plotted against age (Figure 21 ). This indicates an underlying consistency that counters the seemingly random scatter. Moreover, these figures show that the rate of increase in age with depth is fairly consistent. Figure 22, plotting depth versus age, illustrates the rates more clearly. The dashed trend lines connect samples of the same type at different depths. Solid horizontal lines connect the ages of the two components of each sample (except 8-1, the mollusc shell, for which there is only one dated component). With the exception of the line segments connecting the ages of like components of samples 8-2 and 8-3, the slopes of these lines are very similar, and it is primarily the age of the organic component of sample 8-2 that causes an appreciably deviation. Linear equations of the individual line AR Consultants

Special processing notes: Analyses were performed at the Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS) under the direction of Jack Liu, Assistant Director. Carbonate concretions and mollusc shells were separated from the soil matrix by wet screening and hand picking. Both the concretions and shells were initially rinsed in dilute HCl solution (aqueous) to remove surficial contaminants. The initial supernatant was discarded. The cleaned concretions and shells (treated separately) were then dissolved in concentrated HCl solution (aqueous) and both the supematants and the insoluble residues were collected. Separate samples were prepared from both the acid-soluble and acid-insoluble fractions of the concretions and shells and were dated by the atomic mass spectrometry (AMS) method. Humate samples were initially decalcified in an HCl solution (aqueous). The decalcified humates were then pyrolized in a sealed vessel filled with Ar gas. Pyrolysis produced volatile and nonvolatile (residual) components, which were collected separately. Samples prepared from these components were dated by the liquid-scintillation method.

Low slopes denote great age variation with depth, probably as a result of rapid addition of young carbon. Periods of nondeposition or erosion may also account for discontinuities in the trend lines through the profile, although most of these lines, in aggregate, exhibit fairly consistent slopes. A flood terrace would likely be subject to episodic breaks in deposition and pedogenesis. If sedimentation were continuous and in equilibrium with all other processes, the Y intercepts of the linear equations should equal 0 (Y=0 when X=O). Instead, I YI >0 when X=0. In fact, the Y-intercepts in Figure 22 range from -116.8 to +872.9 cm (absolute values of +105.6 to +872.9 cm). This means that carbon that is older (positive Y intercepts) or younger (negative Y-intercepts) than that required to maintain equilibrium have entered the stratigraphic profile. In a flood-terrace setting like the current project area, old carbon is generally inherited from ancient soils and other sources upstream and higher in the watershed. At the time of its deposition, a bed of sediment is 0 years old; but if it contains an appreciable percentage of ancient carbon, it would yield a pre-modem AR Consultants

Radiocarbon age versus mean sample depth. tion of even small amounts of modern carbon can affect the calculated age significantly, because the young carbon retains so much more of its radiocarbon. Only half the original amount of radiocarbon is present after approximately 5700 years. Intrusion of just a small quantity of new carbon could offset much of the decay occurring over millennia, causing the ·measured ages to be young. These observations can be used to assess the discrepancies among these radiocarbon ages. Analysis of the two components of the humate samples, volatile and non-volatile, is intended to isolate and quantify some of the reservoir and "new carbon" effects. Volatile components consist of organic acids that are light, mobile, and easily translocated through the soil profile. Non-volatile components are the relatively immobile humins, some of which may have been inherited from older carbon sources at the time of AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 60 deposition. In many cases, the age of the non-volatile component is assumed to approximate the time of deposition of the parent material, whereas the age of the volatile component provides an estimate of the time of soil formation. By comparing the radiocarbon ages of these components in a single sample, we can gauge the magnitude of carbon inheritance and overprinting. Table 6 and Figure 20 show that the net age variation is approximately 300 years in sample 8-5 and 600 years in sample 8-6. Compared to the combined l& laboratory deviation of 140 to 150 years, however, mixing appears to be slight to moderate, and it is not clear whether one or both components have been skewed. This question will be addressed again later. The age of the mussel shells is also uncertain. Shells consist of laminates of organic concheolin and inorganic calcium carbonate in mineralic form. Both the concheolin and the carbonate contain carbon, but the sources of the carbon in these materials are usually quite different. Some of the inorganic carbon in the shell may have derived from bicarbonate from ancient limestone that was dissolved in the water, whereas bicarbonate may also form through dissolution of contemporaneous atmospheric carbon dioxide. Carbon in the bicarbonate from limestone may be millions of years old and no longer contains measurable amounts of 14C. This carbon has reached radiocarbon extinction and is said to be "dead." If uncorrected, a radiocarbon assay of shell containing significant amounts of dead carbon would be heavily skewed, yielding a calculated age that was much greater than that of the organism that produced the shell. Unfortunately, it is difficult to know just how much dead carbon was incorporated. Analysis of the organic laminate may yield a more representative age because concheolin is a product of metabolic activity from assimilation of suspended organic nutrients and dissolved atmospheric gases. In this study, the shell sample was too small to yield sufficient concheolin for dating, but the carbonate in the shell was dated. The inorganic components of freshwater mussel shells are generally unsuitable for precision dating, but in some instances may provide a rough indication of true age. Calcareous nodules (pedoconcretions) in soils are yet another two-component material consisting of inorganic carbon in calcium carbonate and organic matter trapped between mineral layers and within individual crystals. As in mollusc shells, calcium carbonate in nodules is precipitated from bicarbonate dissolved in fluids that almost certainly contain a mix of ancient and contemporaneous carbon. Studies designed to determine how much of each component is present have met with mixed success, and nodules are seldom dated. Recently, however, Caran and others (1995) and Winsborough and others (1996) demonstrated that organic matter trapped in travertine, another form of mineralic calcium carbonate, yielded reliable radiocarbon dates. Caran (in review) applied this concept and successfully dated the organic carbon in calcareous nodules. There are, however, many questions that must be considered when dating these materials. Was the organic carbon that is extracted from the nodules originally present in the soil's parent material? If so, was some of that carbon inherited from ancient "reservoir" sources? Or was the organic carbon introduced during pedogenesis, and thus younger than the parent material? Did the nodules form quickly or slowly, continuously or discontinuously, soon or long after deposition of the sediment? AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Arcl,aeology 61 In many instances, answers to these questions can be found by analyzing other materials in the nodules. Microfossils such as pollen, diatoms, phytoliths, and ostracods are often well preserved in nodules, even when they are absent from the bulk of the deposit, and may indicate a change in the environmental conditions from the time of deposition to the time of pedogenesis. Such a change can provide definitive evidence of the time of nodule development. So, too, can the carbon stable-isotope ratio of the organic matter. For example, a change from marsh conditions to dessert would clearly affect the types of plants living locally, and the organic matter from one or the other of those groups may be preserved in the nodules. Isotopic ratios reflect the broad composition of the flora by indicating particular photosynthetic pathways, utilized differentially by various groups. Tropical grasses and many dryland plants employ the C pathway, and their residual 4 organic matter has representative isotopic ratios of -17 to -9 °/ averaging -13 °/ 00, 00 (Boutton 1991 ). Most trees and aquatic plants use the C pathway, yielding isotopic 3 ratios of-32 to -20 °/ averaging -27 °/oo- These ratios are retained in the organic matter 00, trapped in nodules and, thus, provide a record of the source of the carbon that is dated. In the present study, carbon stable-isotope ratios exhibit little variation. Table 6 and Figure 23 show that through most of the profile, isotopic ratios in the organic components ranged from-20.9 to-19.2 °/ although a value of-17.7 °/ was recorded in sample 8-4, 00, 00 the deepest and oldest of the nodules. These values lie intermediate between the ranges of the two main plant groups and probably indicate a mix of organic carbon sources. Organic matter likely derived from both the grasslands present throughout much of the watershed upstream from the project area and the riparian woodland that probably dominated the flood terrace, although the local woodland source predominated. Therefore, most of the trapped organic matter may have been incorporated through pedogenesis under a tree canopy. The isotopic ratios of inorganic carbon in the carbonates ranged from -8.0 to --6.6 °/ probably as a result of mixing carbon from 00, dissolved particles of ancient limestone (0.0 °/ atmospheric carbon dioxide (-7.8 °/ 00), 00), and carbon dioxide produced by decomposition of organic matter in the soil (-22 to -8 0 (Boutton 1991). These values support the conclusion that the soil organic matter /00) probably contained a mix of carbon from C and C sources. The mix was dominated by 3 4 C sources, however, because the observed ratios approach those of soil carbonates in 3 pure C environments, -12 °/ more closely than those of carbonates in pure C 3 00, 4 environments, +2 °/ (Ceding 1984). The carbonates are+ 11.2 to 14.3 °/ more enriched 00 00 than the organic matter in most of the profile and +9. 7 to 11.1 °/ more enriched than the 00 organic matter in sample 8-4. In an environmental setting in which only one vegetation type contributes organic matter to the soil, carbonates are usually enriched by + 15 °/ 00 relative to that vegetation. The high intermediate enrichments noted in the present project area likewise indicate mixed organic sources dominated by C 3• AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 62 Discussion and Conclusions The available data indicate a credible basis for interpreting the suite of radiocarbon ages. The observed intermediate isotopic values for the carbonate in the calcareous nodules indicates that its carbon derived from both organic matter and limestone particles in the soil. The fact that the carbon in the carbonate yields consistently younger radiocarbon ages than the organic matter in the same nodules indicates that accretion of the nodules was an ongoing and possibly active process. In contrast, the organic matter trapped in the nodules must have derived from the soil's parent materi::ds or was stabilized during the early development of the soil. The fact that the organic components of the nodules (with the exception of sample 8-2) are similar in age to the humates at comparable depths, particularly the volatile components, reinforces this conclusion. The volatile components may have derived early in the development of a given soil horizon and remained essentially fixed because of the high clay content, high bulk density, and low transmissivity of the soil. Non-volatile components were probably inherited in part from older carbon sources upstream. Radiocarbon ages of the non-volatile components may, therefore, be a few hundred years older than the deposits themselves. The age of deposits at approximately 380 to 390 cm depth is probably about 5500 BP. These deposits continued to undergo pedogenic modification until 3200 BP. Deposits at 300 cm depth are approximately 5100 years old, and were pedgenically modified until 2800 BP. The actual age of deposits at roughly 2.5 m depth is somewhat more ambiguous. The trend line for organic components of the calcareous nodules in samples 8-3 and 8-4 is very similar to and essentially continuous with that for the volatile components of humate samples 8-6 and 8-5 (Figure 22). This indicates comparable timing and rate of carbon assimilation, which may reflect early post-depositional soil development. Both the organic and inorganic components of sample 8-2, a calcareous nodule, yield significantly younger radiocarbon ages. The trend lines between components of samples 8-3 and 8-2 are nearly parallel, but that for the organic component is somewhat more gradual. This may indicate continued incorporation of organic matter within the nodules. The clear discrepancy in the ages of the humate and nodule components, however, denotes that organic components were translocated through the soil at different times. The nodules developed along root conduits affording enhanced infiltration at depth. The humates in the less permeable matrix remained isolated and are probable relicts of the early pedogenic history of this horizon. Calculated radiocarbon age of the shells (inorganic carbon) in sample 8-1 is comparable to that of the humates at similar depth, particularly the volatile component of sample 8-5. Age of the deposits at 230 to 270 cm is probably about 4800 BP. Soil development continued preferentially in permeable zones until 2000 BP. The organic matter in nodule sample 8-2 was probably trapped about 3600 BP, but accumulation of inorganic carbon within the mineral portion of these nodules continued until about 2000 BP. Overall, deposition of fine-grained mineral sediment at this site appears to have slowed after 4800 BP, but did not cease entirely. Reduced sedimentation allowed a longer period AR Consultants

The high clay content and consequent low permeability of this sediment limited the rate of intrusion, but the addition of organic matter was continual. Eventually, however, the thickness of accumulated sediment, in combination with the limited transmissive capacity of the clayey soil, inhibited further incorporation of both dissolved and particulate humates in a given stratum. Thereafter, the carbon content of that stratum was essentially fixed, and its radiocarbon age would reflect the finite period of organic accumulation through pedogenesis, as well as the age of any inherited (reservoir) organic matter. The minimal disparity between the radiocarbon ages of the volatile and nonvolatile humate components indicates that inheritance was low and the period of pedogenesis was relatively short, despite the evident decline in sedimentation rate. There was, however, another mechanism for selective addition of carbon to the buried soils. Roots and open, vertical root conduits allowed preferential infiltration, and although the bulk of the soil mass was unaffected, that part of the soil in the immediate proximity of the roots and the openings they created would be altered.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 64 dissolved and particulate organic matter entering through the conduits decomposed in situ, generating carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide quickly dissolved in water within the conduits, producing carbonic acid and, as concentrations increased, bicarbonate in solution. Carbon in both the carbonic acid and the bicarbonate was derived from recently living organisms and was therefore, much younger than the organic matter in the surrounding soil matrix at a given depth. Limestone particles in the surrounding soil were leached by the acid, yielding abundant calcium ions and additional bicarbonate, but that bicarbonate contained ancient, dead carbon. The bicarbonate content of the soil water increased significantly. Eventually, the water within the conduit reached saturation in terms of its capacity to retain bicarbonate in solution, and calcium carbonate precipitated from the water as the mineral calcite. The mix of bicarbonate from contemporaneous and ancient sources was thus preserved in the calcite, resulting in an intermediate radiocarbon age (skewed by the high 14C content of the young carbon) and causing its net 613C ratio to lie midway between that of limestone (0.0 °/oo) and the carbon dioxide generated in the soil (nominally -22 to -8 °/oo). The calcite formed a hard, impermeable nodule or concretion within the root conduit. Organic matter (as kerogen) that was present in the conduit, but which had not yet decomposed to carbon dioxide, would have been trapped within the nodule as the calcite precipitated. In this way, the kerogen was isolated from other, younger organic materials translocated through the soil profile at a later time. A nodule might also continue to grow for thousands of years through addition of calcite containing inorganic carbon. The organic material that was preserved initially would, however, remain intact, as was the case in samples 8-3 and 8-4. Yet, it is also possible that additional organic carbon could be trapped as accretion of the nodule continued, as in sample 8-2. The 613C ratio of the organic component of sample 8-2 was the most depleted of all of these samples and, therefore, closest to the expected value of the C vegetation dominating the site during 3 post-depositional soil development. This observation appears to corroborate the finding that the organic component of sample 8-2 includes material added long after deposition of the mineral sediment composing the soil horizon from which the sample was collected. The soil profile at Backhoe Trench 8 was described in detail (Table 5, Figure 18). The upper 192 cm of deposits contain weakly developed soil horizons, whereas those at greater depth exhibit more advanced pedogenic characteristics. All of the radiocarbon and stable-isotope samples were collected between 230 and 393 cm depth, from relatively mature soil horizons (Bkb or Btkb ). The inferred radiocarbon chronology of deposition and soil development at this site is consistent with the degree of horizonation particularly the common, hard, granule- to pebble-size calcareous nodules below 219 cm depth and the argillic horizon below 301 cm depth--based on observations elsewhere in the region (Caran, 1990a, 1990b; Ferring, 1988, 1990). Slow aggradation of the upper part of the profile or even a depositional hiatus may have allowed late intrusion of organic matter through root conduits penetrating the older deposits. This would account for the discrepant radiocarbon ages among samples from the interval from 230 to 268 cm depth (samples 8-1, 8-2, and 8-5). AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 65 The comparison of ages has, thus far, concentrated on the 313C-corrected, but uncalibrated ages. Table 7 lists the dendrocalibrated ages of these samples. Whereas calibration indicates that the corrected ages should be adjusted by -69 to +819 years, the effect on the relative distribution of ages is negligible. Calibration provides a probable absolute radiocarbon chronology, but it cannot address the problems of inheritance and intrusion of organic and inorganic carbon. The previous discussion focuses on these latter problems and largely resolves the discrepancies. Because calibration has little effect on the relative distribution of ages, it is of minimal interest here. The previous discussion defined several chronological benchmarks: 1) strata between 380 and 390 cm depth were deposited about 5500 BP, but were pedogenically modified until 3200 BP; 2) deposits at 300 cm depth accumulated at about 5100 BP and were modified until 2800 BP; and 3) strata at 230 to 270 cm depth were deposited about 4800 BP and modified until 2000 BP. Using the dendrocalibrated ages, the history of the sequence would be adjusted as follows: 1) strata between 380 and 390 cm depth were deposited about 6300 BP, but were pedogenically modified until 3400 BP; 2) deposits at 300 cm depth accumulated at about 5700 to 5900 BP and were modified until 2880 BP; and 3) strata at 230 to 270 cm depth were deposited about 5350 to 5900 BP and modified until 1950 BP. The apparent ages of the deposits are affected by as much as +800 years, but this may approximate the range of precision of this reconstruction of events and, therefore, can be essentially ignored. Although radiocarbon assay of sediments is an invaluable guide to the age of deposits and the timing of events, it is often fraught with an irresolvable degree of uncertainty. By examining a variety of datable materials using the analytical and interpretive techniques described here, we can reduce the inherent uncertainty to manageable dimensions. Implications for Cultural-Resource Management The history of carbon inheritance, translocation, and differential fixation at site 41 TRI 64 is complex, affecting the reliability of radiocarbon and carbon stable-isotope analyses. A review of these complexities is instructive, with implications for this and many other sites. The flood-terrace context affords rapid aggradation of low-permeability fine grained sediments, but also promotes locally enhanced infiltration through deep penetrating root conduits. Both grassland and woodland biomes occur in proximity, ensuring a mixed carbon isotopic influx. The soil parent materials were rich in particulate and dissolved calcium carbonate and organic matter. These factors combined to create apparent isotopic discrepancies not easily explained, without data pertaining to specific organic components. Interpretation of radiocarbon and other chronological data frequently poses challenges, but the difficulties at this site are particularly noteworthy. A variety of analytical and interpretive techniques were employed in reconstructing the record of local deposition and pedogenesis. This credible synthesis provides a temporal framework for site occupation and utilization. In general, the age of deposits appears to range from 5500 to 4800 BP between approximately 4.0 and 2.5 m respectively. This is an important and generally poorly understood period in this region. Significant cultural discoveries might be made at comparable depths in similar settings. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 66 Summary The Rough Green site and site 41 TRI 64 are located adjacent to a relatively shallow hairpin meander scar which is oriented such that it would have been rapidly erased by scouring and overflow had it been a channel of the West Fork of the Trinity River. However, the dates from the two sites and the history of deposition described above indicate that this meander was present for several thousand years, and that recently it was abandoned. We expect that this abandonment occurred at the same time that occupation at the Rough Green site and probably the upper deposit at site 41TR164 ceased. We do not know the sequence or causation of this abandonment scenario. As discussed above, both sites represent campsites where a variety of extractive activities were carried out and where occupation occurred for repeated times over a period of maybe as much as 4500 years during the Middle and Late Archaic and into the Late Prehistoric. Specific reasons for the sites being present were proposed in the Research Design which guided the investigation, but these reasons have not been confirmed by the available evidence. These occupations clearly do not point to a primary function of harvesting aquatic resources based on the faunal and mollusk remains found. In the light of this evidence, it is our purpose to propose that these sites, and probably others known and unknown in the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity River, served as an extended family camp from which bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) acorns were gathered. We further expect that specific trees were recognized as belonging to individual family groups, although sharing is likely to have been carried out when harvest yields varied in different family groves. Numerous bur oaks (Figure 24) are present today in the floodplain between the two sites and throughout the surrounding bottomland hardwood forest. Moreover, we know that the bur oaks are represented as charcoal at Rough Green, although no acorn shells or fragments were recovered. As shown in Figure 24, bur oaks are significantly larger than other white oaks, red oaks, and live oaks and yield a large nut as noted by the species name, which translates as "large nut". Bur oaks are confined naturally to floodplains where they have wide and deep root systems and are generally less effected by seasonal fluctuations in water levels. The acorn itself contains less tannic acid than other acorns, and as a result is easier to prepare for consumption. As outlined in discussions by Martin (1988, 1995), Turner (1988), and in a thesis by Jerry Hilliard (1980), oak trees drop acorns in a two step process. The first to drop are those acorns that have not matured or are insect-infested; these acorns are generally not gathered. Modern Native American acorn harvesters wait for the second fall which includes those acorns that have matured, although many have undeveloped weevils inside. Although not discussed by these authors, it is our opinion that the acorns from the first drop and probably leaves into which these acorns fell would have been removed from beneath the trees at the time of the first drop, thus creating an acorn/leaf-free landing pad for the second drop and making second drop nut gathering simpler. Once the nuts were gathered, they may have been briefly parched in order to kill the undeveloped weevils and to dry out the nuts. According to these authors and others, including Bev Ortiz ( 1991) who writes about "Traditional Yosemite Indian Acorn Prepar- AR Consultants

View is to the north with Lance Trask for scale. ation" in a book entitled "It Will Live Forever", acorns were gathered on a daily or short term basis and then carried to more permanent campsites away where the hull was removed from the nut and the nut was further processed. As described by these various authors, hull shucking and subsequent preparation would have required baskets, a splitting stone [harnmerstone], and a flat stone [nutting stone or metate]. The nut was placed on the flat stone and hit vertically with the splitting stone, thus separating the hull from the meat. Subsequently, the meat was prepared for consumption by grinding in a stone or wooden mortar using a pestle and then mixing the ground meal in water. This process removed part of the tannic acid and created a mush that was eaten as porridge, baked into a loaf of bread, or was allowed to dry into hard loaves which had a long shelf life and could be carried on long trips or stored in dry settings for use later.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 68 presented by the late C. Hart Merriam in an August, 1918 article in "The National Geographic Magazine" entitled "The Acorn, a Possibly Neglected Source of Food." Although the ethnography of acorn preparation has not been well described for the area of North Central Texas, it is safe to expect that nuts that attracted deer, squirrels, and other nut-eating mammals would also have been consumed by the prehistoric residents of the same area. This seems to have been the case at the Baggett Branch site where acorn shells were a present, but small, part of the shell residue recovered by excavation (Peter and McGregor 1988:231). The problem is that the River Legacy Park sites are not located miles upstream from the floodplain· of the West Fork of the Trinity, and thus are not in analogous places to the Baggett Branch site. Moreover, no acorn shells were recovered nor were any acorn processing pecked or groundstone tools recovered at Rough Green. While this is to be expected based on the previous discussion of acorn harvesting and processing, it does not provide conclusive evidence that either Rough Green or 41 TRI 64 are acorn harvesting sites. In order to provide supporting evidence, it will be necessary to recover larger and more sensitive samples of plant and animal remains that confirm fall occupation. It will also be necessary to isolate occupation surfaces and to tie them to geomorphological evidence of fall or winter deposition. Ideally, it should be possible to find lost or otherwise unutilized acorns imbedded in occupation surfaces, or possibly to recover acorn shell fragments in midden deposits or in hearth matrices. It is our belief that many of the generalized or apparently unfocused temporary/seasonal hunting and gathering campsites described within the floodplain of the West Fork served as the center point for the gathering of acorns from family oak groves.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 69 CONCLUSIONS The following chapter focuses on three main topics and presents the first two in the form of testable models. The topics are: 1. Rough Green in the Late Prehistoric settlement system of the West Fork Watershed 2. Revision of the Static West Fork Model 3. National Register Potential of Small Prehistoric Sites Topic 1. Rough Green in the Late Prehistoric settlement system of the West Fa rk Watershed The first attempt at developing a settlement system that included the West Fork valley and the Rough Green site area was done in conjunction with investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988:362-367). However, at that time information about prehistoric sites in this area adjacent to Mountain Creek was limited. Since then, excavations at the Chambers site in northwest Tarrant County, the Fountain site on Village Creek, the Rough Green site, and other sites in the West Fork valley and along the tributaries provide information about sites, artifact assemblages, and environmental resources that are useful in proposing an explanatory model of Late Prehistoric settlement. For the purpose of this discussion, the West Fork Watershed includes the full extent of the watershed from the junction of the West Fork with the Elm Fork on the east and extending west to northwest Tarrant County. This includes major tributary watersheds of Mountain Creek, Johnson Creek, Village Creek, the Clear Fork of the Trinity River, Big Fossil Creek, Walker Branch, Hurricane Creek, Big Bear Creek, and other unnamed tributaries. Although thorough investigations have not been conducted in each of these areas, the available information is used to develop a model that can be tested and revised during subsequent survey and site evaluations. We recognize that few sites have been excavated and reported in the West Fork Watershed and this limits the depth of conclusions. It is our position that the goal of research should be to develop testable models and hypotheses. Using the Joe Pool report as a baseline and including the results of CRM surveys and avocational investigations in the surrounding area, we begin by presenting four environmental zones shown on Figure 25. The floodplains of the various drainages [mapped as Qal by the Bureau of Economic Geology 1988] are depicted along the West Fork and each of the named tributaries. This zone supports a primarily bottomland hardwood forest that is inundated with floodwaters of the West Fork or its tributaries on a regular basis. We have found no reason to suggest that this condition has changed significantly over the past thousand years, in fact, the continual aggrading of the flood- AR Consultants

This flooding and deposition has also created narrow overbank flooding levees that are oriented parallel to the flow of the drainages. The bottomland forest of the West Fork and Mountain Creek were treated as separate zones by Jurney (in Peter and Jurney 1988:16), and while there is a difference of scale, the dichotomy is not presently useful for this evaluation. According to Jurney, bur oaks were incidental in both the West Fork and Mountain Creek floodplains, but bur oaks and post oaks were the largest species reported by the early twentieth century GLO surveyors. Besides the mast yield, a variety of mammals, particularly deer, were available along with reptiles, fish, and mollusks. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 71 Pleistocene terraces [Qt] are shown as a separate zone [d iagonally lined areas on Figure 25], except where the terrace area is laterally small and does not show well on a reduced map and where sites are not known to be present. This zone is generally above river flooding and supports a prairie or a forested environment depending upon the terrace location. The terrace zone includes settings that are adjacent to major and minor drainages. Access to adjacent environmental zones highlights the importance of the terrace zone. Although underlain by Pleistocene gravels, very little evidence has been found that these buried deposits served as quarries. The Grand Prairie is along the west side of Mountain Creek and to the north along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Pure prairies and brushy prairies are present, but the Grand Prairie shown on Figure 25 is a pure tall grass prairie, while the Prairie east of the Mountain Creek valley is a brushy prairie. The Eagle Ford Formation underlies the Grand Prairie. Trees are scattered throughout the pure prairie, and although mast-bearing trees are mentioned as being present, their density was low. Martin (1995:215) considers trees in this area to have had very low economic potential. Prairie-adapted mammals inhabited the Grand Prairie prehistorically based on the presence of the bones of bison and antelope, but Lynott (1979) notes that the prairies of north-central Texas had low nutritive values when compared to the short-grass prairies of the High Plains, and that large numbers of these mammals were never common. The Eastern Cross Timbers is correlated with the Woodbine Formation and forms a north-south band that passes through the area. Sandstone, clay, and shale are present and a relatively thin soil overlies the bedrock exposures. As an environmental zone, it is interesting in that Johnson Creek follows part of the eastern edge of the zone south of the West Fork and Village Creek follows the western edge of the same zone, except for an isolated area of cross timbers west of the Village Creek/West Fork Junction. On the north Hurricane Creek extends a short distance north into the cross timbers and Big Bear and Little Bear Creek cut through the zone from southeast to north and west and continue into the Fort Worth Prairie. Post oaks and blackjack oaks dominate the tree canopy, but other fruit and nut-yielding trees are present. There are significantly more open and barren areas south of the West Fork, and only oaks are present in these areas. Deer inhabited this zone at least on a seasonal basis to secure nuts for food. The Fort Worth Prairie (Dykersthuis 1946) is similar to the Grand Prairie, but is anchored on the Fort Worth Limestone which is a significantly thinner geological formation than the Eagle Ford. The principal climax grass of the Fort Worth Prairie was a Bluestem [Andropogon scoparius]. Woody plants were largely confined to the valleys and their margins. Valleys in the Fort Worth Prairie tend to be less rugged than eastward, but a regular water flow is known to have occurred in many. Bison and antelope are described as having lived in this area historically, and their presence has been confirmed archaeologically. The eastern edge of the Western Cross Timbers bounds the western edge of the Fort Worth Prairie in western Tarrant County. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 72 When it comes to site locations, three major settings are apparent throughout this area. The largest site deposits are found on Pleistocene terraces. Sites in this setting include Chambers (Glasgow 1990), Cobb-Pool, Fountain, and sites TA9, 41TR128 and 70. Other sites are recorded in this setting, but very little is known about them. The second setting includes sites within floodplains of the rivers and creeks, these sites include Baggett Branch, Ubil, River Bend, First Street Bridge, Rough Green, and sites 41TR119, 141- 146, and 167. The third setting includes the valleys of mostly intermittent drainages and adjacent level areas in the uplands of the Fort Worth Prairie and the Eastern Cross Timbers. The few sites recorded in this setting include the Arcadia Trail site on a tributary of Big Fossil Creek, sites on Hollings Branch at the south and upper end of Mountain Creek, and the Highway 360 site on the north side of Little Bear Creek (Lorrain 1973, 1975). By the end of the Late Archaic, population density appears to have reached its highest point during the prehistoric occupation of the North-Central Texas region. This density corresponds to the widest dispersal of sites throughout the area (Skinner 1981; Lynott 1981:105; Peter and McGregor 1988:361; Prikryl 1990:74; Perring and Yates 1998:146- 147). Sites such as Arcadia Trail and site B along Highway 360 are situated in the uplands of the Fort Worth Prairie and the Eastern Cross Timbers respectively, and may have been near water sources that were permanent at the time of occupation. At the same time, the earliest occupation of the Baggett Branch and Rough Green sites had begun and continued into and through the Late Prehistoric. Earlier occupations have been documented in the floodplain by F erring ( 1994) and investigators at the Metro vest area. Occupation oflarger sites, such as Chambers, Fountain, TA9, 41 TR128 and 70, occurred on terraces situated in the floodplain of the West Fork and along streams such as Village Creek. A similar pattern appears in the White Rock Creek Watershed in Dallas County where the Spillway site is clearly located on an elevation adjacent to the creek, and where a diverse tool assemblage, features, and burials have been reported (Harris 1949; Hatzenbueler and Harris 1949; Kirkland and Harris 1941 ). This same pattern seems to have continued into the Late Prehistoric, and in fact, there is little evidence that it changed through the length of this time period, except for anomalous sites such as the Cobb-Pool site and the expansion into tributaries such as Hollings Branch and Artesia Creek on the east side of Mountain Creek where water could have been counted on being present even when droughts were causing major pressures on the indigenous population living along the major drainages. For the purpose of this discussion, we do not divide the Late Prehistoric into sub-periods, but division into at least early. and late periods offers the best explanation of the limited stratigraphic information available. Certainly at Rough Green the shell-tempered pottery is at the top of the stratigraphic profile and is not associated with Scallorn arrow points. The major shifts appear to be in a decrease in site size and in the apparent abandonment of terrace settings in the West Fork valley westward from the Elm Fork junction to beyond the junction with the Clear Fork. A similar and contemporaneous increase in site numbers on tributaries is reported for the Elm Fork (Prikryl 1990:79). Floodplain sites continued to be occupied as shown by Rough Green and Baggett Branch. We have AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 73 suggested above that Rough Green and other sites in the West Fork floodplain were primarily bur oak grove sites and suspect that sites like Baggett Branch, and possibly Ubil, were also located in relationship to bur oak groves but may have been occupied long enough seasonally to have had acorns processed there. More permanent campsite deposits are reported from Cobb-Pool, Fountain, and the Chambers sites, which although varying in size, have tool assemblages more diverse than the other sites discussed above. Fountain is considered to be an acorn-processing site (Hanson and Kvemes 1977:11), while at the same time hunting was a major activity represented at the site. For additional explanations of subsistence strategies, the reader is referred to reports on Joe Pool Lake and Aquilla Lake (Martin 1995; Brown 1988). At a very basic level, it is good to note that the lithic debris from all four sites is chert rather than the more common quartzite of the Elm Fork and the mainstem of the Trinity River in Dallas County. Thus, there is good reason to expect that the West Fork folk were quarrying their chert from similar gravel shields (McGregor 1995) or from regional cherts described by Ferring at Lakes Lewisville and Ray Roberts. The breakdown of lithic debris from three of the sites (Figure 26) shows that the Fountain and Chambers sites have similar percentages of primary/secondary/interior debris types which can be interpreted as an indication that tool manufacture and refurbishing were carried out, while the Rough Green site has a sample with similar percentages of secondary and interior debris which reflect tool refurbishing. The composition of the debris assemblage from Baggett Branch was not presented in a comparable format. 80 60 40 20 - Rough Green [236) 10 11111111 Chambers [4388] - - - Fountain [13,000+1 p s L~hlC Debris Figure 26.

For the Chambers site, the three top levels were used for developing the density measurement. Tool kit density for the 18.9m3 of the site is 9 items per cubic meter. For lithic debris, it is 232 pieces per cubic meter and it is 241 for the combined assemblage per cubic meter. We have estimated that AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 74 Fountain is no more than 20 cm thick, and according to the authors, they excavated 1,665m2 using 108 units. While we don't know how horizontal and vertical control can be maintained in so large an area with only 108 units, we have concluded that 333m3 of artifact- yielding sediment was excavated. This yields a very low density of 1.9 tool kit items and 39 pieces of lithic debris per cubic meter. The combined density is 40.9 items per cubic meter, and this leads to the conclusion that many of the excavated units yielded very little or no cultural material. It remains our expectation that Fountain should be similar to Chambers, rather than the lowest of the four sites. At Baggett Branch, SMU excavated 115.25m2 and we have estimated that the major occupation zone is about 20 cm thick, which was confirmed by Dan McGregor (1999). Tool kit density is 16.9 items per cubic meter and lithic debris density is 1 l 7.8/m3 Overall density is 134.6 pieces per . cubic meter. At Rough Green, tool kit density is 9.2 and lithic debris density is 65.5 per cubic meter. Assemblage density is slightly higher at 74.7 pieces per cubic meter. Overall, density is a measure of occupational intensity that drops from Chambers to Baggett Branch to reach its lowest measure at Rough Green. When other sites from the West Fork floodplain are included, density drops even further, almost to a measure of no more than 1-2 pieces per cubic meter (Peter 1987; Ellis 1998:10). This low figure, when based on small samples, may be questionable as illustrated by the low numbers from the first test pit at Rough Green (Skinner and Caran 1997:Table 6) proved to be unrepresentative based on the excavations described above. Nevertheless, very few items were recovered from River Bend, First Street Bridge, 41 TR119, and 41 TR167 and we consider the drop in numbers to reflect intensity of occupation from base camps to temporary camps. To further explore the differences between sites with Late Prehistoric components and their proposed place in the settlement system, we compiled artifactual assemblage information from the Baggett Branch, Chambers, Fountain, and Rough Green sites (Table 8). As noted in the table footnotes, some artifact categories have been combined, and in some cases, artifact numbers and definitions are insufficiently presented in the available reports. Because of differences in tool kit artifact numbers, the numbers have been converted into percentages which are also listed in Table 8. Based on the numbers and percentages, it is our conclusion that the figures for Chambers, Baggett Branch, and Rough Green are relatively representative, while the reporting of Fountain appears incongruous. It is apparent that hunting was a major activity conducted at Chambers, based on the high number of projectiles and the faunal assemblage, and that it was also important at Fountain as reported by the authors, but not born out by the numbers. Hbased on the same criteria, hunting was also important at the two excavated floodplain sites, although to a lesser extent. Quarrying does not seem to be present at any of the sites, but tool manufacture and repair are represented by the number of projectile point bases, biface fragments, and lithic debris. The low representation of chipped stone tools is unexplained for Chambers, but the high numbers of retouched pieces from Fountain and Baggett Branch indicate the practice of making flakes for use and then discarding them at the point of use. Hammerstones, groundstone, and pottery are present in each site, but in AR Consultants

These are the floodplain, Pleistocene terraces along Mountain Creek, Village Creek, and western part of the West Fork of the Trinity River in northwest Tarrant County, and at select locations in the uplands. We consider the locations on the terraces to be base camps/residential bases and the floodplain sites to have been briefly occupied on a seasonal basis-particularly for harvesting bur oak acorns and other floodplain resources. The scattered upland locations are considered to be limited activity sites which were occupied briefly, but probably repeatedly, as was the case with the other sites, for specific maintenance activities. The location of quarry sites is outside the scope of this study, and the reader is referred to McGregor (1995) for further information. To further expand on the limitations of the available data, we review several recent investigations where negative information provides further amplification of this sketchy reconstruction. Trackhoe trenching of the levee along the original channel of the West Fork at the mouth of Mountain Creek, failed to locate any buried cultural materials (Skinner and Kent 1998a), thus sites do not occur in every levee setting. Survey of the newly constructed National Cemetery east of Mountain Creek Lake on the east slope of the valley located no prehistoric sites on the surface or in the heavily eroded subsurface deposits (Skinner, Whorton, and Dillon 1995). A similar result came from survey of the Cedar Mountain Preserve (Kent and Skinner 1998) and the Pleasant Valley Golf Course (Skinner, Lindsey, Whorton, and Young 1992), while small buried prehistoric sites were located on the terrace deposits along Hollings Branch (Skinner 1998b ). No sites were found on upper Fish Creek (Skinner 1990) or on the expansion of Friendship Park on upper_ Walnut Creek (Skinner and Whorton 1991). Consequently, there are may areas within the Mountain Creek Watershed where no evidence of prehistoric evidence has been located. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 77 floodplain failed to find surface or buried sites (Caran 1990a and b; Ferring 1988; Prikryl 1995), although Whittsett (1976) found sites along Rush Creek, a tributary of Village Creek. Testing upriver from the Village Creek intersection with the West Fork did not find sites at Beach Street (Skinner and Trask 1999) or along the river channel west until just past White Settlement (Trask, Caran, Whorton, Dillon, and Skinner 1996; Skinner, Caran, Whorton, and Trask 1997). A similar pattern has been reported in the uplands east of the Clear Fork (Skinner 1998a), at Lake Benbrook (Stephenson 1948; Ferring 1993, 1996; Trask 1996;) and in the area along Dutch Creek a tributary that drains into Benbrook (Skinner and Kent 1998b ). While the Arcadia Trail site was recorded in one section of Whites Branch, nothing was found in the South Arcadia Trail Park site (Whorton and Skinner 1995a), and a single dart point was found upstream (Skinner 1997). Likewise, survey of a park site on Big Fossil Creek failed to find any prehistoric sites (Trask and Whorton 1995). The purpose of this presentation is to note that few sites have been located anywhere in this part of the West Fork Watershed. Therefore, a diligent search for unrecorded sites will not only be useful in evaluating this demographic model, but is needed in order to better understand the prehistory of the West Fork Watershed as its evidence continues to be impacted by the modem settlement of the area as a major population center. Topic 2: Revision of the Static West Fork Model Initial discovery of the Rough Green site appeared to mirror the report by F erring ( 1994) of sites buried in the floodplain of the West Fork just downstream in River Legacy Park. Although these sites, and additional sites recorded in the Metrovest area [s ee references below], and the Baggett Branch site present evidence of prehistoric occupation during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods along the edge of the river channel or Mountain Creek, or in the West Fork floodplain, the Rough Green site does not conform to this same pattern. All of the sites appear to have been buried by overbank flooding, and the Rough Green site is situated along a levee that parallels a cutoff meander and is oriented roughly perpendicular to the present axis of the West Fork. Very limited testing outside the pipeline corridor and extensive inspection of the area led to the conclusion that the buried site deposit extends to the edge of the cutoff meander which must have been active at the time that the Rough Green site [and probably earlier when site 41 TR164 was being occupied] was being used as a campsite for harvesting bottomland forest food resources. This raised questions about whether the meander belongs to the West Fork and is a remnant of an earlier river channel or is the meander of a smaller river tributary? The meander is narrower than the present West Fork channel, but more importantly the toe of the meander is barely two meters below the level of the prehistoric ground surface at Rough Green, while the river is incised into the floodplain more than three times this depth. Furthermore, augering demonstrated that the base of the meander channel is based on sterile· subsoil and shows no evidence that a deeper channel has been filled with AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 78 overbank sediments in the past millennium. The very tight and elongated U-shaped configuration of the meander scar does not conform to any extant configuration of the West Fork in the surrounding area. In fact, this configuration would be virtually impossible for a high volume stream, such as the West Fork, to have maintained because the water velocity would have washed out a meander that was flowing at an angle of 180° to the channel and then made a hairpin tum and flowed back to the channel. Based on these decidedly limited factors, we postulate that the cutoff meander belonged to Walker Branch and that the West Fork flowed in a now-abandoned, and barely visible, channel scar that is south of the Rough Green site. This is not an heretical conclusion, since old river channels are reported and mapped at Metrovest, but it does serve to highlight the generally unmapped and undated lateral movements of the West Fork channel. The location of this hypothetical channel is between two mined areas that are shown on Figure 28. This 1963 aerial photograph shows the present configuration of the West Fork. At that time, much of the floodplain was being farmed, although two areas on the south side of the river were being mined for sand and gravel. This same pattern shows on an earlier 1950 aerial photograph and continued on a subsequent 1977 photograph. A railroad bed [a generally light line] is shown running northeast from the western mined area and then turning north and crossing the river where it entered an extensive mine north of the river. It appears that the railroad no longer crossed the river in 1963 and that gravel was being moved from both of the mines south of the river across a bridge that went west and crossed the river. Of particular interest on the aerial photograph is an unmined strip of land between the two strip-mined areas. This same unmined area is indicated to be a drainage on the Hurst, TX 7 .5' USGS map that is part of Figure 1 above. This drainage extends south toward the Village Creek Plant and this is probably an old meander of Village Creek. This same drainage remnant extends almost to the east bank of the West Fork. As shown on Figure 29, it is our postulation that at the time of occupation at the Rough Green site, the West Fork flowed through the channel marked in yellow. At that same time, Walker Branch meandered across the floodplain past the Rough Green site and then back to the vicinity of today's river channel. From this point, it continued downstream to where it joined the West Fork channel at the mouth of the intermittent tributary channel that is the only remnant of the now abandoned river channel. It is our conclusion that the sites located to the east along the present river channel [s ites 41TR143-146 and downstream] were probably in this place because the West Fork flowed by them and this setting provided access to important food resources. While we do not know why the river would change its course, this seems to be the only viable explanation for the situation of the Rough Green site along the bank of a hairpin cutoff meander. It is possible that a major flooding episode occurred and dammed the main channel of the West Fork and that this resulted in the relocation of the channel to the north where it pirated the channel of Walker Branch which left the meander high and dry. This damming and flooding might have corresponded to the time of the West Fork paleosol or might signal the end of this dry time. Based on the dating of the Rough Green and site 41 TRI 64 and the associated artifacts, we believe that occupation along the Walker Branch channel spanned the time of the West Fork paleosol.

Although this topic is outside the limits of the present investigation, future research in the River Legacy Park area will need to focus on investigating subsurface cuts for buried site deposits, as well as drainage channels and paleosols. These investigations need to be conducted as Caran has done in the lower Village Creek area, even though prehistoric camp deposits are not found, because it is only in this way that it will be possible to reconstruct the lateral movements of the West Fork. This is particularly important today, because some much of the ground surface has been disturbed; this situation hampers interpretation and could lead to the untimely discovery of significant buried deposits during construction projects.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 81 Topic 3: National Register Potential of Small Prehistoric Sites In a well argued discussion of the potential eligibility of prehistoric site 41 TRI 67 to the National Register of History Places [NRHP], Lain Ellis of the Texas Department of Transportation concludes that the site is eligible for inclusion (1998). We concur with Ellis' conclusion and believe that the potential of small sites yielding limited but important information about Binford's "locations" (1980) has the potential of being further investigated in the West Fork valley. Based on the information available about sites 41TR143-146, it is impossible to know if these sites are similar to 41TR167 or to the Rough Green site. Furthermore, we do not know if these sites were on the bank of a meandering channel of Walker Branch or on the bank of the West Fork. We are pleased that parts of the Rough Green site and site 41 TR 164 remain preserved in Walker Branch overflow bank deposits in River Legacy Park outside of the construction area. Along with Ellis, we remain committed to the belief that posing questions is important for the recognition of data needed to evaluate the questions and in the selection of sites to be further investigated.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 91 A total of 1, 185 gastropods and 3,822 freshwater mussel shells were recovered from the Rough Green site. The presentation of the data is divided into two parts. The gastropods are discussed first because they are sensitive to environmental change in local as well as regional environments. The freshwater mussels are then discussed because they are important in determining the types of mussels and their environments utilized by the site inhabitants for subsistence purposes. ANALYSIS OF THE GASTROPOD MATERIAL When an archeological excavation is carried out, everything associated with the site becomes important. One of the many facets is the interpretation of the past environment based upon floral and faunal remains from the site. The use of faunal remains for paleoenvironmental analysis is predicated on the known relationship between a specie or species today with the environment in which it exists. Faunal remains recovered from sites are used to infer regional or even local paleoenvironmental conditions during the period of deposition at the site. In addition, if there are differences in the fauna and flora between strata or layers of deposition, this may indicate a change in environment (Brewer 1992:201 - 202). Mollusca shells are part of the animal remains and Sparks (1970:5) has this to say about mollusk shells and archeology, Mollusca are useful because of their wide distribution, their preservation in a variety of deposits, their large numbers and their comparative freedom from human influences, at least when compared with such vulnerable larger animals s the vertebrates. Evans (1972: 17) adds that terrestrial gastropods from archeological sites can be used to determine both the climate and local environments. He (1972:21) adds that small scale environmental change in an area may not necessarily affect the gastropod population; therefore, the archeologist must look at the total types of snail shells and their change through time in order to create a more exact interpretation of the climate and the local environment specifically. AR Consultants was aware of environmental change at Cotton Creek Valley in Oklahoma which was based on freshwater mussel shell and gastropod shell analysis (Artz and Reid 1984). The Cotton Creek area went from a moist to a dryer habitat from approximately AD 400 - 1200. The possibility for the same environmental change to occur at the Rough Green site (41TR162) was one of the major focuses of the excavation. In determining the environment, how the shell got to the site is important. For example, if Rabdotus shells are found only in clumps at a site, and there are no subadults present, this would suggest, to the archeologist, that the shells were brought to the site for food, especially if they are found among fire-cracked rock. In a normal distribution of shells, Rabdotus would be found among other species, with subadults and scattered more or less AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 92 uniformly throughout the site, their presence is a result of natural processes and not human agents (Allen and Cheatum 1960:293 - 294). In order to compare the oak savannah environment today to past environments, a collection of gastropod shells, along with mussel shells, were taken from the wall of Trench 4. Trench 4 was selected because it was closest to Trench 3 where the major portion of site excavation was being carried out. Methodology Every meter (referred to as a pit), samples would be taken from the wall at 5 centimeter intervals from the surface to the old floodplain which was usually approximately 70 centimeters below the surface. The sample areas per meter were 5 centimeters wide and 10 centimeters deep. No samples were collected from the wall face because it was felt that they may have fallen from the ground surface and became attached to the_w all. For the results of the samplings, see Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows what species of gastropods are present and how they are distributed throughout the area. Figure 2 illustrates how the gastropods are distributed in relation to cultural debris such as daub and the freshwater mussels brought to the site. If the gastropods had clumped around the cultural material, then the logical conclusion would be that they also were brought to the site. In addition, samples of modem gastropods were collected from a clearing and from an area with decayed tree limbs in it, each sample being 1 meter square. The results are given in Table 1. Table 1. Gastropods collected from two environmental areas at site 41 TRI 62. CLEARING WOODED AREA Helicina orbiculata Helicina orbiculata Mesodon roemeri Mesodon roemeri Rabdotus dealbatus Rabdotus dealbatus Polygyra sp. probably P. mooreana Succinea cordialis Linisa texasiana Helisoma trivolvis Physella virgata RESULTS Three of the gastropods (Helicina orbiculata, Mesodon roemeri and Rabdotus dealbatus dealbatus) occur in the clearing area and the wooded area. A gastropod tentatively identified as Polygyra mooreana was found in the clearing area. This specie, along with Linisa texasiana, may indicate two species occupying a similar wooded environment (Cheatum and Fullington 1971: 17). Among decayed tree limbs two types of freshwater gastropods (Physella virgata and Helisoma trivolvis) were collected. Further analysis of the surrounding area indicated that these gastropods can be found in temporary standing water areas surrounding the site. AR Consultants

These shells are extremely small and a microscope was used for identification. PALEOENVIRONMENT Table 3 presents the environments that each gastropod specie represents. As one can see the species are basically cosmopolitan in nature. However, the same species are represented through time consistently throughout the site. The oak savannah environment appears to have changed little from the old floodplain level to today. The L. texasiana and Rabdotus dealbatus, according to Fullington and Fullington (1982: 104) live in a habitat of mixed sparse woods intermingled with open or grassy sections. This description fits the oak-savannah environment that exists today at the River Legacy Park in which the Rough Green Site is located. Unfortunately H orbiculata is too cosmopolitan to use as an index gastropod for a particular environment, but it may do so by association in the Tarrant County area however. Sampson (1882:682) states that M roemeri, H orbiculata, L. texasiana and what he refers to as Bulimulus alternatus were found as fossils in post-Pliocene formations in the Fort Worth area. Fullington and Pratt (1974) do not record the occurrence of Rabdotus (Bulimulus) alternatus in the North Central Texas area however, fossil or currently. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 95 Table 3. Environments indicated by the gastropods collected from site 41 TR162. SPECIE ENVIRONMENT TERRESTRIAL SNAILS Helicina orbiculata ranges from limestone environments in decidous or juniper woodlands to woodland corridors along prairie streams (Fullington and Pratt 1974:8). Rabdotus dealbatus occurs in tall grass prairies, in oak woodlands and semiarid regions (Fullington and Pratt 1974:16) Mesodon roemeri occurs mostly in dense woodlands along water; sometimes found in sparsely wooded slopes (Cheatum and Fullington 1971:31) Linisa texasiana mixed woodland-grass; areas of sparse woods intermingled with open or grassy sections (Fullington and Fullington 1982:104) Polygyra cf. mooreana occupies a variety of habitats ranging from deep woodlands to sparsely timbered hillsides (Cheatum and Fullington 1971: 17) Succinea cordialis moist, wooded areas as well as floodplains (Allen and Cheatum 1960:299 and 294) Retinella indentata found under rotten logs and leaf litter in moist areas Strobilops texasiana found near or on rotten logs under the bark and in leaf litter (Fullington and Pratt 197 4 :26) Gastrocopta cf. G. armifera found under limestone rocks, leaf litter or rotten logs; can be found in moist or dry areas (Cheatum and Fullington 1973:10) Strobilops specie all Strobilop species are usually found under rotten leaves in indeterminant deciduous forests (Fullington and Pratt 1974) Pupoides albilabris found in limestone areas and under leaf litter m sparse woodlands (Cheatum and Fullington 1973:28) FRESHWATER SNAILS Helisoma trivolvis found in gently flowing or standing water; usually attached to submerged branches or rocks (Emerson and Jacobson 1976:311) Physella virgata occurs in environments similar to H trivolvis but possibly more dynamic (Willimon 1972:456 and 462) The gastropod shells recovered from the flotation samples, except for the H trivolvis shells, indicate a wooded environment because they are mainly found under or around rotten logs, beneath leaf litter and in moist areas. In fact, R. indentata can be found in moist areas under leaf litter in the River Legacy Park today. The ratio of individuals of H. orbiculata, L. texasiana, R. dealbatus and M. roemeri found in the flotation samples reflect the ratio of gastropods found in the site area today. The count for M. roemeri is AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Arcltaeology 96 lower than that found in the same area today, but it may• reflect where the float material was collected or a slightly more sparser woodland than today. Further evidence for the oak-savannah environment comes from Raab and Woosley's (1982) study of the pollen from the Cobb-Pool Site in southwestern Dallas County which was occupied from around A. D. 600 - 1200. Based on analysis of the pollen, their conclusion is that the Cobb-Pool site was located in a savannah-like environment with an oak overstory and a grass understory which is very similar to the River Legacy Park today and the Rough Green site in the past. CONCLUSION It appears that no change in the environment occurred from the time the site was inhabited until today. In addition, L. texasiana, especially in association with M roemeri and R. dealbatus dealbatus, may indicate a relative clear area (very little forest debris), among the trees. R. dea/batus, H. orbiculata and L. texasiana were found associated with freshwater bivalves and fire cracked rock in the wall. The gastropods may have been used for food, but it is unlikely because of the many juvenile specimens of both species are not associated with fire cracked rock or shell. They were probably attracted to the rock, shell and remaining meat on the discarded shells as well as a source for calcium for their shells (Neck 1987:III-12). The presence of P. virgata and H trivolvis on the surface suggest that the presence of H. trivolvis may have been brought to the site on vegetation gathered locally or from Walker Branch that might have been used to steam the mussels. ANALYSIS OF FRESHWATER MOLLUSKS Meighan and others ( 195 8: 1) state that of the hundreds of shell middens which have been excavated and reported, only a few have so much as a species list while still fewer have any quantitative data on the relative importance of each specie and even fewer have any inferences made from the site itself. Fortunately, things have changed since this statement was made in 1958. Richard Fullington, Raymond Neck, and others have attempted to look at shells as ecofacts. The following discussion is an attempt to do the same for the mussel shells from the Rough Green site (4 1 TR 162 ), Tarrant County, Texas. AR Consultants collected 3,822 (3,680 from block excavations, 116 from flotation analysis and 26 from a hearth/midden area) shells from the Rough Green site, 41 TRI 62. Of these shells 1,929 are left valves and 1,893 are right valves. White states that the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) is to separate the most abundant element of the species found. The MNI for the collected shells is 1,973. In addition, there are also 39 unidentifiable fragments (not counted in the MNI number) and 62 burned fragments (e ither counted or else unidentified). Table 3 summarizes the MNI of each specie, its genus and specie and percentage in relation to the total number of shells. The mussels were found in the Trinity River Drainage and the Elm Fork of the Trinity River by Strecker (1931:60 and 61). He (1931:60) lists those that came from Dallas AR Consultants

B Litsey, Jr., which are F flava, A. plicata, T verrucosa, Q. pustulosa, 0. reflexa, T truncata, P. purpuratus, L. hydiana, L. teres and Q. apiculata. Strecker (1931:61) also lists Q. houstonensis, from the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Read (1954:45) mentions P. dombeyanus being present in Dallas County although Strecker does not. Howells and others (1996:115) state that Q. pustulosa may be Q. mortoni types; therefore, the shells from 41 TR 162 identified as Q. mortoni are done so on their shell characteristics. It appears that the species from the site are in the area today and were present in Walker Branch when the site was occupied. Table 4. Percentage of identified Freshwater Mollusk Species.

Further examination of the mussel shell between the pits indicated that this was not the case. For a view of the location of the shell lens in Trench 4, see Figure 3. Locations of the shell midden appears to follow the old floodplain. The mussels found in Pit 2, however, do indicate that there may have been another site or at least inhabitance of another portion of the site. The same can be said for mussels located west of Pit 19. These areas may be nothing more than mussels thrown away from a major portion of the site, but, at least for Pit 2, this is doubtful. There does seem be at least three occupations of the site based on what is seen in the profile of Trench 4. Occupation I in the profile appears to be quite thick, approximately 30 cm .. Occupation II appears to be quite extensive and covers most of the site, although it does vary in thickness. This may be a result of the ground surface or even dumping of shells. Waslekov (1987:147) cautions the researcher to be aware that poorly consolidated matrix may allow the downward migration of shells to some level far below their points of origin. It is possible that Occupation I and II interfinger and this is what causes the appearance of the varying thickness for Occupation II. AR Consultants

Waselkov ( 1987: 148) further adds that site abandonment and reoccupation can seriously disrupt the stratigraphy of a shell midden. Paleoenvironment Meighan and others (19 5 8: 11) state that shells represent one of the most important midden components for interpreting ecological conditions. Since the mollusk shells are usually preserved better than bones or seed, it is possible to make positive interpretations about the environment when the molllusks existed, especially when compared to the conditions they are living in today. The portion of the Trinity River near the site today has a mud and sand bottom in the main channel even though there are muddy backwaters in the area, especially during times of flooding. Unfortunately Walker Branch is not flowing today to indicate its substrates, but based on soil analysis from the trenchs made in Site 41 TR162, Walker Branch probably flowed in a channel with substrates found in the Trinity River today. With Meighan's comments in mind, most of the mussel species at Green River Site (4 1 TRI 62) are cosmopolitan in nature and, therefore, not good indicators for environmental change. Fullington states that the mussels from the Adams Ranch Site AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 99 (41NV177), Q. mortoni, L. hydiana, Q. apiculata, T verrucosa, T truncata and P. purpuratus, cannot be used to gauge environmental changes (A nthony 1994 :2 7 0 - 27 1). Of the seven species, six are found at the Rough Green site, the exception being L. hydiana. I doubt that the remaining species, F. flava, P. dombeyanus, Q. pustulosa, and 0. rejlexa are good indicators of environmental change as well. What can be said is that the bottom conditions that these mussels lived in are the same as found in the Trinity River today, and probably Walker Branch when it was active. The environment probably did not change, or if it did, it was not radical enough to create a change in the mussel species. The majority of the a species prefer mud bottoms or at least mud and sand. F. flava, the dominant shell form, is not a good index shell for the channel substrate, but A. plicata may be. Wilson Crook, Jr. and R. K. Harris (1957:61) mention that A. plicata prefers sluggish waters, ooze and muck. They use A. plicata to determine the paleoenvironment for an early man site near Lake Lewisville. They believe that the Elm Fork at the time of occupation was a choked stream bed with a meandering channel, the gradient having been reduced until it was quite low. It is possible that the mussels found at Site 41 TRI 62 may have come from the same environment. Water Depth The mollusk species from the site range in depth from 2.5 centimeters to 3 meters (Howells and others 1996:56, 34, 89, 137 and 115). The range of the depths for the mollusks may indicate that they were collected during dryer times such as the summer or fall where they would be more accessible. This would tend, hopefully, along with other faunal and floral evidence to support AR Consultant's contention that this was a seasonal camp. Fullington states that the mussel species from the Adams Ranch Site (41NV177) indicate shallow water and that those species were exploited probably from summer to fall when the creek was low (Anthony 1994:271). As mentioned previously, several of the species from the Adams Ranch Site were found at the Rough Green site, and this also indicates that the mussels were collected when Walker Branch was low and probably during the fall. In addition, Claassen (1986), in her study of shellfishing seasons for the Southeastern United States, determined that freshwater mussels were gathered during the late summer - early fall on sites in Ohio, Kentucky, Georgia and an Archaic site (41FT180) on the Trinity River. Mussel Hosts As part of the paleoenvironmental reconstruction, the types of fish in the creek are also important. Although no fish bones were collected from the site, it is possible to determine the different species of fishes that existed while the site was being utilized by its native inhabitants. Howells et al. (1996) discuss the fish hosts for the different types of mussel glochidia. Although, the list is not extensive, it covers the known fish hosts that exist today. The mussels and fish host are listed below in Table 5. The minimum number of fish species that act as hosts are mentioned in the list only. According to Chris Garcia, Biologist for the Fort Worth District of the Texas Parks and Wildlife (Personal AR Consultants

Wing and Brown (1979: 141) state that mollusks on the whole provide fewer calories, less protein and more calcium per unit weight than the meat of vertebrates. They further state that seasonal consumption of mollusks may be timed to augment the diet when other sources of protein are scarce or to coincide with increased availability. In addition, Meighan (1970:416) writes that, for a hunting-gathering people, mollusks provide a year round source of food so that they are not subjected to the "feast or famine" seasonality of other foods. At site 41 TRI 62, the use of mollusks as food probably coincided with the collection of nuts as an easily available resource and acted as a supplementary diet to deer and turtle during the Fall, the time when the nuts were harvested. There are approximately 63,000 individuals represented by the shells at the site. In order to determine the amount of individuals allotted to each specie, 63,000 was multiplied by the percentage for each specie used in Table 1. That number was then multiplied by the average soft part weight found in Parmalee and Klippel's (1974) table for the average weight of the mollusks soft parts. If the specie was not found in Parmalee and Klippel' s table, the specie was compared to a similar specie and then the soft part weight was estimated. The soft parts of the specimens weighed approximately 1,626,786 grams. To derive the number of calories in 1,626,786 grams of soft parts (the edible portion), the amount of soft parts is multiplied by 0.58 which is the number used to derive percentage of calories in a gram of the mollusks' soft parts. A total of approximately 943,536 calories were present for the site inhabitants to use. The weight of soft parts and calorie present for each specie is listed in Table 6. AR Consultants

There are enough calories for approximately 374 people that can be garnered from the mussels for one day. If a hunter-gatherer band consisted of 25 people, there were enough calories in the mussels to support the band for approximately 14 days. It is important to remember that although mussel shells make up a majority of the site, there were other faunal resources available to the site inhabitants. Erlandson (1988) has another view. He looks at the protein needed by humans and provided by mussels. He (1988:104) cites Wallace who analyzed the calorie and protein available for clams gathered at Starrigavan Bay, Baranof Island, Alaska. Wallace multiplied the edible meat yied by 0.13 to derive the amount of protein present in the mussels. If the same formula is used for the Rough Green site, the amount of protein present at the site calculates out to be approximately 211,482 grams. A person requires 40 grams of protein per day (Ibid). There would have been enough potential protein for approximately 5,287 people per day or nearly 212 days for 25 people. Although appealing as the time span for the occupation of the site based on the available protein, Parmalee and Klippel' s calorie model is the most widely used in the literature and will be used here. In addition, Wallace used 0.79 to multiple the edible meat yield by (Erlandson 1988:104), but Parmalee and Klippel's number of 0.58 is more conservative and, therefore, used in this report. Another possibility for mussels being gathered at the site is they were a future food resource, as well as probably a food resource while the people were at the site. Henshilwood, Nilssen and Parkington (1994) discuss the drying of mussels for food storage purposes. They mention that drying the mussel (removing the water) allows the mussel to be transported and stored for future use. This point should not be overlooked AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 102 because there is no direct evidence that the mussels were eaten at the site only. If the site inhabitants were gathering acorns, could they not also be gathering mussels for future use as part of an optimal foraging strategy. Preparation The mussel meat may have been eaten one of two ways, raw or cooked. If cooked, the mussels were either steamed, boiled or baked. Based on the lack of burned shell, the mussels were probably steamed since the evidence for boiling is also nonexistent. Henshilwood, Nilssen and Parkington (1994:107) mention that it takes 7 minutes to cook a mussel, but Jenkins (1974:188) quotes Webb and Jarnette who state that steamed mussels could be cooked in 20 seconds on a hot pebble bed. Considering the sandstone found at the site which must have been heated to very high degree, it is quite possible the mussels were steamed. For one thing, it is a fast way to cook several mussels at once. Again, because there were so few burned shells found at the site, the mussels were probably either boiled or steamed. Henshilwood, Jenkins and Parkington (1994) discuss drying mussels in the sun, but since the site is in a floodplain area and quite wooded, this was probably not a possibility because of the amount of shade present. Shell Modification Other than breakage of the shells for meat extraction, none appeared to have been modified by the site inhabitants. Burned Shell Shells that are burnt at high degrees of heat deteriorate quicker than unburnt or slightly burnt shell. It appears the burned shells at site 41 TR 162 were subjected to a high degree of heat, although there were two or three fragments that were gray and probably subjected to low heat. The number of burned fragments (62) collected from the Green River Site was small and compared to the total number of shells collected from the site almost negligible. The interesting part is that most of the recognizable burned fragments were from P. dombeyanus (Bankclimber). Whether these shells were more susceptible to high temperature than the other shells is not known. It may have just been by chance alone that so many fragments were from P. dombeyanus. A group of mussel shells that had been exposed to moderate heat was encountered during the excavation in Block 1, Unit 4, from 30 to 40 centimeters below datum. This is the only concentration of mussels found that were heated to such a degree. These were some of the largest shells found in the excavation also. Whether the mussels were intentionally exposed to moderate heat or if it was an accident could not be determined. Unfortunately not enough of the midden was exposed to determine if there were concentrations of large mussels that had been exposed to moderate heat in order to determine if there was a hierarchy of mussel size per concentration.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 103 Site Abandonment Continuous predation on a specie of plant or animal results in two effects: 1) It reduces the amount of prey available, and 2) it decreases the size of the individual comprosing the prey population (Botkin 1980:125). Botkin (1980:132) presents a case study done by Hewett along the coast of California. Hewett removed 1,642 individuals of Mytilus californianus from one square yard, and after 30 months, the mollusks had not recolonized the area to their previous numbers. At site 41 TRI 62, there appears to have been a gradual increase in the use of shells to a maximum use and then a decline. In addition to the declining number of individuals, Botkin (1980: 132) mentions that procurement time for the mollusks would also increase. The scarcity of the mollusks could have lead to site abandonment. An easy access to food resources became depJeted and another food gathering strategy had to be implemented. It appears, however, that site abandonment occurred when the use of mollusks as a food source ceased. Of course, there are many outside factors that could have affected site abandonment; this is only one potential reason. For whatever reason the site was abandoned, AR Consultant's hypothesis that mussel size decreased over time appears to be correct. Conclusion The Rough Green site was probably inhabited during the fall or summer when the mussels were easily gathered because the water in Walker Branch would be lower at that time. During the time the site was inhabited, Walker Branch's channel and environment was probably similar to that of the Trinity River today. Freshwater mussels were used likely as a diet supplement, never as a main food source. Lintz (1996), based on his study of the nutritional values of mussels from the Colorado and Concho Rivers, suggests that mussels can be important in the diet of humans and should not be considered starvation subsistence. Although the exact amount of food derived from the mussels available to the site inhabitants can not be determined exactly since there are no soft parts, an approximation of the longest period that the mussels would have provided nutrients can be made which is 14 days for a group of 25 people. The pressure placed on the mussel population by the site inhabitants probably decreased the number of mussels in Walker Branch as well as extended the gathering time which may have lead to site abandonment.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 107 A total of 2463 vertebrate specimens were analyzed from 41 TR 162. The purpose of the analysis was to identify the taxa present and to discern any cultural patterning evident on individual specimens or in the assemblage as a whole. Additionally, non-cultural processes information was also gathered in hopes of determining what impact they may have had in influencing the cultural patterns. Methods Specimens were analyzed using the University of North Texas, Institute of Applied Sciences Zooarchaeology Laboratory comparative collection. Identifications were made based on visual comparison with these specimens. Identifications that were equivocal were either taken to the next higher level (e.g., from genus to family level) or were given "c.f." as a prefix to indicate that the specimen compared favorably with the taxon but the identification was not certain. Attributes were recording using a vertebrate faunal analysis coding system (Shaffer and Baker 1992) and were entered into a computer for tabulation. Attributes recorded included taxon, element, portion of element, siding, age criteria, aging, weathering, breakage, impact, burning, gnawing, cut marks and location, chemical dissolution, and a comments field recorded additional information such as notation of pathologies or descriptions of cut marks. The remains were tabulated using two methods (Table 1) . The number of identified specimens (NISP), or simple specimen count, was tabulated for each category of identification. The minimum number of individuals (MNI) was computed as a single aggregate for the site based on element, portion of element, and aging criteria for each unique taxonomic group, usually at the genus level. In some cases, categories were combined for this estimation. For example, all "c.f." categories were combined with their respective positively identified counterparts. Specimens identified as Artiodactyla were combined with those identified as Odocoileus sp. (deer) since no other deer-sized artiodactyls such as pronghorn were identified in the assemblage. Broad categories such as Osteichthyes (fish) or Mammalia (mammals) were not tabulated by MNI. Taphonomic information was recorded for each specimen including both natural and cultural processes. Weathering was recorded as "Light" or "Marked" depending on the AR Consultants

River legacy Park Archaeology 109 having marked weathering. Breakage was recorded as being unbroken, angularly fractured, or spirally fractured. Angular fractures are produced in bones that usually do not spirally fracture (e .g., fish bone, cranial elements, turtle shell) or when bone has lost its collagen (Johnson 1985). Spiral fractures are most common in long bones and occur when the bone still contains collagen (Johnson 1985). Often spiral fractures are produced as a result of intentional breakage of the bone for the removal of the marrow or for processing into grease (Lintz 1976:87-88). This intentional breakage is often produced by percussion, resulting in impact marks on the bone (Johnson 1985). These were noted as well. Burning was noted as either being charred, burned black, or calcined, burned white. Charring results in the more incomplete combustion of the bone whereas calcination is a more complete burning of the bone. Both forms were observed in the assemblage. Two types of gnawing were noted in the assemblage. Rodent gnawing was evidenced by the parallel grooved gnaw marks typically produced by rodent incisors. Carnivore gnawing was evidenced by punctures through the bone walls and also by tooth drag marks found in association with punctures. Cut marks were recorded as per their number and location when observed. Any marks deemed equivocal were not recorded as cut marks. With the exception of one specimen with a chop mark, all of the cut marks observed appear to have been made with stone tools as evidenced by multiple grooves produced in the apex of each cut. TAPHONOMIC OBSERVATIONS Most of the assemblage exhibited light weathering with only 25 specimens noted with marked weathering. This indicates that the assemblage was probably buried fairly rapidly and did not have prolonged exposure to the environment. Further indication of the good preservation of the remains is evidenced by the fact that nine specimens were recovered that still contained collagen or bone grease as evidenced by their greasy feel and luster. While initially it was felt that the bones may be recently intrusive into the assemblage, most were recovered from deeper levels (Level 4 or deeper), and thus the bones do not appear intrusive. None of the bones identified with bone grease were rodent remains. However, given the excellent preservation, it is possible that some rodent remains that appear to be more recent as indicated by bone condition and staining may part of the original cultural assemblage.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 110 The majority of the assemblage was fragmented with just 85 specimens being recorded as complete, most of which were teeth, phalanges, or podials. Of the bones recovered that typically can break in a spiral manner (n=841 ), 468 were recorded with spiral fractures. Additionally, nine specimens were identified with impact fractures that indicated the bone had been struck. Of the nine, seven were on elements identified as Artiodactyla and two were on specimens identified from canid/deer-sized mammals, probably also Artiodactyla. While the amount of spiral fractures was high, there was no indication of grease processing that would have been evidenced by the recovery of large quantities of small spirally fractured pieces (Lintz 1976:87-88). Instead, the bone was probably broken for marrow removal. Burning was not common in the assemblage. Only 215 (9%) specimens were identified with burning. Of these, 166 were charred and 49 were calcined. Cut marks were identified on five specimens. Of these, two were identified on deer, two on deer-sized artiodactyls, and one on a canid/deer-sized mammal. Cuts on the deer bones were located on the proximal radius with five transverse cuts on the anterior portion next to where it would articulate with the humerus, and one transverse cut on a naviculo-cuboid across the lateral aspect. Cuts on the artiodactyl bones were identified on the neck region of a femur (four transverse cuts) and on a tibia shaft fragment (five transverse cuts). Lastly, a transverse chop mark was identified on a canid/deer-sized mammal femur shaft fragment. Gnaw marks were identified on six specimens. Three specimens had rodent gnaw marks and three had carnivore gnaw marks. The carnivore gnaw marks appear to be more damaging because of the potential for consumption that would result in digestive damage (Andrews 1990). A total of nine specimens were identified with chemical etching, some of which potentially could have resulted from carnivore ingestion. Neither gnawing or chemical etching appear to have significantly affected the assemblage. TAXONOMIC REPRESENTATION OF THE ASSEMBLAGE Analysis of the taxa (Table 1) indicates that the assemblage is dominated by various turtles, artiodactyls ( deer), cotton rats and cottontail rabbits. The presence of bison remains also cannot be ignored. Even though represented by low numbers, the bison potentially represented a large amount of potential resources. However, the only two unequivocal bison elements recovered were a complete proximal phalange and a complete calcaneus, neither of which are associated with meat-bearing areas of the animal. Neither specimen exhibited any sign of cultural modification either. While the bison bones may represent culturally introduced specimens to the site, why just these specimens are represented is not known. Other taxa are represented in lower numbers also, but do not appear to be significant economic resources, although they also may have been used for non-utilitarian purposes that would not be evident in the assemblage.

River Legacy Park Archaeology 111 remains included both water turtles and box turtles. Turtles represent a fairly easily obtained resource, especially if procured on land where their slow speed makes them easy to procure. The presence of turtles indicates that the site was occupied during warmer months when turtles would be active, although in Texas, the senior author has observed pond turtles active during every month of the year even in winter months during warm periods. Cotton rats represent the taxon recovered with the highest MNI for the site. All but one of the specimens recovered were mandibles and associated teeth. The may be due to the use of 1/4" screening, or potentially that cotton rats were processed for food and the mandibles represent the largest surviving elements. None of the cotton rat elements exhibited any signs of unequivocal cultural modification or even burning. Cottontail rabbits were represented by two individuals. Unlike cotton rats, cottontail rabbits were better represented by other portions of the skeleton. However, no rabbits remains exhibited any unequivocal signs of cultural modification or burning. Deer and deer-sized artiodactyls are represented by most portions of the skeleton totaling 191 specimens and at least three individuals. The ages of the animals represented varied between fawn-aged specimens (e .g., mandible with erupted deciduous and unerupted permanent tooth buds, unfused metapodials) to at least one older adult represented by an upper molar worn nearly to the root. The combined high representation and presence of cut marks indicates that deer represent the primary economic resource represented at the site. Additionally, the high number of remains identified as canid/deer-sized mammal (n=640) most likely were from deer-sized artiodactyls, but were too fragmented for more specific identification. Nearly half (n=295) of those specimens exhibited spiral fracturing. Thus, taxa representation, breakage data including impact fractures, and age data indicate that deer appear to have been the primary animal resource .. Bison was represented by two elements, one middle phalange and one calcaneus. Both were complete and neither element was modified except by natural processes. Additionally, another nine specimens were identified as being from deer/bison-sized mammals. These were most likely from bison as indicated by the extreme thickness of the cortical bone wall thickness and specimen sizes. Six of these specimens exhibited spiral fracturing, but none exhibited impact fractures or was burned. While bison has the potential to represent a considerable amount of resources for the human inhabitants at the site, the unusual representation of only foot elements being identified is perplexing. It is possible that a greater concentration of bison remains occurred elsewhere in the site than was excavated. Other taxa occurred in much lower numbers. Fish are represented by vertebrae and various cranial elements. Catfish was represented by a single pectoral spine fragment and drum by a dental element. Aside from turtles, nine non-poisonous snake vertebrae were recovered, representing the only other reptile identified at the site. Bird remains were almost non-existent with one small bird, four large bird, and one probably turtle wing AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 112 element. Infrequently recovered mammal remains included opossum, squirrel, vole, probable wood rat, racoon, and bobcat. None of these taxa would be unexpected for the reg10n. TAXONOMIC REPRESENTATION BY BLOCK Presented in Table 2 are the NISPs for each of the taxa recovered by block number. Those specimens recovered from trenches, back dirt, or test pits were designated with block "0". There are horizontal differences in representation of taxa and taphonomy. Block 0 Excavations outside of the designated blocks produced the smallest sample of 40 specimens. Taxa representation is low, as would be expected given the small sample size. Turtle and deer makeup the majority of the identifiable remains, plus the only two positive bison identifications came from non-block areas. The taphonomy of this grouping consists of 37 broken specimens, of which seven (out of 18 possible) were spirally fractured. No impact fractures were identified. Only two specimens were burned, both being calcined. No specimens exhibited gnawing, chemical etching, or cut marks. All specimens were recorded as having light weathering. Block 1 Block 1 excavations produced the largest and most diverse sample with 1418 specimens recovered. Most of the fish remains recovered are from this block, as are a high amount of turtle remains, various small mammals including vole, cotton rat, and deer and deer sized artiodactyls. The taphonomy of Block 1 consists of 1368 broken specimens, of which 181 (o ut of 360 possible) had spiral fractures. Three specimens were recorded with impact fractures, all being deer-sized artiodactyl elements. Burning was recorded on 155 specimens, of which 133 were charred and 22 calcined. Three specimens were noted with rodent gnawing. Two specimens exhibited cut marks. Twenty specimens exhibited marked weathering and the rest with light weathering. Block 2 Block 2 excavations produced a sample of 104 specimens with most of the identifiable remains being turtle, cotton rat, and medium-sized artiodactyl. The taphonomy of Block 2 consists of 101 broken specimens, of which 39 were spirally fractured. The total number of specimens likely to produce spiral fractures totaled only 34 specimens. Thus, spiral fractures were identified on specimens that usually do not spirally fracture. One deer-sized artiodactyl element exhibited an impact fracture. Ten specimens were burned, of which six were charred and four calcined. Two specimens exhibited chemical etching. No specimens were cut. All specimens were lightly weathered. AR Consultants

River Legacy Park Archaeology 114 two on canid/deer-sized mammalian remains. Burning was observed on 48 specimens, of which 27 were charred and 21 calcined. Four specimens exhibited chemical etching. Three specimens were cut. All but five specimens were lightly weathered. MEDICAL DISORDER One medium-sized artiodactyl thoracic vertebra was recovered that exhibited an unusual growth on the dorsal surface of the neural arch. The lack of ebemation (wear facets) on this growth indicates that it did not interfere with articulation or movement between the pathological vertebra and the next vertebra. There is no indication that the cause was due to trauma. SUMMARY The 41 TRI 62 faunal assemblage is dominated by the remains of turtle and deer-sized artiodactyls, with much lesser representations of rodents, rabbits, fish, and bison which may also represent potential economic resources that were utilized less extensively. In general, the assemblage is well preserved, although highly fragmented. Much of the fragmentation appears to be the result of intentional breakage, probably for marrow processing of the deer-sized artiodactyl remains. This corresponds with cut marks also found primarily on deer-sized artiodactyl and mammal specimens. Burning was noted, but does not appear to represent a significant taphonomic factor. A few specimens were noted with rodent and carnivore gnawing. The presence of carnivore gnawing and the additional specimens noted with chemical dissolution may indicate that carnivore action (ingestion) may have resulted in the loss of a small percentage of the assemblage. Additionally, few specimens exhibited marked weathering. The presence of mostly light weathering and grease retention in some elements indicates the assemblage was buried, and hence preserved, soon after abandonment.
