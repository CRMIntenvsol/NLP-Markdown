MANAGEMENT SUMMARY This volume contains the summary report of the prehistoric archaeological and paleoecological investigations undertaken by the Archaeology Research Program of Southern Methodist University within the Joe Pool Lake Reservoir southwest of Dallas, Texas. Joe Pool Lake is being constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, for the purposes of flood control, recreation, and water supply. The archaeological investigations were conducted to mitigate the impact of the proposed construction of the floodwater retarding structure, associated park facilities, and the eventual inundation of the lake area. This report presents the results of the archaeological investigations of 6 prehistoric sites in the Joe Pool Lake project area under contract DACW63-84-C-0146. The excavation of six sites within the project area revealed that the use of the Mountain Creek drainage was never very intensive during the prehistoric period. Excavation of sites 41DL189, 41DL184, and 41DL199 revealed primarily Late Archaic occupational refuse while the Cobb-Pool (41DL148) and Baggett Branch (41DL149) sites revealed distinctive Late Prehistoric occupations. Definition of occupational intensity, changing subsistence patterns, and activity was hindered by site contexts which have been altered by both cultural and natural forces through time. Nevertheless, sites 41DL199 and 41DL184 provide important evidence concerning site modification processes. Modification processes in the form of bioturbation (tree root action and rodent burrowing), pedoturbation (shrinking and swelling of clay soil) and cultural activities (digging of baking ovens) have produced the vertical distributions recognized at site 41DL199. The recognition of gilgai related pedofeatures at site 41DL184 and the profound effect of vertisolic movement on artifact contexts provid.es a new perspective upon the recognition of features and occupation surfaces within the Black.land prairie region of North Central Texas. The investigations of the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) revealed an adaptation not previously documented in the Prairie/Cross Timbers margin of North Central Texas. The short term nature of the site combined with a favorable depositional context have permitted the unique preservation of a significant portion of a horticultural community within the Mountain Creek drainage. Three probable house structures and associated features, an area for food processing and cooking within earth ovens, drying and/or storage platforms, and a likely refuse area comprise the community patterning of the Cobb-Pool site. The radiocarbon dates derived from charcoal suggest that the site was occupied during the first half of the thirteenth century. The Baggett Branch site (41DL149) was also primarily occupied during the Late Prehistoric period. The depositional environment of the site, however, did not provide for the separation of the two, and perhaps three, occupations of the site. The latest occupation, dating to A.O. 1500, is characterized by the exploitation of bison, steeply chipped, "Plains" style end scrapers, and shell tempered ceramic wares similar to the Nocona Plain wares found to the north and west. The discussion of the excavated sites is followed by Part III which presents the results of specialized studies. Magnetometer survey results, the geological context of the Mountain Creek drainage, raw material availability, and analyses of the lithic reduction strategies and projectile point variability are presented. The latter two sections present data sets which raise important questions concerning the interpretation of site function and regional interaction spheres. The Synthesis section which follows focuses on subsistence patterns represented by the Joe Pool Lake assemblages, an evaluation of the research design, and the placement of the Joe Pool Lake assemblages within a regional perspective.

Volume I, Part One 7 channel slope of 10 feet per mile result in rapid runoff and sharp crested flood hydrographs. The average annual sediment loss of the Mountain Creek drainage (2.5 acre feet per square mile) is consequently significantly greater than other streams in Central Texas (Allen 1977: 50-57). N Soil associations mapped within the Mountain Creek Basin are determined by the underlying geology. The clay soils associated with the underlying chalk and shales are vertisolic in nature and exhibit high shrink swell capacities. Gilgai microrelief is commonly associated with these clays on terraces and in the floodplain. Sandy soils are present along the upper ;\)\ ~ ~f:~if:~<;-~:):> reaches of Walnut Creek where the Woodbine sands have been weathered. Plant associations correspond closely to the soil distributions. The more porous escrupment, the ?\\{\}\'.~.~ Cross· Timbers soils, and the floodplain immediately adjacent to the major streams are conducive to the maintenance of larger woody vegetation. The heavy clay soils, on the other hand, support the mid and tall grasses of the North Central Texas prairies. Modern fanning practices and urban sprawl have contributed to the deterioration of the natural environment of the Mountain Creek Basin; consequently, the distribution of plant communities prior to Anglo settlement is masked by cutting, clearing, and cultivation. Whether or not the present plant-soil associations were necessarily stable during prehistoric times is unknown. Examination of the early historic vegetation zones and the paleoenvironmental data of North Central Texas was therefore implemented so that the prehistoric setting within the Mountain Creek Basin might be modeled. kllomelers EARLY HISTORIC VEGETATION ZONES IS) Short and Mid-grass Prairie D Blackland Prairie The composition and distribution of plant E3 II Oak-Juniper Savannah Post Oak Savannah communities play an integral role in human ecology as reflected by settlement and subsistence strategies.

This lack of pollen data pollen recovered from rockshelters and alluvial deposits forces researchers to depend upon data from surrounding in the Osage Hills of northeastern Oklahoma (Hall regions (Perttula et al. 1986:29; Bruseth et al. 1987a) 1982:391-395).

22 Environmental Background upon the accuracy of the radiocarbon dates. It is worthy of note that the three lower dates recovered between 58 and 128 cm below the surface are statistically equivalent. The correlation of older dates with increasing depth is encouraging, but some caution concerning undue reliance upon this data base alone is necessary. A change in the radiocarbon dates, particularly that of 2125 B. P. (175 B.C.), would change influx rates and affect the interpretation of a depositional hiatus. Buck Creek Marsh also provided a 1.45 m core, but only the upper 80 cm produced statistically valid pollen grain counts (Figure 2-8). Holloway (1985) interprets the basal samples as representing an oak-hickory forest with an open canopy. The subsequent influx of pine and willow pollen is interpreted as an indicators of the onset of drier conditions. Unfortunately the presence of only one radiocarbon date at the base of the column precludes any assignment of a temporal scale for this trend. The suggestion of Holloway (1985) and Bruseth et al. (1987a:5-15) that the timing of the drying trend may be estimated is mere speculation. The pollen record for North Central Texas is inadequate at this time. The forthcoming data from Ferndale Bog should be interesting; however, the application of such data to surrounding regions may be difficult. The topographic elevation of the Ouachita Mountains may have buffered the Ferndale Bog area from more dramatic vegetational shifts which occurred .t.t,"J" elsewhere. Further removed from North Central Texas, the pollen data from the Osage Hills area of Oklahoma f-"'""--------------l (Hall 1982), indicate a moist period between A. D. I and "'"1.1q 950 followed by a drying trend lasting until the present. Bryant and Holloway (1985:63) suggest that a similar drying trend began in North Central Texas around A. D. 400. Whether this suggested temporal framework will stand the test of time remains to be seen. SEDIMENTOLOGICAL EVIDENCE Sedimentological evidence in the form of J geological and pedological studies related to archaeological studies is rapidly accumulating for the al Southern Plains and adjacent areas. The studies included here document regional alluvial sequences and provide possible paleoecological interpretations. Figure 2-8.

In 1948, archaeological surveys of stem of the Trinity River (Hanna 1940b; Hatzenbue"hler four proposed reservoirs in the Dallas-Fort Worth area 1942a; Kirkland 1942) were also reported. Reports of were conducted by Robert L. Stephenson for the River DAS test excavations were published for two East Fork Basin Surveys. The River Basin Surveys (RBS) was a sites; Raglan (Hatzenbuehler 1942b) and Butler Hole cooperative program between the National Park Service (Housewright et al. 1947). and the U. S.

This consisted of reservoirs were Lake Benbrook (on the Clear Fork of the a series of post holes outlining an elliptical-shaped Trinity River), Lake Grapevine (on Denton Creek), structure measuring 13 foot 7 inch by 10 foot 1 inch. A Garza-Little Elm (on the Elm Fork, later renamed Lake hearth was located near the center, and burned shell Lewisville), and Lavon (on the East Fork). tempered daub was found along the walls. Also among No sites were found at Benbrook (Stephenson the more interesting reports from this period was 1949c), while none of the few sites discovered at Wilson's (1946) article describing the large circular Grapevine were considered worthy of further work depressions found at many of the larger sites of the East (Stephenson 1948). The RBS investigations were Fork drainage. coµcentrated at Lavon on the East Fork, and at Garza By the late 1940s, sufficient data had been Little Elm on the Elm Fork where a number of sites were collected from Dallas area sites to allow the publication recommended for major excavations (Stephenson of preliminary trait lists for four of the larger East Fork 1949a). Aside from survey, Stephenson had also sites. These were the Lower Rockwall site (Harris conducted test excavations at two Lake Lavon sites in 1948a), the Butler Hole site (Housewright et al. 1948), 1948, Campbell Hole and Hogge Bridge. At Campbell the Raglan site (Hatzenbuehler 1948), and the Upper Hole, excavation into an erosional bank of the East Rockwall site (Harris 1948b). These trait lists would Fork channel partially exposed a purported house floor later become the basis for the definition of the Wylie with a central hearth. No post holes were found, but focus.

The purpose was to identify a variety of Reservoir (Bousman and Verrett 1973, later renamed settlement types, ranging from large permanent base Lake Ray Roberts).

The initial work at Joe Pool Lake (formerly The evidence for Paleo-Indian occupation of the Lakeview Lake) was a site survey in 1977 and 1978 that Upper Trinity River drainage consists primarily of recorded 17 sites with evidence of prehistoric diagnostic lanceolate projectile points from surface occupation (Skinner and Conners 1979). Based on collections, or from subsurface contexts where they were survey data, it was suggested that prehistoric utilization found mixed stratigraphically with later materials. One of the lake area was seasonal, and by groups from example is the Field Ranch site in the upper Elm Fork outside of the Mountain Creek drainage. Based on the drainage.

PREHISTORIC RESEARCH DESIGN by Duane E.

Moreover, must provide bridging arguments in order to relate archaeology provides the opportunity to test objects of the past to a behavioral context.

Although the study of cultural processes is the ultimate goal of contemporary archaeology (Thomas 1979), the construction of culture chronologies and the THEORETICAL MODEL reconstruction of prehistoric lifeways are frequently the end result. Little progress towards understanding culture An understanding of the settlement/subsistence pat process is made. The failure of archaeologists to terns within the Joe Pool Lake area and the biophysical explicitly define appropriate processual questions has factors which may have affected those patterns has been contributed to this situation. The proposed research for the goal of all phases of archaeological investigation at the Joe Pool Lake area is designed to overcome this Joe Pool Lake (Skinner and Connors 1979; Raab 1982). problem by not only providing a refined culture history Such attempts to understand the interaction between but also an understanding of the processes of culture environment and culture are commonly considered to be change within the region. part of an ecological approach.

Volume l, Part One 37 13NVIRONMBNr The examination of these postulated relationships within the static archaeological record requires the definition of measurable empirical correlates (fable 4-1). Unfortunately, the measurement of the analytical dimensions proposed by Plog (1974) is not an easy task. Population estimates and energy provide the SUBSISTENCB TECHNOLOGY greatest challenge for measurement. Population estimates may be provided by detailed comparisons of chronometric artifact and ecofact densities and synchronic spatial density differences (Perring 1982). Such measurement, however, depends upon strict control over periodicity of cultural episodes.

The 1980 features have been redesignated to facilitate discussion and to avoid confusion concerning the two sets of features (Table 5-7). The features will be presented according to their stratigraphic position within the floodplain deposits. Although two or more features occurring at a similar elevation within a stratigraphic MN unit, but at different loci, are not necessarily the result of a single occupation, they are likely contemporaneous given a more gross time scale. 0 10 cm STRATUM 4 FEATURES 0 BumedRock Five features appear within the stratum 4 matrix. @ BasalRock Four of these features (12, 10, 9, and 7) were recorded during the 1980 excavation.

FEATURE 1 This scatter of burned rock was the deepest feature encountered during the 1985 excavations (Figure 5-2). The fluctuating waters of Mountain Creek and the result ing swelling and shrinking of the clays have likely disrupted the original context of this probable hearth area. A small quantity of burned bone and mussel shell was associated with the burned rock. Flecks of charcoal and baked clay were most common at the southeast end of this irregular cluster of burned rock (Figure 5-5). No Unit 26 depression or pit was visible within the cross-section profile of this feature, even though the burned rock was dispersed over a 20 cm vertical span. The charcoal col lected was insufficient for radiometric dating; however, a 0 IO '----J cm humate sample collected immediately adjacent within the Stratum 4 sediments (96.6 - 96.5 m elevation) yielded a 0 Burned Rock (96.4 m elevation) date of 510 ± 60 B.C.

Volume I, Part Two 53 FEATURE 6 Feature 6, similarly situated at the contact of strata 3 and 4, was located 20 m upstream from Feature 13. The erosional action of the stream had disturbed the primary context of a probable hearth. The 1 x .5 m excavation area exposed a scatter of burned rock. No other cultural material was recovered. FEATURE 11 Feature 11 represents the northernmost occurrence MN of burned rock eroding from the cut bank which exposed site 41DL189. Excavation of a 1.2 x .6 m unit revealed a concentration of five small slabs of limestone and some charcoal flecking (Figure 5-7) at an elevation of 97 .08 m. One faunal element, that of a cottontail rabbit, was recovered (Murry 1982:252). No other cultural material was noted within Feature 11. FEATURE 3 Feature 3 is an irregular, basin-shaped hearth and was exposed in Units 23 and 24. Unlike many of the Cut Bank other hearths exposed at this site, it was not rock lined. The matrix within the irregular basin was distinguished by a diffuse scatter of charcoal and associated bone and shell. The basin is approximately 1 m in diameter and it extends into the south wall of Units 23 and 24 (Figure 5-8). The basin is 15 cm deep (Figure 5-8). Burned rocks are concentrated near the west edge of the basin. Stratigraphically, this feature appears just below Feature 2 and an associated scatter of burned rock (Figure I 5-2).

The checkerboard pattern of units E90 quickly revealed features within the northern portion of the sample area. ln order to expose these features and the horizontal distribution of artifacts in relation to the features, a small block of contiguous units was excavated. The checkerboard pattern was continued to the south as a means of sampling areas not containing S110 formal features. It is evident from the summary table (Appendix 2- B) that not all excavation units reached the sterile zone. All units were excavated into the surface of the underlying Pleistocene gravels. Excavation of deeper levels of excavation units within the block and in several of the test units revealed that the number of artifacts recovered was insignificant in light of the higher artifact densities above the gravels and the [ill 29 increased effort needed to sort through the gravel.

Apparently, Quartzite was a distant second, accounting for only the attempt to bifacially reduce this gravel was about 4% of the total debitage. Silicified wood made up abandoned. The two remaining specimens are core 0.6%, and all other materials comprised 0.7%. The fragments.

88 Site 41DL199 Density (Number per cubic meter) The most obvious evidence for vertical mixing of the site deposit is the distribution of recent historic 50 100 150 Leve1.----..,__ ___. __ __. .._ __ artifacts. These materials were deposited during the present century on a surface that was most likely the same as exists today. The recovery of single fragments I of glass from as deep as level 5 in the cleared area and level 9 in the wooded area certainly indicates that 2 vertical displacement has occurred. However, the vast majority of historic-age artifacts have remained within the uppermost levels of the site deposit. Markedly 3 different distributions are displayed by the two site areas 4 (Figure 6-13), and this reflects deflation of the uppermost deposit in the cleared area due to plowing and subsequent erosion. This difference is also evident in 5 the overall distribution of artifacts, and is discussed further in the following section of this chapter. 6 When the vertical distribution of historic age artifacts is compared to those of the Late Prehistoric 7 period arrow points and Late Archaic period dart points, it is obvious that these distributions overlap consider 8 ably. Because so few projectile points were recovered from units in the cleared field, these patterns are best 9 illustrated with data from the wooded area (Figure 6-14). Even there, arrow and dart points were far fewer in 10 number than were historic artifacts. The historic artifacts were densest in levels 1 through 3, although a few were recovered from below this depth. Arrow points Wooded Area were present in levels 2 through 6, with highest densi ties in levels 3 and 4. Dart points, although densest in Cleared Area levels 4 and 5, were recovered from levels I through 8. In very general terms, there is a tendency for older artifacts to occur with greater frequency in deeper levels Figure 6-13. Densities of recent historic period artifacts than is the case for younger artifacts. For example, the by excavation level, Site 41DL199. highest densities of Late Archaic dart points occur about one level lower than that of Late Prehistoric period In a non-aggrading situation, variation in the arrow points. However, the overlap of these vertical vertical proveniences would be due to their differential distributions is much greater than would be expected of downward displacement, and vertical mixing of a truly stratified site deposit. We suggest that this type diagnostics would be expected. It is still possible, of diagnostic artifact distribution might be expected in a however, that older artifacts might tend to underlie non-aggrading context. Materials from at least three those dating later in time simply because they have had sequential occupations have moved downward from a a longer time and therefore greater opportunity for similar surface level. The slight tendency for older vertical displacement. The problem is how to artifacts to underlie those from more recent occupations distinguish between this and the truly aggrading is due primarily to the greater length of time since their situation that has been altered somewhat by post deposition. They have simply had more time for vertical depositional disturbances. displacement through natural soils processes.

Of course, the action of post form of bioturbation (tree root action and rodent depositional processes makes the recognition of burrowing), pedoturbation (shrinking and swelling of distinctive patterns more difficult; nevertheless, we feel clay soil), and cultural activities (digging of baking that the patterns revealed by the artifact distributions ovens) have produced the vertical distributions discussed support one hypothesis more than the other. above.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS THE HARRIS COLLECTION The ceramic collection from the Cobb-Pool site is The Harris collection was examined at the the largest from any site in the Mountain Creek Smithsonian Institution prior to the initiation of the drainage and affords the only opportunity to understand mitigation field work. A total of 80 sherds was the types of ceramics in use in this portion of North examined and photographed, of which 49 were Central Texas between A.D. 1000 and 1200. The most decorated. Little information was derived from the plain common additive to the paste was grog or a sherds. Of the 31 undecorated sherds, 25 were tempered combination of grog with another additive, such as with grog, five were tempered with grog and bone, and bone or quartz. However, shell tempered sherds were one was tempered with ironstone. Most sherds had a also recovered. The most common decorative motifs fine textured paste.

Other common decorative motifs discussion is limited to the decorated ceramics. included diagonal incised lines, concentric incised lines, Of the 49 decorated sherds, 44 were grog tempered, crosshatched incised lines, or combinations of these two were tempered with grog and bone, one was elements with punctations.

Other vessels exhibited sherds ranged in size from 2 to 9 cm in maximum interior pitting indicative of cookware, or interior dimension, although most sherds fell within the 3 to 4 sooting idicative of inverted use of the vessel over a cm range. Nearly all the sherds fell between 5 and 10 fire or use of a vessel to carry fire. Some vessels mm in thickness; only 4 sherds were less than 5 mm exhibit characteristics of both types of uses, suggesting thick. Exterior colors ranged from very dark gray that the same vessel used for cooking was also used for (10YR3/l) to yellowish brown (10YR6/4). Interior storing the leftovers. Although this interpretation is colors ranged from very dark gray to reddish brown speculative, since it is based on characteristics found on (5YR5/3) and pinkish gray (7.5YR6/2). a limited number of relatively small sherds, there is The sherds were decorated using four methods; evidence which suggests that these attributes accurately incising (21 sherds), punctation (19 sherds), punctation reflect these types of uses of ceramic vessels (Halley with incising (8 sherds), and brushing (1 sherd). Several 1985). design element configurations identified in the SMU The ceramic analysis attempted to elicit the maxi collection were also present in the Harris collection. mum amount of information relating to manufacture, These include random punctations (16 sherds), linear form, and function of the Cobb-Pool ceramics. The arrangement of punctations (1 sherd), parallel incised discussion presented here has described the vessel lots lines (13 sherds), crosshatched incised lines (2 sherds), recognized by SMU researchers, the sherds not diagonal incised lines (3 sherds), diagonal incised lines assignable to vessel lots, and the sherds collected by R. with punctations (3 sherds), and parallel rows of King Harris. Since the Cobb-Pool site is essentially a fingernail punctations separated by incised lines (2 single component site, this description provides an sherds). This final design element configuration is very array of ceramic variability that might be expected at similar to Weches Fingernail Impressed, a type found in other sites in North Central Texas dating between A.D. East Texas between A.D. 1000 and 1200 (Suhm and 1000 and 1200. Jelks 1962) which is the same time frame indicated by the Cobb-Pool radiocarbon dates. One very distinctive BONE TOOLS design element configuration was observed in this collection which was not found in the SMU collection. Nine bone tools (fable 9-18) were recovered from This configuration is characterized by three series of the Cobb-Pool site: seven from Feature 2 and two from concentric incised lines separated by a field of small, units outside the 1985 excavation blocks.

If the assumption that all three clusters within the eastern half of Structure 1 along the structures were occupied concurrently is false, then the wall. The central area of the house is relatively clear of possibility of additional structures having been present debris. Unfortunately, the low values of the central area within the quarry area is more enhanced. Of course, it is are biased by the differential recovery techniques used in equally possible that another hamlet may have been the excavation of Units 10, 14, and 15 in 1979.

Proveniences: Testing Unit 4.2, 5.2, 24.1, 145.2. Side Scraper (1 specimen). This is a small Ogallala quartzite flake with cortex covering the distal end and almost half of its dorsal surface. One lateral edge has been steeply retouched to form an edge angle of approximately 90°. The other lateral edge has been marginally retouched along its entire length with a continuous single row of very small flake scars. It was recovered from Level 1 of Testing Unit 4a during the 1980-test excavations. a Scraper with Graver Spur (1 s p eci men, Figure 1 0 -7 /). This specimen is a broken portion of a chert flake that has been steeply retouched along one lateral edge. It is essentially a side b scraper, but it also exhibits a pointed graver spur at one end of this retouched edge. This tool was recovered from Level 3 of Unit 143. Marginally Modified Unifaces Marginal modification is defined by the presence of a single, non-stepped row of small flake scars along the edge of a flake. The edge angles of these marginally retouched flakes are relatively acute ( <45°). A number of morphological tool forms, based primarily on the shape of the retouched edge, are recognized. Borer (1 specimen, Figure 10-7g) This specimen has been unifacially chipped on the distal extremity of an interior, chert flake. The working edge is 21 mm in length. Unifacial modification of the dorsal surface of the flake produced a triangular shaped bit (planar view) which is 10 mm wide at its base. d Provenience: 274.2.

The higher than normal Since it is generally believed that shell tempering incidence of sand in the paste suggests that it might be occurs later in North Central Texas (Lynott 1977a; an intentional element of the paste.

Assuming that the site has been intentional additive. Both the temper and paste texture aggrading during the Late Prehistoric period, those sizes are medium (between .5 and 2 mm).

The sherd possesses with mostly shell temper, yet these sherds are located shell for temper, and the size of the temper particles is the deepest in the site.

Volume I, Part Two 231 Appendix 4-E). This is to be expected since this site represents one of the latest occupations excavated (A.D. 750 - 1500). This is particularly true of the gastropods (R. dealbatus, H. orbiculata, P. t. texasiana). It also yielded several redeposited aquatic species Helisoma anceps and Helisoma trivolvis lenta) both indicative of deeper, clear running streams with abundant littoral vegetation. FLORAL RESOURCES The 13 samples analyzed from site 41DL149 include three from Feature 2, one each from Features 3, 4, and 5, and one each from Units 154, 158, 162, 180, 188, 257, and 261. Results are presented in Table 10- 27, with weights of light and heavy fractions combined. Wood charcoal came from all samples with a total weight of 7.27 grams. Walnut shell totaling 2.21 g in weight, was recognized in all samples with the exception of Feature 4. Two samples, including Feature 4, contained nutshell pieces that could be either walnut or hickory, so they are placed in the Juglandaceae category. Considering the ubiquity of walnut shell at this site and the absence of distinctive hickory nutshell particles, it seems likely that these fragments, totaling 0.03 g in weight, are also walnut. If so, walnut shell would be present in all samples analyzed to date. Acom shell, weighing less than 0.01 g, was recognized in only one sample, Feature 2. Ten samples contained the material being D Black Loamy Clay classified as prairie turnip tuber (Psoralea sp.). Total weight for the site stands at 0.09 g.

Volume I, Part Two 233 FEATURES s14gr-----------------, Six features were encountered during the 1980 and E94 1985 field seasons at the Baggett Branch site. These features range from scatters of burned rock to formal hearths and a possible storage pit. FEATURE 1 Feature 1 was encountered in test excavation unit 2 in 1980 (Figure 10-12). This feature was recognized as a refuse pit extending to a depth of 85 cm below the surface (Raab 1982:23-24). Although the pit may have served secondarily as a refuse pit, it is more likely that the pit served as a baking oven or a storage pit. The fill of the pit, which included burned rocks, mussel shell, animal bone, and charcoal, likely reflects its use as a baking oven. The stratigraphic association of this pit is unclear. The actual orifice of the pit was not detected within the upper 30 cm of the dark loamy clay. The pit outline was observable only within the underlying brown clay S149 (Figure 10-12); consequently, the pit cannot be assigned to a particular component of the Baggett Branch site. Charcoal recovered from Feature 1 yielded a date of A.D. 1200 ± 200 years; however, the standard deviation of 200 years provides a broad temporal span from A.D. 1000 to 1400 for the use of Feature 1. Whether this feature is related to an early or late occupation of the site is unclear. FEATURE 2 Unit208 Feature 2 was a circular, basin-shaped pit approximately 90 to 95 cm in diameter (Figure 10-13). This pit, dug 60 cm below the present surface, likely functioned as a hearth. Burned rock and charcoal (Table 1 10-28) were common, especially in the eastern half of the pit.' As with Feature 1, the orifice of Feature 2 was not detected until the dark olive brown substratum was N encountered at 30 cm below the present ground surface. S150 Feature 2 yielded a wider variety of faunal remains L-________________ JE95 than most features.

MAGNETOMETER SURVEY RESULTS FOR SITES 41DL148, 41DL149 AND 41DL184 n 11 by J.

Historic and recent trash littered all Proton magnetometer survey of three sites in the sites and caused some interference of the magnetic field. Joe Pool Lake impact area was conducted by the Archaeometric Laboratory at Colorado State University. PRINCIPLES OF MAGNETOMETER The surveys were employed as an interpretive tool to SURVEYING quickly isolate interesting areas of the sites and identify subsurface archaeological features. However, due to Magnetometer surveying is a passive geophysical magnetic interference from geologic and metallic technique employed by archaeologists for the sources, interpretation of the survey results was difficult, identification and location of subsurface cultural features. and, often, non-archaeological sources were identified The technique requires no disturbance of the site from anomalies selected for archaeological elements or of the natural settings surrounding the site. investigation.

Many iron objects were also. identified in this area which may be the source of the higher intensity. The magnetic effects of the fence extending N-S along the E180 grid line were apparent over a 10 m girth surrounding the fence and obliterated any other magnetic sources in the area. Fortunately, no cultural features were identified during excavations in this portion of the site. This should serve as a warning, however, that the effects from large iron objects can not always be satisfactorily filtered to allow visibility of cultural feature sources. It is best to avoid such situations whenever feasible. The gravel backdirt pile in tlie eastern-central portion of the grid was also magnetic and may have obscured the more subtle magnetism resulting from archaeological features. The results from the magnetometer survey of site 41DL148 are discouraging. The combined magnetic interference of small iron objects, barbwire fences, and previous test excavations produced a poor environment for location of archaeological features. However, just as important a consideration is the inappropriate survey @] interval used on this site. When the survey interval was 12a selected for this site, the surficial evidence and the previous archaeological work indicated that the survey should aim for location of larger (> 1.0 m diameter) features. In addition, the previous magnetometer work (Huggins et al. 1987) indicated archaeological features might be anticipated which would be magnetically recognizable at 1.0 m survey intervals. Unfortunately, most of the features identified on this site were 0.5 m in diameter or smaller. Even with features of 1.0 m diameters, it is statistically improbable to sample the center of a feature at 1.Q m survey intervals. So, not sampling six of eight smaller features is quite within the ~_L_:::2:.t!-~---.L=:::-,.__ _J\'L_\\L+Sl40 statistical probability of sampling an area at 1.0 m E80 ElOO (twice the feature size) survey intervals.

Volume I, Part Three 257 anomalies (not selected for preliminary testing) were tested during archaeological investigations and were found to correlate with pedofeatures which are the result of gilgai formations. The anomalies were monopolar with high intensities and were generally symmetrical. Three anomalies, F3a, F3b, and I2a, were selected for their uncanny resemblance to pithouse anomalies in the American Southwest (Huggins 1984a). A test excavation over one of these anomalies, however, did not produce any cultural features. Anomalies 14a, 14b, and 14c are similar to these anomalies, but not quite as strong in intensity. Anomalies on the western grid were primarily the result of recent and historic trash sources. A trash pit located in the northeastern portion of the grid produced a generalized high intensity area of approximately 7 x 5 m diinensions. Part of a barbwire fence stuck in a tree in the southeastern comer produced a complex of two dipole fields. Other high intensity regions noted about the grid lacked symmetrical shape, and were therefore, not selected for investigation. The burial and burial pit, located in the northeastern portion of the eastern grid, was not magnetically visible. However, the burial pit was barely recognizable in the field excavations from surrounding material, and it is doubtful that a decomposed body would produce sufficient change in the magnetism to the surrounding area to be detectable with magnetic surveys. SUMMARY The proton magnetometer survey conducted on sites within the Joe Pool Reservoir area was not as productive as initially projected. Based on previous work in central Texas by Huggins et al. (1987), the magnetic visibility of certain cultural features was unquestionably obvious. Occasionally, cultural anomalies had positive intensities of up to 400 gammas. However, the situation at the Joe Pool Lake E200 E210 sites was very different. On two of the sites, the 0 2.5 magnetic variation was relatively small and low DI I I I II m intensity anomalies were identified for investigation. Most of these anomalies were found to be associated Excavation Blocks with geological features referred to as gilgai formations, gravel lenses, buried metal and, variations in the soil and topographic features. Two archaeological features 30 0 -20 -50 -70 were not visible magnetically from these two sites; one possibly due to interference from a piece of iron in the vicinity and one possibly due to the very slight fill .1 Gamma Units change within the pit feature.

'---' and 5) resting unconformably over the lower, Valley streamward slope of the levee (Figure 12-10). All but Margin zone 4 in these deposits is primarily clay. Zone 4 is comprised of thin laminae of silt and mud. Zone 2 is silty clay loam with a strong soil development and calcium carbonate. These observations lead to the Levee interpretation that the levee is of considerable age, Floodplain /l probably early Holocene, and that the floodplain strata - are significantly younger. The fine laminae of zone 4 Bl!Tl e • which have undergone little age-related alteration "" indicate that all of the deposits in the fluted floodplain are very recent, possibly even the result of modem land clearing in the valley. Housed at the Archaeology Research Program facilities at S.M.U. in Dallas are samples from zones 1 and 2 suitable for radiocarbon dating of humates. These would give an indication of the age of this levee. Figure 12-9. Sketch map of geomorphic locality 8.

Also, flooding outside of a deep channel clay and sand of presumed Pleistocene age.

RAW MA TE RIAL AVAILABILITY AND LITHIC REDUCTION STRATEGIES: CONSEQUENCES FOR INTERASSEMBLAGE VARIABILITY I l J by Duane E. Peter and Daniel E. McGregor INTRODUCTION was used as an indicator of settlement variability. Unfortunately, the methodologies pursued were flawed by a lack of knowledge concerning lithic mechanics and an Archaeologists today attempt to extract a overzealous desire to reduce the variability to a single maximum amount of cultural information from the stone variable. Recent studies of lithic reduction systems tools and debitage which comprise the major component (Collins 1975; Perring 1979; Perring and Peter 1982; of most prehistoric sites.

However, the inference.

It would be necessary to assume that chert nodules, which are 60 relatively rare in these gravels, were procured almost exclusively, while the far more abundant quartzite was virtually ignored. 40 The lithic material source survey documented additional gravel outcrops to the south and west of Joe Pool Lake which are associated with the divide between 20 the Trinity and the Brazos drainages (Figure 13-3).

Some interesting differences in lithic material type percentages can be detected both between sites and 80 between classes of artifacts (Table 13-2). Somewhat surprisingly, the percentage of formal tools (bifaces and steeply chipped unifaces) made from quartzite is 60 consistently greater than the quartzite debitage percentage for each site. One interpretation of this might be that much of the quartzite was entering the Joe 40 Pool Lake area in the form of finished tools. If these quartzite tools had been manufactured in situ, considerably more quartzite debitage might be expected. 20 If this reasoning can be accepted, higher percentages of quartzite tools at a site might indicate more frequent 0 movements between that site and the source areas to the 41DN290 41TR63 41DL240 41DL234 north during the period represented by that site.

Percentages of chert and quartzite in site (41DL!49). There is evidence that the use of debitage assemblages from selected sites in the quartzite can be attributed primarily to the earlier (A.D.

This is based both on the higher percentage of quartzite debitage in the upland gravel deposits in the region, which are certainly lower excavation levels (see Table 10-5), and the fact more widespread. However, certain areas within this that over 40 percent of the Scallorn arrow points region appear to lack any sources of silicious materials (associated with that component) are made of quartzite suitable for the manufacture of chipped stone artifacts.

Like the that decortication may occur throughout much of the previous analyses, this analysis is exploratory in nature reduction sequence and that its usefulness as an indicator concerning the relative worth of the selected attributes of early stage reduction is suspect. It should be noted, for recognizing reduction strategies. Unlike the previous however, that such late occurrences of cortical flakes are attempts, it is readily recognized that the variability not statistically important. Seventy-one percent (n = within a reduction system is not likely to be 27) of the cortical flakes from cobble 2 had been characterized by a single attribute, but rather by a set of removed when thirty percent of the reduction sequence attributes which define classificatory units which are had been completed. Therefore, the occurrence of cortical meaningful in a behavioral context. Consequently, the flakes later in the reduction sequence is quite sporadic (n interrelationships of flake dimensions (length, size, = 11). Although these late occurring cortical flakes etc.) and technological attributes (platform type, dorsal increase the range of variability of the cortical flakes, it scar pattern) are examined for patterning within the is equally apparent that the cortical classes provide an reduction sequence. important framework for characterizing initial preforming.

It is the interaction of these attributes which faceted platforms are predominant. Two factors likely best characterizes bifacial core reduction. Dorsal scar contributed to this underrepresentation. First, the patterns, on an intuitive basis, should also reflect the incomplete reduction of the cobble limited the reduction sequence. Perhaps the difficulty of recognizing proportion of interior flakes produced. Secondly, the the states of this attribute as defined for this study analyst's ability to clearly distinguish multiple flake obscures the expected patterning. A simple count of the scars on quartzite material is hampered by the coarse dorsal flake scars may be more useful as indicated by texture of the quartzite which renders the delineation of Magne and Pokotylo's study (1981:34-42). However, individual flake scars more difficult.

The joint distribution of the cortical classes and the technological attributes (Table 13-13) also reveals the distinctive character of the Cobb-Pool assemblage. The greater emphasis on the primary reduction of raw materials at the Cobb-Pool site is reflected by the Silicified Wood greater percentages of cortical and single faceted _Q_ ..l..::..Sl... 51 - I 00 N platforms within the sample of cortical debris. The other # % # % # % assemblages, although not exhibiting such a large proportion of cortical platforms, exhibit a larger propo rtion of single faceted platforms. However, two of the assemblages (41DL184 and 41DL149) exhibit as many 41DL149 or more cortical flakes with multifaceted or crushed Platform Type platforms than those with single faceted or cortical Cortex 1 50.0 1 platforms. Why such variability exists is unclear. A Single Faceted number of factors such as the knappability of the raw Multifaceted 1 50.0 1 material, the stage of the reduction process represented Crushed and the skills of the knapper may be involved.

Unidirectional Distal-proximal and cortical dorsal scar patterns dominate the cortical Opposed flakes. More complex dorsal scar patterns increase in Tridirectional frequency on those flakes exhibiting less than 50 Multidirectional percent cortex; however, they are minimally represented. Cortex Termination shape is most commonly feathered with Ventral Surface hinged terminations following in frequency. Evidence of Error Recovery error recovery is almost non-existant except for the Absent 2 100.0 2 o• Cobb-Pool assemblage where it is moderately represent ed. The need for such corrective action is apparently 90° 1so0 related to the amount of reduction conducted at a site.

A MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF PROJECTILE POINT VARIABILITY by Daniel E. McGregor Traditional studies emphasizing chronology and specimens is not always a clear-cut process. In addition, typology have provided important contributions to our the possibility of significant typological variation understanding of the prehistoric archaeology of North across the region has never been investigated Central Texas. Although subsequent work has suggested systematically. that problems exist with particular interpretations (see One problem with using an intuitively defined Chapter 3), the earlier studies of Crook and Harris classification of projectile points is that assignment of (1952, 1954a), Stephenson (1952), and Suhm, Krieger, specimens into typological groupings is largely a and Jelks (1954) laid the basic culture-chronological subjective process. Although formal "inspectional foundation for this region. The relatively recent types" (c.f., Benfer and Benfer 1981) have been emphasis on settlement pattern studies and the identified, the particular attributes or combinations of development of a more regional perspective have attributes necessary for assigning an artifact to an provided equally valuable insights, but have tended to inspectional type have not been explicitly defined. In deemphasize the refinement of the basic artifact many cases the variables used for type definition are not chronology for North Central Texas generally, and the consistent from one type to another, and we are unable Upper Trinity River drainage in particular. This to formally measure the contribution that each variable deemphasis was particularly unfortunate since success in makes to a type definition. the reconstruction of prehistoric settlement patterns Some researchers have sought to establish more depends, to a large extent, on our ability to establish objective methods for typological classification (e.g., adequate temporal control for the sites involved.

316 A Multivariate Analysis of Projectile Point Variability t i discriminating variables is computed for each group. For every case, the probability of membership in each group is determined, and the case is assigned to the group with BL ML the highest probability. l VARIABLES t For discriminant function analysis in general, the variables that are selected to distinguish between groups SL ' are normally those that measure characteristics on which the groups are expected to differ. For projectile points, these should include a sufficient number of quantitative -BW__. measurements to adequately characterize the overall morphology and dimensions of each specimens. Based on studies of breakage and resharpening (Flenniken 1984; Flenniken and Raymond 1986), blade <111---MW---. measurements are thought to be less reliable for discriminating between projectile point types. Any modification after its original manufacture can alter the morphology of a projectile point. However, ML -Maximum Length NW - Neck Width modification was normally confined primarily to the MW - Maximmn Width MSW -Mid-stem Width distal or blade portion. SL - Stern Length BL • Blade Length The haft element of a projectile point was less BW • Base Width 1/2 W - Width of Blade at Half Length likely to have been reworked. For this reason, stem and base measurements are considered to be more reliable for Figure 14-1. Locations of continuous measurements used differentiating between types. It is also noted that with in the projectile point analysis. respect to the Texas inspectional typology, stem morphology is the most important distinguishing factor area. The objective of this analysis is to establish a for the arrow point types used in the present study. The mathematical basis for the "inspectional" arrow point use of angle measurements has been avoided because typology, and to objectively evaluate the variability previous studies have suggested that they are difficult to exhibited by typologically similar specimens from these replicate consistently, and they frequently have skewed three different areas. distributions (Benfer and Benfer 1981:390; Gunn 1981). A total of 15 variables was recorded, when possible, for each of the arrow points included in this DISCRIMINANT FUNCTION study. Ten of these are continuous scale measurements ANALYSIS that are listed below and illustrated in Figure 14-1. Discriminant function analysis has been used (1) Maximum Length (mm) - the maximum effectively as a strategy for classifying projectile points length of the point along its longitudinal (Benfer and Benfer 1981; Gunn and Prewitt 1975: 139- axis. 149; Leuchterhand 1970:18-24).

It would appear that the inclusion of samples from all three areas increases SUMMARY the variability within types and tends to blur the distinctions between them. This may be the case The purpose of this study has been to analyze especially for the three varieties of Alba. When the samples of arrow points recovered from three separate three geographical areas were analyzed separately, areas within North Central Texas. The specimens in successful discrimination between these three varieties these samples (from Joe Pool Lake, Richland/Chambers was markedly improved.

The objective of this variable. The results reflect a substantial decrease in analysis was to establish a mathematical basis for the percentages of correct classifications, both when the "inspectional" typology, and to objectively evaluate the geographical areas are combined (Table 14-5) and when variability exhibited by typologically similar specimens each area is analyzed separately (Table 14-6).

This pattern fits well with the data from other preservational bias. The increase in the number of sites in North Central Texas which indicate that bison species exploited may reflect an adaptive response to hunting did not become a common subsistence activity the more intensive utilization of the area which occurred until after A.D. 1200 (Lynott 1979). after the Late Archaic period.

360 Settlement-Subsistence Patterns results of geomorphological investigations in the Joe Pool Lake area (Chapter 12), and the archaeological excavations at 41DL189 (Chapter 5) have demonstrated that the modem floodplain surface is underlain by very deep deposits of relatively recent alluvium. The dynamic nature of fluvial systems has served to bias the sample of sites that are accessible for study, either through destruction by erosion or burial by alluviation. At site 41DL189 over 3 m of alluvial sediments have been deposited over the past 2,400 years. Many sites related to prehistoric occupation of the inner valleys of creeks and rivers are now deeply buried and are not likely to be detected with traditional surface survey techniques. In fact, alluvial deposits dating to the culture-chronological periods from Paleo-Indian to Middle Archaic could not be recognized in the Joe Pool Lake area. If these earlier Holocene deposits are preserved, they are even more deeply buried than the sediments currently exposed in area creek channels. MODELING OF PREHISTORIC ADAPTATION AND CHANGE WITHIN THE MOUNTAIN CREEK BASIN The relatively limited resource potential of the Mountain Creek valley is believed to have been an important factor that affected both the intensity and the nature of prehistoric activities in that area. In this section the evidence for prehistoric occupation at Joe Pool Lake is reviewed from a chronological perspective. The three part division of the prehistoric time period presented in Chapter 3 has been refined to employ shorter temporal spans where the data appear to warrant this treatment. Several sources of information have contributed to this synthesis. The primary source is the results of mitigation phase excavations that are reported N in the earlier chapters of this volume.

Volume I, Part Four 363 Chambers Reservoir, the initial construction and use of the large "Wylie focus" pits was hypothesized to have been related to the aggregation of socially-related Late Archaic period groups during times of resource abundance (Bruseth el al. 1987b). The use of identical features within the East Fork_ drainage may also date to the Late Archaic, and a similar function could be inferred. It may be that such aggregate-group activities were necessarily restricted to areas with greater resource productivity than the Mountain Creek valley. Exploitation of the aquatic and forest environments of the Mountain Creek drainage primarily during the summer months suggests that the territorial range of the Late Archaic occupants was significantly larger and required scheduling so that localized resources might be exploited at the proper times. Residential mobility was likely·· very high with the entire group moving to a new resource area as the resources of another area were depleted. Although there is evidence of site differentiation during the Late Archaic period, the lack of chronological control precludes relating such variability to logistical mobility. The differences 41DL189 exhibited by sites 41DL199, 41DL184, and 41DL!89 •41DLI99 are likely related to the depositional environments of 41DL198 41TR58 each locality and the intensity of use of each locality. 41TR59 The high densities of burned rock and lithic artifacts I 41TR60 from site 41DL199 reflect the recurring and intensive use of that locality during the Late Archaic period. Site 41DL184 was also reoccupied frequently during the Late Archaic period, but the general lack of burned rock and the low percentages of formal tools likely reflect brief occupational episodes. Whether sites 4 lDLl 84 and 41DL189 represent logistical camps of a more permanent base camp elsewhere or merely short term 1 foraging camps is not entirely clear. If more permanent base camps did exist during the Late Archaic period, they might have been located along the main stem of the Trinity River. However, the use of N lithic raw materials by the Late Archaic occupants 0 suggests that their territorial range was likely oriented miles westward rather than eastward.

364 Settlement-Subsistence Patterns decline of Caddoan cultural development. In many parts of East Texas, less stratified societies and more locally oriented exchange networks are indicated (Story 1981:151). The Late Prehistoric period in Central Texas begins with the appearance of ceramics, the bow and arrow. and cemeteries (Prewitt 1981:74). Unlike the contemporary, agriculturally based cultures of East Texas, these technological changes were not accompanied by changes in subsistence practices. The economy remained based on hunting and gathering throughout the Late Prehistoric period, but became more heavily oriented toward bison procurement during the latter part of this period (Prewitt 1981:84). Lynott (1977a:82) recognized two temporal phases within the Late Prehistoric period of North Central Texas. These phases correlate approximately with the Gibson/Fulton subdivisions for East Texas and the Austin and Toyah phases of Central Texas. Caddoan influence in North Central Texas is thought to have been strongest during the early phase. In fact, some researchers have suggested that sites like Cobb-Pool (41DLl48) may represent the actual movement of Caddoan groups from eastern Texas into this region prior to A.D. 1200 (Skinner and Conners 1979:52; Lynott 1981:105). Evidence for Caddoan influence declines during the late phase (Lynott 1981:106), and the appearance of shell-tempered ceramics similar to the Nocona Plain pottery of the Henrietta focus suggests more western influences from southern plains groups. Although bison were probably never very abundant in the Upper Trinity River drainage, bison exploitation increased significantly after about A.D. 1200 (Lynott 1979). The results of our excavations suggest that three temporal subdivisions may be recognized within the Late Prehistoric period at Joe Pool Lake. These appear to represent not only changes in material culture, but N significant shifts in subsistence practices and in the 0 nature of site utilization as well. The evidence for miles occupation of the Joe Pool Lake area during each of these phases is presented in the following discussions. Figure 16-5.

Volume I, Part Four 365 of the Late Prehistoric period may not have differed significantly from that of the Late Archaic. Although a wider diversity of resources has been documented, this is partially due to the better preservation exhibited at the Baggett Branch site. This was especially true for carbonized plant remains of which walnut shell and Psoralea tuber fragments were most common. The faunal remains continue to be dominated by deer and aquatic species such as turtle, fish, and mussels. Although the early phase sites at Joe Pool Lake very likely represent only a portion of the regional variability in settlement and subsistence activities at this time, the lack of cultigen remains suggests that a hunting and gathering lifestyle was maintained. Aside from the introduction of ceramics and the bow and arrow, the basic adaptation does not appear to have changed significantly from that of the Late Archaic period. It is possible that this area was being utilized only on a seasonal basis, and for visits of relatively short duration. The territorial range of these inhabitants and the associated residential mobility does not appear to have changed. However, no evidence of extra regional contact is present. Analysis of the stylistic variability of the Scallorn projectile points (Chapter 14) reveals sufficient variability that the Joe Pool Lake specimens are recognized as separate from the stylistic variability of both the Brazos River drainage and the Middle Trinity River drainage. A local resident population of the West Fork of the Trinity River drainage is likely represented. MIDDLE PHASE (A.D. 1000-1300) Even fewer sites have shown evidence of occupation between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1300 (Figure 16-6). The Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) contained the principle site component of this phase. In addition, a relatively minor component of the Baggett Branch site N (41DL149) appears to date to this same time period. 0 Contemporaneous occupation at site 41DL147 was miles evidenced by a single Alba point from the test excavations.

366 Settlement-Subsistence Patterns River drainages. If the Cobb-Pool site does represent an intrusion of Caddoan groups onto the prairies of North Central Texas, one would expect changes in tool styles, raw materials used, and decorative styles of the ceramics, Admittedly, the rather abrupt appearance of a new form of social organization, the addition of technology in the form of maize horticulture, and the similarities to Caddoan ceramic wares leads one to regard the site as intrusive. An examination of the evidence for extra-local interaction, however, reveals that influences were probably as strong from the west as from the east. The predominant use of chert as a source of raw material for tools clearly points to the same resource areas used by the previous occupants of the Mountain Creek basin. An intrusive Caddoan group would have brought more quartzite tools with them and would have used the quartzite sources along the Trinity River drainage. The recovery of the Gahagan-like bifaces of Central Texas flint from the site and two obsidian flakes also denote interaction with peoples to the west. The stylistic analysis of the Alba points from the Cobb Pool site (Chapter 14) also revealed that the projectile point assemblage is distinguishable from similar assemblages to either the east or west. Comparison of the Cobb-Pool assemblages with those documented along the East Fork of the Trinity (Lynott 1977a) also emphasizes the distinctive differences between the two areas. Indirect influence from the Caddoan societies of East Texas cannot be ruled out during this time period. The ceramic motifs in the form of incised lines, punctates, and finger nail impressions are characteristic of the Caddoan wares to the east. The circular house structures with either a center post or a four post support system as those at Bird Point Island within the Middle Trinity River drainage (Martin et al. 1987:433- 439), exhibit some similarities to Caddoan construction. These similarities to Caddoan sites are too 0 generalized, however, to indicate more than indirect miles exposure to Caddoan traditions.

Appendix 1-A LITHIC ARTIFACT CATEGORY DEFINITIONS by Daniel E. McG reior BIFACES PROJECTILE POINT A projectile point iJ defined as a symmeuical pointed biface with the proximal end modified (by notching, 1cemmin1, or thinning) to facilitate hafting. This cacegory includes basal fragments of the same, but only when the haflina element is present. P011dble projectile point tip, medial, and base fragments char do not p0ISOU a defmable hafting element are included within the Biface Fragment category. In the site assemblage descriptions, projectile points are divided into Dart Point and Arrow Point subcacegories, and are 111siped to a secopized type whenever possible. CLEAR FORK GOUGE This artifact form was originally defined by Ray (1941). They have prominent. steeply chipped bits and are roughly trian&ular or subtriangular in outline. The bits themselves were formed with unifacial flaking, buc die olheredges were WOlked bifacially, DRILL A drill is defaned as a bifa cially worked artifact with a long, narrow blade. The blade edges are approximately parallel. Tbe distinctive smaller specimens fitting this definition are included in a separaae "DrillfA wl" category. DRILUAWL Specimens in this category are characterized by their long, very narrow and lhin bifa cialJy worked blades. The bases of most specimens are the unworked proximal ponions of the fiakes from which the toots were _., A few specimens have bifacially WOlked bases with stems for haftina. They are identical to specimens in Sbafds (1973:220) "Awl" cacego,y. BRISTOL BIPACE A Bristol biface ii a bifacially worked artifact with circular or subcircular oudine and relatively straight tdpl.

App. l•A"S Prepared Platform. Platform preparation was essentially limited to splitting the nodule. The newly created., flat surface was then used as the striking platform for further nake removal. In some cases, a few additional flakes were removed from the platform surface itself, apparently for purposes of rejuvenation. SMALL BIDIRECTIONAL CORE T iese are small chert pebbles with a series of flak.es removed from opposite ends. They are similar to specimens which have been termed "bipolar cores," and characterized as re5uldng from reduction by a hammer• and•anvil cechnique (Mallouf 1976:157; Shafer 1973: 107-114). The sma:i size of these cores would have made hand held pen.:ussion difficulL CORE FRAGMENT A broken portion of a core that is too fragmentary for further classification. GROUND, PECKED, AND BATTERED STONE HAMMERSTONE A nodule of lithic material (generally quartzite) exhibiting evidence of battering on one or more ends or edges. MANO An ovate shaped nodule of quartzite or sandstone with one or more noticeably smoothed surfaces. GRINDING SLAB These are large, thick slabs (generally of i.andi.tone) which have been ground smooth on one or more surfaces. These smoothed surfaces are usually flat, but in some cases are basin shaped. The edges of some specimens have been shaped by barcering and pecking. PITTED STONE These specimens are similar to Grinding Slabs except that they are smaller and exhibit one or more small depressions or "pits" which have been pecked into a ground i.urf ace. WACO SINKER These are small, oval quartzite pebbles wh~e ends exhibit well-defined notches. These notches were formed by pecking and grinding. This artifact category was originally defined by Watt (1938). ABRADER Thae are pi,ca of nndstone that da1play one or more linear arooves on II relatively flat surface. GROUND STONE FRAGMENTS Thae ~imcm have at leut one around surfa ce, but are too fr aamencary for further clauificadon.

APP.1• B""6 APPENDIX f .. B ATTRIBUTE ANALYSIS OF COMPLETE FLAKES A detailed attribute analysis of complete flakes was conducted on assemblages from five sites withm the Joe Pool Lake project area. These sites were 41DL184, 41DL189. 41DL199, the Cobb Pool Site (4tDL143), and the Baagett Brand Site(41DL149). Four continuous variables and six nominal observations were recorded for each specimen. The following discussion presents the criteria employed in this analysis. l. ungtb -This attribute was measured at the maximum dimension of the flake parallel to the striking force. This dimension was measured to the nearest millimeter for all complete pieces. ll. Width - This attribute was measured to the nearest miJ!imeter at the maximum dimension of the flake perpendicular to the slriking force. Ul. Thickness -This js the maximum dimension of the tlake which is orthogonal to the length/width plane. This dimension was measured to the nearest millimeter. JV. Platform Thickne,s • This attribute is the distance between the inverse and obverse surfaces of the flake at the platform. This dimension was measured to the nearest millimeter. All flakes exhibiting crushed platforms were assigned a value of0.1 mm for this attribute. V. Platform Type -This attribute record.,; the preparation modes for the removal of spalls from a core. Five attribute st.ates were recognized: 1) Cortex-striking platform is unmodified; original cortex surface is present. 2) Single Faceted -single flake scar form.11 the platform surface. 3) Multifaceted -two or more flake scars form the platform surface. 4) Crushed -most of the platform surface was destroyed on impact; only a remnant. usually step fractured, remains. VI. Percentage of Donal Cortex - The relative amount of cortex remaining on the dorsal surface of a flake. Five categories are recognized: l)Opercent 2) 1-25 percent 3) 26-50 percent 4) S1-1S percent S) 76-100 percent Vll. Dor,al Scar Pmtern -This attribute records the complexity of scar pauems on the dorsal surface or a flake. Nine attribute states are recognized: 1) Unidirectional -all flake scars originate from one edge of the flake only. 2) Perpen-licular - flake scars originate from two edges of the flake, which are orthogon.al co one another. 3) Opposed• flake scars oriainate from the distal and proximal ends of the flake. 4) Tridirectional -the dorsal flake scars origina«e from three edges of the flakes. S} Multidirectional - the dorsal flake scars originate from more than three directions along the flake's edpl. 6) Cortex -the dorsal surfa ce is unmodified. 7) Ventral surface - the dorsal surface exhibits the ventral surfa ce ot a previously struck flake; usually refffled to as "bulb chinninJ" flakeis. 8) 8/Jateral opposed -flake scars origina1e from both lateral edges of the flake. Vlll. E"or Recover, -Thi1 aurib111e records the proportion of flakes struck to remove previous errors sudl as binge or llep rerminacions and the m«hod of their removal. Four a!tribute states are recopized: 1) Ab#IU • no step or hinge terminations on the dorsal surfa ce of the flake. 2) PrUMt (O? • flake nemcwed from die same direction a11 die origin of the 11ep or binp llnllinllion. 3) Prd#/11 (90? • diNetkm of rernovad of the error recovery flake is perpendicul• lO lbat of._ mur ar. 4) PrDMI (180'? • direction of removal of the error recovery ftake is q,poHd to lbat of dao mot ar.

APP. J-C-8 APPENDIX 1-C CERAMICS ANAL \'SIS: ORIENTATION AND ATTRIBUTES The approach that we have chosen to use in analyzing the ,;herds from Joe Pool Lake centers on the examination of several attributes in order to accompli,;h three bask objectives. The first and primary objective is to satisfactorily describe the ceramic sample from th~ Project as a means of communication to others. Although the sherd samples from fll('ttit siteit are small, they ai·e nonetheless imponant since the excavations conducted at each site place the ceramics into a well-documented cultural framework for North Cenrral Texas archaeoloay. The second objecdve L~ to develop a refined framework of site chronology that can be used to date featum and other contexts at the site which otherwii;e Jack temporally diagnostic artifacts or radiocarbon samples. In addition, such a chronological refinement may aid in inrersite comparisons with components that do not possess absolute age determinations. The additive nature of ceramic decoration (Deetz 1969) lends itself to detailed aemporal refinemen'1, and this potential is exploited thm1,gh the Joe Pool Lake analysis. The fmal objective of the ceramic analysis is to examine certain broader issu·:s. These include questions of population size. duration of occupation. vessel uses, and local versus long-distauce vessel manufacture. Several approaches are potentially available to deal with the stated objectives, depending on the theoretical orienlation of research lhat is adopted, The type-variety system of classification, such as is used in the Lower Mississippi Valley (cf. PM.llips 1969), has been succesi.fully employed to develop a refined ceramic chronology for Caddoan archaeology along the Great Bend of the Red River (Schambach and Miller 1984), and certainly has meri: over simple "type-only" systems (e.g., Suhm and Jelks 1962). It has been suggested, however, that the type-variety system is only valid when attribute coassociations are used to define types (Brown 1971:l-S). While this approach would result in types that have some cultural validity, it necessitates that adequate samples of sherds are available and that these sherds are of sufficient ,iize to accurately define decoralive motifs. Unfortunately, the Joe Pool Lake sherds are small in size, with most measuring less than S cm in maximum diameter, therefore, making such an approach impractical. Anolher analytical approach for ceramic analysis is to utilize a classificatory system which divides ceramics initially by decoration or paste characteristics into groups, and then examines the variability among other auributes within each group (Irvine 1980; Hall 1981). Although this approach allows classiflcation of sherds which are small in size, it suffers from an inherent assumption that the hierarchy of classificatory divisions have cultural signir1eance. Without some type of coassociational analysis, however. this assumption ii unverified. Nevertheless, it might be argued that the approach still provides a convenient framework for subdividin1 ceramic variability into 1maller and more manageable subsets for description and information diuemin1UOA. However, if the classification fails to provide cuhural insight, it is on the level of providing culcural lisll and offering explanations of cultural behavior (Brown 1971: 1) . DO( Consequendy, • attribute analysis approach is used in this chapter and is seen as the optimum type of ceramic analysis for the Joe Pool Lake sherd collection. Attributes have been selected to study several archaeoloaical quoslion1. At the same lime, however, some auributes are included solely as a means of fulfilling the responsibiliry of dacribing the sherd assemblage in order to disseminate lhis data to others. A part of ,bis descriptive responsibility is to compare the ceramics from Joe Pool Lake to existing type dacripdoos in an effort to show similarities IO ceramics from other regions and to indicate possible directions and ct.area of cultural affmity. ATTRIBUTES USED FOR ANALYSIS Tiil lltribltla uHd in the Joe Pool Lake Archacoloaical Project ceramic analysis ra11 into four groups: foma, ~ m1Mfac&urina. and uuge. Each is discussed below.

APP, J..C-9 The flnl group of at1tibute1 for ceramic analysis includes four variables that describe various chancctristics of vessel form. These variables are (1) location of lhe sherd on the complete vessel, (2) lip form. (3) rim orierualion, and (4) sherd thickna&. Each is deccribed in <l.?tail below, and should provide a means of describing Che sherd assemblaae and of examinin& pmsible chmnological relationships that these variables mi&ht have. All of them have been found to have chronological variability at other ceramic sites (Brown 1971; Bnaseth and Peruula 1981; Hargrave 1982). Sherd location was divided into three attributes: whether a 1'1erd was part of the rim, part of the body. or pan of the base. Mention should be made that the base caieaory cannot be consiltendy observed and therefore may not be a reliable indicator of the presence of this vessel part That i1, bases from flat•bouomed vessels are often easy to recognize whereas bases from round-bottomed veissels are more difficult. This difflculty is increased when the curvature of the base of round-bottomed vessels is similar to that of the walls. Moreover, the small size of the sherds from the Joe Pool Lake sample further increases the difficulty of recopizing bases. A major goal of this variable was ro obtain information on the types of vessel forms represented in the shercl assemblaae. Ethnographic studies have shown that often certain types of vessel forms exitst and that these types can reflect the economy of the inhabitants (Toor 1985:3). Since vessel form could be directly observed on only a very small number of sherds because of the 5mall size of individual ceramics, it was hoped thac this procedure might provide insight on the range of vessel forms used over time. Specifically, the relative frequencies of body co rim sherds provide an indicator of the overall range of vessel rorms, albeit at a much arosser level lhan direct form observation (cf., Schambach 1970:294#298). For instance, a larae number of body sherds relative co rim sherds would indicate a predominance of restricted orifice ve11els, deep-bodied vessels. or a combination of d1e two. Conversely, a high incidence of rim 1>herds relative to body sherds would imply unrestricred orifice vessels, shallow body vessels, or some combioation. The former might indicate more scorage forms, such as jars and bottles, while the latter might indicate food preparation and eatina utensils. Rim orientation was selected to further examine the forms of vessel,;, and specifically, co help determine if more or less restriccoo orifice vessels exist in a given sample. The auribu1es observed under this variable were strai&ht (i.e" vertical), evened (i.e., inclining outward), and inverted (i.e., inclining inward), An addiaional variJble used to describe vessel form was lip form, or examination of the cross section of the cerminal margin of the veuel orifice (Brown 1971:120). Five categories were defined. The reason for inclusion of this variable is ba.~ed on the tendency of elilablished ceramic types to show a greater incidence of flattened or rounded lips during the Early Caddo period and a greater incidence of rolled lips in the Late Caddo period of East Texas (Suhm el al. 1954). Since most of the decorated ceramics from Joe Pool Lake show similarity to Caddoan types, it wa.; anticipated that temporal chan,e in this attribute might aJso be found at Joe Pool Lake. In addition, some have argued that rolled lips may facilitate coverage by flexible lids (e.g., animal skins), and the rolled ponion of the lip is used ro fasten the cover with cordage . The final variable used was sherd thickness. Thi1 refers to the average thickness in millimeters of each &herd. This variable has certain functional implications in that 1he thickness of a sherd is to some cSearee relaced to its shock resis1ence. Of course. temper also plays an important part in the shock resisumce of ceramic vessels. VA RIABLF,,S RELATED TO MANUFACTURING Included widlin this group are several observations which perutin to the manu fa cwring environment of the ceramicl. These variables are sherd temper, lemper size, paste texture, coil smoothinJ techniques. color, and petrographic constituents.

APP. 1.C-10 The techniques ot· coil smoothing was another variable observed on the Joe Pool Lake ceramics. This referred to the method used to smooth coils during the manufacture process. Two possibilities have been observed ir, ceramics of North Central Te: as, and these include paddle and anvil and scraping. The paddle and anvil techniques refers to the use of a stone or wood anvil placed jnside and against the wall of the vessel and striking the vessel exterior with a wooden paddle . This action smooths over the coils and causes the temper to orient itself parallel to the vessel wall. The scraping technique, on the other hand, refers to a tool being uffli to scrape and smooth over coils. This techniques leaves the temper oriented at a variety of angles within the vessel wall. . Sherd colors were identified according to a Munsell color chart to provide a consistent means of identification. All readings were taken under fluorescent light Certain manufacturing interpretationn that be dr.twn from this variable. Sheppard (1971:105) notes that there are two determinants of sherdcolor: clay source variability and ftring environment. Generally lighter colors such as creams, yellows, oranges, and reds can be inferred to represent oxidized firing environments; whereas darRer colors such as browns, grays, and black can be due to either reduced faring environments or clay sources (Sheppard 1971:105). Thus, some indication of change or stability in clay sources and in firing environments over time can be obtained from this variable, A secondary objective of using sherd color was to help determine if the ceramics from the site were manufactured locally or were trade wares. It was reasoned that if all ceramics had been manufactured locally, similar firing techniques would likely have been employed and have resulted in a similar range oi coiors. On the other band, if ceramics were being traded, then color variations representing different clay sources should be apparent when compared over time. This analysis a.i;sumes that vessels did not consistently originare from the same source over time, a situation that seems unlikely. The final variable oi this grouping involved the identification of the minerological constituents through thin-sectioning and petrographk analysis of a sample of sherds to observe clay composition and to quantitatively approach the problem of ceramic exchange. A trial study of ceramic thin-sectioning and petrographic analysis was conducted at the Richland Creek Archaeological Project near Corsicana (Irvine 1982a), but this study left several unresolved questions in need of funher work. The location of the Joe Pool Lake Project on the prairie provides an excellen: opportunity to address this issue further and add more definitive light on the origin of ceramics found at sites on the prairies. VA RIABLRS OF USE Five variables were selected to examine the question of vessel use. The first was the orifice diameter of the vessels. Recent studies have shown that orifice diameters are related to vessel forms (WhaUon 1972:89). and since most of the sherds were too small for accurate form indentification, measurement of orifice diamters was seen as a means to partly overcome this problem. It should be pointed out, however, that the small size of the sherds has resulted in few rim sherds with a sufficient size for diameter measurmenL'i. Nonetheless, this data base should provide another means of addressing vessel form. This attribiute was measured directly by placing the rim over several different areas to find the appropriate size. Sooting was another variable that was examined for evidence on all sherds. Sooting is the accumulation of carbonaceous particles on the vessel walls from exposure to smoke. Usually this occurs when the vessel is bein& used to cook foods. Three categories were observed on the vessel: absence, presence on interior, and presence on exterior. Another variable that provides clues to the use, of vessels is the presence of pitting, wear marks, or sralehes. Pitting, particularly on the inside, can be che result of storage of certain liquids that dissolve pares of the :nterior of lhe vessels. Scraping marks can occur from che use <>f vessels as serving containes, and such scracches can be observed alon& the interior walls. Wear patterns, such as sheen along the lip. can be used to infer lhat a vessel po5sessed a lid and was used for inorage of liquids that might evaporate if not stored in a c1osed concainer, All of these variables were examined by visual observation for presence on the Joe Pool Lake ceramic sample, Sherd size was examined as a means to identify areas of the sites that might reflect differential breakage a,auerns. for instance, areas of well uavelled pathways miaht be expected to lose smaller sherds than areas leu well cnwc.Jled, such as along the walls of structures (Bob Burton, personal communication, 1986). Sherd sizes wu quamified by placina each specimen on a 1eries of circles. graduted in size by I cm incromonu. A "fit" was achieved when the sherd was found to fully be contianed in 1he smaJle:n circle. TIie ranai variabte of manufacturing concerned the identification of the minimum number of vllllli or ~ in the c:eramic 111emblage a site (cf, Whallon t 972). The 1oal of this variable wu to u,e lhe escimace of the minimum ves1els from a site to help imerpret popularion size and/or occupation intemky.

APP. 1..C-11 Several problems exist with using this varibfable by itself to estimate these parameters (cf. Toor 1985:8), but in combination with other indicators the use of the number of vessels can be an important confirmatory line of evidence for population and/or occupation intensity estimates. The minimum number of vessels was identified by using several criteria for assessment and defining differing levels of confidence to each criteria. The first, and most reliable means of assessment, was the conjoining ot ceramics. Next, those sherds that shared common decoration, temper, texture, color, and thicknesses were considered to be part of a single vessel. Beyond this, various combinations of decoration, temper, texture, color, and thickness were used to assign sherds to vessel groups, but with lesser degrees of confidence. All sherds from Bagget Branch and 41 DL 184 were assigned to vessel groups since samples were sufficently small to allow vessel groups to be easily identified. From the Cobb--Pool site, however, only rim and rim panel sherds were used, since the large number of sherds made the assignment of undecorated body sherds unreliable. VARIABLES OF DECORATION The final grouping of ceramic variables that have been used to analyze the Joe Pool Lake ceramic collection consists of those which pertain to vessel decoration. The first is decoration method, and refers to the manner in which ceramic designs were executed on the exterior of the vessel. The specific attributes observed were punctating, engraving, incising, brushing, slipping, and various combinations of these attributes. In addition, decoration element configurations (Braun 1977: 178) were noted for the a.,;semblage; these refer to the combination and orientation of specific decorative elemenL"i. This is not to be confused with decorative elements alone, which refer to basic, irreducible part11 of a design, such as a tool punctation or an incised line (Sheppard 1971:266). A total of 13 eJement configurations was recorded. This variable was only recorded when a sherd was large enough for secure identification of a given element configuration, and a sample size of at least two sherds was required to define an element configuration. This resulted in several decorated sherds not being classified.

APPENDIX 3A FAUNAL RESOURCES by Bonnie C. Yates METHODOLOGY Animal bone from the five prehistoric sileS mitigareci in the proposed Joe Pool Lake M-ea provides relevant information regarding the subsistence regimes of native peoples in the prairie/woodland ecotone of North Central Texas. The material is primarily food muse associated with Archaic and Late Prehistoric camp sites located along the drainages of Walnut and Mountain Creeks in the Trinity River basin of southwest Dallas County. Previous faunal analyses oftbese sileS were conducted by Yates (1982) and Murry (1982) as part of two phases of investigations conducted. when the proposed name of the reservoir was Lakeview Lake (Raab 1982a). The present work amplifies those findings and includes previous bone totals in appropriate tables and any additional identified taxa; otherwise, the quantifacations presented. here are strictly from the samples submitted. to the Zooarchaeology Lab at North Texas State University from the two mitigation field seasons at the proposed Joe Pool Lake. The contribution of zooachaeoloay is recognh:ed as an augmentation of knowledge about earlier lifestyles in reaard to subsistence practices. The record is intrinsically incomplete because of the gap left by perishable vegetative evidence of subsistence. Therefore, the bcuer preserved evidence of the meat portion of the dietary regime from bones provides some indication of what kinds of activities occurred at a site, why a site is located where it is, and ultimately to pneralizations about the role of specific human groups in a given landscape. The goals of the present study D three: (1) to document the animals associated. with each occupation; (2) to recCIIStl'UCt the resource area by means d inferences derived from modem wildlife data, and (3) to characterize the subsis&ence rationale of the seemin&IY less intense and more transitory Archaic occupations in contrast to the m<n substantial Late Prehistoric features. To accomplish these goals, this analysis has used standard zooarchaeo-logical methods: bone counts of fragments and elements (frapnents that can be identified as a particular unit of a vertebrate skeleton). esdmation of minimum number of individuals, observation d bone modification (cut marks. evidence of modification for ue as tools, burning, etc.). and examination of trends in the vertical and horizontal distribution d faunal material. The method d counting fragments carries with it some inherent problems [see Chaplin (1971). and Grayson (1985)]. For example, how does one count fragments of a crushed scapula or turtle carapace? Numbers of fragments, while unreliable for intersite comparisons due to variable taphonomic conditions, provide useful data for intrasite analysis by giving figures for estimating the density of vertebrate debris present at a given locus. Standard assumptions in faunal analysis include: (1) the extrapolation of modem wildlife studies to prehistoric populations, (2) the association of identified taxa with the subsistence base of the prebistoric human population, and use of identified tau as indicators of the environment during the period of site occupation, and (3) the conespondence of age at death for certain species with the season of site occupation (Smith 1978). Infenmces from apparent subsistence pmsuits are geared to a determination of the role of each site in its landscape. Distribution of faunal remains across a site is examined to detect activity centers and to reconstruct processing and disposal methods. Evidence of seasonality is sought from dental age assessment and migratory/dormancy habits of some of the fauna. Faunas associated with refuse areas, burials, and structures are contrasted. Butchering marts are noted and assigned to cuts inflicted from dismembering activities or from filleting activities. Body part representation is noted as is degree of burning. Raw data files contain the above mentioned information for all of the bones examined. The tabular data and textual information in this report are derived from those files.

APP. 3A-2 Analysis of the faunal remains is structured by the vertical (tempOral) and horizontal (spatial) contexts of the material rocovered by the excavation techniques employed to meet the overall research goals of the project. The bone samples were derived from block excavations, smaller test units, and systematic sampling using course screens (6 mm mesh), fine screens (1.6 mm mesh), and flotation methods. The bones were washed, sorted. packaged, and labeled as from course or fine screens and burned or unburned prior to submittal for analysis. . The contents of these packages were then resorted. (correcting enors in distinguishing burneo and unburned bone), i<ientified to the lowest taxonomic level, and quantified. Descriptive attributes were recorded manually and include provenience, element and identified taxoo (or size-of-animal estimation for fragments), side of body (i.e., right or. left), element portion (e.g. distal, proximal), completeness of portion, degree of burning, location of cuts or modif1eations, and number of burned and unburned (or weight in grams for flotation samples). This manual method allows notations of additional comments such as age/sex determination and similarities in preservation/fragmentation. All material, except modified fragments and any items potentially suitable for illustration. was returned to its original package. The raw data were suhsequendy JCCOrded by unit and level, and identified species (especially deer) and/or their elements were plotted on copies of the site maps to distinguish areal implications. Raw data and inventories are filed at North Texas State University. Minimum number of individuals (MNI) was assessed using the most frequendy recorded body part (i.e., same portion of a symmetrical element). In accordance with the excavators' request for analysis unit breakdown, MNI was assessed for each level and for each site as a whole. Additionally, MNI was assessed for specific features at some sites. PRESERVATION All fauna! remains were identified at least to class level of taxonomy whenever possible. Within the unidentified fraction attention was given to the probable si7.e category of animal f<r each fragment having at least half the circumference of the diaphysis <r shaft of a leg or foot element. These fragments occupy a middle range of information and should not be lumped in with unidentifiable bone scrap. Even though a firm identificadon, such as one based on unambiguous and undamaged articular epiphyes, cannot be established, the bone wall thickness and diameter of the medullary cavity will enable an experienced faunal analyst to assign a si7.e category such as deer-size, dog-size, large bird. rodent, non-mammal and so on. In cases where bones from an archaeological site are well preserved but highly fragmented, this size category supplements the assessment of relative importance played by the species n,presenled in the identified fraction. Such is the case with the samples from Joe Pool Lake. For the most part, the bones themselves lack the degree of surface deterioration that characcerizes po<r preservation (i.e., there is not a high frequency of water worn bones that tum powdery when handled). Whereas some bones exhibit cracked surfaces, root etching, and flaking, many have sharp edges and smooth surfaces. Using Behrensmeyer's (1978) bone weathering stages, the Joe Pool Lab material was probably buried when in stages 0-3. Her bone weathering stages have implications for determining habitat at time of bw:ial in that more equable environments (swamps, woodlands) tend to moderate the long term effects of sun and wind. Stage O bone is a sure sign of immediate burial. Stage 1 involves mosaic cracking at articular ends, and fine longitudinal cracks along shafts of long bones. Stage 2 is characterized by Dating of the outermost concentric layers of bone, especially along cracked edges. What is notable about these samples is that the bone is highly fragmented. The one or two exceptions involve deer and bison elements in feature situations. Bone grease processing also leaves a high incidence of fragmentary long bone shaflS. This process requires smashing selecled elements and boiling out the fatty residue in the bone tissue. This process removes collagen from the tissue as well. and leaves the bone less resistant to soil chemicals (Chaplin 1971:18). The bone from Joe Pool Lake is not brittle <r friable, just broken into medium (3 cm2) to small (1 cm2) fragments <r even smaller. If bone grease processing was undertaken, it is likely that the bone was only lightly boiled which renders most of the fatty residue but does not leave the bone as britde as prolonged boiling (Chaplin 1971:15). Trampling (Binford 1981; Brain 1981), fuel augmentation, smashing for pottery temper, and shrink/swell soil characteristics are a few of the causal alternatives for this high degree of fragmentation. Burning tends to enhance preservation of bone fragments up to a point (calcination) (Styles 1981:37) 44 percent of the total faunal assemblage (average of all sites) is burned to some degree. Two patterns of burning merit attention in this overall commentary. One pattern involves the burned and battered ends of some long bones that appear to have been used to grind hot material ~y. the ground-down processes on the end of a tibia is the only locus of burning on one example. The other pattern involves a marrow extraction technique in

Allomorpha sp,, Gumbelina sp,, Gumbelitria sp.), rare small mollusc fragments (fossil). • Exterior surface smoothed, clay highly oxidized, resembles slip except for intrusions into paste along cracks. Minimal diagenesis; some leaching of carbonates/shells and bone, but is minor, even at surface. Few very fine shrinkage cracks. Paste dark reddish brown, clouded, low birefringence; exterior surface (.3-.6 mm) high birefringence, low 1st order colors~ mainly white. Quartz dominant in lithics; mainly coarse silt, some sand, angular. Sherd 2 Provenience: 41DL149 (135.1.5) Vessel 2 Description: Brushed, incised body sherd; quartz temper; 9.7 mm thick; interior "sooting"; exterior color: 10YR4/2; Interior color l0YR2/l Petrographic description: Abundant temper; mainly fine quartz sand, some medium quartz sand1 grains subrounded to subangular, few rounded and angular. Common sand-sized (to 1.5 mm) siltstone fragments; some hematite; most with shrinkage cracks: most is ~ounded, .5-.7 mm diameter, some to 2 mm; Common large vuggy pores, globular, with irregular margins, many connected by smaller cavities; also common fine channel porosity, probably shrinkage cracks; these anastomose; no slip; core and interior paste has low birefengence, dark; exterior paste is oxidized, moderate birefringence, reddish brown. Exterior surface rough, irregular; interior surface very smooth, but no burnishing or polishing evident.

Sherd 3 Provenience: 41DL149 (221.3.5) Vessel 4 Description: Plain, shell-tempered body sherd1 Thickness: 7.6 mm; exterior color: 10YR4/3; interior color: lOYR4/3 Petrographic description: Dense paste, moderate to high birefringence, reddish brown; no color change at edge of sherd. Rare fine pores, most probably due to plucking; rare fine, sinuous shrinkage cracks, subparallel • and oblique to surfaces. . Abundant shell temper; all appear to be mollusc shells, lamellar layers most common, but quite a few prismatic or entire shell sections present. Shell fragments appear to be calcite, not aragonite- probably fossil. No evidence of burning. Most have fine shrinkage cracks around margins. Very minor leaching, mainly at edges of sherd. Rare fragments of spar, and rare micrite fragments; sparry prismatic fillings. Many shell fragments have common very fine algal borings, perpendicular to exterior surface. Sherd 4 Provenience: 41DL149 (175.2.6) Vessel 5 Description: Plain, grog-tempered body sherd; thickness, 7.7 mm;. exterior color: 10YR4/3; interior color: lOYRJ/2 Petrographic description: Common grog temper; grog is silt-tempered or untempered, few sand grains, some siltstone/shale temper, micaceous, with aligned clays and uniform extinction. this is not true of paste. based on temper, there are at least two vessels represented in grog. Paste has common silt and few fine sand temper grains, mainly quartz; rare chert, and very rare bone. Paste has common large, irregular vuggy pores, connected by common large channel pores; almost all grog fragments are surrounded by shrinkage pores. exterior of sherd is reddened; interior is reddish brown, with moderate birefringence.

APPENDIX 7 POLLEN ANALYSIS OF SEDIMENTS FROM THE MOUNTAIN CREEK DRAINAGE, NORTH CENTRAL TEXAS by Richard G. Holloway INTRODUCTION Pollen analytical studies have been more routinely undertaken in the region of North Texas during the past decade. In spite of this emphasis in research activity, good, well documented pollen-bearing sediments are virtually non-existent from this portion of the state. This is due at least in part to the environment of deposition in this region of Texas. The majority of the sediments are alluvial in origin and this factor, coupled with relatively high pH values, tends to oxidize the sediments and the organic remains. Recently, Bryant and Holloway (1985) have summarized the available paleoenvironmental data from Texas and were forced to interpolate the past vegetational history of this region from data obtained from adjacent are&. During previous excavations in the Richland/Chambers drainage (Navarro and Freestone Counties) a severely deteriorated pollen assemblage was recovered (Holloway 1983). The lack of recovery of pollen from this site contrasted markedly with results obtained a year earlier (Raab et al. 1982). During the past several years, much of the paleoenvironmental reconstruction of this region of North Texas was based on the study of the Frossard site pollen record (Raab et al. 1982) and a similar analysis conducted at the Cobb-Pool site (Raab and Woosley 1982). Because of the importance of these two sites to the interpretation of North Texas paleoenvironmental conditions, it became increasingly imperative to resolve the differences in pollen recovery observed in the two studies. Recent mitigation of a number of archaeological sitei in the Joe Pool Lake area by the Archaeology Research Program at SMU allowed a re-

App. 7-2 examination of the pollen bearing sediments previously recovered form the Cobb-Pool site (Raab and Woosley 1982). To this end, pollen columns were recovered from sites 41DL189 and 41DL148 (Cobb-Pool) during 1985. METHODS AND MATERIALS The samples for pollen analysis were taken from an exposed profile from sites 41DL148 and 41DL189 during excavation of these sites in early 1985. Six samples were recovered from site 41DL189 which had not previously been samples. Five samples were recovered from site 41DL148 and were collected from a column immediately adjacent to the 1980 column analyzed by Woosley (Raab and Woosley 1982). Four of the five samples correspond to those sampled by Woosley and are so marked. All samples were sent to the Palynology Laboratory at Texas A & M University for analysis. The samples were stored at 3° C until pollen extraction could be completed. Thirty mls. of soil were sub-sampled form the original material for analysis. Pollen extraction procedures generally followed the method of Faegri and Iversen (1975). Two tablets of concentrated Lycopodium spores were added to each sample prior to processing for later calculation of pollen concentration values. Initially, the samples were treated with a 30% solution of HCl in order to remove carbonates as well as to disperse the Lycopodium spores. The samples were next treated with 70% HF overnight in order to remove the silicates. Those small silicate particles and other inorganic materials were removed using a heavy density separation of ZnCl2 (S.O. 1.99 - 2.00). This residue was dehydrated using an ethanol series and stain was added during this step to aid identification. The residue was transferred to 1,000 cs 1;licon oil with butanol. A drop of concentrated polliniferous residue was mounted on microscope slides and routinely examined using 400x magnification. A minimum pollen count of 200 grains was

App. 7-3 attempted for each sample (Barkley 1934). The entire slide was scanned using 1 mm transect intervals in order to avoid the problem of non-random distribution ·of palynomi>rphs on the microscope slide (Brooks and Thomas 1967). Critical identification of some: grains was accomplished with lOOOx magnification (oil) or Hoffman modulation phase contrast microscopy. RESULTS Initially, the soil samples were split and a portion of each sample was sent to the Soil Testing Laboratory at Texas A & M University. The results of this examination are presented in Table App.7-1. The samples recovered from the upper levels of the deposit were characterized by high quantities of silts and clays. The lower levels (#'s 13 and 15, 41DL148) were by comparison, composed largely of sand and large silts. The coloration of these two samples was a light yellow or tan, suggesting that a high degree of oxidation had already occurred to these samples. Ph values ranged from 7 .8 to 8.6, and the percent organic matter was calculated at 1.2 - .2%. Phosphorous was consistently low, which was rather surprising for samples recovered from an archaeological site. In addition, the Calcium composition was extremely high, most likely accounting for most of the high pH values. The Calcium values are identical in that they were calculated at a maximum level within these samples. The readings therefore imply a minimum composition of this element Pollen results from these two sites were extremely disappointing. As indicated in Tables App. 7-2 and App.7-3, very little pollen was actually recovered. Less than 20 grains were recovered from each slide. Calculations of pollen concentration values when possible revealed that these values were much below the 1000 grains/ml level which many palynologists use as a minimum for statistical analysis (Bryant and Holloway 1983).

App. 7-4 POLLEN PRESERVATION Because of the lack of adequate pollen concentration within these sediments (Tables App.7-2 and App.7-3), even if pollen counts were obtained from these levels, their interpretive value would be minimal. At this point then, a brief discussion of pollen preservation is in order. There are many complex factors which determine whether pollen grains will remain preserved in a specific type of deposit or if they will be destroyed. As a unit, these factors are generally grouped into three main categories: 1) mechanical; 2) chemical; and 3) biological (Bryant and Holloway 1983). One of the first agents that begins to destroy pollen either during transportation or deposition is mechanical degradation. During these phases, certain pollen grains are more easily abraded than others. Additionally, other factors such as temperature and moisture can affect the pollen grains, once they have beer 1eposited. Holloway (1981) in a series of controlled laboratory experiments demonstrated the types of severe damage that can occur to the pollen wall when it is subjected to alternating periods of wetting and drying. The results of those experiments suggested that archaeological sites which are seasonally inundated by rivers or floods, or sites which are located in geographical regions such as North Texas with a distinct seasonality of rainfall are much more likely to contain severely altered pollen assemblages or to be totally missing them, ihan are sites which are continuously wet or dry. Pollen degradation is also caused by chemical agents. Dimbleby ( 1957) studied the effects of pH on the preservation of pollen grains and his studies revealed that, in sediments with a pH greater than 6.0, fossil pollen was not present in sufficient qu~tity to analyze. Martin (1963) and Bryant (1969) have more recently demonstrated that fossil pollen can be extracted from alkaline soils ranging in pH from 7.1 to 8.9. However, the highly deteriorated condition of the fossil pollen recovered from high pH soils often makes analysis and interpretation difficult, if not impossible.

App. 7-S Recent ~sts have shown that a number of specific chemical compounds can be classified as degradation agents. Holloway's (1981) study revealed that under experimental conditions, nine chemical compounds each caused extremely high percentages of pollen wall degradation. Of these nine compounds, six contained chlorine, three contained magnesium, two contained potassium, four contained sodium, and three contained carbonates. Eight of the nine compounds had a basic pH, which confirms earlier hypotheses that alkaline compounds appear to have a greater detrimental effect on pollen preservation than do acidic reagents. The chemical effects outlined above have direct relationship to the failure to obtain pollen from the sites in the Joe Pool Lake area. Sodium was especially high from 41DL189 whereas both calcium and magnesium seem to have been dominant at site 41DL148. In any event, the pH values from both sites were very high ranging from 7.8 - 8.6 (Table App.7-1). The extremely low organic matter component, usually 1.0% or less, likewise contributed to the low pollen concentration values. The pollen recovery obtained from this investigation is consistent with the low potential for pollen recovery from chemical regimes with pH values in excess of 6.0. Biological agents such as fungi and bacteria can also cause degradation of pollen grains deposited in archaeological sites. Some of these microorganisms are thought to feed on the internal cytoplasm of pollen grains and thus contribute to the eventual destruction of the pollen by weakening the outer wall while attempting to penetrate the pollen grains. Fungi, such as the Phycomycetes, were investigated by Goldsmith (1960) and Holloway (1981) to determine if they were a causative factor in the destruction of certain pollen types. Data from both studies revealed that certain genera of aquatic and soil fungi are selective in their preference since they tend to infest certain pollen types at a faster rate thafl others. In the samples from 41DL148, a large number of fungal and cryptogamic (Bryophyte and fern) spores were present in the residue. The cryptogamic spores would be expected to survive in a better condition since their walls are somewhat thicker and in previous studies have shown a higher degree of resistance to deterioration. The rather large quantity of fungal

App. 7-6 spores from these sediments may suggest a high degree of microbial activity which may have been a factor in the deterioration of the pollen assemblages. COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES Raab and Woosley (1982) reported the initial recovery and analysis of pollen bearing sediments from the Cobb-Pool site. Their report was based on the analysis of the samples by Woosley. In their article, these authors reported that "Excellent grain preservation and high grain counts were obtained from all samples drawn from Feature 2 of the Cobb-Pool site." The results of their analysis are very difficult to reconcile with the results of the present investigation. Four of the five samples currently under analysis were taken immedictely adjacent to the 1980 column upon which Raab and Woosley based their interpretation (see Table App.7-2). Table App.7-4 summarizes the grain counts provided by Raab and Woosley (1982). Many of the pollen types recovered by Woosley (Raab and Woosley 1981) such as Acacia, Li.llaceae, Juglans, Nymphaceae, Juncaceae, Scirpus, and Typhaceae, to name a few, are either very fragile grains which do not preserve well under ideal conditions, or they are extremely low pollen producers and are not normally found in such quantities even under ideal preservation conditions such as bogs. Yet, it is exactly these taxa which are present so abundantly in Raab and Woosley's (1982) analysis. Another anomaly which was never satisfactorily explained, was the presence of Larix pollen in both sample #12 (Raab and Woosley 1982) and their surface ample. Larix pollen has been experimentally studied for the effects of numerous agents of deterioration. Goldsmith (1960) found that Larix was one of the most easily destroyed pollen types. Secondly, Larix is a boreal conifer whose present distribution lies along the 70° Mean July Isotherm (Canada) or west of the Cascade range in Washington State. Furthermore, in their study of surfa ce pollen

from Washington, Mack and Bryant (1974) demonstrated that a stand completely by Larix would produce only 1 -3% of this pollen type in the surface samples. Yet Raab Woosley 1'eported not only 10 grains (1.4%) of this taxon in the surface, but 3 (1.2%) 78 cm below. These percentages strongly argue for a large stand of Larix in the immediate vicinity. This anomalous distribution of a taxon which does not presently grow within 1000 mi of the state has riot yet been satisfactorily explained. Unfortunately, no accompanying soils data was presented in the earlier report (Raab and Woosley 1982). However, since the 1985 column was taken immediately adjacent to the 1980 column, it can be assumed that the soil characteristics present in the 1985 column were likewise present in the 1980 column. It is surprising, that in sediments with a strongly alkaline soil chemistry that pollen preservation was as good as reported by Raab and Woosley (1982). Again, no pollen concentration values were reported, so it is difficult to compare precisely the rate of pollen recovery. LATE HOLOCENE PALEOENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY OF NORTH TEXAS In spite of the difficulties inherent in interpreting the pollen records obtained from archaeological sites in North Texas, we can extrapolate a reasonable paleoenvironmental record f;om nearby adjacent areas. North of the Texas border in Atoka County, Oklahoma, Albert (1981) examined deposits recovered from Ferndale Bog which spanned the last one half of the post-glacial period. In conducting her analysis, Albert (1981) extracted and analyzed several peat cores which she correlated incorrectly on the basis of radiocarbon chronology and site stratigraphy (Hall 1983). In spite of those discrepancies, her overall data reveal that from approximately 5000 B.P. to 1700 B.P. the fossil pollen record is dominated by high percentaaes of arass and herbaceous pollen with some Quercus and Carya pollen

App. 7-8 present. Although minor fluctuations in pollen types occurred during that 3300 year period, the overall trend reflects vegetational stability with no indication of major plant taxa migration. By 1700 B.P. the fossil pollen record shows a shift towards higher percentages of pine pollen suggesting a migration of Pinus into the regional vegetation in the vicinity of Ferndale Bog. From that time period until the present the fossil pollen chronology from Ferndale Bog records a series of fluctuations between the percentages of Pinus, Quercus, and Carya pollen. Although Albert ( 1981) interpreted those fluctuations to represent repeated climatic changes as evidenced first by the increase of Pinus, then an expansion of Quercus, and finally a dominance of Carya, a careful examination of Albert's original data reveals that those fluctuations are associated with layers of charcoal in the bog sediments. I suspect that the fluctuations in aboreal taxa, which Albert attributed to climatic variations, are instead a series of ~ondary vegetational secessional patterns resulting from local forest fires. Recently, Holloway and Perring began a reinvestigation of the sediments in Ferndale Bog. Their testing of the bog deposits resulted in the collection of several new sediment cores over 3 m in depth. Preliminary dating of those sediments reveal a radiocarbon chronology extending form the present back into the middle late-glacial period. Fossil pollen extracted from the Ferndale Bog sediment cores indicate that for several thousand years prior to the.end of the late glacial period the upper elevations of the western Ouachita Mountains in Oklahoma probably were dominated by a grassland vegetation. Those new palynological data confirm the original late glacial vegetational reconstruction proposed for central Oklahoma by Wilson (1966) in his report of the Domebo site and support some of the conclusions mentione.d in the Ferndale Bog report by Albert (1981). Fossil pollen data from the new studies of Ferndale Bog by Holloway and Ferring reveal that by approximately 9000 B.P. (Figure App.7-1). Quercus began invading the grasslands in the Ferndale Bog region and created first an oak savanna, later an oak woodland {which apparently lasted until pines began migrating into the region around 2100 B.P.) and finally an oak-hickory-pine forest after about 1200 B. P. One of the reasons we believe that the oak-

App. 7-9 hickory-pine forest did not become established until 1200 B.P. is that the percentages of pine pollen are moderate and fairly stable between 2100 - 1200 B.P. and it does not increase dramatically until after 1200 B. P. In spite of some radiocarbon dating discrepancies, both Alberfs (1981) fossil pollen study and the renewed study by Holloway and Ferring show the same general series of vegetational events spanning the last portion of the post-glacial period at Ferndale Bog. Both suggest that an initial post-glacial grassland vegetation was replaced first by an oak savanna, then an oak woodland by mid post-glacial times, and finally by a migration of pines into the region around 1200 B.P. However, because the percentage of fossil pine pollen in the deposits of Ferndale Bog never exceeds 30% and the percentage of oak pollen remains high throughout the late post-glacial period, we suspect that the region remained primarily an oak hickory-pine forest where pines were present but never became a major vegetational element (Davis 1969). During the past several decades there have been a number of attempts to recover fossil pollen records from archaeological sites in North Central Texas (Bryant 1969; Edelman 1976; Lynott and Peter 1977; Lynott 1975; Gallager and Beardon 1976; Hall 1980, 1982a, 1982b). For the most part, these attempts have failed to recover sufficient fossil pollen for statistically valid analyses. Two notable exceptions have been Woosley's pollen analytical work from both the Cobb-Pool site (Raab and Woosley 1982) and from the Frossard site (Raab, et al. 1982), which have already been discussed. Since no other fossil pollen evidence dating from the late post-glacial period in North Texas has been able to confirm the pollen data from these studies, both the Cobb-Pool (Raab and Woosley 1982) and Frossard Site (Raab et al. 1982) analyses should be used with caution in reconstructing the North Texas fossil pollen record.

App. 7-10 CONCLUSIONS The results of this analysis have proved extremely disappointing. The soil chemistry data coupled with the pollen concentration values have demonstrated the extremely poor preservation of organic remains, especially pollen, which has occurred in these sediments. Based on comparisons with other attempts to recover fossil pollen from archaeologial site in North Texas, we must conclude that the pollen, if recovered at all, is in such a deteriorated condition as to invalidate any paleoenvironmental interpretations. No adequate explanation is available to reconcile the differences between Woosley's (Raab and Woosley 1982) results and those of this analysis. However, based on all pertinent data, the earlier reported results (Raab and Woosley 1982) must be viewed with skepticism. RECOMMENDATIONS During the past several years, many attempts to recover pollen from archaeologial sites in North Texas have been conducted. With few exceptions, these attempts have been conducted on alluvial sediments with low probability of pollen recovery. The soils analysis and pollen concentration data provided by Holloway from both the Frossard site {4 lNV 139) (Holloway 1983) and those sites currently under investigation have shown the improbability of recovering fossil pollen from these alluvial soils. It is my recommendation that further palynological studies on alluvial sediments be severely curtailed. I would recoIJ1mend collection of samples but pollen extraction and analysis should only be conducted after soil chemical data have shown a high potential for recovery. Decisions regarding any future pollen work can then be intelligently made once the palynologist has the results of the soils data. In short, the lack of pollen results during tbe last several years has demonstrated that these types
