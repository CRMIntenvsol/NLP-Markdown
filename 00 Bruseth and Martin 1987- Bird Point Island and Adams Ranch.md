ABSTRACT The archaeological investigations undertaken at two of the prehistoric archaeological sites within the Richland/Chambers Reservoir (Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch) are discussed in this volume. These two sites have been included in a single volume because they both possess large features (ca. 16 m in diameter and more than 2 m deep) that are similar in form and content to the Wylie focus pits found along the East Fork of the Trinity River near Dallas. The features along the East Fork have been the subject of numerous speculations, but only limited investigations. A major goal of the Richland Creek Archaeological Project was to examine further the hypothesized functions of such features by careful investigation of the features at Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch. The field work was conducted between June 1982 and-~December 1984, by the Archaeology Research Program, Southern Methodist University. The reservoir, located in Navarro and Freestone Counties, is 100 km south of Dallas. It is under construction by the Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement District Number One, Fort Worth, Texas, and will inundate 44,750 acres along Richland and Chambers Creeks. The Bird Point Island site contained significant archaeological deposits relating to hab- itation, with four major periods of site use observed. First, sporadic use of the site occurred during the Late Archaic period (170 B.C. - A.D. 130). The large feature was excavated and used for roasting food and for human burial during this time. The next major use of the site occurred during the Richland Creek phase (A.D. 580 - 860). Primary evidence for this period occurs inside the large feature, which was used for cremation burials and for trash deposition. The following Round Prairie phase occupation (A.D. 1000-1200) consisted of a sedentary hamlet of three houses. Significant economic data were recovered from this occupation which indicated that the inhabitants existed solely on a diet of wild plants and animals, with primary reliance on hickory nuts, acorns, Psoralea tubers, and deer. The final occupation of the site occurred during the St. Elmo phase (A.D. 1300 - 1650). Several periods of short-term site habitation took place during this time, and a shift to a more mobile settlement pattern characterized by seasonal use of the sites seems to have occurred. The economic pattern of the Round Prairie phase continued, except that some maize was introduced into the diet. The very small quantity of maize suggests that it was a minor supplement to the diet. No house patterns were identified at Adams Ranch; the most significant data were recovered from within the large feature. Radiocarbon dates indicate that the feature was first excavated around A.D. 200, during the Late Archaic period. Shell tempered sherds were discovered in the bottom layer of feature fill (dating between A.D. 200 and 700); however, none were found at Bird Point Island. This suggests that the pit at Adams Ranch was excavated at a later point in time, after the introduction of ceramics. The most intensive occupation of the site occurred during the early Round Prairie phase (A.D. 800 - A.D. 1000). Most of the features and artifacts recovered from the large depression date to this period. Grog/grit/bone tempered ceramics replaced shell tempered ware during this period, and arrow points were used along with dart points. The distribution of these artifacts across the site indicates that most other features at Adams Ranch also date to the early Round Prairie phase. Only limited occupation occurred after A.D. 1000 during the St. Elmo phase. Economic data indicate that a hunting/gathering lifestyle based on a diet of deer, acorns, nuts, and Psoralea tubers persisted throughout all periods of occupation, Unlike Bird Point Island, no evidence of maize was recovered at Adams Ranch. The final part of this volume discusses the Wylie focus concept. This construct was originally defined in 1952 to classify several sites with large, man-made depressions observed along the East Fork of the Trinity River. It was characterized by a trait list which included the presence of large pits, ceramics, and flexed burials without grave goods. The data obtained from the similar features at the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch sites have added Significant information on the function of such large depressions. The features are now believed to date to the Late Archaic period, when they functioned as roasting pits for interband feasting and as cemeteries, which may have also served as territorial markers. The new assignment of these large features to the Late Archaic period casts doubt on the usefulness of the Wylie focus as it was originally defined, and calls into question its validity as a meaningful archaeological construct.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The successful completion of any complex project is dependent upon the dedication and assistance of many persons, In this respect, the Richland Creek Archavological Project (RCAP) is no different. In fact, the highly interdisciplinary and multi-seasonal nature of the Project has involved a myriad of field personnel, analyists, writers, consultants, and support staff. We owe a large debt of gratitude to all these individuals, and in this section we recognize their contributions. First, and foremost, we thank Mr. Woody Frossard of the Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement District Number One (hereafter referred to as the Water District). Mr. Frossard was the representative from the Water District who was assigned the responsibility of selecting an archaeological contractor and insuring that the work was completed in a manner consistent with the Water District's needs for completion of the Richland/ Chambers Dam and Reservoir. Mr. Frossard performed these duties admirably, providing direction, encouragement, and constructive criticism in all phases of the archaeological work. Without Mr. Frossard’s support, the Richland Creek Archaeolog- ical Project would not have achieved the success it has. Second, special thanks go to the members of the Memorandum of Agreement Committee, a project review council established by an agreement between the Water District, che U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USCE), the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the National Park Service (NPS). The members of this committee, aside from Mr. Frossard, consisted of one person from each of the agencies involved: Ms. Daphne Derven (USCE), Dr. LaVerne Herrington (THC), and Dr. Stephanie Rodeffer (NPS), who was later followed by Dr. Ann Johnson. The MOA Committee members provided valuable comments and support while attending field meetings during some of the coldest and hottest temperature extremes experienced in this part of the State. The ultimate success of this Project is due in large measure to their collective effort. We also wish to thank Mr. Robert Burton, archaeologist with the USCE, for his assistance in developing the Memorandum of Agreement that made the mitigation phase of the RCAP a reality. Mr. Burton was particularly instrumental in negotiating the mag- nitude of mitigation activities within the reservoir. A great deal of appreciation goes to the field and laboratory crews who worked during the four seasons of the RCAP. Despite the physical discomfort imposed by summer's heat and winter's chill, the field crews worked steadily and often put in long hours to make sure the job was completed properly. Likewise, laboratory workers put in long, tedious hours washing, identifying, and cataloging artifacts from both prehistoric and historic sites. Crew chiefs of prehistoric crews included: Jeffery Bohlin, Marilee Irvine, Thomas Guderjan, Daniel McGregor, Allan McIntyre, Donald Manchester, and William Martin. In addition Debra Desarmeaux and Esther Read served as assistant crew chiefs. Crew chiefs of historic crews included: David Jurney, Susan Lebo, Debbie Marcaurelle, and Abigayle Robbins. During Season I, Marilee Irvine served as lab director. Susan Lebo directed the lab during Season II through IV, with the assistance of Debbie Marcaurelle during Season HI, Dana Curtin during Seasons III and IV, and Melissa Green during Season IV. Many thanks are extended to these supervisory personne! who put in many hours of their own time to complete maps, forms, and computer processing so that the project could run smoothly. Likewise, thanks are due the following people who served as crew members in the field and/or lab: Gail Anderson, Dupleix Awah, David Babson, Bryan Bogle, Bridget Bosshart, Loma Brann, Eric Brill, Stephen Butler, Deborah Campbell, Deborah Casselberry, Pamella Carmichael, Diane Carpenter, Shirley Crittenden, Scott Detwiler, Dianna Doucette, Patricia Easley, Nancy Engle, John Fueger, George Raymon.

viii James Tomassini, Lisa Van Eysden, Mary Walsh, Debbie Wallsmith, Janna Wetherington, Frank Winchell, and Richard Young. The Richland Creek Archaeological Project could not have been successful were it not for the development of a coherent research design. The original research design was developed by Dr. L. Mark Raab (prehistoric portion) and Randall Moir (historic portion), with the assistance of James Bruseth, David Jurey, Daniel McGregor, and Joe Saunders. In addition, several professionals provided theoretical and methodological advice and constructive criticism on various phases of the RCAP. Specifically, we wish to thank Mr. Larry Banks, Dr. Michael Collins, Dr. Glenna Williams-Dean, Ms. Nancy Kenmotsu, Mr. Robert Mallouf, Ms. Patience Patterson, Dr. Dee Ann Story, and Dr. Fred Wendorf. The friendliness and interest expressed in our work by the residents of Navarro and Freestone Counties is greatly appreciated. Several local people made significant contributions to the outcome of the RCAP. Mr. Bill Young, who is an avid participant in Texas’ Stewardship Program for archaeological resources, led us to what turned out to be the most significant prehistoric sites in the reservoir area. In.addition, he and his wife Bobbie Jean, allowed us to study their collections from these sites. The Youngs’ extensive knowledge of North Central Texas archaeology aided us on numerous occasions. Mr. Ed Quals, a resident within the Project area, provided useful historical information about several historic sites, as did Mr. W. D. and Ms. Mozelle Burleson Pillans, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Gregory, Mr. and Mrs. Norton Cloud, Ms. Wyvonne Putnam, Ms. Verna Ann Bonner, Mr. Isaiah Kelly, Mr. Clint and Mrs. Mary Frances Robinson, Ms. Lizzie Bolden Jackson, Ms. Lillian Florine Bennett, Mr. James F. Bell and the J. A. Breithaupt Family. The memories and stories shared by these and numerous other people provided information useful for our interpretations. The Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement District Number One provided heavy equipment for use at creek bank sites and permitted us to use their facilities for the operation of our flotation devices. Special thanks are extended to Mr. Mike Williams of the TCWCID#1 for flying over several of the sites and taking photographs. Thanks are extended to those people who donated their time, equipment, and expertise to help in our study of the Project area. Edward F. Janak Jr., soil scientist with the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service, mapped soils at the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch sites and answered our questions about soils at several other prehistoric sites. Without his assistance, many of our conclusions about site stratigraphy and the deposition of feature fill might have missed the mark. Dr. Gil King, of the University of Texas at Dallas Health Sciences Center, provided the use of energy dispersive x-ray equipment to allow us to conduct trace element studies on human skeletal material. Other specialists also made important contributions to the research effort. Dr. David Pheasant conducted geomorphological analysis of the terraces and floodplain. Dr. Richard G. Holloway and Mr. Michael Pendleton conducted palynological analysis of samples recovered from bogs surrounding the Project area. Dr. Holloway also assisted us in separating fact from fiction conceming previous pollen analysis. Ms. Gayle Fritz conducted analysis of carbonized plant remains with advice from Dr. Richard Yarnell of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and in consultation with Dr. William Mahler and Mr. Barney Lipscomb of the Southern Methodist University Herbarium. Dr. Gary Rutenberg conducted the human osteological analysis; Dr. Phillip Murry conducted the vertebrate faunal analysis, and Dr. Richard Volume II Fullington conducted the mofluscan analysis. Mr. Robert Huggins of Spectrum Geophysics Inc. conducted the magnetic and eletromagnetic conductivity surveys. Mr. David Stahle provided valuable advice on dendrochronolgy and checked the chronologies - developed by David Jurney. Dr. Harold Hietala offered advice on statistical analysis. Ms. Georganna Greer provided information on the Texas Stoneware Industries and Mr. Bill Westbury provided valuable assistance in the classification of historic artifacts. Duane Peter designed and supervised the technological analysis of prehistoric lithic artifacts. Mr. Peter also designed the lithic replication experiment and analyzed the resulting materials. Mr. J. B. Sollberger provided the necessary flintknapping skills and many hours of his time to produce the artifacts used in this replication study. Those who assisted in the report preparation worked just as hard as did those who collected and analyzed the data. Without their dedication and relentless efforts, these volumes could never have been completed. We wish to thank Sue Linder-Linsley for completing the bulk of the typing. Assisting her in this task were Melissa Green and Debra Mallouf. We also wish to thank Shelia Jones and Marilyn Westbury for typing some of the very early drafts. We are grateful to Eric Brill, Susan Burton, Pametla Carmichael, Maynard Cliff, David Jummey, William Martin, and Karim Sadr for completing the drafting. Although some copy editing for the prehistoric volumes was conducted by Maynard Cliff and William Martin, the majority of copy editing was conducted on a voluntary basis by Toni Turner. We thank her for her untiring devotion to the production of a quality report by reading and correcting the myriad drafts of the manuscripts. The quality of the reports has been measurably enhanced by her efforts. Thanks are also extended to Laurel Sloat who assisted in editing the manuscripts. Editing of the historic volumes was aided by Maynard Cliff, David Jurney, and Susan Lebo. We are grateful to professionals who reviewed the drafts of these manuscripts and provided constructive criticism used to refine the text. Dr. Ann Johnson, Dr. LaVerne Herrington, Dr. Mark Lynott, Dr. Stephanie Rodeffer, Ms. Anne Fox, Ms. Daphne Dervin, and Mr. Elton Prewitt all offered suggestions which improved the quality of the reports. Lastly, we could not have completed this Project on time and within budget without the assistance of several individuals at Southern Methodist University. We are indebted to Ms. Mildred Haenel, Director of Research Administration, for her untiring support of the Project. She assisted in much of the contract negotiations and provided administrative guidance during all phases of the Project. Dr. James Brooks, President of the Institute for the Study of Earth and Man, offered guidance and direction for the overall progress of the Project. Dr. Brooks also helped secure additional funds for publication of the Richland Creek reports in an effort to insure that the Project's high quality research was matched by equally high quality finished reports. Lanelle Thompson and Jo Featherston provided incalculable assistance in terms of keeping the Project's computerized accounting system from becoming a tangle of uninterpretable numbers. Finally, many thanks are extended to those who authored and produced these volumes. These people deserve special recognition for their professionalism and willingness to undertake and complete difficult tasks under tight deadlines. James E. Bruseth, Director Randall W. Moir, Associate Director Archaeology Research Program

INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME II by James E. Bruseth and William A. Martin The Richland Creek archaeological Project began in 1980 as a five-year, interdisciplinary program to investigate the cultural re- sources to be impacted by construction of the Richland/Chambers Dam and Reservoir (Figure I-1). The reservoir is located in Freestone and Navarro Counties, Texas. Construction of the dam and reservoir was started in 1982 and was completed in 1986, The archaeological work carried out in the reservoir consisted of three major phases. The first phase, begun in September 1980, involved the survey of the 44,750 acres to be inundated by the reservoir which resulted in the identification of 911 archaeological properties (Archaeology Research Program 1980, 1981). The second phase consisted of site testing and determining the eligibility of sites for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (Raab et al. 1981). Testing procedures involved an interdisciplinary program of archaeological excavations, geolog- ical and geomorphological field work, architectural studies, informant interviews, and archival research. The results identified 106 archaeological sites and historic structures containing important information, which were considered eligible for nomination to the National Register (Archaeology Research Program 1981, 1982). The first and second phases were completed by August 1981. Data from the testing program were used to formulate a plan for the third phase: mitigation of the loss of significant archaeological properties in the reservoir. Any of the 106 significant archaeological properties identified during testing which were located below an elevation of 325 ft msl, under the dam, or inside of highway relocation corridors were recom- mended for intensive study. A program of archaeological mitigation was begun in June 1982, and carried out in four field seasons, each about three months in duration, with the last field season being finished in December 1984, The intensive data collection was undertaken for 80 properties, while it was possible to avoid 26 properties by changing the design of the dam and the locations of roads. The type of work conducted for each significant property during the third phase varied from intensive excavation at all prehistoric and many historic sites to architectural documentation, dendrochronology, geomorphology, informant interviews, and archival research. The remainder of this introduction is divided into two parts. The first is a review of the Richland Creek Technical Series. The present volume is part of this series, and this discussion directs the reader to other volumes where information on the Project can be found. The second part is a brief, but essential, environmental background. The discussion of human ecology in later chapters requires a basic familiarity with the Project's natural setting. THE RICHLAND CREEK TECHNICAL SERIES This present volume is the second in the Richland Creek Technical Series, a five volume set devoted to reporting the archaeological mitigation program conducted in the Richland/ Chambers Reservoir by Southern Methodist University. The series presents all major data, interpretations, and conclusions for the research conducted at historic and prehistoric sites. More details on the contents of each volume are presented below. Volume I provides background information on the Project. The first part of this volume summarizes management issues including agency review and monitoring, in-house quality control and task management, and construction and maintenance of a computerized data base management system. The second part of Volume I presents environmental information for the Richland Creek area and reviews the results of pollen, soil, and geological studies. The data are used to model environmental change during the Holocene for the Richland Creek area. The next two volumes in the Technical Series are devoted to reporting the results of investigations at 15 prehistoric sites. Specifically, Volume IH, the present volume, reports on excavations conducted at the Bird Point Island (41FT201) and the Adams Ranch (41NV177) sites. Both sites contained large, man- made depressions known as Wylie focus pits; because of these unique features, the sites are combined into a single volume.

Location of the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch sites within the Richland/Chambers Reservoir. review of the concept of the Wylie focus is also provided in this volume. It should be noted, however, that during investigations at these two sites, substantial deposits unrelated to the large depressions were also found. In particular, village deposits with important information pertaining to local and regional patterns of human adaptation to the environment of North Central Texas were recovered from the Bird Point Island site. Consequently, a substantial part of Volume II is devoted to reporting data on these occupations as well. Volume III is composed of two parts. The first presents basic data on the excavations conducted at 13 prehistoric sites. The presentation for each site is relatively straightforward and serves primarily as a means of communicating information to other researchers. Brief interpretations on the temporal and functional uses of each site are made. In the second part of Volume III, syntheses of the overall prehistoric research are presented. These syntheses are included in chapters on effective site investigation strategies, chronology, human ecology, and lithic technology and raw materials utilization. The final chapter of Volume III compares the prehistoric archaeology of the Richland Creek area to other sites in North Central Texas. In addition, directions for future investigation in this part of Texas are presented. The last two volumes provide information on the results of archaeological and architectural studies of historic sites in the Richland Creek Archaeological Project area. Volume IV provides information on the research design, field methods, and major data collected from 64 historical properties.Thirty-seven historical properties received archaeological studies as a primary focus. Site descriptions for each property are given in Volume IV. Volume V, the final volume in the Richland Creek Technical Series, reviews the results of specialized historic artifact analyses and synthetic studies of historic sites. The Richland Creek historic artifact classification is presented, and specific chapters are devoted to reviewing major artifact classes for sociocultural information. The remainder of the volume reviews categories of data at various synthetic levels and provides insight into the rich traditional lifeways once practiced on the farmsteads in this region. Sets of microfiche complete the Richland Creek Technical Series and contain various types of data pertinent to each volume.These sets are located in the backs of the volumes. In addition to the data provided in the microfiche and the five volumes, other information, such as original field notes, artifacts, computerized data, and site maps are curated at the Institute for the Study of Earth and Man at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING The environment surrounding the Adams Ranch and Bird Point Island sites consists of the broad floodplain of Richland Creek to the south, and terrace and upland areas to the north. The terraces and uplands have been dissected by numerous tributary streams of Richland Creek, creating an undulating topography with elevation differentials between 5 and 15 m. In the remainder of this section the environment within a3 to 5 km radius of the Adams Ranch and Bird Point Island sites is described in order to provide a background against which human ecological discussions in later chapters can be evaluated. This is a brief discussion of background information, since a detailed study

BY: rts, The the | be natal ters ek the nd/ ies the ils ct. ies rol Fa nd cal ng 2S, on he se Introduction of the biotic resources of the entire reservoir is provided in Chapter 6, Volume I, The data for this reconstruction were compiled by David Jurney, principally from records at the General Land Office (GLO) of Texas, and are based on notes made by original land patent surveyors between 1835 and 1850. Included within these notes are directions, distances, and sizes of witness trees for all major tracts of land surrounding the sites. These data, although potentially biased in several ways (cf., Wood 1976; Warren 1976), have been useful tools for the reconstruction of pre-Euro- American settlement in many parts of the midwestern United States (King 1984; Jumey 1982). In addition to the GLO witness tree data, other more general botanical summaries of Texas, such as Kiichler (1964) and Gould (1969), as well as data on soils and topography, are employed to interpolate between the known GLO data points. - The results of this effort are shown in map form in Figure I-2. This map represents our best approximation of pre-Euro- American settlement vegetation and provides a valuable ecological baseline for understanding the potentially exploitable prehistoric biomass. Three biotic communitites are shown in Figure I-2: Post Oak Savannah, Bottomland Forest, and Tall Grass Prairie. All of the communitites occur with in a 3 km radius of either site and would have been easily exploitable within convenient walking distance (i.e., less than two hours) from both sites (cf., Vita-Finzi and Higgs 1970). Since the disturbances that have occurred to these zones following historic settlement are not relevant to this discussion, we have only reconstructed each zone as it would have appeared in a natural setting at approximately A.D. 1850. POST OAK SAVANNAH Although all three biotic communities are significantly rep- resented in the vicinity of the sites, the Post Oak Savannah has the largest representation. Dominant overstory vegetation of this area would have been post oak and blackjack oak (Gould 1969), which together would have accounted for 80 to 85% of all tree species, based on GLO data (see Chapter 6, Volume I). The third most frequent tree species would have been hickory, accounting for 11 to 15%. The distribution of hickory in the GLO data with respect to topography shows that it prefers slopes and was slightly more frequent in these areas. The remaining 4 to 6% of trees would have consisted of red oak, pin oak, ash, and locust which probably would have been encountered in small drainages and along creeks cutting into the Savannah environment. Although today the dominant understory vegetation consists of shrubs and vines (U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers [USA, COE] 1982), in a prehistoric state tall grasses would have been dominant (Gould 1969:11). Climax species would have been little bluestem, Indiangrass, purple top, silver bluestem, and Texas wintergrass. The occurrence of these species indicates that the density of trees was substantially less than is seen today, and the area would have been more open and a true savannah environment. Such a shift is also supported by the fact that modern prevention of fires has caused trees to increase in number during the past decade (Halls 1971:171). In fact, some botanists prefer to classify the Post Oak Savannah as a prairie association of the grassland (Gould 1969:11). Several elements of this community would have made it particularly important to prehistoric populations. Important faunal resources indigenous to this area would have included whitetail deer, red wolf, fox squirrel, raccoon, gray fox, eastern cottontail rabbit, opossum, and several species of rodents, snakes, and birds. The dominance of oak and hickory species, accounting for nearly 95% of all trees, would have offered great potential for acorn and hickory nut collection. Both species are known to have been important foods of Native American groups throughout the Eastern Woodlands during the historic contact period (Swanton 1946:364-367). In addition, the high frequency of nut producing trees would have created a favorable environment for deer, and hunting of this mammal would no doubt have been a major FEU IOR PA FOL Tall Grass Prairie Post Oak Savannah {J Bottomland Forest oe were kilometere Figure 1-2.

An important plant food available in this habitat, but not found commonly in the others (Correll and Johnston 1970:813-817), would have been the prairie turnip (Psoralea sp.). The remains of the tuber from this plant are common at many of the reservoir sites, and its common occurrence underscores its importance in the prehistoric diet. A similar heavy usage of this plant is documented from further to the north in the Great Plains by historic Native American groups (Wedel 1978). BOTTOMLAND FOREST The second major biotic community within close proximity of the sites was the Bottomland Forest. As with the Post Oak Savannah, the dominant overstory species of this zone would have been post oak. The second most frequent species in the Post Oak Savannah, blackjack oak, would have dropped in frequency within the Bottomiand Forest to fifth, again based on GLO records. The species that would have replaced it in occurrence are ash, hackberry, and elm. Less common species would have included hickory, red oak, locust, and bur oak. In the swamps and wetter parts of the floodplain, green ash, sugarberry, hackberry, and cedar elm would have been dominant, with willow and cottonwood also occurring. Understory vegetation probably would have consisted of shrubs (e.g., coral berry, hawthorn, elderberry, privet, and American beautyberry), vines (e.g., Smilax, Virginia creeper, poison ivy, and grape), grasses, and sedges. The difference in the vegetational compostion between the Bottomland Forest and the Post Oak Savannah is due in large part to a single factor. The bottomlands tend to collect runoff from rainfall that falls in surrounding uplands and thus provide a better-watered environment for plant growth. The Bottomland Forest would have offered several species of potentially high economic value to prehistoric people. The oak species would have comprised a third of all trees, and acorns would have been an importnat autumn food source. The dense

shrubby understory would also have permitted the exploitation of several types of wild berries, grapes, and fruits, Potentially important mammal species of this area would have been whitetail deer, fox squirrel, raccoon, gray fox, bobcat, swamp rabbit, eastern cottontail, opossum, several species of fish and amphibians from creeks and other water sources, and a variety of birds. The total faunal biomass would have been the greatest of any of the habitats, with more variety and a greater frequency of most species available. Two obvious exceptions to this would have been deer and bison, both of which would have been greater in frequency in the Post Oak Savannah and the Tall Grass Prairie, respectively. The high overall exploitable biomass would have made this zone a focus of many procurement activities throughout the prehistoric period. . TALL GRASS PRAIRIE Based on GLO records, the Tall Grass Prairie zone would have been located within 2 to 4 km of the Adams Ranch and Bird Point Island sites. These records also indicate that post oaks and blackjack oaks were present among the grasses, although these trees were widely spaced at 80 m or more apart. This occurrence of oak species in some parts of the prairies is common where soils are medium to light in texture (Gould 1969). The dominant climax species would have been little bluestem, followed by big bluestem, Indiangrass, switch grass, side oats grama, and hairy grama. Faunal species of importance to prehistoric man would have been bison, eastern cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, rodents, and birds. Volume H, Part One Shafer, Dering, and Baxter (1975) have defined the Tall Grass Prairie as a marginally specialized ecosystem. Geertz (1964) defines a specialized ecosystem as one in which a low species diversity index exists, although each species is represented by a large number of individuals. The modifier “marginally” is used to indicate that the specialized nature of the prairie is buffered by the drainage habitats which support linear bands of the Bottomland Forest. If we accept this statement as a reasonable categorization, the above data would suggest that the Bottomlan Forest and Post Oak Savannah habitats can be categorized as less specialized, or generalized ecosystems. Based on presently available archae- ological data from North Central Texas (Murry 1982), it would appear that the subsistence economy of prehistoric people certainly was oriented away from the prairie and toward the bottomland habitats. For example, although the Tall Grass Prairie contains many species of grasses and forbs, there is little evidence of these having been exploited prehistorically (Skinner et al. 1978:151). Thus, from an economic standpoint, only a few animal species from the Tall Grass Prairie could have been of any great importance. A legitimate counter to this argument might be that the sheer quantity of bison, both in terms of individual size and herd numbers, would have offset the low species diversity of the prairie. However, the actual frequency of bison in this habitat is not clear, and in fact, archaeological evidence indicates that they have been infrequently exploited throughout much of the prehistoric period and may have been absent altogether at certain times (Lynott 1979; Dillehay 1974). In support of this latter view is the rarity of bison remains form prehistoric sites in the Richland/Chambers Dam and Reservoir area (see Chapter 9). a Be

THE BIRD POINT ISLAND SITE. by James E. Bruseth and William A. Martin * The Bird Point Island site (41FT201) has received more atten- tion in terms of excavation time, artifact analysis and other specialized analyses, and remote sensing detection of features than any other site in the Richland/Chambers Reservoir area. The reason for this greater effort is due in part to the work of Mr. Bill Young, avocational archaeologist from Corsicana, who initially discovered the site. Young collected artifacts from the site for more than a decade prior to Southern Methodist University’s work, and amassed a sufficient artifact collection to understand that the site was important with respect to the local archaeology. More ceramic artifacts, which are generally rare from the reservoir area, had come from this site than from any other along Richland Creek, In addition, the overall density of artifacts showed that substantial cultural occupation had taken place at the site at several different times during the prehistoric period. Aside from the artifacts, Young had identified important cul- tural features at the site. The most important of these was a large surface depression, approximately 10 m in diameter and 1 m deep, located on the western slope of the site. The shape and size of the pit were reminiscent of the Wylie focus pits located along the East Fork of the Trinity River, about 100 km to the north (Stephenson 1949a, 1952b). This similarity to the Wylie focus pits underscored the importance of this feature at the Bird Point Island site. Despite considerable attention by archaeologists since the late 1940s, the function of the pits along the East Fork is not clearly understood. The most thorough investigation of a Wylie focus pit was conducted by Lynott (1975) at the Sister Grove Creek site, but even this left several hypothesized pit functions in need of further testing. Unfor- tunately, construction of Lake Ray Hubbard and Lake Lavon has in- undated most of the remaining known Wylie focus pit sites, so further testing of Lynott’s hypothesis is not possible along the East Fork. Consequently, the occurrence of the pit at Bird Point Island was thought to offer another chance to advance our knowledge about these features. At a minimum we had an opportunity to test Lynott’s hypotheses, and with luck, we would finally understand why these pits were built and how they functioned within the prehistoric community that constructed them. Of course, a critical assumption in this reasoning is that the pit at Bird Point Island was culturally similar to the Wylie focus pits located further to the north. Although the surface depression of the pit and Young’s artifact collection both suggested this, there was no guarantee that this would be verified as excavation proceeded. Indeed, our work showed that the pits are culturally similar, both in terms of physical structure and content, and the work at the Bird Point Island site has shed light on the function of these pit features of North Central Texas. HISTORY OF INVESTIGATIONS AND RESEARCH ORIENTATION In this section we outline the history of the investigations at the Bird Point Island site since its initial discovery. This is also a convenient place to present the development and evolution of our research orientation at the site. As in any project, research goals and objectives change with time and this certainly has been the case at Bird Point Island. Moreover, understanding how our research orientation has evolved is crucial for understanding the shifts in field strategies. Based on land surveyor notes and records on file at the General Land Office in Austin, the Bird Point Island site was forested during much of its post-occupational history. The first change in site vegetation is evident in photographs taken during the 1940s. These show the site to be covered in brush and small trees, and suggest that shortly before the photographs were taken it had been cleared and farmed or used as a pasture. The few historic artifacts found during field investigations support this limited Euro-American use of the site. Discovery of the archaeological significance of the site oc- curred in the early 1970s when the area was cleared of all vegetation by a bulldozer. The site was subsequently planted

with grass and used as pasture. Mr. Bill Young was the first person to locate the site and made several surface collections. It was at this time that the site was given its name by Young based on the large number of arrow, or “‘bird,” points that he found at the site, and its resemblance to an island during annual spring floods. Also at this time, Young discovered the large surface depression. Shortly afterwards, Southern Methodist University personnel visited the site and recorded it as part of the Tennessee Colony Lake Project then being conducted along the Trinity River (Richner and Bagot 1978). At that time, the potential significance of the site was noted and further investigations were recommended. In the summer of 1980 the Richland Creek Archaeological Project began, the first phase of which was a survey with limited testing for significance of cultural resources within the Rich- land/Chambers Reservoir. During the survey, the Bird Point Island site was reexamined to provide updated information and to insure that data would be collected that were comparable to data from other sites located in the survey. In early 1981 the site was tested. This work involved the excavation of several backhoe trenches, two 1X1 m test units, and several shovel tests, with the purpose of: (1) determining whether or not the large surface depression was indeed a Wylie focus pit, (2) delineating both the vertical and horizontal extent of the cultural deposits, and (3) obtaining samples of artifacts from both within and around the pit. This work successfully demonstrated a similarity between the pit at Bird Point Island and the features along the East Fork and also showed that the site, as suggested by Young, contained extensive cultural deposits surrounding the pit. Based on this work, the site was scheduled for more in-depth investigation during mitigation. On the basis of the information obtained from testing, two hypotheses were developed to guide future excavation. The first stated that: “The Wylie focus pit . .. represents adevelopment from a local Archaic stage cultural base” (Raab and Moir 198 1:203). This hypothesis was based on radiocarbon dates from a similar pit at the Adams Ranch site which suggested a Late Archaic origin for the deeper layers. The second hypothesis was: ‘“The nature of the Wylie focus pit utilization changed through time’’ (Raab and Moir 1981:204). This was based on testing data indicating that burials were placed in the lower levels of the pit, and that trash was dumped in the upper levels at a later date. The implication of these two hypotheses is that the pit functioned initially as an Archaic cemetery and that during the Late Prehistoric period, the pit ceased to be a cemetery and instead was used as a trash dump. In 1982, Southern Methodist University began archaeological mitigation on the historic and prehistoric properties within the Richland/Chambers Reservoir. Since the testing information had corroborated initial impressions about the significance of the site, a multi-seasonal investigation plan was developed for mitigation. The first phase was to involve the excavation of one-fourth of the pit for the purpose of testing the two hypotheses outlined above. An additional one-quarter of the pit was to be excavated during the following field season, and a third season was scheduled for the purpose of investigating the surrounding deposits. Implicit in this plan was the assumption that the pit was the most important feature at the site and, as such, should receive the majority of any field effort. This assumption was supported by testing data from outside of the pit which, although showing that substantial deposits existed, indicated that these materials were not significantly better preserved than those represented at other sites within the reservoir. As can be seen in the remainder of this volume, this impression of the site was grossly inaccurate. In fact, the deposits around the pit were found to be better, in terms of both the variety of features present and the high degree of spatial integrity, than those at most other sites in the Volume II, Part One reservoir. Interestingly enough, this had been suggested by Young prior to beginning our investigations at the site. The goal of excavating a quarter of the pit was achieved during Season I which took place in the summer of 1982. At that time, a sample of artifacts adequate for initial feature interpretation was obtained, a profile of the pit was drawn, and bone and charcoal samples were recovered from which radiocarbon dates were calcu- lated. Most importantly, artifact frequencies could be related to dated stratigraphy, so we were able to test directly the hypotheses concerning pit function proposed by Raab and Moir (1981). The results demonstrated, as these hypotheses had proposed, that the pit was constructed during the Archaic period (AD. 1 to 600) and its function changed over time from a cemetery to a trash dump. However, our understanding of why the pit was excavated in the first place and how it functioned within the prehistoric cultural system that created it was still incomplete. Therefore, we modified the following season’s field plans to involve excavation outside of the pit and changed the emphasis of field work to investigate deposits relating to habitation. We hoped that learning what went on outside of the pit would teil us more about the pit itselfthan would continued excavation within it. Season II began in February 1983 and continued through May 1983. Evidence of at least two, and possibly three, periods of major occupation, and numerous periods of minor occupation, was un- covered at the site. So massive was the recovered data base and so extensive the potential remaining data that an entire additional field season was planned around the pit. This was carried out during Season III, from October 1983 through January 1984. At this same time additional limited work was conducted inside the pit to increase the length of the profile and to supplement the artifact sample. A final week of field work was conducted at the site during Season IV, in December 1984. The purpose of this final work was to cross- section several house post holes and finish up other work that could not be completed during previous field seasons. A particularly important discovery during the field investigations at Bird Point Island was that major periods of occupation appeared to have some degree of spatial separation. This implied that detailed intrasite studies could recover information on internal community patterning. A long-standing assertiqn by some researchers in Texas has been that detailed intrasite studies are needed at sites before we can make further improvements in our understanding of prehistoric cultural dynamics (D. Story, personal communication 1981). In the past, the mitigation phase at too many sites has consisted of small excavation units scattered across the site with the goal of recovering chronological data, often at the expense of understanding large-scale intrasite patterning. Large-scale excavations are required to expose enough site area to draw conclusions about spatial patterning. Since the Bird Point Island site contained extensive habitation deposits amenable to detailed intrasite analysis, we decided to conduct extensive excavations over the course of four seasons of field work. In conjunction with this emphasis on the recovery of large-scale intrasite data, a commitment was made to test a variety of techniques and sampling strategies to maximize the efficiency of data recovery. The large size of the site (4 ha) precluded the use of traditional block excavations for collecting the spatial data; at best, only a small portion of the site could be investigated in this manner. If we were to truly learn about intrasite community patterning, large-scale hori- zontal sampling was needed and a variety of techniques was used to collect this data. Consequently, the site was used as a test case for experimentation with different investigation strategies. As an added benefit to this procedure, the relative effectiveness of each approach was evaluated so that only the better techniques would be used at other sites in the reservoir. In other words, we hoped that the lessons learned at Bird Point Island could be translated into improved

SPATIAL DIVISIONS USED IN LATER CHAPTERS As outlined in Chapter 12 on site chronology, several different periods of occupation are recognized at Bird Point Island. A major focus of the artifact and feature analyses presented in this volume is on the placement of these materials into the temporal framework of Chapter 12. Ultimately these data are used to reconstruct major periods of site habitation and the cultural behavior that occurred during each period. Since most artifacts and features are not easily placed into the chronological periods, spatial analysis has been used to assist this operation. The rationale behind this procedure is that the different periods of site occupation have not occurred on exactly the same parts of the site and the spatial distinctiveness of certain components permits horizontal prove- nience to be used as a chronological tool. In the remainder of this chapter, we present the major spatial divisions used at the site. The division of the site is shown in Figure 1-1. The “North” refers to the area from the 40N line northward and corresponds to debris associated with occupation within and around three house patterns. A subset of this area is “Houses 1, 2, and 3.” All are part of a Late Prehistoric village that existed at the site. Most analyses, however, only examine House | and not the other houses. This is because block excavation uncovered artifacts from the northern 60% of this house pattern; the southern portion was uncovered by bulldozer scraping. In contrast, the other two houses were only discovered after extensive mechanical scraping, so intensive sampling for artifacts was not possible. The next two areas of the site refer to different parts of the same feature. This feature is the large midden, or organically stained zone, that occurs to the south of Feature 1. The limits and composition of this feature are discussed in Chapter 11. The midden has been divided along the 10N line to form two more or less equal halves. Other data, particularly radiocarbon dates and feature locations, suggest that the southern portion of the site may have been occupied later in time (see Chapter 4 and Chapter 12). Division of the midden into two halves along the east-west axis should provide a means to examine this chronological question further. The areas are referred to as “North Midden” and “South Midden.” In certain analyses, however, where data are limited or otherwise temporally inconclu- sive, the midden may not be divided into these two halves and instead is referred to as simply the ““Midden.” Another area of the site is the “South” area. This area corre- sponds to limited excavations that were conducted in the extreme southern portion of the site near the slough. This area was initially discovered during surface collection at the site (see Chapter 13), and later investigations found limited but nonetheless important cultural deposits in this region.

In addition to these spatial areas, Feature 1 is often considered as a data sample apart from other areas of the site. This feature is the large pit, similar to Wylie focus pits along the East Fork of the Trinity River near Dallas. Inside the feature, complex stratigraphy was uncovered with distinct chronological and functional interpreta- tions, and for these reasons considerable time is spent examining these data separately from other areas of the site.

PEDOLOGY: IMPLICATIONS FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION by Edward F. Janak, Jr. and William A. Martin The physical, chemical, and biological composition of the soil often varies considerably from one archaeological site to the next, and sometimes varies within the confines of a single site. Because dif- ferent soil properties effect changes in cultural materials after they have been deposited during the course of archaeological site forma- tion, an understanding of the specific soils present at any given site is critical to its interpretation. For instance, the shrink-swell capacity of a soil and the activities of burrowing animals living within it can re- sult in the displacement of artifacts, thereby complicating stratigra- phic interpretations. In addition, an understanding of soil genesis can determine whether the site surface has been aggrading, resulting in the burial of cultural horizons, or has been eroding, resulting in the mixing of archaeological deposits, or has been stable, with insignifi- cant effects on the deposits from aggradation or erosion. This chapter presents a discussion of the soil and landscape fea- tures present at Bird Point Island. A detailed soils map of the site is presented along with a description of each soil type based on the sys- tem of soil taxonomy utilized by the USDA Soil Conservation Ser- vice (United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service [USDA, SCS] 1975). Following the soil descriptions, the relevance of the specific properties of these soils for understanding site archaeology is discussed. LANDFORM DESCRIPTION A geomorphological study conducted by Pheasant (1982) identi- fied three alluvial terraces of presumed Pleistocene origin and a floodplain of Holocene alluvium within the Richland Creek Reser- voir area. Pheasant examined soil profiles at Bird Point Island and identified traits characteristic of the eroded T-1 terraces found in the eastern end of the Project area. The texture of the Pleistocene allu- vium ranged from fine sand to sandy clay loam, and A, B, andC hori- zons were observed (Pheasant 1982:227). The landform has the convex slopes associated with the T-1 terraces (USGS topographic Il map, Roustabout Camp Quadrangle), but soils of the Wilcox forma- tion of the Tertiary system are also preserit. The entire landform is mapped as part of the Wilcox formation on the geological map (Uni- versity of Texas, Bureau of Economic Geology 1970) because the area of terrace sediments (less than 4 ha) is too small to be de- lineated on a map with a scale of 1:250,000. Soils of the Wilcox formation form a narrow strip along the peri- phery of the landform adjacent to the floodplain. Pleistocene terrace soils cover the Wilcox formation along the higher elevations of the knoll where the majority of the archaeological deposit is found. The Pleistocene terrace materials are devoid of gravel or any other lithic material. The Wilcox formation, on the other hand, con- tains a lithic member in the form of iron-enriched siltstone and sand- stone. At Bird Point Island, outcrops of ironstone are eroding out of the Wilcox formation in the slough at the south end of the site. When heated this resource was widely used for cooking and roasting, so the presence of these outcrops may have had a significant influence on the selection of the site for habitation by prehistoric populations. SOIL TAXONOMY A brief discussion of the taxonomic system used by the USDA Soil Conservation Service is presented here to familiarize the reader with nomenclature referred to in the following sections. The system classifies soils according to physical properties which can be quanti- tatively measured (Brady 1974:318). Soils are arranged in a hier- archy of classes which are based on the relationships observed among soils. Six levels of increasing specificity are used in the hier- archy: order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. Orders are based primarily on morphology, grouping soils with similar sequences of horizons and similar soil genesis into a single category. Suborders emphasize genetic homogeneity and utilize fac- tors such as climate, environment, and vegetation to differentiate soils. The presence or absence of diagnostic horizons are used to

12 assign soils to great groups. Subgroups define the central concept of great groups and gradations away from that central concept. Fam- ilies are grouped according to textures, mineral content, and tem- perature. Finally, soils with uniform characteristics and arrange- ment of horizons are assigned to the same series (Brady 1974:321). Soil profiles are described as a sequence of horizons, which are layers of soils approximately parallel to the soil surface that have been produced by soil forming processes and have different proper- ties from layers immediately above and beneath (USDA, scs 1975:14). Most soils are comprised of three general horizons, the A, B, and C horizons. The A horizon is the surface layer which is usually darkened by the accumulation of organic matter. For the purposes of this report, the A horizon also includes the eluvial (E) horizon which is the zone of maximum leaching from which clays and certain chemical compounds have been removed. The A horizon is also the zone of maximum biological activity in which the action of roots, rodents and microorganisms have resulted in soil mixing, often referred to as bioturbation (USDA, SCS 1975:14). The B horizon lies immediately beneath the A horizon and is called the illuvial horizon. It is the zone of maximum accumulation of materials such as iron aluminum oxides, and silicate clays. The C horizon lies beneath the B horizon and is the zone of unconsolidated sands, silts, and clays which have had the least exposure to climatic and biological agents. Intact horizontal bedding planes are often visible in the C horizon (USDA, SCS 1975:16). Specific diagnostic horizons which comprise parts of the BandC horizons are used to sort soils into different categories. Among the soils recognized at Bird Point Island, the argillic horizon and the calcic horizon are important for classification. An argillic horizon is an illuvial zone in which silicate clays have accumulated. A calcic horizon is a layer of accumulation of calcium and magnesium car- bonates which is usually below or within the argillic horizon. At Bird Point Island, the terms B horizon and argillic horizon may be used interchangeably because the argillic horizon is the only diagnostic zone within the B horizon. The calcic horizon occurs further down in the profile at variable depths within the C horizon. SOIL DESCRIPTION Examination of the natural soil profile was conducted using north- south and east-west line transects across the knoll on which the site is located. The line transect is a systematic sampling technique com- monly used by pedologists in which auger holes are dug at regular intervals so that observations can be made about soil composition. Readings were taken at 20 m intervals on the north-south transect along the 20E line and at 11 m intervals on the east-west transect along the 60N line. A series of random readings was taken along the perimeter of the knoll to supply additional data for the generation of the soils map (Figure 2-1). A soil cross section generated from data collected along the east-west transect is illustrated in Figure 2-2. Six different soil classifications at the subgroup level were recog- nized based on the observations made at the site. These include Aquic Paleustalfs and Udic Paleustalfs associated with the Wilcox formation, and Typic Haplustalfs, Udic Haplustalfs,Ultic Haplust- alfs, and a small area of Typic Ustochrepts associated with the Pleistocene terrace deposits. The two great groups, Paleustalfs and Haplustalfs, are both characterized as freely drained soils with high base saturation and are different primarily in genesis. Paleustalfs were formed prior to the Pleistocene, and Haplustalfs and Ustochrepts were formed during the late Pleistocene. The term Typic defines the central concept of the great group, whereas the sub- group terms Aquic, Udic, and Ultic refer to variations of soil proper- ties associated with different moisture regimes. Paleustalfs are characterized by a loamy epipedon, an argillic hor- izon, and a calcic horizon below or within the argillic horizon. Aquic Volume II, Part One MN a 10° 20 «30 meters + 140 N 100 E Ulfic Héplustatts \ A Us Figure 2-1. Distribution of soils across the terrace at Bird Point Island. Paleustalfs are subject to water saturation during part of the year and exhibit mottling with a chroma of 2 or less in the B horizon. Udic ‘Paleustalfs have a humid moisture regime and either lack a calcic horizon or have this horizon at a greater depth than Typic Paleustalfs (USDA, SCS 1975:45). . Haplustalfs have a sandy or loamy epipedon, an argillic horizon with a gradual or clear, but not abrupt, upper boundary, and a calcic horizon at variable depths. The subgroups, Typic, Udic, and Ultic, differ mainly in the degree of leaching of bases that has occurred. Typic Haplustalfs have a calcic horizon at a moderate depth and are moist for an appreciable part of the growing season. Udic Haplust- alfs exhibit an intermediate degree of leaching of carbonates and have a calcic horizon between 1.5 and 2 m below the surface. Ultic Haplustalfs have been completely leached of carbonates which re- sults in an acid reaction and a decreased base saturation in the B hor- izon (USDA, SCS 1975:141). It is interesting to note that nearly 80% of the cultural features and artifact concentrations recorded at the site lie within the boundaries of Udic and Ultic Haplustalfs. This may reflect a preference for topography rather than soils, since these soils occur on the highest and best drained portion of the knoll.

Typic Ustochrepts are characterized by a shallow calcic horizon and an organic carbon content that decreases regularly with depth (USDA, SCS 1975:255). The texture of the entire profile is clay loam. The Ustochrepts were formed on the portion of the terrace that was subjected to the greatest erosion. More recent terrace deposits were washed away, exposing the underlying sediments in which the Ustochrepts were formed. This erosion also removed some A hor- izon material from the adjacent Typic Haplustalfs, creating an A horizon only 10-15 cm thick. With the exception of the Ustochrepts and a small eroded portion of the Typic Haplustalfs, all of the soils formed in terrace sediments generally can be described as having a brownish, fine sandy loam A horizon, 20 to 40 cm thick, which is underlain by a yellowish brown to reddish brown argillic horizon. Maximum clay accumulation occurs in the upper 15 to 20 cm of the B horizon, and clay content gradually decreases downward into unaltered, stratified, sandy terrace materials at depths ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 m below surface. The Wilcox soils exhibit a thinner A horizon (10-20 cm) and an argillic horizon with a higher clay content than that found in the terrace soils. One other kind of soil development known as an anthropic epi- pedon must be described. The anthropic epipedon is a surface soil layer that has been extensively altered by human activity. This type of soil is often found on archaeological sites and is referred to as a midden in the archaeological literature. Characteristics of this soil are increased levels of organic matter and of elements such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. The deposition of plant and animal remains as refuse increases the organic matter content of the A horizon and darkens the soil to a dark brown or black. The addition of bone and shell increases the calcium and phosphorus content of: the soil. ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS INTERPRETATION OF STRATIGRAPHY The nature of soil genesis and the physical properties of the A and B horizons at Bird Point Island are of great importance for inter- preting the nature of cultural stratigraphy. The soils present on the knoll were formed during the late Pleistocene, long before the first human occupation took place. This, combined with the lack of soil aggradation, means that the ground surface observed today is essen- tially the same surface that has been in existence from Paleo-Indian times up to the present. Consequently, debris deposited during various occupations of the site have become mixed together in the sandy loam A horizon. Cultural stratigraphy in the traditional sense does not exist over most of the site. Instead, most vertical separation of artifacts, with the exception of features excavated into the soil, is due to bioturbation. : In nearly all of the units excavated on the site, some artifacts were found resting directly on the surface of the argillic horizon, with the argillic horizon itself being relatively devoid of artifacts. An analo- gous situation can be observed in many soils that have gravelly sur- face layers overlying argillic horizons; high concentrations of gravel are found resting on top of the argillic horizon, but virtually no gravel is contained in the drgillic horizon itself. Both phenomena can be explained by the previously described characteristics of the layers involved. The A horizon exhibits physical properties favorable to the movement of objects, whereas the relatively high clay content of the argillic horizon forms a barrier impeding the progress of roots and burrowing animals. Since most artifact displacement is a result of plant and animal disturbance, this horizon also impedes the down- ward movement of artifacts. In recent years, archaeologists have devoted much attention to the role of soil-mixing processes in the formation of the archaeological record, For example, Wood and Johnson (1978:317) discussed the effects upon archaeological sites of pedoturbation resulting from plant and animal activity, freezing and thawing, mass wasting (soil creep), swelling and shrinking of clays, growth and wasting of salts, erosion, and earthquakes. The concept of bioturbation also has been examined in recent archaeological literature from East Texas. Brown (1975) countered the conclusions reached by Hyatt et al. (1974) in their analysis of material from the Cox site at Cooper Lake with a new explanation derived from a pedological approach. Hyatt et al. (1974) assumed that artifacts found at greater depths had been covered with alluvium which had been subsequently reoccupied, resulting in the stratification of the artifacts. Because fewer artifacts were recovered from the lower levels than from the upper levels, they concluded that utilization of the site had increased through time. In contrast, Brown (1975) suggested that all cultural materials had been deposited at or near the present ground surface, and that artifacts had been displaced downward by natural factors. He tecognized a size-sorting effect in which artifact frequencies de- clined with depth while the mean weight of artifacts increased with depth. This same pattern was shown to exist at sites 41FT158 and 41NV160 within the Richland Creek Project area (McIntyre and Janak 1982), and it appears to occur at Bird Point Island as well. i ap

i4 The principal effect of bioturbation is the gradual vertical dis- placement of artifacts downward through the soil. At sites associated with Lake Limestone, Prewitt (1975:35) observed a gross separa- tion of Archaic and Late Prehistoric artifacts with some overlap of vertical proveniences in the sandy deposit. He proposed that this pattern represented the cumulative effects of natural disturbance processes, or bioturbation. Subsequent geomorphological analysis by Byrd (1979:27 3-300) demonstrated that alluviation was partially responsible for the vertical separation of artifacts at some sites on floodplain knolis, but that the mixing effects of bioturbation were still amajor influence on the vertical distribution of artifacts at most sites. At Lake Fork Reservoir, Bruseth and Perttula(1981:56) recognized that: Invariably, where the A horizon extends deeply, artifacts are also encountered deeply. In many cases artifacts are found directly on the clay B horizon. Given that this B horizon formed through leaching and was never an exposed surface, these artifacts must have migrated downward from the surface. In addition, they noted variability in artifact movement which was related to the amount of time available for any given artifact to move through the soil. Artifacts deposited during earlier occupations had migrated deeper than those deposited during later occupations, pre- sumably because they had been subjected to the processes of biotur- bation for longer periods of time. This distribution was called the “age effect” (Bruseth and Perttula 1981:57), and it is believed to occur on most sites that are deposited on nonaggrading surfaces. DETECTION OF CULTURAL FEATURES Three properties of the argillic horizon at Bird Point Island act together to provide an excellent environment for the detection of cul- tural features: (1) resistance to bioturbation, (2) close proximity to the ground surface, and (3) light color. In soils classification, the upper 50 cm of the argillic horizon is examined because it is the por- tion of the solum which is most likely to express properties pertinent at the family level, and itis relatively unaffected by cultivation or bio- turbation. This lack of disturbance also promotes the preservation of cultural features which have been dug into the B horizon. At Bird Point Island, where the A horizon is only 20-40 cm deep, most cul- tural features were dug into the B horizon. Since the colors of argillic horizons formed in Haplustalfs are lighter than the organically enriched A horizon soil that forms much of the feature fill, cultural features are visible as light to dark brown stains against the yellowish brown argillic horizon. The ability to detect cultural features depends upon the contrast between the feature fill and the surrounding soil. The darkness of the feature fill depends upon the quantity of organic matter present in the fill, and this in turn, varies according to the use of the feature. For example, hearths are usually darkened by charcoal remnants and also may be marked by oxidized clay as a result of burning. These features usually have distinct boundaries visible against the lighter colored B horizon. At the other end of the continuum are post holes. Post holes were not filled intentionally with organically enriched material as were hearths or pits filled with refuse. Rather, they gradually filled with A horizon sandy loam after the wooden posts decayed. Post holes which filled with organically enriched midden soil are quite distinct, whereas those dug in areas without midden development are often difficult to see. This pattern was observed among the post holes in House | at Bird Point Island. Several post holes were of the same chroma as the argillic horizon, and the distinc- tion was barely visible as a value difference of one on the Munsell scale. In fact, many of these post holes would have been overlooked Volume II, Part One if a segment of the south side of the house had not consisted of darker, distinct post holes resulting from a localized midden accumulation in the A horizon. INTERPRETATION OF FEATURE PROFILES Drainage characteristics of the A, B, and C horizons also must be considered in order to understand the profiles of cultural features. For example, the mottled appearance of the profiles of Features 35 and 36, believed to represent large roasting pits, differed greatly from those of other large pits observed on the site. Examination revealed that the other large pits had gone completely through the B horizon and penetrated the C horizon sands, whereas Features 35 and 36 were confined within the argillic horizon and exhibited characteris- tics of poor drainage such as grayish colors and iron segregation. Apparently, the clay content at the bottom of these two features was sufficient to hold water, particularly after the compaction that un- doubtedly occurred when the pits were intially excavated. This created a trap which collected downward moving water as well as water moving laterally along the top of the argillic horizon. As the two pits became saturated up to the original subsoil level, normal lateral movement was restored. The stratigraphic profiles reflect this fact, exhibiting normal A horizon material underlain by a grayish zone with low chroma mottling. Drainage and associated leaching also explain the complex pro- file observed in Feature 1. This tremendous prehistoric feature, measuring approximately 15X17X2 m, was excavated from the A horizon down into the C horizon. The removal of the B horizon promoted drainage through the pit fill, causing leaching of organic matter which resulted in a gradual decrease in darkness of soil color with depth. Leaching of iron resulted in reddish staining immediately above the pit bottom (McIntyre and Janak 1982). This lens of iron accumulation occurred when the downward capillary movement of water was impeded by the strongly contrasting pore size of the undis- turbed C horizon sediments at the bottom of the pit. The occurrence of this lens was used to help delineate the bottom of the pit, which was otherwise difficult to distinguish. CONCLUSION The implications of soil variability for archaeological research are considerable. First, since the surface of the site has been non- aggrading over much of its history of human habitation, artifacts would have been deposited on a surface similar in elevation to that observed today. These artifacts would have moved into the soil through natural disturbances, probably caused in large part by the burrowing of pocket gophers. Pedestrian traffic across the site could also have forced lost or discarded artifacts into a subsurface context. Under these circumstances, the value of excavating in vertical levels, as archaeologists have traditionally been taught to do, is called into question. Although there is some order apparent with respect to the vertical distribution of artifacts, this gross separation of Archaic from Late Prehistoric artifacts is due to the age effect noted by other researchers (cf., Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Prewitt 1975). The age effect results in the oldest artifacts occurring deeper than the most recent artifacts simply because the older artifacts have been dis- turbed and subjected to displacement for a longer period of time. This vertical movement of artifacts is not uniform; artifact displace- ment is related to artifact shape and size (McIntyre and Janak 1982 ). Thus, the vertical context of the material is mixed and difficult to interpret. On the other hand, the horizontal movement of artifacts by natural processes is probably less destructive to cultural patterning since the scale of movement is smail relative to the overall site size (Bruseth and Perttula 198 1:57). Accordingly, the excavation meth-

Re cee cee aria ae_ ] . q . ; Pedology odology employed at the site was designed to de-emphasize vertical provenience control so that horizontal patterning could be sampled over a large area. The implication of the soils data for the detection and excavation of cultural features is that feature preservation will be minimal within the A horizon. Most cultural features at Bird Point Island represent pits dug into the soil for a variety of functions and‘most of these were filled with the dark organically enriched sandy loam that comprises the A horizon. The close similarity between the color and texture of the feature fill and that of the A horizon, combined with the mixing effects of natural disturbances, prevents visual detection of the upper portions of features within the A horizon. Features are only visible where they have penetrated the B horizon, which is lighter in color than the A horizon and has a sandy clay texture. Although material found in the upper portion of features may be of importance for understanding feature function or chronology, the mixed nature of the A horizon at Bird Point Island precludes detailed analysis of this material. Therefore, sampling of features should concentrate on the lower portions of pits, hearths, and other features which are preserved within the B horizon. These features form discrete units for analysis, and stand in contrast to the mixed A horizon artifacts. The A horizon should be sampled in a manner that will facilitate an understanding of large scale spatial patterning that 15 can be compared with the discrete areas occupied by features visible in the B horizon. The implication of soils data for the presence of interpretable stratigraphy and the identification of chronological levels is that no interpretable cultural stratigraphy is present, except inside Feature | which was sequentially filled and reused a various points throughout prehistory. The possibility of observing different surfaces of origin for features, which is directly related to their relative chronological placement, is limited to the stratified context of Feature 1. All other features originated at the ground surface which is similar to the present day surface. _ Finally, the different soils present at the site have different poten- tials for the preservation of bone and mussel shell. These faunal remains.are affected by differential pH values of the soil and are less likely to be preserved in an acidic environment. As stated previously, the terms Typic, Udic, and Ultic are differentiated primarily by variation in the leaching of bases that has occurred. Ulltic soils display the strongest acid reaction and Typic soils display the weakest acid reaction. Consequently, a lack of bone or shell within the area of Ultic Haplustalfs may reflect poor potential for preserva- tion rather than a lack of faunal processing or trash disposal. The interactive effects of cultural behavior and differential preservation must be considered when final interpretations are made.

MANAGEMENT OF THE DATA RECOVERY PROGRAM by William A. Martin and James E. Bruseth The archaeological literature of the past decade is filled with articles stressing the benefits of problem oriented research both for aiding the organization of individual projects and for adding useful information to the regional archaeological data base (Canouts 1977; McGimsey and Davis 1977; Fitting 1977; Raab 1979). In this vein, work conducted during the Richland Creek Archaeological Project followed a problem oriented research design incorporating a multidisciplinary approach toward the study of prehistory through- out the course of the data recovery program (Raab et al. 1981). At Bird Point Island, the collection of data in several phases over a five year period provided the flexibility required to make adjust- ments to field and laboratory procedures as the need arose. Method- ology was scrutinized carefully and evaluated as work progressed. As new data came to light during the interim periods of analysis, new procedures were devised to address problems of particular interest presented by these data. The refinements in excavation and analyti- cal strategies implemented during successive seasons of field work created a more effective mitigation program than could have been attained using a single-phase approach. The data management approach of the Richland Creek Archae- ological Project incorporated the philosophy of Lipe (1977:33): Like other disciplines, archaeology is healthy only to the extent that it continues to evolve new and more satisfying approaches to explanation. Nowhere was the effect of this philosophy more pronounced than at Bird Point Island, the site which received the greatest concentra- tion of effort during the course of testing and four seasons of mitiga- tion. This chapter presents a discussion of the data collection procedures used during the testing and mitigation field work, the manner in which improvements were made based upon the results of ’ each season of field work, and the effects of these improvements on efficiency and quality of the research. The evolution of the data recovery methodology is outlined as it progressed over the course of five field seasons. Bird Point Island 17 was extensively investigated because it is a large complex site with great potential to enhance the understanding of North Central Texas prehistory, but it also served as a testing ground for a wide variety of field techniques that have not commonly been used in this part of the State. Although some techniques did not reveal significant data, others provided a comprehension of prehistoric cultural behavior that previously could only be achieved with large scale block excava- tions and years of data analysis. Funds are seldom available for such large scale studies, so consequently, little is known of community level patterning at sites in Central and East Texas. The advances in methodology developed by experimentation at Bird Point Island can only be understood by examining them on a season by season basis. Although detailed discussions of the most successful techniques are presented in subsequent chapters, the logic behind decisions to use or abandon specific techniques can be under- stood only by examining progress at the site from one season to the next, as presented in this chapter, In fact, the entire reason for out- lining the methodology in a single chapter is to explain the factors responsible for selection of each specific technique used, not merely to list the techniques without any discussion of their importance. The following sections discuss the methods used during testing and then during mitigation Season I through Season IV. THE TESTING PROGRAM The excavation methods utilized during the testing phase at sites in the Project area were carefully matched to levels of information return. Traditional hand excavation was used on sites where intact cultural deposits were known to exist, such as creek bank sites with buried hearths. On sites where very little was known about the nature of the deposit, a more cost-effective approach was to explore the sites rapidly by means of backhoe trenches. When deposits warranting careful investigation were found, the backhoe was abandoned in favor of hand excavation (Raab et al. 1981). At Bird Point Island, a

18 combination of backhoe and hand excavation was used to examine the deposit at an expenditure of 45 person-days. One of the major goals of the testing program at Bird Point Island was to determine whether the large depression along the western slope of the terrace was the result of erosion or of cultural activity. Although similar depressions, representing large pits that had been excavated and refilled prehistorically, had been found near Dallas, no such pits had been observed south of the East Fork of the Trinity River. A backhoe trench (Unit 25) was dug to bisect the depression rapidly, exposing a profile for stratigraphic examination. The results of this excavation clearly demonstrated that the depression was a man-made pit of prehistoric origin which measured roughly 15 m across and more than 2 m deep (Figure 3-1). The pit, designated Feature 1, contained five human burials within the small portion excavated by the backhoe, as well as pre- historic artifacts similar to those found in the pits near Dallas. The burials, which included one cremation and fragmentary remains of other individuals, were distributed from 75 cm below ground surface to the bottom of the pit. The stratigraphic profile consisted of a layer of mixed yellow and brown sediments overlain by a homogeneous dark brown midden layer that extended beyond the edges of the pit. This suggested that the pit had been excavated and partially refilled prior to the accumulation of the dark brown midden (McGregor et al. 1982:36—38). Another goal of testing was to examine the horizontal and vertical extent of the cultural deposit across the terrace. Toward this end, 21 shovel test units (Units 1-20, and 26), measuring 40X40 cm were excavated at roughly 20 to 30 m intervals across the terrace, and two 1X1 m units (Units 21 and 22) were excavated in areas where shovel test units indicated deep deposits (Figure 3-1). All soil was dry- screened through 1/4 in (6 mm) mesh, except for standardized 81 samples removed from the [<1 m units and water screened through 1/16 in (1.4 mm) mesh. Two additional backhoe trenches (Units 23 and 24) were also dug to search for cultural deposits. Results of the shovel testing indicated that the highest density of cultural material occurred in a broad area south of the large pit, although some material was found across the entire terrace. The test units south of the pit also exhibited dark soil color, a characteristic of midden development, and higher densities of arrow points and ceramics. This suggested that an intensive Late Prehistoric occupa- tion occurred primarily on the portion of the terrace south of the pit. On the other hand, a relative lack of dark soil color, arrow points, and ceramics, coupled with a higher density of dart points, was observed on the northern half of the terrace. This suggested that a less inten- sive Archaic occupation occurred on the northern portion of the terrace. The vertical extent of the deposits in Units 21 and 22 was considerable. Unit 21 was excavated to a depth of 160 cm within the midden south of Feature 1. Unit 22 was excavated within the undisturbed area of a pit exposed by one of the backhoe trenches (Unit 24). This pit, subsequently labeled Feature 124, measured 4m long and was relatively shallow in the trench profile, but Unit 22 encountered cultural material and human bone to a depth of 190 cm. Although Unit 22 was tested with a post hole digger down to 250 cm, few additional artifacts were found below 190 cm. The final goal of the testing program was to assess the nature of the landform on which the site was located as part of a geomorphological study of the Richland Creek valley. Four additional backhoe trenches (Units 27-30) were excavated to expose the natural stratigraphy and allow soil samples to be collected. These trenches were also examined for evidence of cultural activity, but little was found. The only backhoe trenches that encountered substantial archaeological deposits were Units 24 and 25. Very little damage was done to the cultural deposits as a result of backhoe use. Only about 8% of Feature 1 and 10% of Feature 124 were affected by the Velame II, Part One backhoe, leaving the majority of these features intact for subsequent hand excavation. THE MITIGATION PROGRAM SITE RESEARCH GOALS As previously stated, a multiphased approach consisting of testing and four excavation seasons was used at Bird Point Island, with the focus of investigation changing from season to season as new lines of research manifested themselves. The first mitigation season concen- trated exclusively on excavation of Feature 1, the large pit. This season consisted of 302 person-days and was conducted during 10 weeks in the summer of 1982. Since most of the Wylie focus pits found near Dallas are covered by the waters of reservoirs, the discov- ery of a similar pit at Bird Point Island provided a rare opportunity to study the chronology, cultural affiliation, and function of these poorly understood features. Therefore, Feature 1 was the obvious object of initial research in an attempt to unravel the mysteries of these enigmatic features. Using data from excavations of other pits, along with information obtained during testing, hypotheses regarding chronology and pit function were proposed (Raab and Moir 1981). Lynott (1975:70) had proposed a Late Prehistoric origin for the pits, based on four radiocarbon dates ranging between ap. 950240 and 1590+90 recovered from the pit at Lake Lavon. Indeed, all of the previously reported pits contained artifacts associated with the Late Prehistoric period. However, the stratigraphy of the pit at the Upper Rockwall site suggested that its earliest use may have occurred during the Archaic period (Ross 1966:18). The evidence from Unit 25, the backhoe trench inside Feature 1 at Bird Point Island, also pointed toward an Archaic origin. As a result, it was hypothesized that the pit had been dug during the Archaic period and that a subsequent Late Prehistoric occupation was responsible for the midden overlying the pit (Raab and Moir 1982:204). Since few artifacts were observed in the lower portion of the pit, whereas a concentration of artifacts and faunal remains was present in the upper 1 m, it was also hypothe- sized that the nature of pit utilization changed through time (Raab and Moir 1982:204). SEASON I FIELD STRATEGY Prior to excavation, a magnetic survey was conducted within five 20X20 m blocks which included Feature {| and the immediately surrounding area (see Chapter 10). The results showed some low- magnitude magnetic anomalies over and around the pit. These data were compared with the findings of the excavations inside the pit, but little meaningful correlation was apparent. The magnetic data were set aside until a more extensive magnetometer survey could be undertaken at the site to provide a broader comparative base for interpretation. , Before beginning new excavations, backhoe trench Unit 25 was reopened to provide a profile which would, hopefully, permit excava- tion of the pit using cultural levels by following the strata observed in the backhoe trench. Unfortunately, the moisture content of the sandy C horizon created: unstable conditions which resulted in wall slumping. The trench was backfilled quickly to prevent additional damage to this important feature, and excavation proceeded by arbitrary levels within 2X2 m units. Fourteen 2X2 m units were excavated, creating a 56 m? block excavation in the southwest quarter of the pit (Figure 6-1). The numbering system was designed for a larger block excavation, with units beginning along the south

20 edge of Unit 25. Time constraints prevented all of these units from being excavated; consequently, the units in Figure 3-3 exhibit gaps in numbering. Units 88 through 92 were opened first to form a 10X2 m trench which was excavated to the bottom of the pit. Units 93 and 106 fell outside of the pit and were abandoned once the B horizon was encountered. The uppermost levels of Units 88-92 were excavated in 10 cm levels, but levels below 30 cm were excavated in 20 cm levels to speed up the progress and to insure that the bottom of the pit would be reached during the 1982 fieid season. All other units were excavated in 10 cm increments, but none of these units reached the bottom of the pit. At the completion of the season, Units 102, 103, 95, 96, 98, and 99 were at the same level (70 cm below surface at the pit center, and 90 cm below surface at the pit edge), and Unit 97 was 20 cm above this level (Martin 1983:60). Most of the excavated soil was dry screened through 1/4 in (6 mm) mesh to recover artifacts. However, 20 | of soil were saved from each level for water screening through 1/16 in (1.4 mm) window screen to recover a sample of small cultural remains. All soil recovered from cultural features was saved for flotation through a froth flotation device. i SEASON I RESULTS Sixteen features and three human burials were recorded within Feature 1. Most features were recorded within the upper | m of pit fill and consisted of pits containing deer bone, antler, stone tools, nut shell, prairie turnip, and in one instance, maize fragments. The few features found in the lower levels of the pit included an animal burial, acharcoal concentration, and a small circular pit. Most ofthe human remains were found in the lower levels of the pit, including a tightly flexed male skeleton and several fragments of another individual. However, an extended buriaf was also found in the upper portion of the pit (Martin 1983:61-73). A series of radiocarbon dates demonstrated a clear stratigraphic sequence within Feature 1. The bottom layer of the pit dated from the Archaic period, roughly between 170B.c. and ap. 130.A single date from the middle levels of the pit suggested that a later occupation occurred around ap. 580 to a.p. 860. Finally, dates from the upper midden layer ranged between A.D. 1300 and ap. 1650. The fact that the bottom zone contained human and animal burials, but little occupational debris, indicated that the pit was intended as a cemetery during the Archaic period. The presence of occupational debris in pits dug during the late occupation suggested that the pit utilization had changed over time from ritual use to domestic use (trash discard). ‘ METHODOLOGICAL EVALUATION Although sufficient data were recovered to address the hypoth- eses posited prior to the field work, the amount of work accomplished for the time and money spent was deemed unacceptable. An increase in efficiency was necessary to allow adequate investigation of the remainder of the site during subsequent field seasons. The reasons for the relatively slow progress made during Season I were exam- ined, and a revised strategy was developed for use during Season Two. One reason for the impeded progress was the fact that excavators proceeded with extreme caution, being well aware that Feature | represented one of only twosuch pits known to exist intact. Previous researchers had generated a myriad of hypotheses about the function of these pits, including use as large pit houses, ritual feasting areas, sacred dance arenas, defensive breast works, and water storage Velume II, Part One tanks (Stephenson 1949a; Losrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975:11). Consequently, excavators were cautioned to proceed carefully so that data necessary to test these proposed functions could be observed. As the excavations proceeded, however, it became clear that data supporting most of these interpretations did not occur inside the feature. In addition, the hot summer climate of North Central Texas was a major factor responsible for decreased efficiency. The physical dis- comfort resulting from daily temperatures in excess of 100°F cer- tainly had a detrimental effect on the energy level of the crew, but more than that, the heat and lack of rain made the soil almost un- workable. The uppermost levels of all units were so hard that they had to be broken up with picks. Features discovered in the lower, moister levels quickly dried out under these conditions, making it difficult to map and photograph them. Perhaps the factor most re- sponsible for impeded progress was the difficulty involved with screening the soil once it was excavated, Dirt clods from the surface levels had to be broken apart by pounding them with wooden stakes. The first two problems were easily remedied for Season II mitiga- tion. The first problem, over-cautiousness, was less of a factor during Season II because all work was concentrated outside the pit. The second problem, the summer heat, was avoided by planning a spring field season. The third problem, screening efficiency, was more diffi- cult to solve. Although the soil was moister and easier to screen in the spring because of increased rainfall, dry screening still required a great deal of time and labor. Instead, water screening was selected as the preferable artifact recovery method. However, no water source was available other than the slough which remained dry during half of the year. Prior to the start of Season II, some Project funds were expended for the construction of a pond in the floodplain west of the site. Pumps were purchased, and a work area for water screening and artifact processing was constructed along the western slope of the terrace. The work area was bounded on the north and south by two heavy-duty frames which utilized interchangeable screens. A drying area, artifact collection hopper, and supervisor’s desk were located in the center of the work area. Once screens were inserted in the frames and were filled with soil, water pressure was used to wash the matrix through the mesh (Figure 3-2a). Upon completion, the screens were removed and were set in a drying area, while replace- ment screens were inserted in the frames. When the artifacts were dry, delicate materials were removed by hand, and the screens were emptied into the hopper which funneled artifacts into plastic bags (Figure 3-2b). Finally, a supervisor labeled the bags, recorded them in the log, and placed them in boxes for transport to the laboratory. The cost of constructing this factory-like system was anticipated to _ pay for itself many times over in terms of reduced labor costs; in fact, an increase of more than 100% in data recovery per person-hour expended was realized during Season II. SEASON I FIELD STRATEGY The second season of field work at Bird Point Island was zonducted during the spring of 1983. At this time, the research emphasis shifted from investigating Feature 1, a single feature at the site, to understanding the configuration of the site as a whole, The research centered on two problems: the identification of temporally discrete areas, and the detection of intrasite functional variability. Study of the first problem sought to relate the archaeological deposits found across the terrace to the occupations recognized in the strata of Feature 1. The second problem involved the delineation - of activity areas within the temporally discrete areas. Efficient examination of a site the size of Bird Point Island, which measures approximately 100X200 m, requires a rapid overview of

irce Jed Data Recovery Program a artifact and feature distribution to insure that excavations are con- ducted in productive areas. A four stage data-recovery strategy was used during the Season II field work in which an overview obtained during the first stage was used for planning the second, third, and fourth excavation stages. The first stage utilized remote sensing and surface collection techniques to provide maps of potential cultural features and artifact concentrations. During the second stage, inten- sive excavation was conducted in areas believed to contain features or activity areas. The third stage used systematic hand excavation to ’ sample areas of both high and low artifact density. During the fourth stage, larger excavation areas were opened to expose features visible in the B horizon. Originally, block excavations were planned for the final stage, but the quantity and size of the features necessitated a limited amount of surface scraping using heavy equipment to expose portions of them. A total of 435 person-days was expended during Season II mitigation. GEOPHYSICAL REMOTE SENSING Two remote sensing devices were used to survey portions of the terrace prior to excavation: a proton precession magnetometer and a sensor capable of measuring minute changes in electromagnetic conductivity (EM-38). A total of 13 20X20 m blocks (5,200 m2) was surveyed magnetically during Season II, including a resurvey of two blocks surveyed during Season I. The total coverage for both seasons was 16 blocks (6,400 m2). Three 20X20 m blocks and one partial block measuring 10X20 m, covering 1400 m2, were surveyed with the EM-38 prior to excavation. At the end of the field season, additional survey was conducted over a 4X6 m partial block, a 10X20 m block, and a 20X30 m block which partially overlapped a block surveyed at the beginning of the season. Total coverage with the EM-38 was 2024 m?, These surveys identified locations of potential cultural features, thereby providing target areas for initial excavation. The magnetom- eter survey encompassed an area broad enough to include peripheral areas where little activity was thought to have occurred. The objec- tive of this broad coverage was to isolate areas of concentrated activity in an attempt to define site limits. The conductivity survey was confined to a more limited area due to the fact that its use was experimental and its effectiveness was unknown. At least 32 magnetic anomalies and several conductivity anoma- lies were recognized. In areas where both techniques were used, substantial overlap was observed among magnetic anomalies with 21 b Figure 3-2. Water screen work area: (a) water screens in operation, (b) funneling artifacts into a bag with a hopper. high magnetic responses and conductivity anomalies with low conductivity responses. These overlapping anomalies were used as starting points for the excavation stage. A detailed discussion of the remote sensing surveys and results is presented in Chapter 10. AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY Aerial photographs were taken by Lauden Aerial Productions at both high and low altitudes. A 35 mm camera mounted to a small air- craft was used to shoot Kodak panchromatic black and white film for the high altitude photos and Kodak infrared black and white film for the low altitude photos. Sufficient overlap between frames was allowed to permit the production of stereo pairs. The grid used to conduct the magnetic and conductivity surveys was marked to make it visible in the photographs, allowing comparisons to be made. The site was plowed with a disc plow prior to the flights to remove un- eveness in ground temperature caused by vegetation which could adversely affect the photographs. This procedure caused minimal damage to the archaeological content of the site, since it had been plowed several times by the previous landowner. Unfortunately, the results of the aerial photography were less useful than had been hoped. The small film format was inadequate for producing good quality enlargements, and optical distortion prevented direct mea- surement of ground distances from the photographs. Aside from these difficulties, the photographs were useful for delineating areas where brush had been cleared and burned in recent years. Also, the general outline of the midden on the south half of the site was visible, as was a small patch of darker soil on the north part of the site which was later determined to be of cultural origin (see Chapter 11). CONTROLLED SURFACE COLLECTION The next procedure was the systematic collection of surface artifacts to delineate activity areas. This technique has been used at several other sites with success (Binford et al. 1970; Bruseth and Perttula 1981), and it was used to obtain a picture of the horizontal distributions of artifacts to plan further excavations. The site was gridded into 55 m units and all artifacts from each unit were col- lected. The artifact frequencies were then entered into a micro- computer and transferred to the mainframe computer on the SMU campus. A computer program (SYMAP) was used to generalize the data into a spatial map of contoured artifact densities.

22 The SYMAP program, a synographic computer mapping pro- gram which uses a complex algorithm to construct contours of similar artifact frequencies, allows the user to select the number of contours and the interval magnitude for each contour. The interval magnitude of the contours was selected to delineate three major density classes observed on many sites in East Texas: high density clusters, low density clusters, and low level scatters (Bruseth and Pertulia 1981:56). Low level scatters represent materials such as lithic debris or broken tools that were unintentionally entered into archaeological context by means of casual discard during the course of occupation. Low level scatters usually encompass the entire site area, and within these scatters, low and high density clusters are found where specific activities occurred. Low density clusters are usually comprised of objects that were curated and repaired by the prehistoric inhabitants, such as projectile points, knives, etc. High density clusters are comprised of artifact classes with short use life and high discard frequency, such as lithic debris in a stone tool manufacturing area, or fire cracked rock in a cooking area. Unfortunately, most artifact classes were too low for useful maps to be generated. Lithic debris, the most common single artifact class, did show an interpretable distribution, so this map was used to plan subsequent excavation strategies at the site. Further details on this technique and its results are discussed in Chapter 13. MUNSELL COLOR READINGS As soon as the controlled surface collection was completed, the same 5 m grid points were sampled for soil color in an effort to de- lineate midden boundaries. Soil samples were collected at a depth of 20 cm, just beneath the plow zone. The soil was stored in plastic bags to preserve moisture and was taken to the laboratory so that Munsell color readings could be taken under standardized lighting conditions by the same individual. The Munsell colors were digitized to rank them from brightest to darkest. These digitized values were used to generate a SYMAP of soil color which exhibited a large cluster of dark soil within the midden, closely paralleling the lithic debris clus- ter. The results of this study are discussed in detail in Chapter 11. INITIAL EXCAVATION The second stage of Season II field work was designed to interpret cultural patterning outside of Feature 1. In a sense, the initial exca- vation can be viewed as an anomaly-testing program because magnetic and conductivity anomalies were the primary targets of investigation. However, artifact clusters visible on the lithic debris SYMAP and low density areas were also examined. The goal of the initial excavations was to expose as many features as possible, as quickly as possible, so that decisions concerning subsequent stages of excavation could be made. Trenches composed of contiguous 1X1 m squares were exca- vated across the center of anomalies, artifact clusters, and low density areas which were dug as controls. The trenches varied in length between 2 and 12 m depending on the size of the anomaly or artifact concentration. A particular effort was made to extend each trench beyond the limits of the anomaly or artifact cluster so that artifact frequencies from inside the feature could be compared with those from adjacent areas. In all, 162 1X1 m units were excavated, including 93 units across anomalies, 24 units across artifact concen- trations, 39 units in control areas, and 6 units within large features (Figure 3-3). The excavation strategy enabled the excavators to locate the boundaries of cultural features. Excavation of each trench began with the units at both ends and proceeded to the center. Units were dug in 10 cm intervals down to the interface between the A and B Volume II, Part One horizons, exposing the yellowish brown, sandy clay B horizon. Once the depth to the B horizon was established at each end of the trench, excavation continued across the trench at this depth. Using this procedure, excavators were able to detect several large features by the distinct color and texture changes, from yellowish brown sandy clay to dark brown sandy loam, where the edges of these features penetrated the B horizon. Some trenches were excavated on selected portions of the site where anomalies and artifact concentrations appeared to be absent to insure that important features were not overlooked simply because they did not register on remote sensing or surface collection maps. These trenches acted as controls, providing data useful for com- parison with data from the excavations through the anomalies and artifact concentrations. Control Trench 1 was dug to examine an area of high soil conductivity, the opposite of the conditions found over cultural features. Control Trench 2 was dug to search for possi- ble structures indicated by low intensity conductivity anomalies that appeared on a filtered version of the map. Control Trenches 3, 4, and 5 were dug within the midden where artifact density was lowest and no anomalies were observed. Control Trench 6 was excavated in a low density area at the north end of the site. No cultural features were found in Control Trenches 1, 2, or 6, but portions of features were encountered in Control Trenches 3, 4, and 5. The vertical distribution of artifacts in these trenches and others across the site reflect the fact that all artifacts were originally depos- ited on the present ground surface and then worked into the soil by means of bioturbation and plowing, or prehistoric excavation of pits (see Chapter 2). This belief is supported by the preponderance of artifacts in levels 1 and 2 in all units not disturbed by cultural fea-- tures. The relative increase of artifacts at lower levels inside the features represents a mixture of artifacts related to the use of the features with those artifacts already present in the A horizon at the time the features were dug. The increase of fire cracked rock in the lower levels at the interface of the A and B horizons reflects the advanced degree of bioturbation that has occurred within the A horizon. Even though the pedological analysis indicated that the site sur- face was stable and that artifacts were mixed by means of natural and cultural disturbance, the initial excavations employed a traditional approach using 10 cm arbitrary levels. This conservative approach was adopted to collect the data needed to confirm or reject the bio- turbation hypothesis. The lack of interpretable cultural stratigraphy was confirmed by examining the vertical distribution of artifacts, so the use of 10 cm levels was abandoned for subsequent excavations, except in large features where vertical control was required to address specific research problems. SYSTEMATIC EXCAVATION Even though a substantial quantity of earth was processed during the initial stage of excavation, the overall percentage of the site that was actually sampled was rather small. A program of systematic excavation was undertaken to provide more uniform coverage of the site so that intrasite functional variability could be more confidently assessed. The methodology used to mitigate historic properties had proven useful for this kind of analysis, isolating structures, fence lines, and yards on SYMAPs generated from excavation data (Moir 1983:33). Therefore, this methodology was adapted for use at Bird Point Island. Units measuring 50X50 cm were excavated at 5 m intervals from 20N to 120N and 20E to 60E. Six 20X20 m blocks in the midden were excavated in 10 cm levels down to the B horizon. Excavation proceeded in levels because the data from the initial excavations had not been analyzed when systematic excavation began. However, when SYMAPs were generated for each level, it became apparent

24 that no cultural stratigraphy was discernible. The few trends that were observed were the same for each level and became clearest on the map generated for all levels combined. As a result, the remaining units were dug as a single level 30 cm thick. A total of 378 units was excavated, including the 108 units excavated in levels. MECHANIZED EXCAVATION Prior to the initiation of excavation, it was assumed that many anomalies recorded by remote sensing instruments had resulted from natural conditions. However, as the initial excavation stage pro- gressed, nearly all of the anomalies were found to have resulted from cultural features. The additional time expended to test all of the anomalies drastically reduced the amount of time planned for exposing broad areas by means of block excavation. Therefore, an alternative strategy was implemented which utilized heavy equip- ment to carefully strip the A horizon from limited portions of the site. Nine east-west transects were carefully scraped with a bulldozer on selected areas of the site to uncover portions of the features found during the initial stage of excavation and to search for evidence of structures. The scraping operation was monitored by the supervising archaeologist who accompanied the machinery as it traversed the site. The operator varied blade depth in response to signals from the archaeologist to avoid undue damage to features. Several passes were made along each transect with soil removed in 5 to 10 cm increments until the interface of the A and B horizons was visible. The bulldozer trenches were 4 m wide (the width of the blade) and varied from 75 m to 90 m in length (Figure 3-4). The locations of the trenches were chosen to provide uniform coverage of the site, sampling the north part of the site, the midden, and the concentration adjacent to the slough. Remote sensing and excavation data were used to place trenches with precision so that portions of large features could be exposed, leaving the remaining portions undisturbed for future investigation. Once these trenches were opened, they were scraped by hand to provide aclean surface in which features could be observed. Crew members used hoes with sharpened blades to scrape the surface of the B horizon, exposing organic stains where pits had penetrated the B horizon. Supervisory personnel followed the crew to map features as they were found. Trenches 2 through 7 were completely scraped and mapped, but Trenches 1, 8, and 9 were only partially investigated due to time constraints. FEATURE INVESTIGATION A total of 38 features and part of a circular house (House 1) were recorded during Season II investigations, but time permitted excava- tion in only 15 features. A priority system was used to sampie features of various classes to provide information useful for planning the Season III excavation strategy. Large irregular pits (Features 33, 34, 35, 36, and 38), small circular pits (Features 18, 19, and 20), and other smaller pits (Features 21, 22, 27, 29, 30, 37, and 40) were sampled for artifact content, as well as macrobotanical and faunal remains. Small features were completely excavated and their fill was floated to recover all artifacts and macrobotanical remains. Profiles were drawn and photographs taken once the features were cross- sectioned. Larger features too big to excavate in their entirety, such as Features 33, 35, and 36, were sampled by excavating 1X1 m units from the interface of the A and B horizons to the bottom in 10 cm levels. Feature 34 was excavated from the ground surface to the bottom of the pit because it was not found within a bulldozer trench and therefore contained intact A horizon fill.

Profiles were exposed for mapping and photographing by excavating a trench through each feature with a backhoe. METHODOLOGICAL EVALUATION The Season II field work can be viewed as an experimental research and development program in which the effectiveness of several techniques was assessed. Although most of the techniques employed had been used productively for archaeological studies elsewhere, their effectiveness on sites within the Richland/Cham- bers Reservoir was virtually unknown. Each technique was evalu- ated and the most productive were selected for use on other sites during Season III. These techniques and their results are described in more detail in later chapters of this volume. A brief synopsis of the results is presented here to provide a background for understanding the direction of Season III field work at the site. The magnetometer proved to be one of the most useful techniques, identifying concentrations of fire cracked rock as magnetic highs. The map of the magnetic field provided information on intrasite func- tional variability by denoting areas where fire cracked rock was used

One er cm ad. for ach 2S, ic- ed Data Recovery Program for cooking or roasting, as well as areas where it was not used for such activities. As a result, this technique was slated for use at other sites during subsequent field seasons. The EM-38 identified large pits as low conductivity anomalies, presumably because drainage in- creased within the features where the clay B horizon had been penetrated, removing water which is highly conductive. However, it recorded far fewer features than did the magnetometer, so its use was discontinued. The poor results of the aerial photography precluded the use of this technique during Season III. The SYMAPs generated from surface collection data, although useful for initial investigation, were less accurate than those generated from systematic excavation data (see Chapter 13). As a result, surface collection was abandoned in favor of 5050 cm unit excavation. The results of the systematic excavation provided excellent information about intrasite functional variability. For example, a lithic debris cluster was observed directly over House 1 and a large adjacent pit. Since four similar clusters were observed along the highest elevation of the site, it was hypothe- sized that these clusters also represented structures. Additional 5050 cm units were planned for Season III excavations in order to obtain a larger sample and provide more refined SYMAPs. From the standpoint of efficiency, the 50X50 cm unit size was ideal. When excavated to a depth of 30 cm, the volume of soil in a unit this size conveniently formed a single wheelbarrow load. This meant that a single provenience label was filled out and all dirt was ‘ taken to the water screen in one trip, minimizing the chances for the mixing of different proveniences. The provenience information was written on surveyor’s flagging and placed in the soil prior to transport so that the flagging was dumped into the screen with the soil and remained in the screen with the artifacts during drying. Finally, it - was funneled into the plastic bag along with the artifacts at the hop- per. This system improved efficiency and reduced labeling errors. SEASON III FIELD STRATEGY The third season of field work was conducted during the fall of 1983 and winter of 1984. The research objectives of Season I and II were also pursued during Season III. Generally, larger samples were taken to further address the objectives of previous seasons. SYSTEMATIC EXCAVATION The use of systematic excavation units to generate SYMAPs proved to be a successful technique for the study of intrasite func- tional variability during Season IT, so it was retained for use during Season IIL. The 5050 cm unit size remained unchanged because of its efficiency, but the sampling interval was decreased to provide more units for maps with greater resolution. ; The first half of the field season (298 person-days) was devoted to the excavation of 50X50 cm units within the portions of the site that looked most promising on Season II SYMAPs. In addition, a 30X30 m area adjacent to the slough was sampled to investigate the nature of the artifact concentration observed on surface collection SYMAPs. A total of 6,140 m? was systematically excavated in this manner, providing a 9% sample of the total site area. In all, 1,693 50X50 cm units were dug during Season III, bringing the total number of 5050 cm units from both seasons to 2,087 (Figure 3-5). The interval between units was decreased from 5 m during Season IT to 1.67 m during Season II. This permitted two units to be exca- vated at evenly spaced intervals between each pair of units from Season II, allowing Season II data to be used in conjunction with data from Season III for the generation of more detailed SYMAPs. These maps provided eight times the resolution found on Season I maps. 25 - ron - ~ 140 N-40E 7 ra a 140 MN 100 E a ES | i} tyl Slougb “ me eee Contour Interval 50 cm —— Sm spacing between units ——-- «1.67 m spacing between units Figure 3-5, 50 x 50 cm units excavated during Seasons II and III at Bird Point Island. Soil samples were collected from the bottom of each unit immedi- ately above the interface of the A and B horizons and beneath the plow zone. This procedure insured that the color of the soil collected was unaltered by the leaching of organic matter in the plow zone or the inclusion of yellowish brown sandy clay from the B horizon. The soil color from the units was used to produce more detailed maps for greater definition of small middens around houses and activity areas. BLOCK EXCAVATION Next, part of the crew began work on the block excavation of House 1. Excavation began in the center of the house with a north- south trench of contiguous 1X1 m units (320-325). In order to obtain a complete profile, it was necessary to avoid the 50X50 cm units dug within the house by shifting the position of the trench 20 cm east of the 22E line. Consequently, all units within the block excava- tion were shifted 20 cm to the east. Once the east profile of units 320— 325 was mapped, an east-west trench formed by units 326-334 was excavated adjacent to bulldozer Trench 4. Excavation of the block

26 proceeded north from this point and outward from the central units until the 48 m? block was completed. Crew members proceeded with caution during the excavation of House 1, searching for the slightest change in soil color or artifact density that might mark the presence of cultural features. These data were crucial for addressing the hypotheses concerning architecture and domestic activities. Units were excavated down to the interface of the A and B horizons in two levels: the plow zone (0-20 cm) and the remainder of the A horizon (20-50 cm). This procedure kept arti- facts that had been subjected to lateral displacement from plowing separated from those which were only mixed vertically as a result of bioturbation. This separation allowed SYMAPs to be run for each level individually, providing a map of the least disturbed zone inlevel 2. . Level 2 was carefully shaved down a few centimeters at a time so that features could be recorded and excavated as soon as they be- came visible in the lower part of the A horizon. Many features were so ephemeral that they only became visible on overcast days when lighting revealed subtle changes in color. As a result, many of the features recorded inside the house had been partially dug through before they were observed, which is why the plan views contain dotted lines for many features. Features were mapped, cross- sectioned, photographed, and profiled and all feature fill was floated to recover minute artifacts and macrobotanical remains. Feature 1 was thought to have been used solely as a cemetery during the Archaic period, possibly for high-status males; whereas it appeared to have been used for trash discard during the final occupa- tion. Additional excavation was conducted during Season HI to obtain a larger sample of features which might illustrate the range of activities that were conducted within the pit. Previous excavations indicated that males predominated in the pit, so it was suggested that it may have served as a special cemetery for high-status males. A larger sample of burials was required to test this hypothesis and to provide osteological evidence related to genetic or subsistence changes over time. A larger sample of radiocarbon dates from within Feature 1 was also required to refine chronological interpretation. Part of the crew excavated four 2X2 m units inside Feature 1. Units 401-404 were excavated in line with Units 88-92 to form a trench that cut across the center of the pit (see Figure 6-1). The plow zone was removed as a 20 cm thick level; all other levels were dug in 10 cm increments. Features and burials were mapped and photo- graphed according to standard procedures. A map of the east profile was drawn and photographed upon completion of the excavation. MECHANIZED EXCAVATION Once the 9% systematic sample of the site and the block excava- tions of House 1 and Feature | were completed, the next stage of investigation focused on the identification of features visible in the B horizon. To accomplish this goal, the A horizon soil was carefully stripped away with a bulldozer in the areas intensively sampled at 1.67 m intervals. The same procedures followed during Season II were used, but a much larger area was scraped. Approximately 6,000 m2 were scraped in this fashion. The bulldozer made a shallower cut in the A horizon than during Season II so that the final scraping could be completed by a tractor equipped with an adjustable backblade capable of peeling away afew centimeters at atime. After this, hoes were used to further scrape the bulldozed surface. Once features were scraped clean with the hoes, they were mapped and photographed by supervisors. One 20X20 m block at a time was scraped and mapped in this fashion. The large area scraped, the great number of features found and the harsh winter weather made hand scraping a monumental task. As a result, only the area north of the —20N line was scraped and mapped. The area Volume H, Part One south of the —20N lime, although scraped by the bulldozer, was not scraped by hand or mapped during Season II due to time con- straints. This area was investigated during Season IV. FEATURE INVESTIGATION More than 400 organic stains, most of which are believed to represent cultural features, were mapped once the B horizon had been scraped. The size of these features varied from 0.02 m? for post holes to 160 m2 for Feature 1. Also, additional circular house patterns, Houses 2 and 3, were uncovered. Obviously, only a fraction of these features could be excavated, so a sample was select- ed from the different categories of features observed. The shape, size, and color of feature fill were used to sort features into the rough categories from which the sample was selected. Six categories were recognized: (1) post holes; (2) smail, circular pits with black fill hypothesized to be smudge pits; (3) circular to oval pits 1 m or less in diameter, with very dark brown fill, thought to be storage pits; (4) large, irregularly shaped pits on the north end of the site, believed to represent roasting pits; (5) large pits within the midden similar to those on the north part of the site, but containing more bone, shell and ceramics; and (6) small, circular pits filled with charcoal and fire cracked rock, interpreted as hearths. An attempt was made to obtain a representative sample from each class of fea- tures. A total of 55 features was sampled during Season II, although seven were later found to contain cremated human remains and were assigned burial numbers in place of feature numbers. Hand excavated trenches were dug across the centers of Features 38 and 45 to test specific hypotheses about feature function that could only be understood with data collected by hand excavation techniques. Feature 38 was thought to be a roasting pit that had been reused over and over again. It was hypothesized that such a pit might be likely to display an erratic distribution of fire cracked rock if re- digging had disturbed concentrations of small rock fragments. Precise horizontal and vertical controls were required to address this hypothesis, so small contiguous units measuring 1 m north-south by 0.5 m east-west were dug in 10 cm levels to form an east-west trench across the pit (Units 423-434). This allowed the frequencies from 99 100X50X10 cm levels within the feature to be plotted and examined for symmetry or randomness of artifact distribution. Feature 45 was thought to represent a small version of Feature 1 because a burial had been found in a backhoe trench dug during Season IL. To avoid damage to other burials and to assess the nature of pit stratigraphy, an east-west trench of contiguous 11 m units was excavated in 10 cm levels (Units 411-418). All of the features sampled during Season III were cross-sec- tioned, photographed, and profiled. All fill from features inside the block excavation over House 1 and inside Feature | was collected for flotation. The sample size ranged from 15-180 | and it soon became clear that it would be not feasible to float and analyze 100% of the fill from the features remaining to be sampled. Therefore, the sampling strategy was changed for features found during the scraping operation so that a maximum of 601 from each feature was saved for flotation. The remaining fill was water-screened through 1/4 in (6 mm) mesh. Excavation procedures for features varied to some degree. Whenever practical, the south half of the feature was removed for processing, leaving the north half intact for future investigation, if needed. Features which were circular or oval were treated in this manner, but features with a long axis oriented in a direction other than east-west were sectioned along their long axis. For example, the long axis of Feature 94 was oriented from southeast to northwest, so the southwest half was excavated. Most features represented pits that had been dug and refilled as a single episode and lacked stratig- raphy, so the excavated half was removed as asingle level. However, ee en a sce =

Most features Season [V Features sectioned, no units assigned extra caution was exercised when excavating Features 94, 95, and 97, large pits in the midden, to search for stratigraphy like that observed in Feature 1. Excavation of these features proceeded in 10 cm increments until it became apparent that no stratigraphic layering was visible. Feature 94 was completed in 10 cm levels, but the pit fill was a homogeneous dark brown with no evidence of a stratified fill se- quence. Constraints imposed by the quantity of features remaining to be sampled and the inclement winter weather prevented the comple- tion of Features 95 and 97 in 10 cm levels. Since these pits had no _ visible evidence of stratigraphy and the field season was drawing to a close, the remainder of each of these features was removed as asingle level. It was reasoned that 50% of each feature remained to be exca- vated in levels at a future date if this degree of precision was deemed necessary. Magnetic survey of experimental features was conducted to test functional hypotheses related to roasting and storage pits. A detailed discussion of this study is presented in Chapter 10, but briefly, an attempt was made to identify cultural processes responsible for increasing the magnetic field over features. METHOLOGICAL EVALUATION For the most part, the field procedures used during Season II were well suited for the collection of data necessary to address the research questions. Of particular effectiveness for the study of spa- tial patterning and chronological assessment of features was the exposure of broad areas by means of mechanized excavation. Cer- tain interpretations could not have been made if features had not been exposed and mapped over the majority of the site area. For example, after scraping it became clear that numerous circu- - lar and oval pits were intrusive into large irregular pits in the midden south of Feature 1, demonstrating that they post-dated the large pits. Similarly, spatial relationships between houses and the large pits thought to represent roasting pits on the north part of the site sug- gested that these features occurred within yard areas around the houses and therefore dated from the ap. 1000-1200 occupation. The pronounced lack of intrusions into the large pits, dating from A.D. 1000-1200, at the north end of the site suggest that the ap. 1300- 1650 occupation was responsible for the numerous intrusive pits south of Feature 1, and that the majority of activity during this last occupation was concentrated on the south half of the site. Radio- carbon dates and distributions of temporally diagnostic artifacts offer additional support for these interpretations (see Chapter 12), but this information never would have come to light ifexcavation had been limited to small blocks and the broad pattern had not been observed. The data provided by 50X50 cm units were extremely useful for defining artifact clusters indicative of specialized activities. How- ever, evaluation of the fine sampling interval used during Season III suggested that fewer units could be excavated to obtain similar re- sults, It now appears that a spacing of 4 m is adequate for most sites. SEASON IV FIELD STRATEGY The final season of field work at Bird Point Island was conducted during the fall of 1984. The principal objectives of Season IV re- search were: (1) the completion of scraping and mapping at the south end of the terrace, and (2) the examination of post holes within the houses recorded during Season ITI. These areas were not thoroughly investigated during Season ITI due to time constraints. The South area adjacent to the slough was scraped, mapped, and. features were sampled to obtain chronological and functional data. At the north end of the site, post holes were cross-sectioned and pro- filed to obtain information on post hole shape, depth, and diameter.

For example, the presence of regularly spaced interior posts led to the hypothesis that most of the weight of the roof was supported by the interior posts rather than the wall posts. This implies that the interior posts should be larger and anchored at greater depths than the wall posts. The sampling program was designed to provide data from wall posts and interior posts that could be used to address this problem. In addition, the fill from the interior posts was saved for flotation to provide additional information about house content. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Bird Point Island has received more attention than any other site within the Richland/Chambers Reservoir and-perhaps has received more than any other site in North Central Texas. A substantial por- tion of the site has been excavated during the course of a testing program and four seasons of mitigation including 21 40X40 cm shovel tests, 2087 5050 cm units, 178 1X1 m units, 12 1X1.5m units, 17 2X2 m units, and 16 backhoe trenches (Tables 3-1 and 3- 2). A systematic sample of approximately 9% of the entire site area was obtained, and major excavations were conducted within the numerous large pits found at the site, with a total of 340 m* exca- vated by hand. In addition, nearly 1,800 m3 of topsoil were removed by machinery to provide an unobstructed view of all features present at the site, once the systematic sample of the A horizon was com- - pleted. This procedure permitted an unbiased assessment of the spatial relationship present among features. Aside from the vast quantity of soil excavated at the site, Bird Point Island also received the most attention with respect to the use of remote sensing techniques. Magnetometer survey was conducted over 6,400 m? at the site as well as over 800 m? off the site in a control area. Electromagnetic conductivity was investigated at vari- ous levels of intensity over a 1,400 m? area. These devices were employed to aid in the search for cultural features, and in the case of a ae ee | Ce

t One hae J om ad 3- area 1 the XCa- oved sent -OMml- > f the Bird use cted Vari- were se of Data Recovery Program the magnetometer, to examine experimental features for comparison with data from archaeological features (Chapter 9). The quantity of data generated by the research is enormous. Excavation revealed the presence of 325 features, 160 post holes, and 27 human burials (Table 3-3). A total of 293,620 artifacts was recovered by the 1/4 in (6 mm) mesh used to screen mast of the soil (Table 3-4). Numerous micro-flakes, faunal and floral remains were also recovered from fine screening through 1/16 in (2 mm) mesh and from flotation. , The most important aspect of the multiphase approach toward data recovery is constant review and revision of the research goals 29 and the techniques, used to pursue them. Excavation strategy and other forms of data collection must be tailored to address the hypoth- eses in the most efficient manner possible. At Bird Point Island, procedures were monitored continuously to evaluate their effective- ness and efficiency, Changes were implemented whenever new data shifted the focus of research or whenever specific techniques could be replaced by other more efficient techniques, The final outcome of this system of management is a report which provides information for traditional avenues of study, such as artifact typology, as well as for newer kinds of analysis, such as the study of magnetism for explain- ing the probable uses of features.

, DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS | OF CULTURAL FEATURES by William A. Martin and James E. Bruseth The term "cultural feature" as used in this discussion includes a broad range of contexts such as hearths, roasting pits, burials, post holes, caches of tools or food, artifact clusters, and other discrete loci where specific activities occurred. Schiffer and Reid (1975:275) call features "behaviorally significant proveniences" because they represent specific locations that were intentionally dug, used, and sometimes intentionally filled by the inhabitants of the site. Thus, features represent specific episodes of cultural behavior. In order to understand the relationships among features, their function must be determined by analysis of form and content (Binford et al. 1970). Depositional processes responsible for the inclusion of material in feature fill must also be considered (Schiffer and Rathje 1973). For example, an artifact recovered from a feature may have been included intentionally in the feature fill because it was directly related to use of the feature, or it may have been included unintentionally through loss or other incidental cultural behavior (primary deposition). On the other hand, the artifact may have been present in the soil before the feature was dug and included accidentally when the feature was backfilled (secondary deposition). Natural forms of secondary deposition also account for the presence of some artifacts in features. For instance, movement of artifacts by erosion or chuming of the soil by means of bioturbation can cause artifacts unrelated to feature function to enter into the feature fill. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the cultural features recorded at Bird Point Island (Figures 4-1 through 4-4), present the methods used to analyze feature form and content, and discuss the probable functions that the features fulfilled. Also, the natural and cultural factors which may have influenced the content of the features are discussed. More specifically, the chapter is divided into four sections which move from descriptive data in section one to statistical analysis of feature content in section two, followed by classification of features in section three, and analysis of house- patterns in section four. Feature 1, the so-called Wylie focus pit, is complex enough to warrant treatment in a separate chapter (see Chapter 6). Descriptive information, including the dimensions, magnetic responses,.and contents of the features, is presented in a 31 tabular format in the first section. Tables 4-1 through 4-3 are presented in place of traditional narrative descriptions of each feature to facilitate comparison of data. The artifact, floral, and faunal data are presented in a volume-corrected form in Tables 4- 4 and 4-5 as artifacts per 100 1 of fill. This permits direct comparison of large features from which huge samples were obtained with small features which contained far less material. Since all values are listed as artifacts per unit volume rather than as actual frequencies, comparison of the values is unaffected by variations in the volume of feature fill excavated. The raw data for each feature sampled are presented in Appendix C. The manner in which the tables were compiled is also discussed in the first section, especially with respect to missing data. For the most part, the analytical scheme and system of classification utilized over four seasons of mitigation changed very little. However, some changes in the system became necessary as our knowledge of the site increased and the data categories were . refined, The effects of these changes on comparability of the data are discussed. The second part of the chapter is devoted to the analysis of the data presented in Tables 4-4 and 4-5. The analytical methodology used to organize features into discrete groups having similar qualities is presented along with the results of this analysis. Correlations among data classes are discussed along with the results of Q-mode factor analysis. The third section describes the functional classes of features recognized at the site: hearths, roasting pits, storage pits, dog burials, post holes, and human cremations and burials. Features are assigned to these categories on the basis of the statistical analysis presented in section two along with data on size, shape, and spatial relationships. The final section concerns the analysis of data from Houses 1, 2 and 3. Architectural characteristics are discussed using wall post and interior post data in a manner similar to that used for the analysis of the houses found at the De Shazo site (Good 1982). The features recorded within the houses are also discussed. Finally, the architectural style of the houses at Bird Point Island is compared and contrasted with house styles from other regions. nD Dy

Note: Feature 1 encompassed Features 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 61, 61B, 72, 73, 78, 86, 87, 88, and Burials 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9/11, 10, 14, 15, and 18. FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS NUMERICAL DESIGNATION OF FEATURES The numerical designations of features presented in Tables 4-1 through 4-3 divide features into three categories: features, burials, and post holes. In general, cultural soil disturbances were assigned feature numbers unless specific criteria were observed which clearly distinguished these disturbances as human burials (including cremations), or post holes. This system was developed to avoid confusion resulting from multiple numerical designations for burials and post holes, such as "Feature 10, Burial 2", or "Feature 22 Post Hole 3.” Instead, a single designation was assigned to each cultural disturbance. For example, instead of assigning a feature number to a grave pit and a burial number to the skeleton within the grave, both the pit and the skeleton are referred to by a single burial number. Burial numbers were assigned to all features containing human remains, including isolated fragments of individuals and fragmentary cremated remains. Cremations are defined as pits which contain burned human bone. Each pit containing cremated remains was assigned a single burial number, except for one pit

a | Cultural Features found inside Feature 1 which contained the remains of two individuals, This cremation was labeled "Burials 19 and 20." In the tables used in this report, burials and cremations are indicated by the letter "B" followed by a numeral, such as B1. Post hole numbers were assigned to small circular to oval pits, ranging in area between 100 cm2 and 1000 cm2, which exhibited steeply sloping straight to tapering profiles indicative of cylindrical or conical shapes. The term post mold, which is often used interchangeably with the term post hole, is more properly defined as the remains of an actual post found within a post hole (Good 1982:53). No post molds were observed at Bird Point Island, but more than 100 post holes were identified. Post holes are listed in the tables by the letter "P" followed by a numeral, such as P7. One problem with this system of numerical! designation is that some features had to be redesignated as post holes or burials once further excavation and analysis was conducted. Several gaps are- visible in the consecutive listing of feature numbers in Tables 4-1 through 4-3 because some pits assigned feature numbers in the field were later redesignated as post holes or burials. For instance, many pits containing cremated human remains were not recognized as cremations until the osteological analysis was Pios . ~& = eT 35 completed. The feature numbers originally assigned to these pits were changed to burial numbers, and these feature numbers were removed from the list. Another reason for the gap in feature numbers is that some natural disturbances were originally assigned feature numbers, and these numbers were eliminated from the tables when excavation revealed that they were actually caused by roots or rodents. However, the largest single factor accounting for missing feature numbers in the tables is the fact that more than 500 features, burials, and post holes were mapped and recorded at the site, but only a sample of 177 was excavated due to time constraints. DATA CATEGORIES The principal objective of this study is to understand the behavior responsible for the creation and use of features by examining a variety of data categories related to form and function. Metric attributes describing the shape and size of features, including length, width, depth, area, and volume, were recorded. The artifact content of feature fill was divided into several classes, and the faunal and floral contents were quantified BASTIEN ESL DE DIES ye, . ee oe . -20 N 20°E — Feature excavated Feature mapped, but not excavated Figure 4-4.

Also, classes of data generated by magnetometer studies were included. Specifically, the magnetic response of each feature was recorded and used to determine the degree of reuse of certain features. In this section, each category of data is described, and the manner in which the data were collected is explained. Metric measurements presented in Table 4-1 are fairly straightforward. Length, width, and depth are measured in centimeters, area is measured in square meters and volume estimates are presented in liters. Depth is recorded in two ways in this table. A single measurement indicates the depth of the feature as measured from the top of the B horizon, the point at which most features were found once the A horizon had been removed by heavy equipment. Since the B horizon was encountered between 20 and 40 cm below surface, the actual depth of these features is 20 -- 40 cm greater than the depth recorded in the table. Two depth measurements (e.g., Feature 2, 30 - 35 cm) are presented for features observed in block excavations inside Feature 1 and House 1, where accurate measurements from the ground surface could be taken. The first measurement records the depth below ground surface where the feature was first observed, and the second records the depth below ground surface to the bottom of the feature. Volume estimates for features in which small portions were excavated were made by entering feature length, width, and depth into the formula for half of an ellipsoid.

Therefore, volume estimates for large features should be regarded as rough estimates. The last two columns, "Munsell Color" and “texture,” list the color of the feature fill according to the standardized Munsell color chart and the texture of the soil. Table 4-2 provides a summary of the processing techniques employed to recover data from the features. The first column lists the three methods used to process fill: dry screening through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh (Season I only), water screening through 6.4 mm mesh, and flotation recovery through a series of fine geological sieves. The letter D denotes dry screening, W denotes water screening, and F denotes flotation recovery. In many instances both flotation and a form of screening were used to sample a feature, so two letters are designated. For some large features, so many artifacts were recovered from the 6.4 mm mesh size that their function could be studied without spending resources on analysis of flotation artifacts. In these cases, labeled (F)W, the flotation samples were sorted only for macrobotanical remains, while artifact data were recorded from water screen materials. In all cases, macrobotanical data and small lithic debris data were obtained solely from flotation samples. ; The volume excavated, expressed in liters, represents the total quantity of fill removed by hand excavation regardless of the processing method used. The percent of feature dug was obtained

40 the quantity of fill processed by flotation that actually was. analyzed. In some instances, a large quantity of fill was excavated for flotation, but a smaller sample was analyzed due to time constraints. As a result, when the values entered in the column are added to the values in the "volume dry or water screened” column, they will not always yield the values contained in the "volume excavated” column. Table 4-3 presents the anomaly number, the magnetic response, and direction of polarity associated with the cultural features. Only the 27 features which produced measurable magnetic responses are included in the table. This number represents approximately 22% of all features excavated at Bird Point Island and approximately 6% of all organic stains identified at the site that are believed to represent cultural features. The anomaly number represents the number assigned by the magnetic specialist to each location exhibiting magnetic enhancement prior to the initiation of excavation. Some features do not have anomaly numbers because, prior to excavation, their high magnetic responses were thought to be the result of historic iron trash. The magnetic response is presented in gammas and measures the intensity of the magnetic field associated with each feature. The magnetic polarity indicates the orientation of the magnetic field around the feature. For most cultural features, a pronounced magnetic low is aligned due north of the magnetic high, but in some cases the magnetic low is shifted to the east, and in other cases several weak magnetic lows are oriented in several directions around the feature, causing mixed polarity. The implications of magnetic response and polarity for interpreting the use of features is discussed in Chapter 10. Volume-corrected data are presented for 83 features in Tables 4-4 and 4-5. Table 4-4 includes data from the 62 features which had the most complete sets of data, and Table 4-5 lists the same information for nine cremation burials and 12 post holes. Twenty data classes are presented in these tables which include magnetic data, artifact content, and macrobotanical content. Magnetic response is listed in gammas. Total large lithics (greater than 6.4 mm), total small lithics:(2 mm - 6.4 mm), total fire cracked rock, bifaces, unifaces, cores, dart points, arrow points, and ceramics are listed as volume-corrected counts calculated from the raw frequencies. Baked clay, bone, burned bone, shell, wood, hickory, pecan, acorn, Psoralea, and maize are presented as volume- corrected weights calculated from the original weights in grams. These 20 classes were selected for use in factor analysis because. they provide functional and temporal information useful for classification. Magnetic response is tied directly to thermal alteration of iron oxides in Wilcox sandstone and is useful for identifying features with heat related functions (see Chapter 10). Likewise, fire cracked rock and baked clay are indicators of features subjected to heat, such as hearths. Two size classes of lithic debris were included following the lithic reduction trajectory model proposed by Raab.et al. (1979) to account for differences in lithic reduction technology among features. The tool categories were not divided into more specific types because the resulting frequencies would have been too low to be meaningful. These general tool categories still have functional implications that are useful for feature classification. For the same reason, projectile points were separated only into dart points and arrow points, categories which have functional and chronological relevance, rather than into a myriad of specific types. Ceramics also have functional implications, such as use for cooking or storage, as well as chronological meaning. Bone and shell indicate the degree of faunal utilization represented in features. Poor preservation and small sample size per feature precluded division of these categories into specific taxa. Bumed bone was included in the analysis to help identify features which may have been cremations containing unidentifiable fragments of human remains. This was accomplished by comparing the overall contents of known cremations with those of suspected cremations. Finally, floral remains were included to help identify features with food preparation or storage functions. Volume standardizations were calculated as follows. First, the processing method was examined to determine whether the Volume II, Part One Table 4-3 FEATURES EXHIBITING MAGNETIC RESPONSES Anomaly Magnetic Feature Number Intensity Polarity (gammas) 23 25 Shifted 33 5 6 None observed 34 7 16 North-South 35 8 25 Shifted 36 9 38 Shifted 38 13 25 Shifted 42 17 50 Mixed 43 25 83 Mixed 44 50 Shifted 45 18 67 Mixed 46 10 None observed 47 23 25 Mixed 53 20 16 None observed 54 21 25 Mixed 55 22 10 Indeterminate 37 29 38 None observed 94 25 Indeterminate 95 23 38 Mixed 97 23 16 Mixed 98 18 16 Mixed 99 18 50 Mixed 102 18 16 Mixed 104 32 110 North-South 106 27 22 Mixed 120 26 16 Indeterminate 136 12 10 None observed 310 50 Mixed frequencies were obtained from 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) screens only, flotation only, or from both methods, Then the appropriate volume screened and volume floated columns were consulted to obtain the proper volume, adding the columns together for features where both methods were used. Flotation volume only was used for lithic debris under 6.4 mm in size, heat treated lithic debris, and all macrobotanical data because these classes of data were only collected from flotation samples. The volume processed and raw frequencies were entered into the simple formula Taw frequency = _x_ volume 100 to obtain the values in Tables 4-4 and 4-5. DATA COMPARABILITY Data comparability hinges on the consistent collection of data and the use of identical sorting criteria in the lab during each season of excavation. However, it is usually impossible to foresee all classes of data relevant to the research goals prior to field work, so modifications often must be made. For the most part, the data collected for features from all four field seasons are directly comparable, but some minor differences resulting from problems with the recognition of certain data classes, and from economic and time constraints on the analysis, were encountered. All data from Seasons II, III, and IV are directly comparable, and most classes of data from Season I are directly comparable with those from the later seasons. The principal difference lies in the category of fire cracked rock. This artifact category was not included in the Season I artifact tabulations because it was not identified as culturally modified until the end of the season. Otherwise, data classes were similar to those used during subsequent field seasons.

The heavy fraction was further sorted in two steps. First, all material was sifted through 6.4 mm mesh and material remaining in the mesh was sorted into all data classes presented in Appendix C. This provided results that were directly comparable with data obtained from dry screening and water screening through 6.4 mm mesh elsewhere on the site. Next, the material that passed through the 6.4 mm mesh was passed through a 2 mm sieve and lithic debris, bone, shell, and macrobotanical remains were removed and quantified. All extremely smal! materials that passed through the 2 mm sieve remained unsorted and unquantified, with the exception of micro flakes which were removed for detailed lithic analysis. The unsorted material was sent to a specialist along with the sorted macrobotanical specimens so that a rapid spot check could be made to make sure important seeds were not overlooked, The 1/8 inch- (3.2 mm) mesh size from the light fraction was sorted in the same manner. Smaller screen sizes from the light fraction were not sorted for artifacts, but were sent to a specialist for analysis of macrobotanical remains. MISSING DATA The missing data in Table 4-4 are data recovered by means of flotation only. All macrobotanical remains are absent from Features 42, 54, and 120 because flotation samples were not recovered from these features. Small lithic debris is missing from Features 94, 95, 97, 98, 99, 101, and 102 because, although flotation samples were obtained, time constraints prevented sorting for anything other than macrobotanical content. All missing data were coded so that missing categories were ignored by the computer rather than read as zeroes. Thus, the statistical analysis was not greatly affected. The fire cracked rock frequencies for Features 33 through 36 were corrected for the purposes of statistical analysis to avoid using figures that were drastically underrepresented. During Season II, only fragments of fire cracked rock larger than 2.5 cm were quantified. During Season III, it was learned that small fragments provided more useful information than large fragments, so both sizes were recorded. Unfortunately, Features 33 through 36 were excavated during Season II, so only large fragments were recorded. Their counts are not comparable with the total fire cracked rock frequencies recorded for the rest of the features. To compensate for this discrepancy, an estimate of small fire cracked rock was obtained by examining the ratios of large to small fire cracked rock from features with good data. Although the ratios varied considerably, many were in the range of 1:2 to 1:5, Feature 38 appeared most similar to Features 33 through 36 in size, shape of plan view, and artifact content, so its ratio of 1:2.5 was selected as a correction factor. The estimates for small fire cracked rock for Features 33-36 were obtained by multiplying the large category frequencies by 2.5 and the new totals were increased accordingly and used as values for the statistical analysis. The actual counts for large fire cracked rock are listed in Appendix C. This correction procedure has a methodological weakness, namely that it insures that slightly higher correlations will occur between Features 33 through 36 and Feature 38. However, the overall similarity of these features in other respects suggests that this estimate is reasonable. Since the correlations are based on 20 variables, the alteration of one variable should not affect the results to any great extent. It seemed wiser to use the estimated values than to compare values which were clearly underrepresented. ANALYSIS OF FEATURES The feature analysis classifies features on the basis of similarities in artifact content, size, shape, and other measurable characteristics. First, statistical tests and mathematical tools such as factor analysis are used to examine feature content from an

Field observations of characteristics that are not quantified in Tables 4-4 and 4-5 are also considered. For instance, the spatial relationships between feature locations and the houses affected interpretation. Likewise, the presence of subtle soil color changes within portions of features may reflect burning or disturbances that are important for understanding feature function, but cannot be easily quantified or included in statistical analyses. Therefore, both statistical analyses of feature content and field observations related to size, shape, and spatial location are combined to formulate the feature classification system. One assumption underlying the analysis of feature data is that features with similar contents, shapes, and sizes were used for similar purposes by the prehistoric inhabitants of the site. This assumption is tempered by the complicating factor of secondary deposition, where some of the contents found in a feature are unrelated to the original use of that feature. This concept affects feature content only; variables such as size and shape of the feature are completely unaffected by this process and they are unlikely to change after the initial use of the feature unless it is subjected to episodes of reuse. Therefore, feature size and shape act as good controls for comparison with features grouped together on the basis of content. The following section presents the goals of factor analysis, the manner in which the analysis was conducted, and the results of the analysis, Then, the sizes and shapes of features associated with the factors generated by this analysis are compared using the Chi- square statistic to examine the significance of relationships among feature content, size, and shape. Following the discussion of statistical analysis, general functional classes of features are described using information derived from field observations in conjunction with factor analysis results. FACTOR ANALYSIS BACKGROUND Factor analysis, specifically principal components analysis, was the technique selected for assessing the relationships among features based on the 20 variables described previously. For several years now factor analysis and related quantitative techniques such as cluster analysis, have been used increasingly by archaeologists to simplify complex relationships among their data. In a recent example, Ciolek-Torrello (1985) used cluster analysis to examine room content at Grasshopper Pueblo which allowed him to identify six classes of rooms used for different functions. Similarly, Hill (1968) used factor analysis to sort 14 pottery types into seven clusters of covarying types in his analysis of room variability at Broken K Pueblo. This type of analysis has been applied to the study of cultural features in recent years. For example, feature types at Cannon Reservoir were defined by Q- mode factor analysis of feature shape and size (O'Brien and Warren 1982).

It can also be used to describe regularities in the data, allowing inferences to be made about the nature of the data. Thus, factor patterns are useful for classification when treated as purely descriptive categories (Rummel 1967:455), The original purpose for selecting factor analysis was to sort the cultural features into discrete functional types. It was hoped that each factor generated by the analysis would represent a discrete functional class of feature. However, this was an unrealistic goal because the relationships among features are too complex to permit this specific level of classification. Secondary deposition processes complicated the analysis, and the unquantified information from field observations mentioned previously proved. to be more important for functional assessment than was originally believed. It is important to stress that factor analysis provided much useful information related to feature function, temporal placement, and degree of secondary deposition among features. This information provided insights into the nature of feature function and the kinds of relationships that exist among features that could not be observed on an intuitive level. The information derived from the analysis is discussed in detail here, and is later used to aid in the definition of functional classes. PRINCIPLES OF FACTOR ANALYSIS Rummel! (1967, 1970) describes five kinds of factor analysis: common factor analysis, principal components analysis, image analysis, canonical analysis, and alpha factor analysis. Common factor analysis only examines the common (shared) variation among variables whereas principal components analysis looks at all variation among variables, not just the variation they have in common. Image analysis is similar to common factor analysis, but has different mathematical properties. Canonical analysis defines common factors for a sample of cases that are best estimates of those for the population. This enables tests of significance to be used. Alpha factor analysis defines common factors for a sample of variables that are best estimates of those in a universe of content (Rummel! 1967:455-457). For the purposes of this study, principal components analysis was selected because it considers all variation among variables, not just the variation that is shared by the variables. By considering all of the variability, a better picture of feature classes can be obtained. The principal components analysis is also easier to use than common factor analysis, since estimates of communality do not have to be made. The basic steps in principal components analysis are: (1) the preparation of a correlation matrix, (2) the extraction of initial factors, and (3) rotation to terminal factors. Factors are defined as separate patterns of relationships between the variables. According to Rummel (1967:463): "The number of factors generated by principal components analysis is the number of ee ee me ee ie ee let ee ok

ne Maize hh iad! Sl oe ee, «et 2 = oma NP Cultural Features substantively meaningful uncorrelated patterns of relationship among the variables." Variables are assigned loadings for each factor, which can be interpreted like correlation coefficients denoting those variables that are most highly related to the pattern.. Eigenvalues are the sum of the columns of squared loadings for each factor; they measure the amount of variation accounted for by the factor. The initial, or unrotated factor pattern lists the most general patterns of relationship, whereas the rotated factor pattern lists the distinct clusters of relationships (Rummel 1967:466). It is the rotated factor pattern that is the object of interpretation because it provides factors that are much more closely related than are the initial factors. Rotation simplifies reality by shifting away from general factors involving all variables to groups of factors involving different sets of variables. It identifies each variable with one factor, or a small portion of factors, and minimizes the number of variables loading highly on any given factor (Rummel 1967:475). . Correlation coefficients are statistical measures of association used to examine the strength of relationships among variables. Several types of correlation coefficients are in common use and the selection of the proper statistical measure hinges on the nature of the data being compared. Most of the information quantified for feature content is counting level, or ordinal level, data. Kendall's Tau and Spearman's Rho are tests designed to produce correlation coefficients for ordinal level data. Kendall's Tau was selected for use in generating matrices of correlation coefficients because it is more suitable than Spearman's Rho for data sets with large numbers of ties among paired values (Blalock 1972:419). A great number of ties among the paired values was observed in the data set, especially among low frequency categories such as bifaces and unifaces where zeroes were common in the matrix. This fact made Kendall's Tau the logical measure of association for use with the Bird Point Island data. Two correlation matrices were generated: first the data classes were correlated with each other, then the features themselves were correlated with each other. Weak to moderate correlations were obtained in the first matrix, with the highest correlation coefficient being .58 between dart points and bifaces. The data classes appeared to be relatively uncorrelated and the moderate correlations were inadequate for providing an interpretation of feature function. On the other hand, numerous strong correlations were generated in the second matrix, with the highest correlations being .95 between cremation Burials 23 and 28, and .97 between Features 37 and 67. This matrix appeared to have the greatest potential for simplifying relationships among features, so it was used as the correlation matrix for Q-mode principal components analysis. Once initial factors were generated, rotation to final factors was conducted using both orthogonal (varimax) rotation and oblique rotation. In orthogonal rotation, the factors are rotated at right angles to each other like the spokes of a wheel, whereas in oblique rotation, each factor is rotated individually to fit each distinct cluster. Controversy exists as to which method of rotation is the best approach, so both were examined in this study. However, the results were not drastically different between the two methods, so only the factors generated by varimax rotation are discussed here. . RESULTS Twelve factors were isolated, with Factors 1-6 accounting for 89% of the variability among features. Factors 1-4 are the most important, accounting for 82% of the variability. Each factor from Factor 5 on accounts for a small percentage of the variability, and Factors 7-12 account for only 1.2% to 2.3% per ' factor. Therefore, only Factors 1-6 are considered for the classification of cultural features. In this section, varimax rotation factors are interpreted by examining factor loadings for features with known functions, such as cremations and post holes, and comparing them with the loadings for features with unknown functions. Features with loadings of .4 to .9 are listed for Factors 43 1-6 in Table 4-6. To understand which variables are responsible for the factors selected by the principal components analysis, the mean values for each of the 20 variables recorded for features associated with the six factors were calculated. The mean values for each variable are presented in Table 4-7 along with the standard deviations for features which loaded on the factors at the level of .4 or above. The mean values for features loading at .6 or above were also calculated, under the assumption that a feature loading at .4 or .5 may load at an equal or higher level on another factor. However, with few exceptions, the values obtained from these calculations were not drastically different from those presented in Table 4-7. The mean values for each variable are plotted graphically by factor in Figure 4-5 to illustrate important differences observed among the factors. The spatial distribution of features associated with Factors 1 through 6 is presented in. Figures 4-6 and 4-7. Prior to discussing the factors, the features with known functions must be defined. These features meet specific criteria that are traditionally associated with cremations, post holes, hearths, and storage pits. As stated previously, cremations are defined simply as pits which contain burned human bone. They are often difficult to identify because bone fragments that are clearly identifiable as human must be preserved before a burial number is assigned. As a result, some features containing burned bone too fragmentary to be identified may also be cremations, but they were not assigned burial numbers. Post holes, as defined earlier, are relatively small, circular to oval pits, ranging in area between 100 cm2 and 1000 cm2, which have steeply sloping straight or tapering profiles and thus are cylindrical or conical in shape. The principal attribute of hearths is evidence of intense burning marked by the presence of burned clay, charcoal, and in some cases by fire cracked rock. Storage pits are known primarily from their locations: inside houses in the central living area around the hearth. Their principal contents are charred plant foods. Factor 1 Factor 1 accounts for 58.7% of the variability among the features and includes 52 features with loadings of .4 or higher. The mean artifact densities for features included in Factor 1 exhibit the highest levels of bummed bone and charcoal found among any of the factors (Tabie 4-7, Figure 4-5). This trend is most pronounced for features with the highest loadings (.6 - .9). All other artifact classes are present in very low densities and many are lower for Factor 1 than for any other factor. Of the features with known functions, cremations and post holes have the highest loadings. Some features (Features 18, 20, and 91) suspected of being cremations because of their similarity to cremations in size, shape, and location on the site, also loaded highly on Factor 1. This lends support to the idea that they may be cremations in which human bone was too fragmentary to be identified. Features with moderate loadings (.4 - .5) include cremations and post holes but also include hearths (Features 104 and 105) and storage pits (Features 37, 63, 64, and 67) as well as features of unknown function. The different kinds of features included in Factor 1 appear to- be unrelated at first glance, but similarities become visible when the basic nature of their uses is considered. All of these features are essentially holes dug to include a limited set of cultural items and therefore, they all exhibit low densities for most artifact classes. The high density of burned bone and charcoal is easy to explain in that cremation pits were intentionally dug to store bumed human remains which probably were mixed with charcoal from the funeral pyre, and hearths are primarily comprised of charcoal. Post holes and storage pits contained less charcoal and little burned bone, but are similar to cremations and hearths in their lack of artifacts for most classes. In all of these features the primary function does not involve the inclusion or use of artifacts, so artifacts would not have been intentionally included within the pit fill. This means that most of the artifacts that are present within the feature fill probably were introduced by processes of

Either these artifacts had been deposited in the soil before the features were dug, or they were deposited after the feature was filled and entered into the fill as a result of natural soil mixing processes. In summary, then, Factor 1 isolated features that were used for limited purposes involving the intentional inclusion of only a few items. The common denominator among all the features is their low artifact densities for all classes other than burned bone and charcoal. Features such as cremations and post holes which contain burned bone and/or charcoal loaded highly on Factor 1, but all features included on this factor exhibited low densities for most artifact classes. We conclude that Factor 1 has isolated features of short term use subjected to processes of secondary deposition. Factor 2 Factor 2 accounts for 12.2% of the variability among features and includes 20 features with loadings of .4 or more. The mean artifact densities for Factor 2 are strikingly different from those for Factor 1. Factor 2 has the highest values of all the factors for magnetic response, fire cracked rock, bifaces, unifaces, and dart points (Table 4-7, Figure 4-5). In fact, it has high densities for every class except small lithic debris, arrow points, and aco for which it ranks lowest. Features with the highest loadings (.7 and .8) are primarily large, irregularly shaped pits located in the North Midden and South Midden areas (Figure 4-6c). Features with moderate loadings (.4 - .6) include similar large, irregular pits located in the North area of the site, as well as two of the hearths and one cremation. The large pits within each area of the site correlate most highly with each other. When the large pits in the North area are correlated with those in the Midden, slightly lower correlation coefficients are observed. This trend may be the result of a greater degree of incidental inclusion of refuse within pits in the Midden rather than the result of functional differences among the pits in both areas. Factor 2 features rank highest in densities of fire cracked rock and are very high in baked clay content. This indicates that they os ee ms el a ek ks a he at ae

High macrobotanical content was also noted, making cooking or roasting the most likely possibilities. All of these features are marked by high densities of several other artifact classes. Dart points, bifaces, and steeply chipped unifaces increase in these features more so than in any of the others. The consistent recurrence of these types in higher frequencies than are found in other features suggests that they were directly related to the activities conducted in and around these large features. All of these tools have cutting edges that may have been used in food preparation for removing peels, hulls, etc. Although some tools may have been included unintentionally, the dramatic increase in tool content demonstrates that most tools did not enter into the pit fill by the processes of secondary deposition associated with Factor 1 It is interesting to note that all of the large irregular features were grouped into Factor 2 on the basis of content alone without using data on size and shape. This indicates that these large irregular pits actually do represent a single functional class of features, as was hypothesized on the basis of similarity in shape, Factors 1 and 2, it does not include any features with loadings higher than .6. Features grouped into Factor 3 all have high macrobotanical content and high ceramic content, with the features loading at .6 having higher ceramic densities than features with lower loadings (Table 4-7). The spatial relationships among features loading highly in Factor 3 are particularly interesting because all of the features occur on the North area of the site, and 63% are present inside houses (Figure 4-7a). This suggests that Factor 3 has clustered together features related to domestic activities. Examination of the contents of features that correlate highly with one another reveal two major kinds of features which are grouped by Factor 3: hearths and storage pits. For example, Feature 103, a hearth containing oxidized clay and some fire cracked rock, correlated highly with Features 112 and 113. Feature 112 is situated in the center of House 3, where the hearth should be located, and Feature 113 is located inside House 3 adjacent to the wall. Feature 112 is probably a hearth, even though baked clay content is low, based on its location in House 3. Feature 113 contained the highest count of Iva annua (marsh elder) seeds found at the site and is located in the wrong location for a hearth (along a house wall), so it may have ‘or size, and profile among these pits. Some smaller features were also been used as a storage pit. Features 58, 64, and 74 within House | art included in Factor 2, so it seems that high densities of fire cracked are also thought to be storage pits. They contain high densities of for rock and baked clay formed the lowest common denominator staple food items, such as hickory, acorn, and Psoralea and are for among all the features loading on Factor 2 at .4 or above (Table 4- situated within the central portion of the house around the hearth. nd 7).

48 with loadings of .5 - .6). As with Factor 3, there are no features with loadings higher than .6 associated with this factor. Examination of the mean artifact densities show that Factor 4 features are only high in smal! lithic debris, acorn, and hickory. Factor 4 is the lowest of all factors for almost all other artifact classes and is second lowest for fire cracked rock (Table 4-7). Features with the highest loadings are Features 37 and 67 which are both pits inside House 1 containing charred plant material but lacking baked clay and fire cracked rock. These features correlate with one another at a level of .97. and are-believed to represent storage pits because of their content and location within the house. Post holes 32, 35, 102 and 104 all correlate highly with Features 37 and 67, probably reflecting their shared locations within houses and the results of secondary deposition of household items, In general, Factor 4 is similar to Factor 1 in that the low frequencies of most artifact classes are probably the result of secondary deposition. Whereas Factor 1 includes cremations, hearths, and post holes, Factor 4 contains storage pits and post holes, mainly features with low fire cracked rock and baked clay content, associated with the village occupation (Figure 4-7b). It is also similar to Factor 3 in that several features related to the house occupation are included. Factor 5 Factor 5 accounts for 4.0% of the variability and contains three features, Features 78, 86, and 87, all with loadings of .9. All of these features are dog burials found within Feature 1. The selection of these as a separate factor is due to the manner in which they were excavated. Unlike pits dug into the B horizon, which is a culturally sterile layer, those dug into the fill of Feature 1 include material present in the fill that is unrelated to their use. Thus, when dog burials were found, the bones were removed and no fill from around them was saved for flotation because the data recovered by flotation would have been unrelated to the dog burials themselves. The computer factored out these features because they had the highest bone densities of all features and because data were missing from all other data classes, This resulted in perfect correlation coefficients of 1 for all three features. It is clear that dog burials form a discrete class of features at the site, but the principal components analysis has artificially created Factor 5 due to the excavation strategy. Factor 6 Factor 6 accounts for only 2.9% of the variability among features and contains only four features. These four features have the highest densities of maize, ceramics, arrow points, large lithic debris, cores, shell, charcoal, and hickory found on the site, and the second highest densities of fire cracked rock, bifaces, and unifaces (Table 4-7). The factor loadings appear to be most affected by ceramic variability. Feature 89, with the highest loading of .8, also has the highest density of sherds found at the site. The types of ceramics found in these features are quite different from those related to the house occupation. Feature 101 contained Late Caddoan ceramics (see Chapter 8) and Feature 89 contained large, thick, plain sherds with large chunks of bone temper which are different from all other plain ware found at the site. Features 97 and 102 were very similar in that both contained trash lenses from 3 to 5 cm thick in the bottom portion of fill. The similarities detected by the principal components analysis appear to be related to intentional trash deposition in the fill episodes of these pits rather than to their original functions. Features 97 and 102 also loaded highly on Factor 2 which was comprised primarily of large irregular pits used for roasting. Although Factor 6 may not be useful for defining original function, it appears to have isolated a group of features within the South Midden area belonging to the A.D. 1300-1650 occupation which were ultimately used for refuse disposal (Figure 4-7c). Volume II, Part One In summary, Factors 1-6 aided in directing our thoughts concerning the elements and processes important for classifying features. Although Factor 2 was the only factor (other than Factor 5 dog burials) to isolate a specific functional class of feature, the other factors isolated groups of features related to house occupation and others related to the final occupation. Perhaps the most important observation is the fact that a majority of features (Factor 1) has been grouped more on the basis of secondary deposition of artifacts than on primary deposition. The features affected by this process might not have been recognized and may have been classified on the basis of artifacts unrelated to their function, if the principal components analysis had not been run. In effect, the factor analysis has grouped features into discrete entities, “types” based on content which is not always related directly to original feature function. The analysis provides information useful for examining feature function, but does not always produce specific functional types. COMPARISON OF FACTORS WITH FEATURE SIZE AND SHAPE Just as similarity in the content of feature fill is assumed to reflect similar uses of features, regularities in sizes and.shapes of features are also assumed to reflect similarity of feature function. Since size and shape are not affected by anything like the complicating effects of secondary deposition, they provide good, independent sources of feature information useful for classification. Size and shape are unlikely to change after the initial use of the feature unless the feature is subjected to episodes of redigging or extraordinary levels of bioturbation. In this section, the Chi-square statistic is used to determine whether or not there are significant relationships between the clusters of features isolated by principal components analysis and feature sizes and shapes. The information on size, shape, and feature content is used to assign features to specific functional classes in the subsequent section. The size of each feature was calculated as its area in plan view, Three size categories were selected which correspond to small (0.01 - 0.30 m2), medium (0.31 - 1.00 m2), and large (1.10 - 100.00 m2) features. Of features with known functions, past holes and small pits fall within the small category, most hearths, storage pits, and cremations fall in the medium category, and Factor 2 pits form the large category. Shape was determined by examining the outline of each feature in plan view. Two basic shapes were used: symmetrical and asymmetrical. Symmetrical features include circular and oval pits, whereas asymmetrical features include all amorphous pits. The number of features falling within each size category is listed for Factors 1-6 in Table 4-8, and the number of features failing into the two shape categories is listed for each factor in Table 4-9. A brief examination of these tables reveals that pronounced associations do exist between size, shape, and the factors selected on the basis of feature content. In Factor 1, 62% of the features are within the small category, and 81% are symmetrical. On the other hand, 75% of Factor 2 features are large, and 70% are asymmetrical. Factor 3 features are mostly medium sized (75%) and are evenly divided among the two shapes. Factor 4 features are mostly small (75%) and are primarily symmetrical (79%). All Factor 5 features are small and symmetrical, and all Factor 6 features are large but are evenly divided among the two shapes. Chi-square values show that these relationships are statistically significant. Only Factors 1-4 were used for the Chi-square test because zeroes in the matrix for Factors 5 and 6 would have invalidated the test. A Chi-square value of 56.91 with a significance level of 00001 was obtained for size, and a value of 18.60 significant to .0004 was obtained for shape. The results of the comparison have important implications for assigning features to functional classes. Comparison of size and shape with Factor I indicates that small to medium features which

As a result, care must be exercised in making functional assignments based on feature content; size and shape may actually be better criteria for classification of these features. The comparison with Factor 2 shows that the features grouped on the basis of content are similarly grouped by size and shape. Thus, most Factor 2 features appear to represent a distinct functional class characterized by larger asymmetrical pits containing fire cracked rock, baked clay, and a number of tool types. Comparison with Factor 3, which is comprised largely of both symmetrical and asymmetrical hearths and storage pits, suggests that these classes of features fall within the small to medium size range, at least during the A.D. 1000-1200 period. Factor 4 also contains storage pits and post holes ranging in size from small to medium but these are primarily symmetrical in shape. Thus, the asymmetrical component of Factor 3 features appears to be related to hearths. Factor 5 relates to dog burials in Feature 1 and is not important in this analysis. Finally, Factor 6 features were all large pits that were intentionally filled with trash during the late occupation; a pattern of behavior not as readily apparent during earlier occupations. FEATURE CLASSIFICATIONS FUNCTIONAL AND TEMPORAL DESIGNATIONS The discrete functional classes recognized at the site are described here using information on size, shape, feature content, the behavioral and functional implications presented by Factors 1- 6, and spatial relationships among features. Spatial relationships are discussed in detail in Chapter 13, so it will suffice to say simply that the concept of the household cluster, an area composed of features within and around a structure (Winter 1976), was used to help classify hearths and storage pits around Houses 1 through 3. Some features are listed under more than one functional category because they exhibit characteristics associated with each category, and a definite classification cannot be made. These features are designated with the letter "f" to indicate that their functional assignment is uncertain. Other features assigned to single functional categories are also marked by the letter "f" to indicate that their assignment to that category is tentative. Such features exhibit some traits associated with the categories to which they are assigned, but their functional assignments should be regarded as best estimates. Features assigned to the Unknown category yielded too little data to formulate estimates of feature function. The temporal classification of features was hindered by the fact that many features did not contain material suitable for radiocarbon dating, nor artifacts diagnostic of specific time periods. The features from clearly dated contexts include those found within Feature 1 (see Chapter 6), those which contained 49 datable charcoal, and those which contained ceramics bearing decorative elements diagnostic of specific time periods. All other features were assigned to components on the basis of spatial relationships to similar features from clearly dated contexts. For example, features found inside Houses 1 - 3 are clearly related to the hamlet occupation in the North area dated at A. D. 1000 - 1200 from charcoal in hearths, roasting pits, and a possible cremation (Feature 20). The close proximity of many cremations to one another, and their central location between Houses 2 and 3, suggests that they represent a cemetery area related to the hamlet occupation. Likewise, the distribution of the large irregular pits around Houses 1 - 3 suggests that they were work areas associated with the hamlet (see Chapter 13). The North area was characterized by a distinct lack of superpositioning of features, which strongly suggests. that most features were the result of a single occupation, Even though a few features found in the North area dated from a later period, the majority of features appeared to be associated with the hamlet occupation and were assigned to the A.D. 1000 - 1200 component. Likewise, many features in the Midden area are assigned to the A. D. 1300 - 1650 component, since radiocarbon dates and ceramic types from this occupation are common in these areas. Features for which temporal placement is uncertain are marked by the letter "t" in Table 4-10. Although some bias is undoubtedly introduced into these temporal estimates, owing to the facet that some features from earlier and later contexts are probably scattered across the site, these estimates are considered to be reasonable approximations of reality. Discussions of burials, flora and fauna in subsequent chapters use these same temporal classifications. The following subsections present general descriptions of each functional class, and Table 4-10 lists the features assigned to each class by chronological period. This section is intended as a summary of feature classes, so the discussion is kept to a minimum. However, the roasting pit discussion is extended owing to the unusual nature of these features and the problems involved with interpretation. ROASTING PITS Roasting pits were the only functional class of feature isolated by principal components analysis (Factor 2). Most are characterized as very large irregular pits, although a few pits are smaller and oval in shape. The size of these features ranged from 3.7 m2 for Feature 97 to 107 m2 for Feature 42, with most features falling within a range of 20 - 50 m2. These features vary in depth from 100 cm to 225 cm below surface; however, the majority range between 120 and 150 cm. In profile, the pits are roughly basin-shaped, but most are characterized by bottoms with irregular undulating surfaces. In several, two colors of pit fill are usually present, an upper darker zone and a lower lighter zone, probably due to effects of leaching. Aside from size and shape, feature content was a primary criterion for classification. All of these features contained high frequencies of macrobotanical Table 4-9 FREQUENCY OF FEATURES BY SHAPE PER FACTOR Factor Shape Symmetrical Asymmetrical 1 42 10 2 6 14 3 5 4 11 3 5 3 6 2 2

The spatial distribution shows that these features are evenly divided among the North Area and the Midden. Those in the North area tend to form a ring around Houses 1, 2, and 3. These large asymmetrical pits form an uncommon class of features. Such pits are not reported in the Caddoan area 100 km to the east and there is virtually no information available about them in the archaeological literature of North Central Texas, although similar pits have been reported within regions dominated by Post Oak Savannah (Story, personal communication 1985). The function of these features was not immediately apparent, so a careful program of excavation and analysis was conducted to investigate hypotheses related to the two kinds of processing suggested by the contents: heat treatment of chert, and roasting of plant foods. FUNCTION: HEAT TREATING VERSUS ROASTING If heat treatment of lithic raw material was the primary function of the Factor 2 features, then one would expect to find heat treated cores and lithic debris in and around the features. Although an increase in cores was found within these pits, no pattern of increase in thermally altered flakes was observed (Appendix C), The ratio of total flakes to heat treated flakes varies widely among features, with the highest concentrations of heat treated flakes occurring in features other than the large pits. Similarly, no relationship between large pits and heat treated lithic debris is apparent on the SYMAPs (see Chapter 13). This stands in striking contrast to SYMAPs of small fire cracked rock which clearly delineate these features. If, on the other hand, roasting of plant foods was the primary function of the Factor 2 features, then one would expect to find charred macrobotanical remains in the feature fill. Examination of Table 4-4 reveals that all of the large pits listed as roasting pits in Table 4-10 contain respectable quantities of hickory, pecan, and Psoralea. Roasting is an ethnohistorically documented method of preservation for nuts (Swanton 1946) and for the prairie turnip (Psoralea sp.) (Wedel 1978:165), so charred remnants of these species within the features support the roasting hypothesis. Another line of evidence that supports the roasting hypothesis and casts doubt on the heat treatment hypothesis is the great number of these features found at the site. This number of pits is too great to account for the small quantity of heat treated lithics ™ ta ®& hd oe Ft

One on wo rer ee Cultural Features recovered from the site. Certainly, there would be no need to dig so many pits for the processing of lithic raw material when a few pits would suffice. On the other hand, the processing of seasonally available plant foods requiring prompt attention (see Chapter 9) could well require the use of several pits simultaneously, since foods would be available for only brief periods of time and would have to be processed rapidly to retard spoilage or infestation by insects. Ethnohistoric accounts mention roasting of acorns (Swanton 1946) and prairie turnip (Wedel 1978) as common practices. Roasting pits are recorded in the ethnohistoric record for the roasting of sotol bulbs by Lipan Apaches further west in Texas. The soto! bulbs were placed in pits filled with heated rocks after the coals and ashes had been removed, then the pits were covered with dirt. After a few days, the roasted bulbs were dug out for immediate use or storage (Dennis and Dennis 1925). The large pits at Bird Point Island may have been used in the same manner to roast nuts and prairie turnips. Although there are relatively high frequencies of baked clay inside these features, there is little evidence for in situ burning as is found in hearths. The Wilcox sandstone, which comprises most of the fire cracked rock, was probably heated outside of the pits and then placed inside with the plants. The increased baked clay frequencies probably resulted when the heated rock contacted the sandy clay B horizon soil. An explanation for the irregular outline of these features was hypothesized, based on the sotol roasting account. Every time a pit was used for roasting, two episodes of digging were required: one to prepare the pit for the placement of food and heated rocks, and one to uncover the roasted foods. If the same pits were used over and over again, the numerous episodes of redigging would gradually change the shape of the pit since the area excavated each time would never quite match the areas excavated during previous episodes of use. This would cause the pits to grow larger in a variety of directions, producing the asymmetrical patterns observed today. This hypothesis was supported by magnetic data which indicated multiple episodes of reuse (see Chapter 10). FEATURE 38 EXCAVATION Feature 38 was selected as a test case to examine the nature of pit use and hypothesized episodes of reuse. Excavation and analytical strategies were selected to test hypotheses regarding redigging and reuse. It was hypothesized that artifact distributions, both horizontally and vertically, would indicate an erratic pattern reflecting a great degree of disturbance. Fire cracked rock and stone tools would have been redeposited from their original positions along thé pit bottom to points further up in the profile once redigging occurred. Some portions of the pit may have been reused while others remained intact, thereby creating a randomly mixed artifact distribution. To test this hypothesis, finer control of artifact provenience was required than could be obtained in 1 x 1 m units, so unit size was reduced to 50 x 100 cm. Units 423-434 were dug through the center of the pit in 10 cm levels (Figure 4-8). A total of 99 levels was excavated in Feature 38 and all fill was water screened through 6.4 mm mesh. For the purpose of the artifact distribution analysis, only lithic debris and fire cracked rock were present in sufficient quantities to exhibit interpretable trends. The west profile of Feature 38 is shown in Figure 4-9. The distribution of lithic debris is plotted by level along the west profile of Feature 38 in Figure 4-10 and the distribution of fire cracked rock is plotted in Figure 4-11, Lithic debris and fire cracked rock frequencies were grouped into six classes to facilitate comparison. For lithic debris, class 1 contained 0-4 flakes, class 2 contained 5-9 flakes, class 3 contained 10-14 flakes, class 4 contained 15-19 flakes, class 5 contained 20- 24 flakes, and class 6 contained 25-29 flakes per level. For fire cracked rock class 1 contained 1-49 fragments, class 2 contained 50-99 fragments, class 3 contained 100-149 fragments, class 4 contained 150-199 fragments, class 5 contained 200-249 51 meters Figure 4-8. Location of Units 423 through 434 in Feature 38. fragments, and class 6 contained 250-299 fragments per level. High frequency classes 4, 5, and 6 are shaded in Figures 4-10 and 4-11 to provide a clearer view of the variation of artifact distribution. The pattern of artifact distribution visible in Feature 38 shows high density clusters scattered erratically throughout the profile. This pattern is markedly different from that for features that were filled with trash at the time of abandonment. Such features exhibit a dramatic increase in artifact frequencies in the lower levels. It is also markedly different from the pattern observed in the natural soil profile or in features that were merely filled with A horizon soil when abandoned, where there is a gradual decrease in artifact frequency paralleling an increase in depth. Figure 4-10 shows the highest density of lithic debris in the pit (class 6) in level 5 of Unit 429, whereas level 6 has a density of only class 3. Likewise in Unit 431, frequencies drop uniformly from class 5 to class 3 in the upper levels, but then surge up to class 5 in level 4. The frequencies jump back and forth from class 2 to class 4 and back to class 2 in the lower levels. Fire cracked rock frequencies reflect the same trend, with high density clusters occurring at a variety of depths in different units. The pattern of distribution looks as if an episode of redigging occurred in the vicinity of Unit 431, removing some fire cracked rock originally present in the lower levels of Unit 431 and redepositing it in the upper levels of Units 430 and 432. Although this particular interpretation is speculative, it is clear that some disturbance from redigging created the irregular distribution of artifacts found in Feature 38. It is assumed that this pattern is typical of roasting pits in general. Figure 4-12 illustrates profiles of some of the other roasting pits excavated at the site.

Hearths: (a) Feature 105, and (b) Feature 57. criterion, but not all pits containing oxidized clay also contained this item, and other features which were not hearths contained fire cracked rock, so it was of less significance for classification. Frequencies of other artifact classes fluctuated dramatically among hearths, probably reflecting secondary deposition or use of different hearths for a variety of activities requiring heat. This fact, along with the high charcoal quantities, apparently caused several hearths to be included in Factor 1. Size and shape were less important than content for identifying hearths. The size of hearths ranged from .43 to .97 m3 within the medium category. Shapes were both symmetrical and asymmetrical in plan view. In profile, the hearths were generally basin-shaped, ranging in depth from 50 - 75 cm below surface. Spatial information was useful for classifying some features as hearths. For example, Feature 112 was an oval, basin-shaped pit in the center of House 3. Even though it had relatively low baked clay and fire cracked rock content, it was classified as a hearth because it was located in the same position within the house as Feature 57, a definite hearth in the center of House 1 (Figure 4-13). Feature 104, a hearth in the South Midden area, is illustrated in Figure 10- 14, STORAGE PITS The location of these features inside houses was a major criterion used to assign a storage function to them. Content also played an important role; these features had high densities of macrobotanical specimens which would be expected in food storage pits where some amount of stored food was not retrieved at the end of the pit's use life. Storage pits fell in the small and medium size classes, ranging from .17 to .62 m? in area. They were relatively shallow, ranging in depth from 42 to 56 cm below surface. Their shallow depth made it difficult to recognize them; many were confined to the A horizon or barely penetrated the B horizon. Thus, they were rather ephemeral and difficult to distinguish from the surrounding A horizon soil. Figure 4-17 in the last section of this chapter illustrates the hearth and storage pits found in House 1. Storage pits were included in Factors 1, 3, and 4. Natural or cultural processes of secondary deposition would have allowed household debris to work its way into abandoned storage pits, which probably reflects the relationship to Factor 1 features. Factors 3 and 4 selected many features with high macrobotanical content situated inside houses. This reflects their function for storing food, as well as the secondary deposition of household items in abandoned storage pits. All of the storage pits recognized had frequencies of macrobotanical remains that indicated foodstuffs had been removed prior to abandonment. The only pit with a definite storage function that contained the original stored items was Feature 5, a cache of tested cobbles found in Feature 1. This feature is described in Chapter 6. DOG BURIALS Content was the sole criterion for assigning features to this class. Dog burials are defined as complete or partially articulated dog skeletons. It is not always possible to determine whether dog remains represent discarded food or intentional interments. For this analysis, disarticulated skeletons are interpreted as refuse from meals, whereas articulated skeletons are classified as dog burials. Several dog burials were found inside Feature 1 (see Chapter 6), but dog burials were also present in two features in the Midden. Figure 4-14 illustrates two dog burials. POST HOLES Size, shape, and spatial patterning were the principal criteria used to assign features to this class. Post holes ranged in size from 100 cm? to 1000 cm? and were circular to oval in plan view. In profile they were parallel sided or tapering and ranged from 45 to 80 cm below surface. Post holes forming house patterns were easily recognized by their regular spacing in circular patterns. Content was the least important criterion for designation of features as post holes. The original contents, wooden posts, had decomposed, so the post hole fill was the result of secondary deposition of household debris. Post holes are illustrated in the last section of this chapter concerning the architecture of Houses 1 through 3. CREMATIONS Content, shape, size, and spatial distribution were all important criteria for identifying cremation burials. Obviously, the principal criterion was the presence of burned human bone. However, most cremations fall within a narrow size and shape range as well. Cremation pits were primarily .30 to .50 m2 in area and were

Dog Burials: (a) Feature 86 within Feature 1, and (b) canine elements recovered from Feature 94, circular or oval in plan view. In profile they were basin-shaped and ranged in depth from 50 to 80 cm below surface, except for Burials 19 and 20 inside Feature 1 which were found between 95 and 107 cm below surface. Cremation pits lacked grave goods, but a bumed arrow point was found with Burial 2, and 51 Vicia seeds were found with Burial 28. The arrow point may have been imbedded in the body of the cremated individual or may have been an incidental inclusion. The inclusion of seeds, although most probably intentional, can not be easily interpreted. Cremation pits are illustrated in Figure 4-15. BURIALS Content was obviously the most important criterion for classification of features as burials, Although both cremated and noncremated human remains were assigned burial numbers, the term burial as used in this discussion denotes all non-cremated human skeletal remains and grave pits associated with them. In general, grave pits were difficult to discern; only Burials 12, 16, and 17 were associated with grave pits, although the pit for Burial 12 had been greatly distorted by rodent activity. These pits were a symmetrical “bean-shaped” pits, a shape accommodating the semi- flexed skeletal position common in the Richland Creek vicinity. Depths varied with Burial 12 only 40 cm below surface and the bottom of Burial 16 approximately 90 cm below surface. Most of the burials found on the site were within Feature 1 or were later intrusions into roasting pits. These are discussed in Chapters 5 and 6. MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES Several features do not fit clearly into any of the categories detected by content, size, shape, factor analysis or spatial patterning. Most of these features are small, nondescript pits that are not easily interpreted. However, a few of these features require some attention here. First, Feature 33 (Figure 4-16a) is of interest because it is a large, irregular pit with an irregular, mixed profile that closely resembles profiles of features classified as roasting pits. However, the artifact content is much lower than that observed for other roasting pits. The profile of Feature 33 also resembles the profile of Feature 1, and the artifact densities are somewhat similar. The highly irregular nature of the pit bottom appears to be the result of intensive activity on the part of b Figure 4-15. Cremations: (a) Burial 19 & 20 within Feature 1, and (b) Burial 28 (Labeled Feature 19) next to possible cremation Feature 20.

The best estimate of this pit's function is that it was used for roasting to a limited degree, but this may not have been its only function. Feature 125 (Figure 4-16b) may represent a separate class of feature: the smudge pit. The contents of Feature 125 are comprised almost entirely of charcoal with no baked clay and virtually no fire cracked rock. It is smail, being only 35 cm in diameter and 12 cm deep below its contact with the B horizon. It is smaller than other hearths at the site and exhibits no evidence of intense in situ burning. The charcoal may be the result of a smoldering fire used to produce smoke for food processing or other purposes. Feature 101 (Figure 4-16c) is of interest not only because of its late period ceramics and presence of maize, but also because of its unusual shape. This pit appears to be similar to the hourglass- shaped pit discussed by O'Brien and Warren (1982:260), where the walls contract from the orifice to about midway between the base and the orifice, and then expand again. If the A horizon was still intact when the Feature was excavated, this hourglass shape of Feature 101 would have been more pronounced. ARCHITECTURAL STUDIES: HOUSES 1, 2, AND 3 A small hamlet marked by the presence of three structures was uncovered along the crest of the terrace during Seasons II and III at locations predicted by SYMAPs of artifact distributions. In this section, the remains of Houses 1, 2, and 3 are described and . analyzed to explain their method of construction, the arrangement of interior living space, the estimated population of the hamlet, the estimated extent of house occupation, and relationships between these houses and those from the Caddoan and Plains areas. HOUSE DESCRIPTIONS In general, all three houses were very similar to each other in shape and content. All houses were circular, ranging in diameter from a maximum of 7 m for House 1 to a minimum of 5.5 m for House 3. All houses contained large interior support posts arranged in a rectangular or trapezoidal configuration, as well as smaller randomly distributed interior posts. Houses 1 and 3 had central hearths, but House 2 did not have any visible remains ofa hearth. It is possible that a hearth was present in the A horizon which was scraped away by heavy equipment. The lack of storage pits recorded inside Houses 2 and 3, as opposed to the numerous pits within the A horizon inside House 1, is undoubtedly due to the fact that the A horizon was stripped away over Houses 2 and 3, whereas 60% of the A horizon over House 1 was excavated by hand. Some house patterns were more complete that others; for example, all post holes in House 2 were found and mapped, whereas only about 70% of the post holes for House 3 were found. Despite these problems, enough data were gathered to form an understanding of the architecture.

Plan view of House 1 showing the location of the hearth and storage pits. ° House 1 measured 7 m in diameter and was comprised of 31 wall posts, 6 interior support posts, 3 randomly placed posts near the wall, a central hearth (Feature 57), and 7 storage pits (Features 37, 58, 59, 60, 64, 67, and 74) (Figure 4-17). A few large gaps occur where shallow wall posts were completely dug through before the lighter colored B horizon was reached. Therefore, the actual number of wall posts would have been closer to 40 at the time the house was abandoned. A total of 22 post holes was excavated in House 1 (Figure 4-18). House 1 is unusual in that it has six interior support posts, rather than four as found in Houses 2 and 3, The extra two posts in House 1 are not spread around the interior to form six, evenly spaced posts. Rather, they form an extra pair closely paralleling the original pair in the eastern half of the structure. This pattern, along with the fact that post hole spacing is closer in House 1 than in other houses, suggests that an episode of rebuilding, or repair, of the structure occurred. Examination of the post holes along the southwest side of the house revealed an alternating pattern of light and dark colored post holes. This is taken as evidence that rebuilding occurred after a localized midden accumulated within and around the house. The darker post holes are probably the later ones which filled with the more organically enriched soil brought about by the house occupation. Because 60% of House 1 was excavated by hand, it provides the best information on the use of interior living space. SYMAPs of artifact distribution and analysis of features confined to the A horizon provide clear patterns of space utilization. The spatial data are described in Chapter 13, but briefly stated, evidence of cooking was observed within the hearth in the form of increased pottery and fire cracked rock, maintenance activities such as stone tool repair were observed around the hearth, and fewer artifacts were found along the wall. The locations of storage pits were also scattered around the hearth and were primarily restricted to the area encompassed by the interior support posts (Figure 4-17). The lack of storage pits and lower artifact densities adjacent to the wall probably reflect use of this part of the structure as a sleeping area. 57 Sleeping platforms along the walls of houses have been reported for both Caddoan and Plains groups (Griffith 1954:101; Wedel 1979:96), so this is a likely location for a sleeping area in House 1. Since House 1 was the only structure which was dug by hand, it is the only one for which profiles were drawn. The north profile (X - X' in Figure 4-19) was drawn along the northern edge of the bulldozer trench that first exposed the house, and the east profile (Y - Y'. in Figure 4-19) was drawn along a trench of hand excavated units. Both profiles are drawn with an exaggerated vertical scale in Figure 4-19 to highlight subtle changes in depth. The location of the wall in the north profile runs from the post hole cross-sectioned in Unit 334 west to the west end of Unit 329. In the east profile, the northern edge of the wall intersected the north half of Unit 323. _ The profiles clearly show that a midden has developed within the structure, and that the midden is densest in the center of the house. The dark midden soil is not apparent in the east profile except in Units 320 and 321, covering the area from the interior e lig * @e6 15 -@- 35 36 34 -@--@- 16 eo ! 1708 @5a 1 18 -e- ® %; 19®@ ®, 33 20 - ~@— ° -@ -, -e- Oo ¢ 21 -@ 32 e, ~ ' -e- 22, a1 ; 23@ | i 0 1 zy p29 —aas 26 27 28 meters cm below WALL POSTS surface 0- (een On oes ee 4 — mm cn - haiti 2d [at bs} Se: ise | tf - , oi | 1 1 i po o4d H i - ee - ces] vy te 70 - o- a EO | a ‘92!

North and East profiles of House 1. posts south to the center of the house. A darker midden layer is visible all the way across the north profile, but it is deeper in the center of the house. The depth of the midden and the gradually increasing depth of the sandy clay B horizon, from shallow outside the house to deep inside the house, originally led to the hypothesis that the structure was semi-subterranean. It was hypothesized that a house pit was excavated prior to house construction to account for the observed depth of the midden. However, excavation revealed that the hearth and storage pits were present immediately beneath the plow zone, which means that the house must have been constructed on the present ground surface. The depth of midden and irregular contact between the midden and the B horizon indicate that several episodes of digging occurred within the house, probably related to storage pits. The dark midden soil and episodes of redigging probably account for the irregular shapes of storage pits and the difficulty experienced in finding them. House 2 measured 6 m in diameter and contained 29 wall posts, 4 interior support posts, and 5 randomly dug interior posts. Only one small gap exists among wall posts, so it appears that nearly the entire post hole pattern was uncovered. A total of 29 post holes was excavated in House 2 (Figure 4-20). No central hearth or storage pits were observed within the B horizon, but they may have been present in the A horizon as shallow pits. It is also possible that House 2 was not occupied as long as Houses 1 or 3, or that it was a summer house that did not require a hearth. However, its similarity to Houses 1 and 3 in all other respects suggest that the former possibility is more likely. House 3 is the smallest structure, measuring 5.5 m in diameter. It is also the least complete structure, with only about 70% of the post hole pattern visible and a large gap between post holes along the southeast wall. A total of 15 wall post holes, 4 interior post holes, and 4 randomly dug post holes was present in House 3. A total of 14 post holes was excavated in House 3 (Figure 4-21). Feature 112 was present in the center of the house and is assumed to be the central hearth. Feature 113 is located adjacent to the wall at the west side of the structure and may represent a storage pit because of its high macrobotanical content. The only other notable fact about House 3 is that the wall post spacing is further apart for this structure than is the case for the other two. Because of the incomplete nature of the post hole pattern and the wide post hole spacing, it is postulated that this may actually represent a summer house or a covered work area, like a ramada, located between- Houses 1 and 2. ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS The method used to compare regularities among the structures is based on that used by Good (1982) to analyze nine structures at the De Shazo site, a protohistoric Allen phase Caddoan village in Nacogdoches County. Good quantified the distances between wall posts and the distances from the center post to the wall posts, then used the mean distances for both to form a ratio useful for comparison among structures. She discovered that the ratios of mean distance between exterior post holes to mean distance between exterior and center post holes was remarkably similar for all structures, regardless of the differences in size observed among the structures or the variation observed among spacing of exterior posts. The ratios only varied from 1:3.1 to 1:3.8 for all nine structures (Good 1982:65). This indicated that regularity in post hole spacing was based not on standard units of measurement between post holes, but on the radius of the house. The distance between wall posts was slightly greater than 1/3 of the radius, regardless of the size of the house (Good 1982:64). The De Shazo style analysis was selected for use in the architectural studies of Houses 1, 2, and 3 because it quantifies house dimensions, providing results that can be directly compared with De Shazo data to examine possible relationships between Bird Point Island houses and Caddoan houses. Certain modifications in the methodology were required for use with Houses 1, 2, and 3 because they contained support posts arranged in a rectangular pattern rather than a single center post. To examine the relationship between wall post spacing and the radius of each structure, the average diameter of each house was simply divided

Plan view and profiles of post holes excavated in House 2, by two to obtain the radius. To examine the relationships among the spacing of interior support posts, distances were measured in north-south, east-west, and diagonal directions. Then, the mean distances from the center of each house to the. center of each interior support post hole were compared with the radius to form a ratio useful for comparison of interior post spacing among structures. This analysis was designed to test the hypothesis that the placement of interior posts was more important for the structural soundness of houses than the placement of wall posts. The distances between wall posts are presented in Table 4-11. The range of variation is substantial for all houses, but the range observed for Houses 2 and 3 is fairly close. None of these measurements include distances between post holes where massive gaps are present, such as along the unexcavated portion of House 1 or the southeast portion of House 3. This avoids artificial inflation of the range of distances observed. The mean distances between wall posts vary substantially, with the closest spacing observed in the largest structure (House 1) and the widest spacing observed in the smallest structure (House 3). 59 128 127 129 4 ! 126 130. g 4 re) i Q \ ! a \ / had 125 131. 140 oe. e @124 132@ -9- 139 133-@ 141 ~~ Pa eo, rad -O- 137 138 Ny e * 135 , 136a MN ® 0 4 136 —- ey meters cm _ WALL POSTS below surface 126 127 128 129 130 ! i 1 Uw or { 1 t ! f] i ] - |@U 60— 131 133 134 136 136a 137. o- com eo To To _ \ I \ en ee en ee ee 1 H \ i \ i 1 i i 4 i _ 4 i \ i 1 1 1 f 1 t ot t 1 i \ i 1 ! \ f i 1 4 t a a ef - UW VY Vvouy 60- INTERIOR POSTS o- 4 t \ i} \ 1 1 - 1138 } | 139; 1140; 4 141 | - | poy oF LE | _ i} { { i \ I \ { \ f Ww i UO | 60- Figure 4-21.

The mean distances between interior posts are also very similar for Houses 2 and 3, which suggests that the spacing of interior support posts was more critical for structural integrity than was spacing of wall posts. This probably means that the bulk

In this case, the wail posts would play a minor part in supporting the structure, and their placement would be less critical. The ratio of mean distance between wall posts to the radius of each house is listed in Table 4-13. These ratios display far more variability than the uniform ratios observed at the De Shazo site. On the other hand, the ratios of mean distance between the center of each house and interior posts to the radius of each house presented in Table 4-14 are very uniform, ranging from 1:1.5 to 11.7. The results of this analysis provide additional support for the hypothesis that the placement of interior support posts was more critical for the structural integrity of the houses at Bird Point Island than was the placement of wall posts. Similar kinds of measurements were used to examine the relationships present among the size and depth of interior and exterior posts. Table 4-15 lists the areas of the wall posts, illustrating their similarity in size. Table 4-15 also lists the areas of interior posts, showing that these are also similar in size. However, interior posts tend to be at least 2.5 times larger than wall posts (Table 4-16). This lends additional credence to the notion that the interior posts supported most of the structure's weight. Likewise, the mean depths of wall posts are similar to each other and the mean depths of interior posts are similar to each other, but interior posts are set deeper than wall posts (Table 4-17). The ratio of wall post depth to interior post depth ranges from 1:1.23 to 1:1.28 (Table 4-18). If the large interior posts supported most of the weight, they would have needed to be anchored more securely than wall posts. The size and depth differences between wall and interior posts are clearly visible in Figures 4-19, 4-21, and 4-22. The results of the post hole analysis indicate a great deal about the nature of construction of houses at Bird Point Island. Trees of roughly uniform diameters were selected for use as posts, with the larger diameter trees used for interior support posts. The interior posts were spaced in a rectangular, or slightly trapezoidal fashion, at a distance from the center of the house equal to 2/3 of the radius. Undoubtedly, cross beams were attached at the top of the posts to form a central support structure for the roof. The smaller wail posts were set in a circular pattern around this support structure, but less attention was paid to exact spacing of these posts. A lattice work of saplings was probably woven among the wall posts to provide a framework for the thatch (the relative lack of baked clay Volume I, Part One around the houses suggests that they were not covered with daub). Finally, a pitched roof was attached from the wall posts sloping upward to the taller support structure (Figure 4-22). It is not possible to reach firm conclusions about the location of the entryway into these houses because so many gaps are present in the post hole patterns. No extended entry ways are present, as are sometimes observed among Caddoan or Plains house styles (Wedel 1979). The relatively continuous post hole pattern observed for House 2, with only one gap, suggests that the entrance may have faced the southwest, where the gap is observed. However, the gap may represent an area where a few post holes were scraped away from a continuous pattern of posts. If short posts were set along the entry way to form a low wall, perhaps 20-30 cm high, then there would be no gap in the post hole pattern and it would be impossible to identify the entrance. This type of entry way has been documented historically in photographs (see Figure 14-2), POPULATION ESTIMATES Archaeologists have long been interested in obtaining estimates of aboriginal populations by developing formulas from modern ethnographic studies and from ethnohistoric accounts. Most studies relate house floor area to the maximum number of people that would fit in this area based on knowledge of the varying needs for personal space among different cultures. Naroll (1962) studied 18 tribes from the Northwest Coast and the Iroquois to conclude that population could be estimated as being equal to one-tenth of the covered floor space. Cook and Heizer (1968) studied California tribes and noted that a minimum area for a family of six was 11.1 m2 (1.8 m2 per person). Wedel (1979) examined the populations of Plains Indian houses by looking at ethnohistoric accounts of Pawnee village populations. He concluded that a figure of 5 m2 per person was a reasonable estimate. Perhaps the best estimates for the houses at Bird Point Island can be derived by looking at ethnohistoric data from tribes that were in the area historically. Ethnographic accounts for the Wichita and the Waco were provided by Captain Randolph Marcy in 1852. The Wichita village was comprised of 42 lodges about 25 ft (7.6 m) in diameter, each containing two families totaling about 10 people (Marcy 1937:125). Wedel (1979) notes that Wichita lodge size remained virtually unchanged since first reported by Ofjate in 1601, so there appears to be great stability in house construction over time. The Waco village contained 20 lodges and about 200 people, again with 10 people per lodge. Lodge size was estimated at 20 to 25 ft (6.1-7.6 m) in diameter, approximately the same size at the Wichita lodges (Kendall 1844). Wedel (1979:96) points out that these population estimates do not differ greatly from the estimates he calculated for Plains groups which had larger lodges. The minimum area per person for the Wichita and Waco appears to have been 4.6 m* per person, whereas Wedel’s estimate is 5 m2 per person. The size range reported for Wichita and Waco houses is nearly identical to the range observed among Houses 1, 2, and 3 at Bird Point Island and these groups were known to occupy this region Table 4-12 DISTANCES BETWEEN INTERIOR PosT HOLES House 1 House 2 House 3 N-S E-W Diagonal N-S E-W Diagonal N-S E-W Diagonal Number of Measurements . 3 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 Range (cm) 260-310 325-410 440-500 240-280 270-275 375-395 220-250 280-290 360-370 Mean (cm) 283.8 363.8 466.3 260.0 272.5 385.0 235.0 285.0 365.0 Standard Deviation 25.2 40.5 26.9 28.3 3.5 14.1 21.2 TA 7.1

It is therefore logical to use the estimate of 4.6 m2 per person obtained from ethnographic accounts to derive population estimates for the hamlet at Bird Point Island. The area of House 1 is 38.5 m2, which means that it could have housed eight people. The area of House 2 is 33.2 m2, so it could have held seven people. House 3 is 23.8 m2 and could have held five people. Thus, assuming comtemporaneity of the three houses, the total population of the site during the hamlet occupation (ca. A.D. 1000-1200) was probably about 20. The problem of contem- poraneity of house occupation is discussed in Chapter 14. COMPARISON OF ARCHITECTURE WITH CADDOAN AND PLAINS STYLES The house styles of Caddoan and Caddoan-speaking Plains groups are compared with the houses at Bird Point Island in an attempt to discern cultural relationships. While house patterns from a broad geographical area were considered, this is by no means an exhaustive study. The cultural groups selected for this analysis are dll Caddoan-speaking groups and are assumed to be related culturally. Hughes (1968:302) has traced these groups back to a proto-Caddoan group occupying the Mississippi valley around 4000 B.C. and has outlined their spread toward the Plains over time. Thus, it seems likely that cultural relationships existed among these groups and the inhabitants of Bird Point Island. Early Caddoan house patterns from the George C. Davis site were examined (Newell and Krieger 1949) as well as late Caddoan houses from the De Shazo site (Good 1982). Fort Coffee and McCurtain focus houses from Eastern Oklahoma were compared (Wallace 1962) and Plains Indian house styles of the Pawnee were also examined (Wedel 1979). Ideally, houses from other Wylie focus sites located near Dallas should be considered for this comparison. However, examination of the literature shows that few houses have been found: the presence of houses has only been inferred on the basis of baked clay concentrations at sites such as Farmersville on Pilot Grove Creek (Stephenson 1949a:30) and at the Hogge Bridge and Branch sites along the East Fork of the Trinity River (Stephenson 1949a:38-40). A house floor was uncovered in the floodplain at a depth of 36 inches (1 m) at the Campbell Hole site, but only a small cross-sectional area was dug, revealing a hearth but no post holes.

No houses were excavated at other classic Wylie focus sites such as the Upper Rockwall, Lower Rockwall, and Glen Hill sites (Ross 1966; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968). The only houses excavated at Wylie focus sites were an elliptical house at the Butler Hole site (Housewright et al. 1947) and a portion of a semi-subterranean house at the Dugger site (Dawson and Sullivan 1973). No map is published for the house at the Dugger site, which was excavated primarily by a series of backhoe trenches, so no direct comparisons can be made with the Bird Point Island houses. However, the description of the house as semi-subterranean, | m deep, with two rooms, and measuring 7.5 m north-south by 11 m east-west (Dawson and Sullivan 1973:42) demonstrates a dramatic difference between this house and Houses Figure 4-22.

The house excavated by the Dallas Archeological Society at the Butler Hole site is documented by a map and descriptions (Figure 4-23). This house was elliptical, measuring 13 feet 7 inches (4.1 m) east-west by 10 feet (3 m ) north-south and contained 51 post holes. Shell tempered, wattle impressed daub was found around the wall of the structure, and there were no interior posts or clear evidence of a hearth (Housewright et al. 1947:9) Thus, it is clear that this house also bears little relation to the houses at Bird Point Island. The Caddoan houses in East Texas are generally circular or subrectangular in shape, and only the circular houses were examined for this comparison. All Caddoan house patterns were comprised of uniformly spaced exterior wail posts and a single central interior post within the hearth at the focus of the circle (Newell and Krieger 1949; Good 1982) (Figure 4-24), Other random interior posts were also observed, probably representing supports for sleeping berths. Ethnohistoric accounts describe men working from the center post, as if it were a ladder or scaffold, to tie the tops of wall posts together, forming the the beehive-shaped house characteristic of Caddo tribes. Once the wall posts were bent and secured at the top to form a sturdy structure, the center post was cut down and a hearth was dug in its location (Swanton 1942). The principal difference between the Caddoan houses and Houses 1, 2, and 3 is that Caddoan houses did not-require interior posts for support. The fact that Houses 1, 2, and 3 all contained interior support posts indicates that the style of architecture was substantially different, with a roof resting on supports rather than wall posts being bent to form the roof. The differences in wall post spacing between the De Shazo houses and Houses 1, 2, and 3 discussed earlier provides additional evidence that the Bird Point Island houses are probably not of East Texas Caddoan origin. One structure out of the 51 clearly identifiable structures at the George C. Davis site bears a resemblance to the structures at Bird Point Island (Figure 4-25). This structure, designated as Feature 125, was located in Unit 10 midway between Mounds B and C. It was a circular structure 7.4 m in diameter comprised of 88 wall posts and four large interior posts arranged in a rectangular pattern around a central hearth (Story 1972:85-87). These interior posts are believed to represent roof supports (Story 1972:86) and suggest an architectural style similar to that observed at Bird Point Island. Despite the general similarities in construction technique, several important differences are also apparent. For instance, Feature 125 has more than twice the number of wall posts than the 40 posts estimated for House 1, even though these structures are approximately the same size. Thus, wall post spacing is much Volume II, Part One .° _7e ° ®e 6 « ry e e e °. e e e° e ® es e ° Ps e 3} e e e e e eee e $0 0 e999 0 1 es | meters N Figure 4-23, Plan view of the house at the Butler Hole site (after Housewright et al. 1947). closer in Feature 125 than in House 1. Also, the interior posts inside Feature 125 are only .75 m from the center of the hearth, whereas the mean distance from the interior posts to the center of House 1 is 2.33 m. In other words, both the wall posts and the interior posts are much closer together in Feature 125 than they are in House 1. - Perhaps the most significant difference between the two pertains to their proposed function. The function of Feature 125 is not interpreted as a house, but rather as a special purpose structure. The well defined prepared hearth in the center of Feature 125 revealed evidence of three periods of intensive burning that are radiocarbon dated at A.D. 950 + 1130, A.D. 870 + 1030, and A.D. 780 + 960 (Spock 1977:178). Because this structure exhibited an unsual architectural style, contained the most intensively used hearth found at the site, and was equidistant from Mounds B and C, it was proposed that Feature 125 was used as a Fire Temple (Spock 1977:187). On the other hand, the distribution of artifacts and features inside House 1 at Bird Point Island clearly reflects domestic activities associated with houses (see Chapter 13). Therefore, the similarity of the Bird Point Island houses to the proposed Fire Temple at the George C. Davis site is not viewed as a strong indication of Caddoan influence in the Richland Creek vicinity. Structures interpreted as Caddoan houses still differ substantially from Houses 1, 2, and 3. Ninety-five house patterns from 34 sites in Oklahoma were examined by Wallace (1962), but only five of these were circular. McCurtain focus sites from southeastern Oklahoma with circular house. patterns include the McDonald site and the Davis site. At the McDonald site, a circular house was uncovered which had uniformly spaced wall posts and an extended entry way, but Table 4-17 Deptu OF WALL AND INTERIOR Post HOLES I A House | House 2 House 3 Wall Interior Wall Interior Wall Interior a Number of Measurements 15 6 18 4 11 4 Range (cm) 45-70 65~80 48-65 65-80 40-55 55-65 Mean (cm) §2 71 54 68 47 60 Standard Deviation 14.2 4.5 3.4 6.2 3.2 4.1

This is clearly unlike the houses at Bird Point Island. At the Davis site, however, a circular house with irregular wall post spacing, numerous interior posts forming a circle, and several sub-floor cache pits was uncovered. The diameter of this structure was about 7.5 m, close to the diameter of House 1. The interior support posts were larger than the wall posts, just like the ones observed in Houses 1, 2, and 3, but they were arranged in a circular pattern rather than in a rectangle (Figure 4-26), Wallace (1962:38) says that this house pattern looks similar to historic Wichita dwellings, except for the high frequencies of daub found. Although this house pattern is not identical to the patterns unearthed at Bird Point Island, the strong similarities in construction suggest that a cultural relationship may exist. Two circular Fort Coffee focus houses were found at the Choates II site in eastern Oklahoma which are similar in diameter to Houses 1, 2, and 3. These houses exhibited regular wall post spacing and subfloor cache pits as well aS numerous interior posts. However, several interior posts were actually part of wall post arcs from other houses, and the remainder were randomly placed about the interior. None of the interior posts were large enough to suggest they were used as rodf supports (Wallace 1962:34). Therefore, there appears to be no relationship between these structures and Houses 1, 2, and 3. e e e e e e e ° e e e e e e e e @ e @ 0 5 ee ee ee meters MN 63 & O meters MN Figure 4-25.

A.D. 1750-1850) were circular with a central hearth and a circle of six to ten interior posts set between two and six feet inside the wall of the house (Wedel 1979:86). These structures are somewhat similar to that at the McCurtain focus Davis site described earlier. The preceding Lower Loup phase houses (ca.

64 rectangular or trapezoidal fashion (Figure 4-27). Although the placement of interior posts is very similar, Lower Loup houses are by no means identical to Houses 1, 2, and 3, For example, Lower Loup houses are characterized by extended entrances facing east and an altar containing a bison skull directly opposite the entrance against the west wall. There is also quite a time difference between the two, with Lower Loup houses dating between A.D. 1550 and A.D. 1750 and Houses 1, 2, and 3 dating between A.D. 1000 and 1200. The houses of the Central Plains tradition (ca. A.D. 1000 - 1400), which preceded the Lower Loup phase, were rectangular but also had four interior support posts (Wedel 1979:87). Although this discussion is not a comprehensive treatment of architectural styles, it does point out some major differences and similarities that suggest cultural connections between the inhabitants of Bird Point Island and other groups. Our initial inclination was to seek relationships among Caddoan groups to the east because the pottery types recognized at the site include several Caddoan designs. However, analysis of the architecture provides little link with Caddoan architecture. The only common factor among the Caddoan houses examined and the houses at Bird Point Island is their circular outline. All other characteristics related to the presence or absence of interior posts indicate that Caddoan houses were constructed quite differently from Houses 1, 2, and 3. On the other hand, houses associated with the Plains tribes display similarities with Houses 1, 2, and 3 in regard to interior post arrangement. Although none of the Plains houses examined matched Houses 1, 2, and 3 exactly, more similarities were observed with Plains groups than with Caddoan groups. It may be possible that the occupants of the houses at Bird Point Island were related to the Wichita or Waco, whose lodges were described previously, but no definite cultural connection can be demonstrated at this time. The historic period house shown in Figure 14-2 may be close to the house style found at Bird Point Island. . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Including all burials, post holes, features, and organic stains believed to be features, over 500 cultural features were mapped and recorded, and 177 were excavated over the course of four field seasons. The 83 features (including post holes and cremations) containing the most complete data sets were analyzed using factor analysis with varimax rotation as an aid to classification. Twelve factors were isolated by principal components analysis, of which six accounted for most of the variability observed. Factors 1-6 selected features having contents related both to the original use of the features, the degree of secondary deposition obscuring the original function, and the temporal distribution of features. A significant relationship was Velume II, Part One 0 5 — Ges Bs meters N Figure 4-27. Plan view of a Lower Loup house (after Wedel 1979). observed between features loading highly on Factors 1-6 and feature size and shape. All of this information was used in conjunction with spatial information to classify features as hearths, roasting pits, storage pits, dog burials, post holes, cremations, or burials. A detailed analysis of Feature 38 was presented to test hypotheses regarding the possible uses of roasting pits. The results of this analysis indicate that the large irregular pits were used for- roastinig on several occasions over time. , Analysis of Houses 1, 2, and 3 was conducted using a methodology borrowed from Good (1982). The typical house pattern at Bird Point Island is circular, between 5.5 and 7.0 m in diameter, with four interior posts arranged in a rectangular pattern spaced about 2/3 the length of the radius away from the center. A central hearth is present surrounded by storage pits within the Limits of the interior posts and little activity is apparent along the walls. Assuming contemporaneity of structures, the population of the site at the time of house occupation was probably about 20 people, based on Wedel’s (1979) method. Comparison of Houses 1, 2, and 3 with houses of Caddoan and Plains groups shows that methods of construction are more similar to Plains styles than to Caddoan styles of East Texas.

BURIAL DESCRIPTIONS AND OSTEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS by Gary Rutenberg, Maynard B. Cliff, and William A. Martin Osteological analysis provides crucial data for ecologically ori- ented archaeological research. Direct evidence of human/environ- ment interaction is manifested in the skeletal remains of the popula- tion. The degree of adaptation to a specific environment can be assessed by examination of skeletal and dental pathologies, trace elements which reflect dietary intake, and the demographic recon- struction of the skeletal sample. In addition, comparison of anthro- pometric indices among the sexes permits observations to be made about status, the sexual division of labor and population dimorphism in general. This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of the small and often fragmentary sample of human skeletal remains recovered from Bird Point Island. Although 27 individuals were recovered, 10 were cremated beyond recognition of age or gender and several noncre- mated individuals were represented only by fragments, precluding detailed analysis. As a result, only 11 individuals could be used to provide good anthropometric and pathological data. Despite problems inherent in the small sample size, an attempt is made to address several problems of archaeological interest. First, temporal changes in the principal locations of burials across the site are examined and social implications of these changes are discussed. Next, trends in burial orientation are presented along with a discus- sion of variability in orientation due to seasonality. The level of adaptive fitness of the Bird Point Island population is studied using demographic parameters, such as risk of death among age cohorts, pathological indicators of stress, and the prevalence of skeletal and dental pathologies. Changes in the dietary intake of the population _ over time are addressed using trace element analysis and the pres- ence of dental pathologies such as caries and calculus. Finally, the skeletal population is compared and contrasted with burial data from 65 similar prehistoric burials associated with the Wylie focus of Dallas and Collin Counties. METHODOLOGY Burials were removed from the field with minimal processing (gentle cleaning with a soft brush and water) to prepare skeletons for photographs. The skeletal material was thoroughly cleaned at the laboratory at SMU prior to examination. Friable skeletal remains were stabilized with a solution of duco cement and acetone. When- ever possible, skeletal elements were reconstructed. Anthropometric measurements were taken whenever possible and estimated when necessary. All bones were examined macro- scopically for signs of pathology. In addition, a stereomicroscope was used to search for lesions. Various elements presenting patho- logical anomalies were radiographed and selected long bones were radiographed to determine the presence or absence of Harris Lines. BURIAL DESCRIPTIONS During the testing and subsequent four seasons of intensive exca- vation at Bird Point Island a total of 27 burials was recovered from various portions of the site (Figure 5-1). These burials span all four defined occupation periods for the site and include both primary burials and secondary cremation burials (Table 5-1).

BURIAL LOCATION As can be seen from Table 5-1 and Figure 5-1, the burials at Bird Point Island are nonrandomly distributed across the site area. Of the total sample of 27 burials, over 40% are located within the large central pit, Feature 1; about 30% are situated in the North portion of the site (see Chapter 1 for definition of this and other spatial divisions of the site) and are closely associated with the three house patterns in this area; and about 11% are located in the Midden south of Feature 1. Many of the temporal ascriptions for the burials are based on the feature analysis, so some burials are assigned to components on the basis of spatial relationships rather than on firm radiocarbon dates (see Chapter 4). Only a brief discussion on the context of the burials _ in Feature | is presented here since greater detail is presented in Chapter 6. FEATURE 1 Feature | was initially used as a mortuary during the first inten- sive occupation ofthe site (170 B.c.-A.D. 130). In fact, over half ofthe burials recovered from this feature date prior to ap. 130. After this time, there is a gradual but definite decline in the use of this feature for mortuary purposes: less than 30% of the burials in Feature 1 are from Zone 2 (A.D. 580-860), and less than 10% in Zone 1 (A.D. 1000-1650). Prior to ap. 1000, the majority of the burials at Bird Point Island were placed in Feature 1, while after ap. 1000 the majority of the burials were interred outside of Feature 1. During the 67 first period of use, all ofthe interments in Feature 1 were primary and either flexed or semiflexed. Between a.p. 600 and 800 several cre- mations were placed in Feature 1, although primary interments con- tinued to occur. After A.D. 1000, only two interments were placed in Feature 1: Burials | and 8. Burial 8 was the only extended burial found at the site, and its unusual position (face down) suggests con- siderable difference in the use of the Feature 1 pit during the latest occupation of the site (A.p. 1300-1650). A number of the burials in Feature 1 showed evidence of postin- terment disturbance due to both natural and cultural factors. The large number of isolated elements and disturbed burials from within the pit is a strong indication of this substantial activity. Burial 9/11 is a single individual buried tightly flexed on its back and characterized by the disarticulation of the upper limbs and the removal of the frontal bone which had already been fused to the parietals at death. Evidence of rodent activity was observed with long bones of the arm present in nearby rodent burrows, but the skeleton was also probably disturbed by later intrusive excavation as evidenced by the removal of the frontal bone. In support of this interpretation, small peck marks, possibly from digging into the pit, were found on the left parietal. For a more detailed discussion of the cultural activities connected with Feature |, see Chapter 6. THE NORTH AREA About 30% of the burials from Bird Point Island were recovered from the North portion of the site. These burials form a group, dis- tinct from the other burials on the site in a number of ways.

68 Volume II, Part One Table 5-3 DEscRIPTIONS OF BURIALS FROM BirD PoinT ISLAND A A I Burial Number Description Burial 1 Recovered by backhoe, no orientation available. Fragmentary bone, predominantly from lower limbs. Probably flexed. No pathologies noted. Burial 2 Cremation, bone was extremely fragmentary. Remains found in a shallow lens, slightly depressed towards the center. Skeletal material jumbled, no orientation discernible. Bone color varies from dark blue to chalk white. No pathologies noted. Burial 3 Recovered in part by backhoe, large portion left in situ. Slight arthritic changes occurring on phalanges and thoracic vertebrae. Burial 4 Found above Burial 3. Remains of humerus only. No pathology noted. Burial 5° Radius fragment, no other remains present. Burial 6 Remains consist solely of immature phalange found with Burial 3. No pathology noted. Burial 7 Cranial fragments only, may be associated with Burial 1. Burial 8 Majority of skeletal elements present and in excellent state of preservation. Body extended, face down with left arm brought under chest and hand grasping right wrist. Considerable dental calculus preserved on teeth. Pitting and enlargement of scapular glenoid cavity. Burial 9/11 Burial is complete and well preserved with the exeption of hand and foot elements. Left radius fragments and carpal bone (lunate) found disarticulated approximately 50 cm from burial on right side. Individual’s frontal bone (originally designated Burial 11) was found intact approximately 1 m away from burial along the same axis as the left radius fragments. Upper facial elements were fragmentary or missing altogether. Slight to moderate degree of periostitis present on tibiae and fibulae. Burial 10 Fragmentary skeletal remains consisting of right radius, lower rib, and calcaneus fragments. Found closely associated with Burial 9, but more gracile in size. Burial 12 Consists of occipital, parietal, and long bone fragments from a post-adolescent individual. Burial 13 Female, 30-40 years. Buried tightly flexed on back with head orientation towards west. Remains show evidence of rodent gnawing. Mild periostitis noted on both tibiae. Burial 14 Craniofacial remains and upper thoracic area present, Infant placed on left side with right arm slightly flexed and brought forward over the mid-thoracic area. No pathologies noted. Burial 15 Cranium, lower axial skeleton (including the innominates, sacrum, and several lumbar vertebrae), and portions of the lower limbs excluding the feet present. Upper axial skeleton and arms not present. Considerable periostitis present on both tibiae and left fibula. A lesser degree of periostitis can be found on the femora. Extensive rodent activity (gnawing) occurs along the entire length of the linea aspera of the left femur. Vertebral osteoarthritis can be found on the lumbar vertebrae. Burial 16 Complete skeleton in fair to good condition. Individual was semiflexed with forearms flexed and brought forward toward the face. A slight degree of periostitis occurs on the femora and tibiae. Slight osteoarthritic lipping occurs on the articular surfaces of the right distal humerus. Burial 17 Skeleton apparently consisted of the calvarium and fragmentary portions of the upper arm and lower limbs. The individual was semiflexed with the forearm brought towards the face. Burial 18 Fragmentary skeletal remains consisting of cranial, mandibular, dental, vertebral, and fibular elements. Recovered from Units 401, 402, and 403 near Burial 15. Burial 19 Cremated remains of cranial and postcranial elements recovered from Unit 401. Material is angularly fractured with color range from black to blue to calcined white. Burial 20 Cremated remains found with Burial 19. Age estimate obtained from fragments of deciduous molars and immature bone (with unfused epiphyses). Material found in similar condition to Burial 19. Burial 21 Cremated remains in extremely fragmentary condition. Recovered via flotation (heavy fraction >2 mm). Burials 22-28 Cremated remains identified by cranial and postcranial fragment morphology, enamel and root dental morphology. burials in this area are believed to date to AD. 1000-1200; with few exceptions they are all cremations, and they are all closely associat- ed spatially with the three structures identified in this portion of the site. The contrast in burial patterns between the use of what was apparently a community cemetery (Feature 1) prior to ap. 1000, and separate, probably family related burial areas associated with individual structures after a.p. 1000, raises the likelihood of changes in social organization over time at Bird Point Island. CREMATIONS Cremations account for at least 40% of the burials recovered from. Bird Point Island. They are the major burial type in the North area of the site during a.p. 1000-1200, but were also identified in Feature 1 dating to A.D. 580-860, and in the midden to a.p. 1300-1650, Only two of the cremations postdating a.p. 1000 were found in the South Midden, but burials in general are scarce in this part of the site.

ie ht of 1e d Osteology bone fragments recovered from cremation contexts are maximally only several centimeters in diameter, and range in color from charred brownish black to dark blue to white (heavily calcined). These char- acteristics indicate that the cremation process took place at a rela- tively high temperature, between 800° and 900° C, for a period of not less than several hours (Geujall 1969). The bones of the cremations are angularly cracked and fractured, indicating that that the body was burned while the soft tissue still covered the skeleton. It has been suggested that cremation was used in the case ofdeaths which occurred away from the site, with the remains subsequently being returned and buried on the site (Prewitt 1974a; Binford 1971). However, this is not the only possible explanation forthe occurrence of cremations. Evidence exists that the cremations at Bird Point Istand were secondary rather than primary interments. For example, Burial 2 was recovered from a shallow bone lens, approximately 75 cm in diameter within Feature 1. The condition of the surrounding soil showed no evidence of in situ baking, suggesting that cremation occurred elsewhere with subsequent burial in Feature 1. A burned projectile point also was found in association with the Burial 2 cre- mation. It may have been the cause of death, a grave offering, or an incidental inclusion. Other cremations at Bird Point Island, while less complete, show similar characteristics of color, bone size, and fracture. patterns. In each of these cases, no evidence indicating in situ cremation was found. It is possible that one or more crematory areas existed on the site where bodies were burned prior to interment. Such features would be expected to show evidence of recurrent firing at a relatively high temperature and might contain isolated human bone fragments from several individuals. Cremation pits dug into the clayey, B horizon would exhibit fire hardened oxidized edges resulting from intensive burning of the sandy clay. No features with these characteristics were identified at Bird Point Island, but this does not mean that they were not present. If crematory areas involved above ground funeral pyres resting atop the A horizon, then we would expect little evi- dence to remain. Experiments conducted during Season II concen- trated on the effects of intensive burning on both A and B horizon soils. Pits weré dug so that one was completely confined to the A horizon and one was well within the B horizon. Intense fires were allowed to burn for several hours and the soil was examined for changes in color and texture after cooling. The clay enriched B hori- zon became fire hardened and exhibited a reddish oxidized color. On the other hand, the A horizon tumed a dark black and was only slight- ly hardened. By the time the site was revisited during Season III, the A horizon hearth had been completely obliterated whereas the B horizon hearth was still visible. It is unlikely, then, that any crematory area confined to the A horizon would have been preserved at the site. The evidence presented here demonstrates that no cremations occurred in pits dug into the B horizon because no pits exhibiting fire hardened oxidized surfaces were found. Thus two possibilities are left for consideration: either individuals were cremated on the ground surface at the site and no archaeological evidence remains, or the individuals were cremated somewhere away from the site. Due tothe sedentary nature of occupation between ap. L000 and 1200, the former possibility seems more likely. BURIAL ORIENTATION The primary burials previously recovered from Wylie focus sites were characteristically found with an east-west head orientation. This east-west orientation is less clear for the Bird Point Island burials. Figure 5-2 summarizes the orientation data from Bird Point Island along with data from burials found at Wylie focus sites 69 One point per individual sworeeraavees Bled Point [siaad Sample -—_——— Wylie focus (East Fork) Samgie Combined Sample Figure 5-2. Burial orientation of the Bird Point Island sample, the Wylie focus sample, and both samples combined. (Lynott 1975) and graphically illustrates an overall trend toward an east-west axis of orientation. Although deviations do occur, with some individuals oriented in all of the cardinal directions, most burials cluster along the east and south axes. Turner’s (1978) work on burial orientation from the Tuck Carpenter site, a Titus focus site in Northeast Texas, demonstrates a rigid pattern in which all burials are oriented east to west. However these burials were extended rather than flexed, unlike the majority from Bird Point Island. Other Caddoan sites reviewed by Turner demonstrate variability of orien- tation; although many, especially those of the Frankston, McCur- tain, Sanders, and Allen foci, are characterized by a similar strong affinity towards an east to west orientation. An examination of slight variations in orientation away from the east to west alignment suggested to Turner that upwards of 80% of the burials (hence deaths) occurred between September 21 (autum- nal equinox) and March 21 (spring equinox) (Turmer 1978:49-55). Furthermore, he suggested a bimodal distribution of deaths during this period with peaks in October and February. Doubtless, seasonal skewing of deaths occurred, exacerbated by harsh weather and food scarcity, but the degree to which seasonality of death is concentrated within only a few months may not be as great as he suggests. BIRD POINT ISLAND DEMOGRAPHICS The structure of a prehistoric population in regard to its composi- tion by age and sex can yield valuable insights into the nature of its lifestyle and its adaptation to the environment with which it interacts. Observations of the sex ratio and age at death can provide informa- tion regarding life expectancy, general health and morbidity, and overall population structure. These data can, in turn, allow other inferences to be made about status, division of labor, migration, and population growth. Age and sex determinations were made macroscopically and through the use of metric comparisons with other known skeletal samples from the North Central Texas area (Navey 1975; Westbury 1978). Sex determination was made using cranial and pelvic mor- phology (Krogman 1962; Bass 1971; Ascadi and Nemereski 1970) and postcranial anthropometrics (Steele and McKerm 1969; Olivier 1969). Age determination in subadults was made by examination of epiphyseal closure (Krogman 1962; Bass 1971) and dental devel- opment (Shour and Massler 1941; Ubelaker 1978). Adult age deter- mination was estimated from the degree of dental attrition (Broth- well 1965), cranial suture closure (Krogman 1962) and skeletal degeneration (Ubelaker 1978).

Life tables are constructed using specified age (and often, sex) categories (cohorts) to represent the risk of death to various segments of the population. The burials from Bird Point Island were classified into the following age cohorts: 0-1, 1-5, 5-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-35, 35—45, and greater than 45 years (Table 5-4). The 0-1 cohort (neonatal) is a period of high mortality risk. The following two cohorts (1-5 and 5-15) were established to represent periods of decreasing juvenile and adolescent mortality. The post- adolescent cohorts (15-20 and 20-25) were established to represent a high risk period of mortality for females giving birth and males who would be more active in high risk activities. The subsequent adult age cohorts were subdivided into 10-year intervals. As was true in earlier studies of the burial sample from the Rich- land Creek area, there was an underrepresentation of individuals in the 0-1 year age cohort of the life table (Rutenberg 1982). The lack of an appreciable number of infants in the sample may be due to the generally poor preservation of their skeletal remains. Mobley (1980) pointed out that infants, and taking the idea one step further, fetal deaths, may be considerably underrepresented in burial populations from archaeological sites. This may be due largely to the incomplete ossification of bone at the time of death, and the subsequent poor preservation of the existing boney remains. Ethnographic evidence from various pre- or proto-agricultural societies suggests that the probability of infant mortality may be as high as 20 to 40% of all births (Weiss 1973). There is no evidence within the pit for preferen- tial burial (by gender, age or status) and hence, no reason to believe that infants were buried elsewhere. Assuming that the pit was recog- nized and utilized as a cemetery during the first period (170 B.c.-a.D. 130), the substantial disturbance found within Feature 1 at Bird Point Island may, in part, be a reflection of unpreserved infant buri- als. Mobley’s response to this problem was to correct the early age cohorts by inputting a proportionate number of individuals, usually 20-25% of the total adult sample, and recalculating the appropriate life table results. Table 5-4 uses a number equal to 25% of the total adult sample, a value which is consistent if not conservative with known prehistoric populations, to standardize the 0-1 year cohort. The previous life tables computed for the Richland Creek popula- tions also used this estimate (Rutenberg 1982, 1983). No significant difference in the sex ratio at death was found for the Bird Point Island sample as a whole. However, it should be remem- bered that the sample at hand is small and subject to statistical bi- ases. No appreciable change in the aggregate life table statistics were noted when compared with the results of previous studies (Rutenberg 1982, 1983). Unfortunately, the small size of the Bird Point Island sample does not allow us to fine tune subtle differences by time period. The life table construction for the total sample of burials from Bird Point Island tended to follow Weiss’s (1973) 20:60 model, in which life expectancy at age 15 (e15) is 20 additional years and only 60% of the original cohort born are still alive. The survivorship curve for the total Bird Point Island sample (Figure 5-3) shows a strong resem- blance, even to the point of partially overlying it, to the curve calcu- lated for the sample of burials from Wylie focus sites along the East Fork of the Trinity River (Navey 1975). It is difficult to say how valid the Bird Point Island mortality pat- tern actually is. However, this pattern and those from Wylie focus sites tend to show the lowest mortality when they are compared to other prehistoric cultures (Figure 5-3). In this connection, it must be remembered that 0 age cohort values (d) have been adjusted to re- flect approximately 25% of all deaths occurring in this age cohort. Furthermore, it should be recalled that a large number of cremated remains, upwards of 40% of the total sample, was recovered from this site. Biases of the life tables are probably due to difficulties in the determination of the actual number of individuals cremated, the in-

Subsequent analy- sis on a larger data base has indicated that endochondral growth measurements agree with those from other, similar sites elsewhere. These new results are based on a reevaluation of the gracile nature of the Richland group following the reclassification of Burial 3 as a female. In the original study, Burial 3 was classified as a male, but subsequent reanalysis indicated that the individual was a female.

ANTHROPOMETRICS y 2 Anthropometric measurements and indices have proven to be ! useful for characterizing prehistoric populations, and evaluating 1 their health status and genetic makeup. Skeletal measures give in- 01 (Rutenberg 1983). sight into physiological responses to the environment and the pessi- ble genetic interaction of biological traits. Examples of Mendelian modes of inheritance, such as tooth morphology, are discrete traits which tend to be resistant to modification of environmental influ- ences. Continuous or endochondral measures, on the other hand, are more susceptible to environmental effects and may respond to changes in subsistence, environment, or health status. Because of the fragmentary nature of the sample from Bird Point Island, this study necessarily concentrated upon continuous traits (Tables 5-5 and 5-6) following the previous formats of Navey (1975), Westbury (1978), and Rutenberg (1982, 1983). Mea- surements of continuous traits were taken whenever possible for those burials which were sufficiently well preserved. In some instan- ces, these measures were estimated and are denoted on Tables 5-5 and 5-6 by an asterisk (*). Trotter and Glesser’s formulae for com- puting stature were used when complete long bones were available (Krogman 1962). When complete long bones were unavailable for the estimation of stature, the methods developed by Steele and McKern (1969) utilizing specific standard fandmarks for different sections of the humerus, femur, and tibia were used as an alternative. Additional anthropometric formulae were taken from Brothwell (1965), Olivier (1969), Krogman (1962), and Bass (1971). As is noted in the demographic section, anthropometric measure- ments were used to verify gender differences using metric compari- sons and t-tests. This was especially true for Burial 8 which had a mosaic of secondary sexual features; the skull being robust while the postcranial skeleton was somewhat more gracile. In an earlier study (Rutenberg 1982), the overall stature for the total Bird Point Island population was thought to be somewhat more m-l nutrient diameter midpoint a-p diameter A series of indices which were believed to be potentially useful for assessing the degree to which changes in body build may or may not be temporally related to changing subsistence strategies was calcu- lated for the Bird Point Island skeletal sample. This includes several indices which measure the degree of medio-lateral flattening of vari- ous long bones. This flattening is an indication of greater biomechan- ical stresses as aresult of increased muscle development and, hence, of greater physical demands (Perzigian et al. 1984). The degree of flattening of the femur is indicated by the platymeric index: subtrochanteric a-p diameter x 100 subtrochanteric m-| diameter Flattening of the tibia is found from the platyenemic index: x 100 a-p nutrient diameter The degree of development of the linea aspera on the femur is also the result of increased muscle development and is indicated by the pilas- tric index: x 100 midpoint m-| diameter Where possible, calculated values for each of these indices as well as stature estimates for sufficiently preserved burials, are presented in Table 5-7. As can be seen from Table 5-7, only five burials at Bird Point Island were complete enough to allow computation of all of the above mentioned indices. Luckily, these are relatively evenly split

What is immediately apparent from Table 5-7 is that all of the indices as well as the stature measurements of the two time periods overlap, suggesting there is no appreciable difference be- tween the two populations in regard to stature or robusticity. PALEOPATHOLOGY The health status of a population is a reflection of its adaptation to its immediate environment. Stresses such as overcrowding and food scarcity may manifest themselves as disease processes. The result of ’ such stresses is reflected through skeletal trauma, infection, endo- crine or metabolic disease processes, tumerous growth, or congenital malformation. The conditions can be subdivided further into acute or Volume II, Part One chronic disease, with chronic disease more likely to affect the skele- ton. Occupational stresses can lead to degenerative osteoarthritis, trauma, or infection, while changing subsistence strategies and/or division of labor may lead to gender or age differences in the occur- rence of such diseases. The skeletal remains from Bird Point Island were examined ma- croscopically for lesions and microscopically with the aid of a stereoscopic scope (7-40X magnification). Radiography was used to examine pathological lesions and for selected long bones to deter- mine the presence or absence of Harris Lines. Harris Lines are radiographically dense areas of trabeculla, usually found towards the articular ends of long bones and formed at right angles to the tubular diaphysis, or shaft, ofthe long bone.

The ingestion of heavy metals may cause similar radio-opaque lines to form. These lines may be lost later through normal skeletal growth and trabecular reorganization (McHenry 1968; Woodall 1968). It is interesting that no evidence of Harris Lines was found in any of the burials examined for his study, suggest- ing that adolescent dietary stress may never have been a serious problem at Bird Point Island. However, these results must be viewed with two caveats. First, the absence of noticeable Harris Lines may be due in part to the fragmentary nature of the material. Second, many of the radiographed bones, especially those that were frag- mentary, had lost much of their trabecular bone, precluding any possible analysis. A tabulation of several general disease categories by age cohort at death can be found in Table 5-8. These categories are: (1) arthritis, generalized degenerative boney changes inclusive of articular sur- faces and vertebral bodies; (2) osteitis or periostitis, generalized boney changes of the endosteum, cortical bone, or combinations of the two (the etiology of osteitis is often nonspecific; the cause of the inflammation may be due to a systemic chronic disease, or to an acute cause, affecting only a small portion of the skeletal system); and (3) trauma, specific boney changes due to violence, force, or accident which result in a localized boney lesion. These categories demonstrate some interesting patterns. As can be seen from Table 5- 8, periostitis and trauma occur most frequently in the 26 to 35 year cohort. This may be associated with greater risks of injury from oc- cupational stresses (Ortner and Putchar 1981; Steinbock 1976). The two instances of osteoarthritis are not severe and are not re- stricted to a single age cohort. Instead, they are evenly divided be- tween the two cohorts from 26 to 45 years. This arthritis may be due largely to normal wear and tear of the connective tissue. Unfortunately, when these data are broken down by period of site occupation, no gross temporal trends can be discerned. During the 1703.c. to A.D. 130 period, two skeletons showed traces of periostitis (B9/11 and B15) and two showed evidence of arthritis (B3 and B15). During a.p. 1000-1200, periostitis was observed on the remains of Burial 13; while Burial 16 revealed evidence of the same condition during the period between a.p. 1300-1650. The higher frequency of both conditions during 170 8.c. to A.D. 130 is probably simply the re- flection of a larger sample of preserved, primary burials from this occupation rather than any actual reflection of a poorer standard of health. Dating between 170 B.c. and av. 130, Burial 15 showed pro- nounced periostitis of unknown origin on the femora, tibiae, and fibu- lae. This condition was characterized by a dense proliferation of longitudinally woven bone over the original cortical surface. Slight to moderate vertebral osteoarthritis was also observed in this skeleton. Dating to this same period, Burial 18 had slight to moderate verte- bral osteoarthritis. Burial 9/11, also dating to the first occupation, demonstrates slight to moderate periostitis on both tibiae and both fibulae, but the right tibia presented the most severe cortical change (Figure 5-4). Several elongated islands of dense compact bone overlay the original cortical bone midshaft on the right tibia, representing a possible ossi- fied subperiosteal hemorrhage (cf., Saul 1972). This condition occurs when blood flowing between the bone surface and the peri- osteum, due to trauma or vitamin deficiencies, becomes infiltrated with osteocytes and subsequently calcifies. The left fibula presents a thickened area with moderate periostitis at the midshaft. The margin of the anterior crest corresponding to the origin of m. extensor digi- torum longus abruptly changes, travelling obliquely laterally through the region of periosteal bone thickening, then downward to an area of normal cortical bone. Radiographic analysis indicates that the me- dullary cavity follows this same curvature and then resumes its normal path downward, providing a strong indication of an old, healed greenstick fracture (Figure 5-5). Cranial anomalies, suchas a flattening at lambda, suggest possible antemortem cranial deforma- tion (Bass 1971; Brothwell 1972). Premature fusion of the left coronal suture has occurred, but no concomitant cranial asymmetry was found. Burial 16, which appears to date between a.p. 1300 and ap. 1650, has slight nonlocalized periostitis of unknown origin on the tibiae and femorae while Burial 8 possesses a well defined instance of traumatic osteoarthritis upon the left scapula. This is characteriz- ed by granular pitting and anterior enlargement of the glenoid cavity, possibly due to chronic dislocation (Figure 5-6). The head of the left humerus was too poorly preserved to determine if concomitant func- tional changes had occurred on this bone. The cause of this patholo- gy may be due to partial dislocation or recurrent subluxation of the humerus. The result would be chronic irritation of the cartilage stim- ulating a hypertrophic bone response (Ortner and Putchar 1981; Steinbock 1976). An alternative explanation is joint irritation due to a rupture of the supraspinatus tendon or the musculotendenous cuff. A rupture of this kind is a relatively common occurrence and may be caused when an arm is used to cushion a fall (Raney and Brashear 1971).

74 Figure 5-4, Tibia of Burial 9/11 showing ossified hemorrhages (A) and cortical striations (B). DENTAL PATHOLOGY Dental pathologies are not uncommon in the sample from Bird Point Island (Table 5-9). Pathologies which were found included: (1) dental calculus or tartar, a mineral deposit which forms in varying degrees along the gingival line, (2) dental caries, cavities in the enamel, (3) abscesses, localized lesions of the bone surrounding the tooth, usually due to infection, (4) enamel hypoplasia, horizontal striations of the tooth enamel which form during enamel histogene- sis, and (5) hypercementosis, abnormal deposits of cementum upon the root portion of the tooth, often related to unusual stresses upon that tooth. All individuals exhibited slight amounts of calculus, hy- percementosis, and enamel hypoplasia. Most adults had consider- able enamel attrition or tooth loss. Dental pathology is strongly related to changes in diet. Increasing dependence on grains, usually as a result of agriculture, may lead to general increases in the incidence of caries and dental calculus. Diets rich in meats, on the other hand, may act as natural cleansers, remov- ing the minerals and residues which may form calculus or lead to dental caries (cf., Cohen and Armelagos 1984). In this connection, the dental data from Bird Point Island are somewhat equivocal. Hypoplasia and hypercementosis are present only during 170 B.c. to AD. 130; while abscesses occur only in this and the next (a.p. 580- 860) period. Only caries and calculus are frequent enough to even hint at significant patterns through time, and they seem to contradict each other. The frequency of caries seems to remain the same or Figure 5-5, Fibula of Burial 9/11 showing area of cortical and Fig medullary change. Volume HI, Part One Figure 5-6. Scapulae of Burial 8 showing arthritic change in the left scapula. decrease through time, largely as a result of the high incidence of caries in Burial 15 during the 170B.c. to a.D. 130 period. On the other hand, the frequency and severity of calculus seems to show a definite increase from the first occupation (170 B.c. to A.D. 130) to the final occupation (AD. 1300-1650). This latter pattern is the only one that is strong enough to suggest that it is not a function of sampling error, and may be related to suggested dependence on agriculture during the later period. A small area of reactive bone, approximately 1 cm in diameter, was found on the lingual surface of the right horizontal ramus below M, of the mandible of Burial 9/11. No radiographic change was noted: and this defect may represent a small, focal infection, perhaps an abscess at an early stage of development, within the mouth. Only slight amounts of dental calculus were noted, The dentition of Burial 13, believed to date between a.p. 1000 and AD. 1200, demonstrates considerable occlusal wear. Unequal wear occurring lingually was common on all teeth present in this burial. A moderate degree of alveolar resorption was found and the presence of dental calculus persisted on the crowns at the gingival line. All of these traits are largely due to the aging process. A considerable de- gree of root hypercementosis was found, probably reflecting occlusal stresses (Boyle 1955). Two of the maxillary molars show little wear relative to other teeth. One, probably M3, may have been impacted. No wear was evident on this tooth, but a large anomalous ovoid facet was found on the crown. The second maxillary premolar (P?) exhib- ited a possible interproximal groove on the cervical region at its ure 5-7.

Interproximal grooves may be formed when infection or dental irritation occurs and palliative measures are taken to re- lieve any pain. These measures may include the continued use of a probe or toothpick which eventually creates a visible groove on the surface of the tooth (cf., Ubelaker et al. 1969). The groove on this individual appears slightly tubular when viewed buccolingually but may actually represent two separate grooves. The first groove ex- tended downward from the cervical junction of the lingual aspect and followed into the enamel midway across the crown. The second groove appeared to follow the cervical junction just above the enamel and cut across the root. The adjacent first molar (M") had been lost before death. Similar interproximal grooves were noted on other burials within the reservoir area. Finally, Burial 8, definitely dated to the final occupation, exhibits considerable dental calculus buccally and lingually on both the man- dibular and maxillary dentition (Figure 5-7). Anterior teeth have moderate degrees of calculus, while the heavier deposits were found on the posterior dentition. This was most notable on the right man- dibular molars and premolars. Three supernumerary teeth were present on this individual’s mandible. A premolariform tooth was found erupted to the occlusal plane buccally between P, and P, of the right mandible. Two additional unerupted premolariform teeth were found within the left mandible underlying ,P and ,P (Figure 5-8). Dental wear on both of the upper third molars is directed lingually, the occlusal plane does not run perpendicular to the occlusal surface of the mandibular molars. The maxillary third molars are oriented slightly buccally, moving the occlusal plane towards the lingual side of the tooth. Figure 5-8. Radiograph of Burial 8 mandible showing unerupted premolariform dentition. TRACE ELEMENT ANALYSIS An increasingly common analytical technique to identify dietary influences on prehistoric populations is trace element analysis. Shifts in proportional frequencies of trace elements in the bone can be directly related to changing dietary patterns or food preferences. Five trace elements were examined as indicators of diet in the Bird Point Island population: iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), zine (Zn), manga- nese (Mn), and strontium (Sr) (Angel 1984; Roosevelt 1984). Trace element analysis was carried out using a nondestructive X- tay fluorescence technique: Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX). Samples taken for this study were irradiated at 20,000 KEV for 100 seconds. The result is a characteristic curve, which has various dual spikes representing the presence of specific trace elements. The first and taller spike (Kal) represents the loosely held electrons of the given element, while the second spike (Kf 1) represents the inner core of electrons for the given element (Gill King 1985, personal communication). Counts for this study were taken from the first of these two peaks, from which a normalized count value was estimated by obtaining the ratio of the specific element count against the maxi- mum y-value for the curve. This resulted in values which represented amaximum of 10,000 counts and which could be more readily com- pared between individuals. As can be seen from Table 5-10, with a few exceptions to be dis- cussed later, iron levels appear to show a steady increase through time. Strontium shows no clear trend, although when mean levels are computed for each period, there is a slight increase around A.D. 1000 in comparison with the levels from earlier periods. Manganese shows a definite increase after A.D. 1000 as well, while zinc does not show an increase until after a.p. 1300. Manganese has been found to be correlated with an increased dietary dependence upon grains, in- cluding Zea mays. On the other hand, zinc is related to increased meat in the diet. Variations in zinc levels may also be an indicator of growth, revealed by increases in zinc, or wound healing, indicated by depletions of zinc. Variability in the proportions of these trace ele- ments may also be exacerbated by diets rich in nuts. Nuts contain large amounts of zinc, manganese, copper, and strontium. In addi- tion, zinc and manganese are both subject to leaching from the bone matrix in acidic soils. In some of the female burials, notably Burial 13 and Burial 15, calcium levels seem to be depressed, while iron levels are almost twice the norm of the other burials. Elsewhere in the Richland Creek area, similar values are found for a female from 41FT161B (Burial 2) and one male from 41NV179 (Burial 2). One possible explana- tion for the differences specific to the female sample may be that these represent pregnant or lactating women (Burial 2 at 41NV179 is the only male with these aberrant values). During pregnancy, red blood cell production increases significantly and may, therefore, be

CONCLUSIONS SUMMARY OF RESULTS The analysis of burial data from the Bird Point Island site has sig- nificantly contributed to our understanding of the prehistory of this important archaeological site, despite the relatively small sample of burials. Some of the most critical results occur in relation to the tem- poral patterning of cultural and dietary practices revealed by the burial data, The changes in burial location and interment procedures that occurred around a.p. 1000 may mark changes in social organ- ization. One of the more valuable results of the work at Bird Point Island is the identification of Feature 1 as an early mortuary feature (see Chapter 6). Based on dating of the burials, Feature 1 was apparently almost the sole cemetery location for the Bird Point Island communi- ty prior to A.D. 1000. After a.p. 1000, radical changes occurred in burial location and treatment. The preferred burial area ceased to be Feature 1, and cremation became the preferred method of interment. The majority of the burials during the a.p. 1000-1200 period were located in the North portion of the site in close proximity to several posthole structures which have been interpreted as houses (see Chapter 4). Burial of deceased family members close to or within their former dwelling is a common pattern exhibited by sedentary groups over much of North America, and indeed over much of the world. There is enough variation in burial treatment, especially in regard to the continued placement of noncremated burials in the former cemetery area, Feature 1, to suggest that differences in status characteristic of social ranking may have been reflected in mortuary patterns. However, the data remain equivocal due to the inability to age and sex the cremations. The results of the osteological analyses combine to suggest a sig- nificant difference between health, physical status, and diet of the earlier inhabitants of Bird Point Island (170 B.c. to AD. 130 and pos- sibly A.D. 580-860) in comparison with the occupants of the site during the later periods (post-a.p. 1000). The anthropometric data indicate a decrease in both male and female stature when the sample from the 170 B.c. to A.D. 130 period is compared with that from after A.D. 1300. In the area of skeletal pathology, no temporal trends can be discerned for the Bird Point Island sample. In regard to dental pathology, the frequency of dental calculus is higher after ap. 1300 in comparison with the 170 B.c. to A.D. 130 occupation, while the frequency of caries may remain the same or actually decrease. Both of these characteristics are related to the frequency of meat versus grain in the diet; both are expected to rise in frequency with increased dependence on grain in the diet. As presented in Chapter 9, the only corn present at the site dates after ap. 1300. The data from the trace element analysis is more complete and several strong temporal trends can be noted. The level of iron shows asteady increase through time, manganese increases after a.p. 1000, while zinc increases after a.p. 1300. Calcium levels remain relative- ly constant, while strontium may show a slight increase after a.p. 1000 on an average basis. Manganese is related to the amount of grain, such as maize, in the diet, while zinc levels often increase with ahigher proportion of meat in the diet. Both of these elements, as well as strontium, can be gained from a diet rich in nuts. All of this data taken together suggests dietary and health differ- ences during the a.p. 1300 to 1650 period possibly related to a par- tial reliance on maize agriculture. The dental data, while admittedly somewhat equivocal, still tend to support the presence of maize agriculture at this time, although overall dental health did not decline as would otherwise be expected. Unfortunately, none of these data gives us any indication of whether or not agriculture was present at Bird Point Island earlier than a.p. 1300. The trace element analysis, however, seems to suggest that some nutritional changes had occurred as early as a.D. 1000. However, despite extensive flotation of feature fills, no agricultural evidence has been encountered for this period (see Chapter 4). The jump in manganese levels at around A.D. 1000 would seem to suggest the introduction of grain agriculture at that time, but a contemporary, although minor, increase in average levels of strontium may indicate that an increased reliance on nuts is actually the cause of both changes. Finally, by a.p. 1300, the trace element data strongly suggest a high proportion of meat in the diet, as shown by high levels of zinc, and a continuing reliance on nuts and grains, probably.due in part to agriculture judging from the anthro- pometric and paleopathological data mentioned above. One anom- aly is the unaccountably low level of manganese for Burial 16. The fact that this individual was apparently a female raises the possibility of gender related status differences being manifest in dietary practices. Unfortunately, the small sample of late burials prevents this from being much more than a suggestion at this point. COMPARISONS WITH THE WYLIE FOCUS Navey (1975) discussed in considerable detail the human skeletal remains from the Sister Grove Creek site, a Wylie focus site located within the Lake Lavon Reservoir area, as well as previously

Ine he us Osteology excavated burials from the surrounding region. Her discussion indicated that a majority of the burials demonstrated both physical and pathological characteristics common to agricultural popula- tions. In other words, she found considerable periostitis of all forms, including osteitis and sub-periosteal hemorrhaging, and probable evidence of dental calculus (the original may have been inad- vertantly removed during the cleaning process). A critical difference between her sample and the present one is the absolute control of both horizontal and vertical provenience, with resultant firm dating controls, for the burials found within Feature | at Bird Point Island. She indicates that many burials in her sample may be more recent individuals who would have more likely been reliant upon agri- culture. Conversely, a large number of the complete burials from Bird Point Island were found in the lower, and earlier, levels of the pit. Rose (1984) notes that the impact of ariculture, specifically of maize agriculture in the Lower Mississippi area, may have actually decreased the general well-being of given populations. This obser- vation has been reiterated by numerous workers examining skeletal remains from other maize producing areas (cf., Cohen and Armel- agos 1984). A dependence upon agriculture in any region is an ecological paradox. On one end of the spectrum, domesticated culti- gens are a fairly dependable and productive food resource during optimal climatic periods. However, these cultigens may require greater population numbers to efficiently produce adequate food stores. This leads to increasing population size and population pres- sure. Furthermore, increases in population may increase the poten- tial reservoir for infectious disease with a net result of increased population morbidity. This has been continually demonstrated by increases in the incidence of pathological skeletal change: periostitis, osteitis, trauma, infection and periodontal disease. Finally, occupa- tional stresses related to agriculture may increase the incidence of arthritic change. Four factors have been shown to influence local subsistence in a given area. These are: (1) biomass, (2) climate, (3) geographical con- straints, and (4) general distribution of resources. Because these may vary from region to region, interregional changes may occur at dif- ferent rates, if at all. Rose (1984) has noted five general ecological trends which occurred in the Lower Mississippi Valley: (1) Late Archaic semisedentism; (2) knowledge of agricultural technology, 77 evidenced by native cultigens, which preceded maize agriculture; (3) general increases in population density with time: (4) food storage prior to widespread maize agriculture; (5) the widespread imple- mentation of maize agriculture within a narrow time period in the Lower Mississippi Valley. These changes, however, did not necessarily occur in all areas, and the degree to which these changes did occur in any single area was limited by the ecological constraints mentioned above. As an example, Rose notes that as late as a.p. 1200-1400, the skeletal evidence indicates that maize was not widely accepted in the Lower Mississippi Valley. The situation with regard to agriculture in the Late Prehistoric period of North Central Texas may be demonstrative of this. Navey (1975), and Huff and Biggs (1963) noted that skeletal remains from the Late Prehistoric Wylie focus were affected by large degrees of | periostitis and periodontal disease. However, the individuals from Bird Point Island have less severe and fewer skeletal pathologies. Two possibilities exist to explain these differences. The first follows Rose’s suggestion to the effect that the adoption of maize agriculture was not equally embraced by all groups in North Central Texas, pos- sibly due to local ecological insufficiencies. This model finds support in the Richland Creek area from the abundant meat resources, the ready availability of native plant sources, specifically nuts and Psoralea, and the low population density of the region. Finally, al- though maize has been recovered from Bird Point Island, it has not >een found in large quantities. Another possibility to account for the differences found between the present sample and other skeletal samples from the area may be. that they are derived from distinctly different time periods. In this regard, it must be kept in mind that excavations in other sites desig- nated as Wylie focus have been less exhaustive than the present work. Furthermore, the provenience of many of the previously re- covered burials has been poorly documented. In this connection, it should be noted that burials from the uppermost parts of the Feature 1 pit at Bird Point Island, as well as those from outside of Feature I which are generally more recent, tend to have somewhat higher inci- - dences of periostitis and have distinctly higher percentages of dental disease, including calculus. Thus, the burials from other sites, collec- tively referred to as Wylie focus sites, may be largely contempora- neous with the more recent burials at Bird Point Island.

FEATURE 1: THE LARGE DEPRESSION by William A. Martin and James E. Bruseth Feature 1 is the largest and most complex cultural feature at Bird Point Island, measuring approximately 17 m north-south by 13 m east-west and 2.2 m deep at the center. It was visible as a shallow depression on the ground surface along the western slope of the terrace, similar to the depressions reported at 12 sites along the East Fork of the Trinity River. The sites along the East Fork were attributed to the Wyiie focus by Stephenson (1949a). He characterized the Wylie focus as having large circular pits, pottery related to the Henrietta, Sanders, and Frankston foci, and flexed burials in poorly defined burial pits which lacked grave goods (Stephenson 1949b:305). As a result, large pits such as Feature 1 have been referred to in the literature as "Wylie focus pits" (Suhm et al. 1954; Lynott 1975; Raab 1982). This terminology is avoided here because it carries with it several cultural implications beyond the presence of a pit. Part III of this volume discusses the usefulness of the Wylie focus as a culture-historical construct, whereas this chapter simply describes the excavations inside the pit and presents the results of the analysis. The importance of Feature 1 for understanding site chronology cannot be overemphasized. Feature 1 was the only portion of the site where interpretable cultural stratigraphy was visible, The zones of Feature 1 pit fill were radiocarbon dated, thereby providing chronological information about artifacts and features within the pit which was critical for interpreting similar materials found elsewhere on the site. Since previous work within the "Wylie focus pits” along the East Fork had been quite limited, primarily confined to backhoe excavation (Ross 1966; Lynott 1975), the excavation at Bird Point Island provided a unique opportunity to study these enigmatic pits. The purpose of this chapter is to describe all pertinent data recovered from Feature 1, including stratigraphy, cultural features, burials, cremations, and artifact distributions. The ultimate goal is to provide an interpretation of pit utilization and the ways in which utilization changed over time. 79 SAMPLING AND EXCAVATION STRATEGIES During the testing program at Bird Point Island, the depression was tested rapidly by bisecting it with a backhoe trench to determine whether it was a natural erosional area or a cultural feature (McGregor et al. 1982). The profile of the backhoe trench and the presence of burials demonstrated that the depression was of cultural origin rather than the result of erosion, and it was labeled Feature 1. During mitigation Season I, excavations were conducted in the southwest quarter of the pit (Figure 6-1). The Season I excavation strategy was designed to excavate to the bottom of the pit in as many units as possible so that profiles extending from the center of the pit out to the rim could be examined and artifact frequency comparisons could be made among the strata observed. Only by reaching the bottom could the aboriginal construction of the pit and subsequent fill episodes be understood. An attempt was also made to open up a broad area, to expose a wide range of features and artifact concentrations that might yield insights into the function of the pit. Excavation preceeded in arbitrary levels rather than stratigraphic layers because the stratigraphy was extremely difficult to follow, and it was impossible to isolate discrete layers of cultural deposition. The stratigraphy was due to both cultural deposition and the natural effects of pedogenic processes such as leaching and bioturbation. Arbitrary levels provided the best means of maintaining control over vertical provenience and allowed the volume excavated to be calculated easily. The uppermost levels of Units 88 through 92 were dug in increments of 10 cm, but levels below 30 cm were excavated in 20 cm increments to increase the progress of the excavation and insure that the bottom of the pit would be reached by the end of Season I. This strategy succeeded, exposing the bottom of Feature 1 in these units during the final week of field work.

In order to expose features and artifacts needed to assess the nature of pit structure and function, additional units were opened to the west of Units 88 through 92. Units 95 through 99 were adjacent to Units 88 through 92, and Units 102 and 103 were adjacent to Units 95 and 96. The resulting block excavation covered an area of 56 m2, although only 48 m2 reached any appreciable depth, since Units 93 and 106 were abandoned shortly after they were started. At the completion of the field season, Units 102, 103, 95, 96, 98, and 99 were all down to the same level, and Unit 97 was only 20 cm above this level. The level reached within these units was 100 cm below datum, but this level varied from 70 cm below surface near the center of the pit to 90 cm below surface at the rim, due to the slope of the depression. Detailed soils analysis was conducted on samples recovered from the east profile to examine changes in stratigraphy and aid in the interpretation of the pit filling sequence (Figure 6-2), Sixty-six

82 soil samples retrieved from four vertical columns were analyzed from Feature 1. Soil samples were analyzed for the following chemical parameters: pH, total phosphorus (P), total calcium carbonate (CaCo), and total iron (Fe); in addition, levels of organic matter (O.M.) and organic carbon (O.C.) were assessed. Thirty-four of the samples were analyzed for soil particle size. Samples were extracted at 10 cm intervals from four vertical soil columns located in Units 88, 89, and 92 (McIntyre and Janak 1982:342). Osteological, faunal, and macrobotanical analyses were conducted on materials recovered from the pit, and tentative conclusions were derived about pit function. During the Archaic period, Feature 1 was thought to have been used solely as a cemetery, whereas it appeared to have been used for trash discard during the final occupation. Additional excavation was conducted during Season III to obtain a larger sample of features which might illustrate the range of activities that were conducted within the pit. Previous excavations indicated that male burials were predominant, so it was suggested that Feature 1 may have served originally as a special cemetery for high-status males. A larger sample of burials was required to test this hypothesis and to provide osteological evidence related to genetic or subsistence changes over time. A larger sample of radiocarbon dates from within Feature 1 was also required to refine chronological interpretation. The additional excavation conducted during Season III also provided a more complete sample of artifacts than that recovered during Season I because material was recovered by means of water screening rather than dry screening. Also, Season III excavations provided the only reliable data on the distribution of fire cracked rock, since the Wilcox sandstone comprising the majority of this class was not collected during Season I. Once the importance of this artifact category was recognized for the interpretation of other large irregular features (see Chapter 4), a comparable sample was required to adequately interpret the function of Feature 1. Units 401-404, were placed in a direct line with Units 88-92 to provide a complete profile through the center of the pit (see Figure 6-1). This permitted a view of the stratigraphic profile across the entire length of the feature, providing a better view of the entire fill sequence. PEDOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF PIT STRATIGRAPHY Mr. Edward Janak, Jr., Regional Soil Scientist for the USDA Soil Conservation Service, examined the profile of Feature 1 and helped isolate three major soil zones. The uppermost layer was designated as Zone 1, the middle layer was labeled Zone 2, and the bottom layer was designated as Zone 3. The undisturbed C horizon beneath the culturally disturbed layers was designated as Zone 4 (see Figure 6-2). It must be noted here that the specific locations where the boundaries between Zones 1-3 were drawn are not considered to be the exact points where zones are separated. The mixed nature of the fill and the diffuse boundaries caused by leaching make it impossible to define precise boundaries. The term zone is used here rather than stratum because there is no true stratigraphy in the traditional sense of gradual accumulation of distinct soil layers like those found on floodplain sites. The divisions of Zones 1-3 illustrated in Figure 6-2 provide a best estimate of zone differentiation based on color and texture variation. Radiocarbon dates and artifact distributions discussed later in this chapter are used to examine the accuracy of the zone boundaries. The east profile formed by Units 88-92 and Units 401-404 is illustrated in the upper half of Figure 6-2. The profile of Backhoe Trench Unit 25 is illustrated in the lower half. Since these three distinct zones were not recognized during testing (only Zone 1 was clearly mapped), the lower portion of the bottom profile is labeled as Zone 2 and 3 in Figure 6-2. In addition, it was impossible to differentiate Zones 1 and 2 in Units 402 through 404 in the upper Volume IH, Part One profile, so this portion is labeled as Zone 1 and 2. Zone 1 is comprised of fine sandy loam and is the most striking aspect of this profile, being characterized by a dark midden layer within the upper 40-80 cm of the pit. This dark soil (10YR3/1) is virtually nonexistent in undisturbed settings with similar parent material, relief, vegetation, and climate, and is directly relatable to human occupation and the addition of tremendous amounts of organic matter resulting from human behavior. The plow zone is slightly lighter in color than the underlying part of Zone 1. This is most likely due to recent plowing. Disturbance by tillage tends to accelerate the oxidation of organic matter, resulting in a lighter soil color. The plow zone (0-21 cm) is a dark grayish brown (10YR3/3) with a mean pH of 6.1, The remainder of Zone 1 (21- 80 cm) is a very dark gray (10YR3/1) with a mean pH of 5.8. However, the midden color fades to a very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) in Units 403 and 404 at the north end of the pit, suggesting that most refuse was discarded toward the center and south end of the pit (McIntyre and Janak 1982:352). Zone 2 is comprised primarily of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) and dark grayish brown (10YR3/3) fine sandy loam sediments with lighter colored disturbances ranging from 10YR4/3 to 10YR5/4. Zone 2 is separated from Zone 1 by a gradual, smooth boundary and is separated from Zone 3 by a gradual, diffuse boundary. Zone 2 varies in depth from about 40 cm to almost 160 cm in places and has a mean pH of 5.8. It is a very uneven layer with its thickness ranging from only 10 cm in Unit 91 to a maximum of 90 cm in Unit 88. Zone 2 differs from Zone 3 in its darker soil color and higher concentration of iron, both of which apparently leached out of Zone 1. In fact, Zones 2 and 3 may represent a single fill episode in which soil color and changes in chemical composition have affected only the upper portion of the fill, creating the impression of two separate layers. Due to the lighter color of the Zone 1 midden in Units 403 and 404, it is impossible to distinguish Zone 1 from Zone 2 in these units. Zone 3 is highly variable with respect to depth; the upper boundary of Zone 3 is only 70 cm below surface in Unit 91, whereas it is 135 cm below surface in unit 89. Zone 3 is characterized by a jumbled mixture of soil colors, including: brown (10YR4/3), yellow (10YR7/6), yellowish brown (10YR5/4), and even yellowish red (SYR5/8). In addition to variation in color, Zone 3 is very heterogeneous with respect to texture and has characteristics which suggest that it was part of the Bt (argillic) horizon of the original undisturbed soil profile. Structural development, which is not present in the other layers, is readily apparent in Zone 3. The structural units are coated by thin patchy clay films, a property which is diagnostic of argillic horizons. The sandy clay loam texture and the yellowish brown color with yellowish red mottles are typical of those observed in the argillic horizons of the soils surrounding the pit area. The boundary between Zone 3 and the undisturbed C horizon subsoil is irregular, but quite abrupt. The original bedded terrace sands are clearly visible in this undisturbed soil layer and are characterized by a wider variety of colors than found in the feature fill including miscellaneous shades of yellow-brown, white and reddish brown (McIntyre and Janak 1982:352). The bottom of the pit is easily distinguished by the contact of the randomly mixed fill with the uniformly stratified material below the pit. In addition, a fairly continuous zone of reddish staining occurs directly above and roughly parallel to the undisturbed terrace sediments. This is most likely due to deposition of iron by water percolating downward through the backfill material. The difference in pore size of the stratified sediments interrupted the free movement of the water, causing it to perch above the contact, allowing iron that had been leached from the materials above to accumulate in the perched water zone (McIntyre and Janak 1982:354), The irregular undulating bottom of the pit probably reflects extensive rodent burrowing activity. Numerous rodent burrows were observed within Zone 3, where darker soil from the upper zones filtered down to fill in the burrows. It is likely that older burrows are completely obliterated by recent ones and that the: level of disturbance in the feature is greater than the profile smawweroenresnesaaren reakrgan et el ee

In addition, rodent gnawing marks were observed on most burials, further indicating the degree of disturbance caused by this form of bioturbation. Extremely high pocket gopher activity has been documented in sandy soils along the Brazos River (Buechner 1942) and it is probable that similar levels of activity occurred within the sandy loam fill of Feature 1 and the sandy C horizon sediments below the feature. The soils data obtained by visual observation and laboratory analysis support the second hypothesis. The appearance of the backfill material in Feature 1 suggests that little, if any, selectivity was used in choosing the materials. Intermingled fragments of genetic horizons from the original soil profile are evident throughout the backfill, and occur randomly with no observable pattern. This suggests that the materials that were excavated were stockpiled, then backfilled unselectively. Backfilling most likely occurred as a single event rather than as a succession of events with any appreciable time between them, since there is no observable evidence of silt laminations or organic matter accumulation in the bottom layer of feature fill. These phenomena would probably be observable had significant time elapsed between a succession of backfilling events or had the pit been left open for any appreciable length of time. Organic enrichment of feature fill is limited to the upper 80 cm of feature fill (Zone 1) which formed gradually as a result of colluvial deposition of surrounding A horizon soil. Laboratory analysis of chemical composition and soil particle size provides additional information concerning the processes responsible for the creation of Zones 1 through 3. The natural soil profile resulting from pedogenic processes has the following chemical characteristics. Reaction (pH) is neutral to slightly acid at the surface and gradually decreases with depth. Iron and phosphorus are fairly mobile in a slightly acid medium and tend to accumulate in horizons with high cation exchange capacity, such as horizons with high clay or organic matter content. Calcium carbonate is highly soluble and leaches downward to accumulate at depths below 2 m. Organic matter is concentrated along the surface and gradually decreases with depth. Soil particle size varies within the sequence of A, Bt, and C horizons. Surface (A) horizons are fine sandy loam ranging from 25 to 37 cm in thickness, underlain by an argillic (Bt) horizon that is sandy clay loam in texture (McIntyre and Janak 1982:341). Disturbance and rearrangement of the profile by excavation, stockpiling soil, and backfilling disrupts the natural chemical and soil particle properties of the soil. As a result, chemical properties and soil particles sizes should be randomly distributed throughout the profile if prehistoric excavation and backfilling occurred. Examination of Figures 6-3, 6-4, and 6-5 shows that the distribution of chemicals is noticeably erratic from one level to the next and varies dramatically among Units 88, 89, and 92. It must be concluded, then, that random rearrangement of the soil layers has taken place as a result of prehistoric excavation and backfilling (McIntyre and Janak 1982:356). sor Depth tem Zone Number ou $.0 S.1 5.2 53 54 5.5 5.6 5.755 SF 60 Bt 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 ED Ld a so 106 10 200 286 300 350 ppm Fe o 19900 20000 30080 40040 ppm Om. o of v4 ae ae 2.0 12 a 165 Figure 6-3.

Soil chemical distribution in Unit 89. Colluvial deposition contributed to the pit filling sequence after the pit had been partially filled to create Zone 3 (and perhaps Zone 2). The depth of the A horizon soil observed in the 50 x 50 cm units dug upslope from Feature 1 was only 10 to 20 cm, whereas the depth ranged from 30 to 40 cm elsewhere on the site. This suggests that erosion washed soil downslope into the pit which gradually filled the depression to its current level, and created Zone 1. Analysis of artifact densities inside and outside the pit also supports this interpretation. Artifact densities from 110 50 x 50 cm units surrounding Feature 1 were compared with 50 units dug inside Feature | in order to examine the problem of colluvial deposition. Most of the units outside the pit were excavated to the level of the B horizon upslope from Feature 1, and units inside Feature 1 included the upper 30 cm of Zone 1. Table 6-1 presents the artifact densities from the two areas as artifacts per cubic meter. Dramatic differences are apparent between the two, with densities of unifaces, bifaces, lithic debris, and fire cracked rock much higher outside of the pit. However, when the relative proportions of artifacts in the assemblage are compared for both areas, very similar percentages are observed. This means that the composition of the midden inside and outside the pit was very similar despite the greater quantity of artifacts present outside Feature 1. Although it is possible that a greater degree of activity occurred around the outer edge of the pit, it seems more likely that the increase in density is a result of soil being removed by slopewash from the upslope part of the midden and redeposited within Feature 1.

Although some movement of artifacts would have occurred, this would have been confined to micro- flakes and other categories smaller than the artifacts used in this study. In addition to the data demonstrating that a heterogeneous profile is present, several intrusive pits were observed in both the east and west profiles of Units 88-92 and Units 401-404. These pits originated at or near the ground surface and penetrated Zone 2, demonstrating that a substantial amount of redigging occurred within Feature 1 sometime after it was completely filled and midden had accumulated on the surface. DESCRIPTIONS OF FEATURES AND BURIALS Even though the features inside Feature 1 were included in the analysis presented in Chapter 4, and raw data from these features are presented in Appendix C, feature descriptions are included here to illustrate the nature of pit utilization and change in use over time. Even though Zones 1 through 3 do not represent clearly separated zones of occupation, their artifact content and radiocarbon dates suggest that there is a degree of cultural relevance to these zones. Therefore, features and burials are described on a zone by zone basis from top to bottom, rather than in numerical order. Table 6-2 presents features and burials broken down by zone and Figure 6-6 illustrates their location within the pit. ZONE 1 Eleven features and one burial were uncovered in Zone 1. Features 2 and 3 were concentrations of refuse discarded within the very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) fill of Feature 1. Feature 2 consisted of two articulated deer vertebrae found at a depth of 20-40 cm in Unit 91. Feature 3 was a concentration of bone (95.3 g), baked clay (11 g), mussel shell (1 g), a few fragments of fire cracked rock, and charcoal spread over a 100 x 60 cm area of Unit 88, also at a depth of 20-40 cm. No discernible pits were associated with these concentrations. : Feature 4 was an oval concentration of charcoal (10YR3/2) found between 30 and 50 cm below surface in Unit 92. A date of AD. 1370 + 50 was obtained for this deposit. At the same depth, in Unit 89, a unique storage feature was found. This was Feature 5, a concentration of cores and tested cobbles (i.c., cobbles from which portions of cortex had been removed) found within a 30 x 30 cm Volume II, Part One area between 43 and 55 cm below surface (Figure 6-7). A total of 38 tested cobbles was recovered along with decortication flakes and a few secondary flakes. This feature appears to be a cache of raw materia! for stone tool production, probably placed in a pit intrusive into the very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) midden. However, no pit was observed due to the darkness of the midden soil. Feature 12 was a large, irregular pit which may actually represent several overlapping pits (Figure 6-8). This feature originated in Zone 1, but penetrated Zone 2. The feature was first observed as an amorphous, very dark brown stain (10YR2/2) at a depth of 70 cm in Unit 98. The end of the pit apparently extended east into Unit 91, but was not observed until it became apparent in the west profile of Unit 91. It extended 170 cm east-west and 70 em north-south and 134 cm below surface. A concentration of deer bone (70.7 g) and antler was found in the upper 30 cm of the fill and a few artifacts were recovered below this down to the bottom of the feature. A dart point, arrow point, and 173 flakes were recovered. Also, this was one of only three features found on the site that contained maize cupules. Feature 16 was visible in the west profile of Unit 90 and in plan views of Unit 97, but was not excavated due to time constraints. It was a very dark gray (10YR2/2) and contained an oval patch of black (10YR2/1). It looked very similar in profile to Feature 12, extending down within Zone 2. The presence of these pits indicates that numerous disturbances occurred within Zone 1 due to episodes of digging. Several features were dug into the rim of Feature 1. The term rim is used here to denote the undisturbed B horizon encountered at the edge of the pit, instead of an earthen berm, or surrounding ridge, that has sometimes been described for other Wylie focus pits (Stephenson 1949b), No such earthen embankments were observed at Bird Point Island. It is difficult to associate some of the pits found in the rim with a specific zone because such pits could have been dug either at the time of the original excavation of Feature 1, or during a subsequent episode of use. Features such as 61 and 61B clearly relate to Zone 1 because the bottoms of these features are confined within the Zone 1 midden and do not penetfate the subsoil. Features 17, 72, and 73 are primarily dug into the B horizon. The location of Features 72 and 73 adjacent to Features 61 and 61B suggests that they are probably contemporaneous with 61 and 61B. Feature 17 contained dark fill identical to the Zone 1 fill, so it is also believed to date to the Late Prehistoric period. It must be noted that most of the features associated with Zone | represent pits that postdate the accumulation of midden forming Zone 1. These pits were dug into Zone 1, and backfilled with Zone 1 midden soil, making it difficult to observe them until they penetrated the lighter colored soil of Zone 2 or the pit rim.

86 Figure 6-7. Feature 5, a concentration of tested cobbles. dark grayish brown (10YR2/3) fill. It did not load highly on any factor of the principal components analysis, so its function is difficult to determine. Its contents suggest use as a hearth for cooking or roasting. Feature 61B is a small pit with dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) fill adjacent to Feature 61 which may actually be an irregular projection off of the main pit. However, it had much higher volume-corrected counts of lithic debris and fire cracked rock than did Feature 61, so it may have served a related, but not identical function. Feature 72 was a small oval pit 15 cm west of Feature 61 that was highly irregular in profile. It contained dark grayish brown (10YR3/3) fill along with 13 flakes and 34 fragments of fire cracked rock. It was found between 61 and 67 cm below surface. Feature 73 was a circular, basin-shaped pit dug into the rim of Feature 1, between 55 and 65 cm below surface. It was comprised of dark grayish brown (10YR3/3) fill and contained 46 flakes and 39 fire cracked rock fragments. Although none of these features were sorted into functional groups by factor analysis, they may be related to the use of Feature 61 as a hearth judging from the presence of charcoal and fire cracked rock in their fill. Burial 8 was the only burial found within Zone 1. A clear grave pit was visible which contained fill darker than the surrounding midden soil. The pit curved south from the east wall of Unit 88 down to the center of Unit 89, measuring 300 cm long by 150 cm wide with the bottom at a depth of 120 cm below surface. The skeleton was found between 95 cm and 115 cm below surface. The position of the body was unique among the burials from sites in the Richland Creek drainage. The skeleton was interred face down in an extended position with the left arm crossed under the chest and the left hand possibly grasping the right wrist. Aside from the highly unusual burial position, another unusual aspect of Burial 8 was that fragments of a large charred log, approximately 20 cm in diameter, were found lying on top of the legs and lower back of the skeleton. This large mass of charcoal was present between 97 cm and 100 cm below surface. No evidence of charring was observed on the bones, however, making it unlikely that the charred log was the result of an attempted cremation. Since the skeleton was clearly interred in a grave, its unusual position and the location of the charcoal log cannot be due to the collapse of a burning structure. In fact, no evidence of any structures was found within Feature 1. Two dates of A.D. 1422 + 56 and A.D. 1510+ 60 years were obtained from the charred log (see Chapter 12 fora detailed discussion of radiocarbon dates). No grave goods were present, but animal bone, shell, pottery sherds, fire cracked rock, and three projectile points were present in the grave fill. Most of these materials were probably present in the midden when the grave was dug and were unintentionally included in the grave when it was backfilled with the same matrix that was removed to create the grave pit. Thus, they are unrelated Volume H, Part One Figure 6-8. Feature 12, an irregular pit dug into Zones | and 2. to mortuary practices and are not considered to be grave goods. However, the projectile points are of particular interest because they appear to have been in direct association with the skeleton. An Alba arrow point was found along the left side of the left calcaneous and the tip of an unidentifiable dart point was found between the scapula and thoracic vertebrae. Finally, a Gary point was found beneath the lumbar vertebrae. None of the projectile points were embedded in any of the bones, so no firm conclusions can be reached about their role in contributing to the death of this individual. The points may have simply been present in the midden soil that was used to fill the grave, but their close proximity to the skeleton suggests the possibility that they were intentionally included with it, either as grave goods or a result of violence. ZONE 2 Six features and five burials, including three cremations, were uncovered in Zone 2, Feature 9 is a pit observed in the profile of Backhoe Trench Unit 25 during the testing program (originally labeled Pit E in McGregor et al. 1982:37). No contents were collected at that time, and the feature fell outside the limits of the hand excavated area, so nothing is known about its function. It seems from the profile drawn during the testing program that a sharp break occurs between Zone 1 and the pit fill, so it might have originated in Zone 2. Feature 13 was a small, oval dark brown stain (1OYR2/2) found at a depth of 66 cm in Unit 102. The stain measured 32 cm north- south by 45 cm east-west. Only the top 4 cm of the feature were excavated to complete level 7 (60-70 cm) in Unit 102. Within this 4 cm deep portion of the feature, a small quantity of deer bone and teeth, flakes, and fire cracked rock was found. Feature 62 was comprised of black (1OYR2/1) fill and was a very unusual feature in that it contained mussel shell (45.2 g) and an entire deer antler (118 g) that did not appear to have been cut or subjected to use in any way. It also contained the second highest count of sumpweed (Iva annua) seeds found at the site (see Chapter 9). Some bone fragments and 28 fragments of fire cracked rock were also present within this oval, basin-shaped pit which measured 90 cm east-west by 68 cm north-south. It first became visible in Unit 401 at a depth of 86 cm, the interface of Zones 1 and 2, and extended down to 107 cm below surface. Feature 63 was a nearly circular pit, 50 cm in diameter, with an amorphous profile comprised of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) fill. It was found in Unit 402 at a depth of 98 cm and extended down to 104 cm below surface. The feature fill contained 18 flakes, 1.8 g of dog bone, and 28 fragments of fire cracked rock. It was difficult to tell whether this was an actual pit, or a load of trash more properly associated with the original fill episode. It wammeanneeeanrrane a ee ee me Oe

le a s int ile ns is en he ly Te ily Te he It ta ve nd h- re his nd sa ind est ter ich me ind wn ind ied ced vad It Feature 1 was not possible to determine whether the dog bone was part of a burial or refuse from a meal. Feature 78 was a dog burial located in Unit 401 in very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) fill immediately beneath Burials 19 and 20, from 110 cm to 115 cm below surface. Part of an articulated skeleton in a poor state of preservation was found; the other part had been destroyed by backhoe trench Unit 25. Long bone fragments and vertebrae totaling 3.0 g were recovered. Another dog burial, Feature 86, was recovered at nearly the same depth in Unit 401 (see Figure 4-14a). The long bones (23 g) were articulated but other bones had been disturbed by the shovel. Feature 87 was another dog burial consisting of 50 g of bone found in the north end of Unit 401 near the bottom of Zone 2 at a depth of 168 cm below surface in an area measuring 30 cm by 15 cm. Feature 78 was confined to an area measuring 30 cm east-west by 13 em north-south (although the northern portion of the skeleton was missing), and Feature 86 was confined to a 20 x 20 cm area. No grave pits were observed. Three of the burials recorded within Zone 2 were cremations and two were noncremated, fragmentary remains. Burial 2 was a cremation in a pit observed between 100 cm and 125 cm deep in Backhoe Trench Unit 25 (McGregor et al. 1982:37). Burials 4 and § were each comprised of a single long bone. Burial 4 was the humerus of an adult male found near the center of Feature 1 ata depth of 125 cm below surface. Burial 5 was a radius of an adult of unknown gender located near the rim of the pit at a depth of 80 cm below surface (Rutenberg 1982:86). These bones were assigned their own burial numbers because they could not be positively connected with other skeletons in the pit. However, they probably represent some of the bones missing from skeletons found further down in Zone 3 which were redeposited in Zone 2 during later episodes of digging. A pit containing the cremated remains of two individuals, Burials 19 and 20, was observed as a very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) chareoal and burned bone filled, oval pit between 95 cm and 105 cm deep in Unit 401 (see Figure 4-15a). Part of the cremation had been removed by Unit 25 and part of it extended into the east wall of Unit 401 (see Figure 6-2). The lens of charcoal and bummed bone (252 g) was distinctively darker than either the Zone 1 soil immediately above or the light brown soil of Zone 2, with an abrupt boundary at 95 cm. At first this level was thought to mark an old surface occupied prior to the final filling of the remainder of the pit, but soils data and depths of other cremations outside of Feature 1 indicated otherwise. There were no accumulations of organic matter or silt laminations at the 95 cm depth as would be expected if a surface had been exposed at this level for any length of time. Also, other cremations at the site were found in pits ranging between 50 and 70 cm deep, so it seems unlikely that a pit only 10 cm deep would have been dug for Burials:19 and 20. It is more likely that the pit was dug down from a surface above this lens and that the bone and charcoal lining the bottom of the pit are all that remain visible today. ZONE 3 Feature 8 was a dark grayish brown stain (10 YR3/3) containing charcoal flecks that was found in the southeast corner of Unit 92. The feature was diffuse in the profile of the east wall, but appeared as an oval stain cutting across the floor of the unit at a depth of 90- 100 cm. Its function is unknown. Feature 10 was a very thin lens of charcoal flecks in the center of Unit 91 measuring 30 cm north-south by 38 cm east-west and 6 em thick. It was found at a depth of about 1 m below surface, appearing as a very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) fill against a light brown (10YR4/3) background. Burned flakes (4) and burned bone (0.1 g) were recovered beneath the charcoal lens, and an oxidized orange (10YR5/8) area was present adjacent to the charcoal. This suggests that burning occurred in situ and that the feature was used as a hearth. Unfortunately, the quantity of charcoal recovered was insufficient to provide a radiocarbon date. 87 Feature 11 was a dog burial found in Unit 88, 150 cm below the surface. The skeleton was only partially articulated, but most of the bones (5 g) appeared to be present, and they were confined to an area measuring only 15 cm by 15 cm. The fact that the bones were found in a confined area suggests that the animal was deliberately interred even though no grave pit was observed. Feature 14 was an amorphous dark grayish brown stain (10YR3/3) in Unit 91 between 130 cm and 142 cm below surface, The feature was visible in the east profile of Unit 91 and extended 20 cm into the unit. A fragment of deer vertebra (1.7 g) and 44 fragments of fire cracked rock were recovered. It is unclear whether this feature represents an irregular pit dug into the fill or is actually a load of refuse dumped in as part of the original fill episode. This feature is almost identical to Feature 88, found in Unit 403 between 151 and 189 cm below surface, and is very similar to Feature 63, found at the bottom of Zone 2. Feature 88 appeared as a circular, dark stain (1OYR2/1) within a lighter, more irregular stain (10YR3/2) and was completely amorphous in profile. Deer bone (10.7 g), 8 flakes, 24 fragments of fire cracked rock, and a trace of mussel shell were recovered from Feature 88, . but no pit was definable. It is proposed that this feature also represents trash dumped in as part of the pit filling sequence. Feature 15 looked similar to Features 14 and 88 in that it was circular in plan view but unlike these other features, it had a basin- shaped profile. This pit was first observed as a light brown stain (10YR4/3) against the yellowish brown (10YR5/4) soil along the bottom of Zone 3. It was 67 cm in diameter and extended from 140 cm to 177 cm below surface. This pit contained very few artifacts, including 13 flakes and some fire cracked rock, but it also contained charcoal, hickory, acorn, pecan, and Psoralea. This indicates that it had an economic use, perhaps as a hearth. Most of the burials recovered from Feature 1 were found within Zone 3, and none of these were cremations. Several individuals were represented by isolated long bones found in rodent burrows or simply scattered in the fill. This demonstrates the high degree of disturbance that has occurred within the pit due to rodent activity and cultural episodes of redigging. The typical burial position was semiflexed, but a tightly flexed skeleton was also recovered. Burials 3 and 6 were found together in the same location near the bottom of Feature 1 in Unit 25, at a depth of about 2 m below surface (McGregor et al. 1982:37). Burial 3 was an adult male buried in the flexed position on his left side. Burial 6 consisted of a single immature phalange of a sub-adult found in association with Burial 3 (Rutenberg 1982:86). Burial 9/11 consisted of a nearly complete skeleton of a young adult male. The cranium was missing the frontal bone, which had separated along the coronal suture. The frontal bone was originally found in Unit 88 and listed as Burial 9, whereas the skeleton was labeled Burial 11. However, the frontal bone fit the cranium of Burial 11, so this individual is referred to as Burial 9/11. The skeleton was found in Unit 89 at a depth of 150-185 cm below surface, and the frontal bone was found in Unit 88 at a depth of 182 cm. The skeleton was tightly flexed, lying on its back with the skull to the east. The legs and pelvis were turned to the right side (north), and the legs were very tightly flexed. The right leg was crossing the left leg about halfway up the length of the femur. The skeleton was missing the left radius and ulna, which were found in the northeast corner of Unit 89, approximately 40-60 cm from the rest of the skeleton. The hands and feet were also missing from the skeleton and no trace of any hand or foot remains was found during subsequent excavation. The tight flexure suggests that the body may have been interred after most of the flesh ’ decayed. No grave pit was observed, which may mean that the body was set on the bottom of Feature 1 and covered during the fill episode. Burial 10 consisted of skeletal fragments found at a depth of 198 cm in the north half of Unit 88. Radius, ulna, rib, and calcaneous fragments were recovered. They were spread out across the north half of the unit, either due to rodent disturbance or to redeposition by later aboriginal excavation in the pit.

88 Burial 14 was an infant burial in a poor state of preservation in Unit 401 at a depth of 140-155 cm below surface. The cranium was broken apart with the occipital separated from the parietals and lying next to them. The entire lower portion of the skeleton from the pelvis down was missing, which suggests massive disturbance by a prehistoric digging episode. It appears from the position of the ribs and the articulated right humerus, radius, and ulna that the child was buried in a semiflexed position on its left side with its face toward the west. No grave pit was observed and no grave goods were found. Burial 15 was a partial skeleton of a female found in Unit 401 between 150 and 170 cm below surface. The cranium, pelvis and long bones of the leg were intact and were lying in the correct position for a semiflexed burial on the right side with face to the north. Most of the skeleton (vertebrae, scapulae, long bones of the arms, and ribs) was completely absent. Serious disturbance from burrowing animals is indicated by the severe gnawing observed on the long bones of the leg. Rodents may have removed every bone in the midsection of the skeleton, or the bones could have been removed and redistributed during some subsequent episode of digging. Burial 18 is a good example of this type of disturbance. Burial 18 consists of isolated fragments of cranial, vertebral, and fibular elements scattered across a 4 m area stretching from Unit 401 into Unit 403 at a depth of about 150 cm below surface. These bones may not all be from the same individual, but to maintain a conservative estimate of the burial population, the bones were considered part of a single burial because no evidence to the contrary was observed. It is certainly possible that the remains identified as Burial 18 represent some of the missing bones from other skeletons, but it is not possible to make a positive connection between these elements and other skeletons. CHRONOLOGY OF PREHISTORIC UTILIZATION OF FEATURE 1 In this section, radiocarbon dates and temporally diagnostic artifacts are examined to formulate a chronological framework for the features, burials, and fill episodes within Feature 1. This section duplicates to some extent the presentation of site chronology in Chapter 12, but only to the extent required to unravel the sequence of pit utilization. The distribution of ceramics and projectile points is presented by zone. Since no clear stratigraphic boundary was visible between the zones in Units 402- 404, zones were arbitrarily divided as follows for this artifact distribution analysis: Zone 1 is levels 1-8, Zone 2 is levels 9-15, Eeet Profile I Unit 404 | Unie 403 1 Ualt 402 t aS ZONE 1 Unit 401 \\Y \Y A.D, A.D. 1510 + 60 1422 + 56 A.D. 1370 + 50 A.D. 1280 + 110 ®@eeaa A.D. 1350 + 90 Figure 6-9. Distribution of radiocarbon dates within Feature 1 at Bird Point Island. Unit 88 Volume II, Part One and Zone 3 is levels 16-20. The levels defined for each zone during Season I (Martin 1982) were used for analysis of Units 88-92. RADIOCARBON DATES Fourteen radiocarbon dates (uncorrected) were obtained from the various zones within Feature 1. From Zone 1, seven specimens were analyzed, three of which provided modern dates and four of which provided dates ranging from A.D. 1280 + 110 to A.D. 1510 + 60 (Figure 6-9). The modern dates from Units 88 and 91 were obtained immediately below the plow zone, so it is probable that surface charcoal was chumed into the soil either by plowing or by bioturbation. A modern date for Feature 12 probably reflects recent charcoal working down into the soil by natural means. The maximum date range, ca. A.D. 1170 to A.D. 1570, appears to suggest that much of the midden accumulation of Zone 1 occurred during the final site occupation dating to the Late Prehistoric period. However, the two terminal dates obtained were from the charred log associated with Burial 8, which was intrusive into Zone 1 (Figure 6-9), so the majority of midden accumulation must have occurred prior to A.D. 1422 + 56. The distinction between Zones 1 and 2 appears to be substantiated by the occurrence of two specimens in Zone 2 dating at A.D. 720 + 140 and A.D. 700 + 100, for a maximum range of A.D. 580 to A.D. 860 at a depth of 95 cm to 120 cm. Due to a lack of charcoal in Zone 3, the only dates obtained for this zone were four bone dates from Burial 9/11. The collagen from rib fragments was dated to A.D. 140 + 110. Both collagen and apatite were dated for long bones by the SMU Radiocarbon Laboratory. These dates varied considerably, ranging from 107 B.C. to A.D. 521 (see Figure 6-9). However, the latest date was considered the least reliable by the director of the SMU Radiocarbon Laboratory and has been discounted (see Chapter 12). Thus, the accepted date range for Zone 3 is 170 B.C. to A.D. 130. TEMPORALLY DIAGNOSTIC ARTIFACTS The vertical distribution of projectile points and ceramics within Feature 1 supports the hypothesis that the midden (Zone 1) is the result of a Late Prehistoric occupation postdating the underlying material (Figure 6-10). Ratios of arrow points to dart points by zone iilustrate this fact. In Zone 1, 56 arrow points were recovered as opposed to only 12 dart points for a ratio of roughly 5:1. In Zone 2 the trend is reversed and there are only 5 arrow ” uete 89 i Unit 90 1 Unie 91 I Unit 92 horizon harlzom ¢ horlzon ZONE 2 ZONE 3 A.D. 700 + 100 ™ A.D. 140 + 110 AD. 36+ 203 (} A.D. 720 + 140 107 B.C. + 239

Distribution of Late Prehistoric period artifacts in Feature 1 at Bird Point Island: (a) number of arrow points per level, and (b) number of ceramic sherds per level. points to 19 dart points forming a ratio of nearly 1:4. In Zone 3 only dart points were found. The arrow point types recognized within Zone 1 include Alba, Scallorn, Friley, Hayes, Steiner, Catahoula-like, and Perdiz. The first four types were made until at least A.D. 1200 in East Texas, but generally predate the A.D. 1300-1650 period associated with Zone 1 of Feature 1. However, the Catahoula-like and Perdiz points could easily fall within the A.D. 1300-1650 period. It is possible that all of the projectile point types found at the site persisted longer in the Project area vicinity than they did in East Texas, but there is only a partial agreement between projectile point types and radiocarbon dates if the East Texas chronology is used (McGregor et al. 1982:142). The only classifiable arrow point types in Zone 2 are Alba (two specimens) and Scallorn (two specimens). These types are thought to be diagnostic of the early Late Prehistoric period. All dart points from Zone 2 are classified as Gary, with the exception of one Yarbrough point in Unit 403. Zone 3 contained six Gary points and no arrow points. The ceramics from Feature 1 are confined almost entirely to Zone 1 and include varieties associated with the Early and Late Caddoan periods in East Texas. The two specific types identified are Canton Incised, associated with the Sanders focus, and Maydelle Incised, associated with the later Frankston focus. Untyped ceramics bear decorative motifs common to Caddoan pottery, including incised and punctate designs as well as engraved and excised triangle designs typical of the Late Prehistoric period (see Chapter 8). The chronology for the ceramic types corresponds with the radiocarbon dates from Zone 1. Five charcoal samples provided dates clustering within the A.D, 1300- 1650 occupation period, which agree with the temporal placement of the Late Caddoan styles, but only one date from the A.D. 1000- 1200 period was obtained. It seems that little charcoal was deposited with the many ceramics associated with the Early Caddo styles which were discarded into the pit during the A.D. 1000- 1200 occupation, whereas substantial quantities of charcoal were left in the pit between A.D. 1300 and 1650. FEATURE FUNCTION: CHANGES THROUGH TIME In this section, the concentrations of artifacts, faunal, and floral remains throughout the Feature 1 fill are examined, and the different kinds of features and burials are considered in order to address probable feature function. Previous workers have ° proposed that Wylie focus pits were defensive breastworks similar to the pits dug by the historic Waco (Stephenson 1949b), subterranean structures (Ross 1966), or ceremonial areas for council meetings or ritual feasting (Lynott 1975). The data from Feature 1 at Bird Point Island were examined to search for answers to the problems of original pit use and changes in utilization over time. MORTUARY AND CEREMONIAL USE The most obvious function of Feature 1 is its role as a cemetery. Within the percentage of the feature excavated by hand and backhoe (38%), 13 burials, including three cremations, were recorded. Examination of Figure 6-6 reveals that most of the interments occurred near the center of the pit. Since about half of the center was dug, it is reasonable to estimate that about 50% of the total burials were recovered rather than only 38%. If this is the

90 case, then approximately 26 individuals were interred in Feature 1 during the course of its use as a cemetery. The vast majority of burials (59%) were found in Zone 3 between 140 cm and 180 cm below surface, very near the bottom of Feature 1. None of these burials were cremated and those individuals represented by more than fragmentary remains were buried in semiflexed or tightly flexed positions. As was the case for Wylie focus pits near Dallas, no grave goods other than a few mussel shells were included with these individuals, so no indicators of status differentiation were present. As previously noted, the predominance of males recovered during Season I led to the hypothesis that the pit served as a special cemetery for high-status males. However, Season III burials included males, females and infants, a population typical of a normal cemetery, so this hypothesis was abandoned (see Chapter 5). Very few features were recognized within Zone 3, other than a dog burial (Feature 11) and amorphous. patches of dark soil containing refuse which may represent soil dumped into the pit as part of the fill episode (Features 14 and 88) or which may be the product of rodent denning. The few features which are clearly of cultural origin that are not related to mortuary activity (Features 8, 10, and 15) are related to economic activity. Features 8 and 10 may have been hearths, and Feature 15, which contained charred Psoralea tubers, was clearly associated with food preparation. These are discussed further in the next section. All cremations found within Feature 1, (Burials 2, 19, and 20), occurred in Zone 2 around 100 cm below surface. Fragmentary long bones and ribs of two noncremated individuals were also found in Zone 2, but they may represent bones redeposited from Zone 3 burials as a result of redigging. It seems that either mortuary practices changed substantially by the A.D. 580-860 period from inhumation to cremation, or that both practices were conducted simultaneously during the later period. The presence of cremations and inhumations together around Houses 1, 2, and 3 indicates that the latter possibility is more likely. Along with human interments, dog interments were also encountered in Zone 2, demonstrating that its principal function was similar to that of Zone 3. As stated previously, the distinction between Zones 2 and 3 is based on soil color and iron content, probably due to leaching, and is not necessarily the result of cultural activity. It is not surprising that Zones 2 and 3 share many traits, since they probably represent a single episode of pit fill. It is only the upper part of Zone 2, where cremations and most features are found, that chronological differences between Zones 2 and 3 become apparent. Zone 1 differs dramatically from Zones 2 and 3 in that it contains the highest concentrations of artifacts in the pit and exhibits a relative lack of burials. All of the fill excavated in Units 95-99 and 102-103 was confined to Zone 1, which means that more than twice as much of Zone 1 was sampled than of Zones 2 and 3. Yet, in all this area, only Burial 8 was uncovered. This highly unorthodox burial was clearly intrusive into Zone 1, and had nothing to do with the primary activities conducted in Zone 1. The primary use of Feature 1 seems to have shifted away from the mortuary role to increased use for economic activities during the occupations that created the Zone 1 midden. NONMORTUARY USES Nonmortuary uses of Feature 1 can be clarified by examining trends in the vertical and horizontal distribution of artifacts as well as the faunal and floral material found within it. The comparison of materials by zone is supplemented with a similar comparison by level to identify finer gradations in artifact distribution. Volume- corrected figures are used in place of raw counts to compensate for the variations in volume caused by the presence of Backhoe Trench Unit 25, the presence of features, and the irregular shape of the rim and bottom of Feature 1. All artifact densities are presented as counts per cubic meter to make data comparable from unit to unit. Volume I, Part One Table 6-3 ARTIFACT DENSITIES!

Although similar analysis was conducted during Season I, three factors make Season III data more suitable for this analysis than Season I data. First, 10 cm levels were used during Season ITI, whereas 20 cm levels were used during Season I, so finer detail can be discerned. Second, the Season I data lack quantification of fire cracked rock, which was recorded during Season III. Third, Season IH data were collected from water screening, providing a more complete and consistent data set than was likely to have been obtained during Season I. VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF ARTIFACTS, FLORAL, AND FAUNAL REMAINS Artifact densities were first examined by zone using the arbitrary divisions noted previously (Zone 1 equals levels 1-8; Zone 2 equals levels 9-15; and Zone 3 equals levels 16-20). The total artifacts per cubic meter for Zones 1, 2, and 3 in Units 401- 404 are presented in Table 6-3. Zone 1 contains the most lithic debris, bifaces, unifaces, arrow points, ceramics, baked clay, and charcoal, while the frequencies of these items drop markedly from Zone 1 to Zone 3 (see Chapter 7). However, Zone 2 is highest in bone, dart points, and fire cracked rock content. Zone 3 demonstrates a lower frequency of every class except bone, which is relatively high. The high bone content of both Zones 2 and 3 can be traced in part to the presence of dog burials and the natural inclusion of burrowing animal skeletons, but many of the skeletal elements are from species used as food. The distribution of bone is such that the upper levels contain little bone other than deer, whereas bone concentrations made up of several species occur within Zones 2 and 3. Zone 1 is dominated by deer, but also contains dog, rabbit, and a beaver incisor. Zone 2 also contains deer, dog, and rabbit, but aquatic species such as turtle are present as well. The greatest diversity of species is found in Zone 3 where bison, bird, snake, deer, dog and burrowing animals such as rabbit, cotton rat, and gopher were found (see Chapter 9). The presence of these faunal species within Feature 1 represents refuse discarded during the filling sequence of the pit. The breakdown of the feature fill into three zones tends to oversimplify the vertical relationships among artifact classes. To obtain a more detailed look at the profile, the raw frequencies for each level in Units 401-404 were calculated as counts per cubic

These volume-corrected values are presented in Table 6-4. The presence of fire cracked rock and food refuse in the bottom levels of Feature 1 demonstrates that economic utilization occurred concurrently with mortuary use during the Late Archaic period. Although the density of fire cracked rock is lower in Zone 3 than in the upper zones, it forms a dominant proportion of the overall assemblage. Roughly 85% of the artifacts recovered from Zone 3 were fire cracked rocks. However, the most notable trends in artifact distribution related to the economic use of Feature 1 are the concentrations of fire cracked rock and baked clay in Zone 2 from levels 8-11 (80-120 cm) in Unit 404 and levels 10-13 (100- 140 cm) in Units 401-403.

Interestingly, the depth of these increases in artifact density closely parallels the irregular line drawn on the profile that separates the upper layer (Zone 1 and 2) from Zone 3 (see Figure 6-2), suggesting that some degree of cultural distinction exists between zones. The fact that fire cracked rock and baked clay are the only artifact classes to show dramatic increases demonstrates that activity related to heat transfer increased in the upper portion of the pit. The pattern most similar to this, outside of Feature 1, is the pattern observed for roasting pits. The introduction of burned rock into a large pit or series of pits would create a roughly parallel distribution of baked clay as the heated rocks came into contact with the B horizon clay that was part of the Feature 1 fill. Fire cracked rock and macrobotanical data from Feature 1 were compared with data from Feature 38 and other roasting pits to test

Within Feature 1, however, any location would observed between 80 and 140 cm in Feature 1 was the result of have been easy to dig, so there would have been no need to return roasting. to the same exact spot each season. New pits could easily be dug The densities of fire cracked rock within Zone 1 of Feature 1 throughout Feature 1 fill, and the current evidence shows that are not nearly as high as within Feature 38. The highest densities in several pits actually were dug throughout Zone 1. As a result, Units 401-404 range from 515 fragments per m> in Unit 404 to there was much less opportunity for fire cracked rock to 730 fragments per m3 in Unit 403 (Table 6-4). The average accumulate in any one horizontal location. density within Feature 38 was 1945.5 fragments per m3, which is Due to the relative lack of ceramics and arrow points below the three to four times greater than the highest densities observed in depth of 50 cm, the temporal placement for most of these proposed Feature 1. However, when the macrobotanical content of each is episodes of digging and roasting must be within the period prior to compared, the similarities are striking. Since no flotation samples _ the deposition of these artifacts. Some of the ceramic styles found were collected from the general pit fill of Feature 1, the within the pit have been dated as early as A.D. 800 in East Texas macrobotanical content of features within each zone was (see Chapter 8), but these same styles found elsewhere on the site examined. Table 6-5 presents the volume-corrected (per 100 1) have been dated between A.D. 1000 and 1200. Since roasting macrobotanical data from features inside Feature 1 along side the occurred during this period in Feature 38, and presumably during volume-corrected values obtained from roasting pits. It is evident the same period in other roasting pits located adjacent to houses, it that features within Zone 1 contain higher amounts of charcoal, seems reasonable to assume that the roasting activity at the 100 cm hickory, pecan, acorn, and Psoralea than do those in Zones 2 and to 140 cm depth within Feature 1 also took place during this 3, and that the densities in Zone 1 are equal to or greater than those period. Most charcoal providing dates from A.D. 1300 and later observed within roasting pits. was found in the upper 50-70 cm of Zone 1, except for charcoal This general trend toward a concentration of macrobotanical associated with Burial 8, which intruded deeper into the midden. It items in the upper zone, with a decrease in the lower zones, seems likely that more charcoal from this Late Prehistoric supports the contention that the economic function of Feature 1 occupation would have been found at the same depth as the fire increased during the Late Prehistoric period. The increases in fire cracked rock and baked clay concentrations if much roasting cracked rock and baked clay at depths between 80 cm and 140 cm _ activity had occurred during that period, just as the late period below surface roughly correspond to distributions in roasting pits, charcoal from Burial 8 was found at a greater depth after the which were generally 100-150 cm deep. The fact that the densities grave was dug through the midden. Thus, the increased use of of fire cracked rock are one third those of roasting pits does not Feature 1 for roasting must have occurred sometime between A.D. preclude the utilization of Feature 1 for roasting. It is probable 700 and A.D. 1300, and probably occurred between A.D. 1000 that episodes of digging and roasting occurred over a broad and A.D. 1200. portion of Feature 1, rather than within the confines of a single pit as was the case with Feature 38. Roasting pits like Feature 38 are believed to have been utilized over and over again on a seasonal HORIZONTAL DISTRIBUTION OF FEATURES, basis resulting in great accumulations of small, fire cracked rock BURIALS, AND ARTIFACTS fragments. One major reason for the reuse of roasting pits rather than the excavation of new pits, is that it is much easier to dig in the The horizontal distribution of features, burials, and artifacts disturbed fill of a pit than to dig through the undisturbed sandy _ also points to changes in pit utilization over time.

e Feature I Table 6-6 HorizoNTAL DISTRIBUTION OF FEATURES AND BuRIALS IN FEATURE | Features within 2.5 m of the Edge of Feature 1 Features in the Center Zone of Feature 1 1 F3, FS, B8 F4, F12, F16, Fi7, F6l, F61B, F72,F73 2 F62, F78, F86, F87,B2, F9, BS B4, B19 & 20 3. Fil, F63, B3, B6, B9/11, F8, F10, F14, F15, F88 B10, B14, B15, B18 the number of features and burials present in the center of Feature 1 and along the edge of the pit (within 2.5 m of the rim) by zone. The total number of features and burials is nearly equally distributed between the center and the edge, with 54% of all features in the center and 46% along the edge. This overall pattern suggests that features are more or less uniformly scattered throughout Feature 1 until the distribution is viewed on a zone by zone basis. Then, striking differences in pit utilization are apparent. Beginning at the bottom, in Zone 3, six human burials and a dog burial are present in the center (58% of Zone 3 features), whereas five features were situated within 2.5 m of the pit edge (42%). The features recognized near the pit edge include Features 8, 14, and 88 which may be nothing more than dark patches of fill containing refuse. The only pits with definite economic uses are Feature 4, a hearth, and Feature 15, a pit containing charred plant remains. It appears that interment was confined to the center of the pit. Although economic use for food preparation may have been concentrated near the pit edge during the initial period of utilization, the presence of fire cracked rock and faunal elements throughout the Zone 3 fill suggests that it was used for food preparation prior to the interment of the humans and dogs. The center of Zone 2 contains three cremated individuals, a human long bone, two dog burials, and three pits (82% of all Zone 2 features), with one pit and a fragmentary burial along the pit edge (18%). The function of Feature 62 may possibly be related to a ceremonial offering of mussel shell, seeds, and antler; Feature 63 may merely represent a load of trash dumped in during the fill episode, and the functions of the other pits are not known. The presence of Burial 5, (a single long bone) along the edge of the pit appears to be the result of redeposition from elsewhere in the pit. It seems that mortuary activity within Zone 2 was also confined mainly to the center of the pit. Moving up into Zone i, the opposite trend is found. Burial 8, Feature 5 (a cache of cores) and an episode of trash disposal were observed in the center of Feature 1 (25% of Zone 1 features), whereas seven irregular pits, perhaps used for roasting, and two possible hearths are present along the pit edge (75%). It is clear that the mortuary function, which was of major importance during the early occupations of the site, was essentially abandoned in favor of an economic function during the later site occupations. Activity appears to have been concentrated near the edge of the pit, but it is possible that other pits were dug closer to the center, which were impossible to detect within the dark midden soil of Zone 1. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Feature 1 is the only feature at Bird Point Island to exhibit interpretable stratigraphy. The complex stratigraphy within this pit has been simplified into three zones. Zone 1 is the dark brown midden layer forming the upper layer of pit fill; Zone 2 is a lighter brown layer with its color caused by leaching from Zone 1; Zone 3 is the bottom layer of mixed soil, exhibiting a patchwork quality of light brown, dark brown, and yellow-brown soils, resulting from 93 ' the mixture of A and B horizon soils in the fill and centuries of burrowing rodent activity. Examination of the pit filling sequence was directed toward understanding the original function of the pit and changes in its utilization over time. Data from soils analysis, artifact analysis, and floral, faunal, and osteological studies were used to examine this problem. Soils data indicated that heterogeneous fill was deposited in the pit shortly after its initial excavation. Chemical analysis identified erratic distributions of chemical properties, and particle size analysis indicated a mixture of A, B, and C horizon soils within the fill. No accumulation of organic matter suggesting the presence of old surfaces was found in the bottom layer of the pit. Darker, organically enriched soil was observed only in the upper 1 - 1.5 m of pit fill. This pattern suggests that the pit was partially filled during an intentional fill episode, probably to around the top of Zone 2, and then was gradually filled to its present level as a result of colluvial deposition of A horizon soil upslope from the depression. Radiocarbon dates obtained from Burial 9/11 found at the bottom of the pit indicate that the pit was originally excavated sometime between 170 B.C. and A.D. 130. Several skeletons were uncovered near the center in the bottom of the feature, none of which had visible grave pits or grave goods. The observed age and sex ratio is normal for a cemetery used by a tribal or band-level society; there is no indication that inclusion inside Feature 1 was restricted to a special class or status. Very low artifact densities were found in the bottom layer of pit fill (Zone 3), and only two definite features related to economic use were found. However, the presence of fire cracked rock and faunal remains suggests that economic activity related to food preparation was also conducted in the pit during its initial period of use. Even though the artifact densities are low, the importance of this economic function may have been equal to that of the mortuary function. Low densities would be expected if short term occupations occurred and the pit was partially refilled, as the evidence indicates. The possibility that ritual feasting accompanied mortuary ritual is discussed more fully in Chaper 21. Two cremation pits containing the remains of at least three individuals were found in Zone 2 nearly 1 m below ground surface. The pit containing Burials 19 and 20 also contained charcoal which provided a date of A.D. 720 + 140, Dog burials were also found in this layer, and most features were confined to the center of the pit. A shift in pit utilization occurred sometime after A.D. 860, when the mortuary function of the pit diminished and economic use increased. Numerous episodes of pit excavation were visible as intrusive features originating in Zone 1 and penetrating Zone 2. Concentrations of fire cracked rock and baked clay occur between 80 cm and 140 cm below surface, and the macrobotanical content of the features in Zone 1 is very similar to that found in roasting pits. It appears that several roasting pits were dug into Zone 1. Since the bottom layers of these intrusive pits contain few ceramics or arrow points, the period of principal roasting activity is believed to have occurred after A.D. 860, perhaps between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1200 during the occupation of Houses 1, 2, and 3. . The last two major occupations at the site were a village occupation between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1200, and series of brief occupations from A.D. 1300-1650. Evidence of both periods of occupation is confined primarily to the upper 50 - 80 cm of pit fill. The house occupation immediately north of Feature 1 resulted in the discard of Early Caddoan style sherds and arrow points in the pit. The A.D. 1300-1650 occupations are documented by radiocarbon dates and the presence of Late Caddoan ceramics within the upper layer of the midden. For the most part, the pit functioned as a trash disposal area during these final occupations. However, Burial 8 was also interred during the last period of occupation. In some of the Wylie focus pits reported along the East Fork near Dallas, researchers suggested the presence of structures within the pits on the basis of baked clay concentrations (Ross 1966:6; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968:11). The rationale for rapid excavation with a backhoe at the Sister Grove Creek site, aside from financial constraints, was that features and structural

54 remains would be found once the fill was removed (Lynott 1975:17). Although it seemed unlikely that the prehistoric inhabitants of Bird Point Island would have constructed a giant pithouse, the possibility of structures within the pit was carefully examined. A search was conducted for post holes both inside and around the edge of the pit. The upper 30 cm of the east half of Feature | was scraped with heavy equipment to expose the edge of the pit and any post holes or other features that were present. Although dozens of features were recorded, no post hole-sized features were found. No examples of post holes were found inside the pit either, although several rodent runs were cross-sectioned in the search forthem. The distribution of artifacts within the pit in no way resembles house occupation debris. The accumulation of fire cracked rock and baked clay forms the only layer of occupation debris and that layer is more similar to material found in a roasting pit than in a Volume II, Part One structure. No evidence of a floor is present at the bottom of Feature 1; rather, the bottom is irregular and has the lowest density of artifacts observed within the pit. In short, there is no evidence of a structure associated with any zone of Feature 1. In conclusion, Feature 1 at Bird Point Island was in use prior to the period defined for the Wylie focus, perhaps as early as 170 B.C., but certainly by around A.D. 130. No evidence of structures or occupational debris was found. Instead, human and dog skeletons and human cremations were encountered in the middle and bottom zones of the pit, and a highly disturbed midden deposit was present in the upper layer. The pit was used both as a cemetery and as a roasting or cooking area from at least A.D. 130 to A.D. 860. Its function then shifted away from the mortuary role to use solely for economic activities. Finally, the depression was used for trash discard resulting in the. accumulation of organic matter, bone, and artifacts in the midden of Zone 1.

of st 10 0 sg le sit se of Tr, LITHIC ARTIFACTS by Daniel E. McGregor ‘This chapter presents an analysis of the lithic artifacts recovered from the excavations at Bird Point Island. Its purpose is to describe these materials and to examine their intrasite distribution. Since artifact description is a traditional and relatively- straightforward task, the site assemblage has been divided into a series of morphological categories, and these categories provide the framework for the artifact descriptions. To examine the intrasite distribution of these artifacts, the total site assemblage is divided into a series of subsets following the spatial areas defined in Chapter 1. The subsets are compared to one another, and similarities and differences in their contents are identified and discussed. This is followed by a brief description of a technological analysis of lithic artifacts that includes a subset of the materials from Bird Point Island. That analysis is reported in Chapter 17 of Volume III. ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS LITHIC TOOL CATEGORIES In the following subsections we define the lithic tool categories that have been employed to classify artifacts from the site. In a later section of this chapter we examine the functional relationships of these classes and make interpretations about prehistoric cultural behavior as seen in the lithic artifacts. PROJECTILE POINTS Projectile points are defined as symmetrical, pointed bifaces with the proximal end modified (by notching, stemming or thinning) to facilitate hafting. This category also includes basal portions of points, but only when the hafting element is present. Possible projectile point tips, and medial and basal fragments that do not possess a definable hafting element are included within the biface fragment category. 95 The projectile points are divided into arrow point and dart -point subcategories, and are assigned to a recognized type whenever possible. The untyped specimens are subdivided according to stem morphology except when they are too fragmentary for this determination. Arrow Points Alba (83 specimens; Figure 7-la-d).These specimens are characterized by their rectangular stems with straight to slightly convex bases. Their triangular blades have either prominent, right-angled shoulders or slightly downward pointing barbs. Bassett (4 specimens). These specimens have small triangular blades with short barbed shoulders. The short contracting stems have pointed bases. Catahoula-like (4 specimens). These specimens have relatively broad blades with slightly concave edges. The shoulders are pronounced, with squared ends. All have short expanding stems with concave bases. Cliffton (2 specimens). Both specimens have short contracting stems and have a somewhat unfinished appearance. They were fashioned from small flakes by retouching that was primarily unifacial. Cuney (10 specimens). These specimens are characterized by their short expanding stems with deeply concave bases and triangular blades with barbed shoulders. Fresno (1 specimen; Figure 7-1e). This unstemmed specimen has a triangular outline and slightly concave base. The distal tip is missing. Hayes (31 specimens; Figure 7-1f). These specimens are distinguished by their slightly concave edges, triangular blades and bulbous stems with rounded bases.

Perdiz (65 specimens; Figure 7-1g-i). These specimens are characterized by their straight edged triangular blades, well- barbed shoulders, and long contracting stems. The blade edges are finely serrated on many specimens. Scallorn (28 specimens; Figure 7-1j,k). These specimens are comer notched, with markedly expanding stems and straight- edged triangular blades. They have either prominent right angle shoulders or slightly downward pointing barbs. The bases are either straight, slightly concave or slightly convex. Scallorn-like (serrated blade) (23 specimens; Figure 7-11). These specimens have markedly expanding stems that are characteristic of Scallorn points. They differ from Scallorn specimens in that their blade edges are serrated. Steiner (23 specimens; Figure 7-1m-p). These specimens are characterized by their deeply serrated blades. Stem morphology is somewhat varied and in a few cases stems are poorly developed. Most specimens have rather short, slightly expanding stems with straight or slightly convex bases. Untyped, Contracting Stem (46 specimens; Figure 7-1q,r). Untyped, Expanding Stem (28 specimens; Figure 7-1s,t). Untyped, Fragmentary (79 specimens). Dart Points Angostura (1 specimen; Figure 7-2a). This specimen has a narrow leaf shaped outline and is eight cm long. It is widest at its midsection (3.1 cm) and considerably narrower at the base (1.7 cm). The blade edges are convex on the distal three-fourths of the specimen but the ground stem edges are quite straight and converge slightly toward the base. Bulverde (1 specimen; Figure 7-2b). This specimen has a large triangular blade with straight edges and prominent, barbed shoulders. The stem is rectangular in outline with a straight base. Dawson (18 specimens; Figure 7-2c). This type was originally defined by Duffield (1963:17-18) and later expanded upon by Prewitt (1974b:58-62). They are characterized by their relatively long, straight to slightly contracting stems. The stem edges on nine specimens exhibit light grinding. The bases of most specimens are convex, but are formed by cortex on four specimens. Thirteen of the specimens have relatively long and narrow blades, whereas the blades on five specimens are much broader. Elam (1 specimen). This short, crudely fashioned specimen has a roughly rectangular stem and slightly convex base. The blade shoulders are weakly developed. Ellis (8 specimens; Figure 7-2d). These specimens have short triangular blades with prominent shoulders. The stems are sharply expanding with straight or slightly convex bases.

Gary, Regular Variety (237 specimens, Figure 7-2e-g). These specimens are characterized by their triangular blades and contracting stems with rounded bases. There is a considerable range in blade form with shoulders varying from poorly developed to prominent. A few of the specimens exhibit light grinding on the stem edges and, less frequently, on the base (Figure 7-2e). Specimens which are similar in morphology but either have serrated blade edges, or are less than 3 cm in length are included in separate categories. Gary, Serrated Blade (20 specimens; Figure 7-2h,i). These are similar to the regular variety of Gary, except that their blade edges are serrated. The blades are distinctly beveled on 11 of these specimens. All have slightly contracting stems, none of which exhibit evidence of grinding. The bases are rounded or convex on all but two specimens, which have bases formed by cortex. These specimens are very similar to Prewitt's (1974b:67) Neches River, oletha variety. Although a Middle Archaic age has been suggested for the Neches River, oletha variety, similar specimens have been recovered from a securely dated post-A.D. 300 context at site 41FT193. Gary, Small Variety (32 specimens, Figure 7-2 j,k). These small (less than 3 cm in length) specimens are identical to examples of the hobson and colfax varieties of Gary that were defined by Johnson (1962:163-166). They have straight edged triangular blades and prominent, but unbarbed shoulders, Stems are either slightly contracting or somewhat square. The bases are primarily rounded or convex, but on a few specimens are formed by cortex. Stratigraphic evidence from site 41FT193 suggests that specimens in this category may date somewhat later than the larger Gary form. Godley (2 specimens; Figure 7-21). These specimens are distinguished by their relatively short, slightly expanding stems with convex bases and their rather narrow triangular blades with weakly developed shoulders.

This specimen has a broad triangular blade with long, barbed shoulders. It has a rather short expanding stem with a slightly convex base. Palmillas (2 specimens). The distal portion of the blade is missing from both of these specimens. The blade shoulders are prominent, but not barbed. The stems are bulbous with rounded bases. Pedernales (2 specimens). These specimens have triangular blades with prominent shoulders. The stem edges are roughly parallel and the bases are deeply notched. Wells (3 specimens; Figure 7-3b). These specimens exhibit very long and relatively narrow contracting stems, the lateral edges of which have been ground smooth. One specimen is missing its distal tip and has serrated blade edges. The blade of another specimen has been reworked extensively and is beveled. Blade shoulders are weakly developed on all specimens. Yarbrough (11 specimens; Figure 7-3c,d). These specimens are characterized by their moderately long expanding stems. Blade shoulders vary from prominent to weakly developed. Six of these specimens have straight bases and five have concave bases. Untyped, Contracting Stem (4 specimens). Untyped, Straight Stem (29 specimens).

BIFACES Finished Bifaces Gouge (2 specimens), Both specimens have prominent, steeply chipped bits and are roughly triangular in plan view. The bits themselves were formed with unifacial flaking, but the other edges of both specimens are bifacially worked. Each specimen is approximately 5 cm long, with a maximum width of about 3.5 cm at the bit end. Drill (20 specimens). These specimens are all narrow, bifacially worked blade portions of broken tools. All are considerably larger than the blade portions of specimens in the drill/awl category described below. DriiliAwl (14 specimens; Figure 7-3f,g). These specimens are characterized by their long, very narrow and thin, bifacially worked blades. The bases on 10 of these specimens are the unworked, proximal portions of the flakes from which the tools were made. The other four specimens have bifacially worked bases with stems for hafting. Bristol Biface (49 specimens; Figure 7-3h,i). These bifacially worked artifacts are circular or subcircular in outline with relatively straight (i-e., nonsinuous) edges. This artifact category was originally defined by Duffield (1963:43-44). Knife (42 specimens; Figure 7-4a-c). These specimens are characterized by the presence of at least one straight blade edge

Bifacial tools from Bird Point Island: (a-c) Knife, (d) Aborted biface, early stage, (e) Aborted biface, late stage. formed by fine, secondary retouch. Outline morphology is highly variable, including triangular, subtriangular, leaf shaped, and oval specimens. Aborted Bifaces Aborted bifaces are bifacially worked artifacts that appear to have been rejected at some stage in the biface production process. These have been divided into early and late stage subcategories, depending upon the amount of bifacial reduction accomplished prior to discard. Arrow point preforms are aborted bifaces which are differentiated primarily on the basis of their small size. Fragments which may represent aborted bifaces, but are not sufficiently complete for confident classification, are included in the indeterminate biface fragment category. Early Stage (134 specimens; Figure 7-4d). These specimens tend to be thick and somewhat irregular in outline, with sinuous edges formed by the removal of large flakes. Most specimens retain at least one area of nodular cortex. Some specimens retain cortex on both faces and appear to represent aborted attempts at bifacial reduction of relatively flat cobbles. Others appear to have been reduced from large, thick, primary flakes. Although some of these specimens may have been used as cutting or chopping tools, their unfinished appearance has led to their classification as rejects from an early stage in the biface production process. Late Stage (87 specimens; Figure 7-4e). The edges of these specimens are less sinuous than those in the Early Stage subcategory, but they lack fine secondary retouch. Some specimens retain minor amounts of cortex or have an area of step fracturing on one face. Outlines are variable and include oval, leaf shaped, subtriangular, and subrectangular. Again, some of these specimens could have been used as cutting tools. Arrow Point Preforms (32 specimens). These specimens are all made on smail flakes and are generally subtriangular in outline. Their edges have been shaped by varying amounts of bifacial and unifacial retouch, and they lack evidence of basal modification for hafting. The proximal ends of some specimens retain portions of the original striking platform of the flake. Biface Fragments Possible Projectile Point Tip Fragments (192 specimens). These are pointed distal fragments of bifacially worked artifacts whose size and configurations suggest that they are the broken tips of projectile points. One hundred and four are of arrow point size, and 88 are of dart point size. Possible Projectile Point Base Fragments (114 specimens). These specimens appear to be the proximal ends of stemmed projectile points. Twenty-nine are of arrow point size, and 85 are of dart point size.

100 Possible Projectile Point Medial Fragments (40 specimens). The size and morphology of these fragmentary specimens suggest that they may be medial blade sections of projectile points. Thirty-one are of arrow point size, and nine are of dart point size. Indeterminate Fragments (744 specimens). These are broken specimens with at least one edge showing evidence of bifacial chipping. They are too fragmentary to be confidently assigned to any of the above bifacial tool categories. UNIFACES Steeply Chipped Unifaces Artifacts included in this category possess the following characteristics: (1) a zone of regular retouching rather than a more random pattern of flake scars; (2) two or more rows of overlapping (stepped) flake scars along the working edge; and (3) a working edge angle of greater than 60 degrees. Gossett Gouge (4 specimens). These specimens were made from rather flat quartzite nodules, and all have straight, steeply chipped bits at one end. The flat ventral surfaces of all specimens retain their nodular cortex, and all but one specimen retain cortex on their upper surfaces as well. This artifact category was originally defined by Story (1965:208-210). End Scraper (25 specimens; Figure 7-5a). These specimens are relatively thick flakes with steep, stepped retouch along either the distal or proximal end. Some specimens also exhibit retouch along one or both lateral edges. Side Scraper (40 specimens; Figure 7-5b). These specimens are all relatively thick flakes or broken flakes that exhibit steeply chipped retouch along one or both lateral edges. Scraper with Graver Spur (6 specimens). These specimens are all side scrapers with one or more pointed tips (graver spurs) along the steeply chipped edge. Spokeshave (12 specimens). Each of these specimens possesses at least one concave edge that was formed by steeply retouching the lateral edge of a relatively thick flake. Scraper on Tabular Piece of Silicified Wood (94 specimens; Figure 7-5c). These specimens are identical to Johnson's (1962:189) Mineola end scrapers. They are thin slabs of silicified wood on which unifacial flaking of one end has produced a steep bit. Some of the specimens also exhibit unifacial retouch along one or both lateral edges. Marginally Modified Uniface Artifacts included in this category are characterized by: (1) a relatively acute angled working edge formed by a single, nonstepped row of flake scars; and (2) relatively small, retouch flake scars (all are less than 2 mm in width; most are less than | mm). Graver (72 specimens; Figure 7-5d). These specimens are small, thin flakes on which regularly patterned edge retouch has produced one or more pointed tips. Some of these are composite tools that also possess concave, straight, or convex marginally modified edges. Denticulate (8 specimens). These are small flakes on which one lateral edge has been unifacially retouched to form a series of three or more regularly spaced, pointed tips.

Unifacial tools from Bird Point Island: (a) End scraper, (b) Side scraper, (c) Scraper on silicified wood , (d) Graver, (e) Concave working edge. Burin (2 specimens). Both specimens were made on thick chert flakes. The burin tips were formed by the removal of part of the original flake edge. The tips exhibit small step fractures, perhaps caused by use. Concave Working Edge or Notch (197 specimens; Figure 7-5e). Regularly patterned retouch along the edges of these specimens has produced one or more concave notches. Straight to Convex Working Edge (1568 specimens). These are flakes, broken flakes and similar pieces of lithic material which exhibit a series of small, retouch flake scars along one or more straight or convex edge. In some cases this retouch is evidenced by zones of regularly patterned flake scars, but on most specimens the flake scars have a more random appearance. MISCELLANEOUS ARTIFACTS Cores A core is defined as a nodular or tabular piece of lithic material from which flakes have been intentionally removed. Within this

id ck of S, se 3). ial or St his Lithic Artifacts category, the specimens have been subdivided according to the amount and pattern of reduction that had occurred prior to discard. Split or Tested Nodule (151 specimens). These are pebbles or cobbles of knappable lithic material with one or very few flakes removed. They may represent discards from an early, material selection stage of the core reduction process or, in some cases, materials that were cached in anticipation of future need. Freehand Percussion Core. These are relatively large pieces of lithic material from which a series of flakes has been detached. The recovered specimens indicate that a variety of reduction strategies was used. They have been subdivided on the basis of the nature and positioning of their striking platforms. Bifacial Platform (20 specimens). Flakes were removed bifacially from one or more edges, but with no apparent attempt to thin the parent nodule. Cortex Platform. The platform is actually the cortex covered surface of the nodule. These specimens are further subdivided according to the number and position of the platforms. Single Platform (19 specimens). These specimens have a single cortex platform at one end, Double Platform (9 specimens). These specimens each have two cortex platforms which are located at opposite ends. Double Platform-90 degree (2 specimens). These specimens each have two cortex platforms located at an approximate right angle to one another. Multifaceted (192 specimens). Flakes have been removed from a number of directions without consistent platform development. - Prepared Platform (17 specimens). Platform preparation on these specimens was essentially limited to splitting the nodule. This newly created, flat surface was then used as the striking platform for further flake removal. In some cases, a few additional flakes were removed from the platform surface itself, apparently for purposes of rejuvenation. Small, Bidirectional Core (11 specimens). These are small chert pebbles with a series of flakes removed from opposite ends. They are similar to specimens which have been termed “bipolar cores" and characterized as resulting from reduction by a hammer-and-anvil technique (Mallouf 1976:157; Shafer 1973). Core Fragment (222 specimens). These specimens are portions of cores that are too fragmentary for further classification. Ground, Pecked, and Battered Stone Hammerstone (136 specimens). These specimens are lithic nodules (generally quartzite) that exhibit evidence of battering on one or more ends or edges. Mano (20 specimens). These are ovate shaped nodules of sandstone or quartzite with one or more noticeably smoothed surfaces. Grinding Slab (19 specimens). These are large, thick slabs (generally sandstone) which have been ground smooth on one or more surfaces. The smooth surfaces are flat on most specimens but are slightly basin shaped on two specimens. The edges of some specimens have been shaped by battering and pecking. 0 5 Leclbael bed 6 CM Figure 7-6. Ground stone tools from Bird Point Island: (a,b) Pitted stones, (c) Waco Sinker. Pitted Stone (10 specimens; Figure 7-6a,b). These specimens are similar to grinding slabs except that they are smaller and exhibit one or more small depressions or pits which have been pecked into a ground surface. Waco Sinker (4 specimens; Figure 7-6c). These are small, oval quartzite pebbles whose ends exhibit well-defined notches, These notches were formed by pecking and grinding. This artifact category was originally defined by Watt (1938). Abrader (9 specimens). These specimens are pieces of sandstone that display one or more linear grooves on a relatively flat surface. Ground Stone Fragments (11 specimens). These specimens have at least one ground surface, but are too fragmentary for further classification. ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS In order to examine possible spatial variation in lithic artifact assemblage composition, five of the spatial areas defined in Chapter 1 have been employed: North, House 1, North Midden, South Midden, and South (see Figure 1-1). The tabulated assemblages for these areas include only those artifacts recovered

102 from excavation of the A horizon. The lithic artifacts recovered from the fill of features and from Feature 1 are tabulated separately (Table 7-1 and 7-2). The artifacts tabulated for the North area do not include those recovered from the block excavation of House 1. The House 1 assemblage is tabulated separately. In addition, four subareas (A through D) were defined within the North area (Figure 7-7). These subareas correspond to the locations of higher density clusters of lithic debris. Because these clusters were reasonably discrete and showed spatial relationships with house patterns, it was thought that they might represent the locations of separate activity areas of lithic tool manufacture and use. The artifact counts for these subareas are also presented in Table 7-1. The provenience units represented by the columns in Table 7-1 provide a series of lithic artifact assemblages that can be compared to one another. The following discussion of these data is essentially an attempt to identify similarities and differences between these assemblages. As discussed in Chapters 12 through 14, the spatial divisions of the site have chronological integrity, and it should be possible, therefore, to elucidate changes in lithic tool use through time by examining these divisions. The projectile points are of particular interest because they are thought to be the most temporally sensitive of the lithic artifact categories. The best temporal contexts are provided by the stratigraphic zones within Feature: 1, the large pit at the site (see Chapter 6). Zone 3, the earliest zone, contained only dart points (Table 7-3). The ratio of arrow points to dart points increases through time from about 1:4 in Zone 2 to about 5:1 in Zone 1. The recovery of dart points from Zone 1, even in relatively minor proportions, is somewhat surprising. Radiocarbon dates from this zone are all later than A.D. 1200, a time when it is generally thought that dart points had been replaced entirely by arrow points. Although some mixing of materials between zones may have occurred through both cultural and natural processes, other evidence indicates the contemporaneous use of both dart and arrow points during the Late Prehistoric period. The range and frequency of projectile point types from excavations outside of Feature 1 show several important chronological characteristics. The proportions of dart points relative to arrow points are noticeably higher in the North area, and arrow points generally increase in relative frequency from north to south (Table 7-1). The highest relative proportions of dart points recovered from the A horizon excavations are among the areas encompassing the three house patterns (House 1, and subareas A and C). Although some of these dart points are probably attributable to Archaic period occupations, their distribution suggests that many of them are indeed associated with the A.D. 1000-1200 period village occupation. The higher proportions of arrow points from the Midden areas (both north and south parts) and the South area suggest that the assemblages from these areas contain a greater representation of materials associated with the A.D. 1300-1650 period of site occupation. Table 7-4 presents a typological classification of the dart points from the five horizontal subdivisions of the site. Those from A horizon and feature excavations are tabulated separately. It is noted that dart point types assignable to the Early and Middle Archaic, such as Angostura, Bulverde, Marshall, Pedernales, and Yarbrough, are relatively rare and indicate that Archaic occupation was sporadic and ephemeral. The most common dart point type is Gary (regular variety), a type with poor chronological specificity which appears to have been used into the Late Prehistoric period. Within both the North and Midden areas, Gary points account for a similar percentage of all dart points. In each area the small variety of Gary is the second most frequent dart point style. In the South area samples are small, but Gary also accounts for the majority of all dart points. Although arrow points are present in all parts of the site (Table 7-5), the ratio of arrow points to dart points shows that arrow points increase in relative frequency from north to south. Within the arrow point assemblages, a pattern of increasing relative frequency of Perdiz points from the northern to the southern Volume II, Part One 120N 40N -20N 60E PIECES OF LITHIC DEBRIS [] 0-20 21 - 28 29 - 48 Figure 7-7. Locations of lithic analysis subareas within the North area. portion of the site is evident also. Based on the published temporal placement of Perdiz points (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Prewitt 1981), this suggests that a later occupation which produced arrow points is better represented in the southern part of the site, whereas an earlier arrow-point-producing occupation was located primarily in the North and Midden areas. Dart points may have been used during both of these occupations, but appear to have been more common during the first. Evidence for the concurrent use of dart and arrow points is implied by their association in the block excavations over House 1. Because the SYMAPs showed higher densities of artifacts in this location, it is assumed that most of these artifacts resulted from the occupation of House 1. Consequently, the relative frequencies of arrow to dart points may be a reasonable indicator of the ratio in use during the occupation of House 1. A total of 23 arrow points and 27 dart points was recovered from the A horizon excavations, for an arrow to dart point ratio of .85:1. This is virtually identical to the ratio from A horizon excavations in the remainder of the North area of the site (.84:1). Perhaps the most anomalous aspect of the projectile point distribution is the consistent association of dart points with features. The relative proportions of dart points from feature excavations are consistently higher than the proportions from the A horizon excavations (Tables 7-4 and 7-5). This is the case regardless of the type of feature and regardless of the feature's horizontal location. The implication of this pattern is that dart points were being used more frequently in whatever activities were associated with these features. Only two of the 24 features containing projectile points had more arrow points that dart points. These are Feature 89 ( 2 arrow, | dart) and Feature 101 (4 arrow, 1 dart). Both features are located in the South Midden area and are thought to date to the A.D. 1300 to 1650 component. The most consistent occurrence of dart points was within the large features that have been interpreted as roasting pits (Features 34, 35, 36, 38 and 45), All 57 of the projectile points recovered from the fill of these features were dart points. When this

However, a radiocarbon sample from Feature 38 was dated to A.D. 1120 + 120, even though all 17 of the projectile points recovered from this feature were dart points. This is further evidence that dart points were still in use during the Late Prehistoric period. We turn now to the comparison of assemblage composition. For statistical comparisons the chipped stone artifact categories in Table 7-1 have been combined into the more inclusive groupings shown in Table 7-6. This was necessary in order to obtain cell frequencies that were large enough for Chi-square analysis. Chi-square tests were performed for all possible combinations of the assemblages presented in Table 7-6. The Chi-square statistic was used to test the hypothesis of homogeneity between pairs of assemblages. This hypothesis was rejected when the relative frequencies of specimens in at least some of the artifact categories showed significant differences between two assemblages. The results of the Chi-square tests are summarized in Tables 7-7 and 7- 8. The .05 level of significance was used in testing the hypothesis of assemblage homogeneity. 7 5 1 4 10 2 8 2 8 #1 3 1 2 1 6 1 1 3 i 2 1 1 1 6 5 2 2 1 1 1 3 1 1 t 2 1 2 3 2 { 3 4 i t 1 161 1 1 i 3.2 ~=«3 1 1 6 ig 9 12 4 2 21 °5 11 1 to1 1 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 I 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 21 = =3 201 18 55 14 25 6 12 16 23 2: | 2 9 1 1 3 1 1 110 6 6 1 1 $i 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 1 3 1 2 2 1! 1 i 2 1 When the four major site areas are compared, significant differences are found between the North area and both the North Midden (p <.0001} and South Midden (p = .0006). The two Midden areas are not significantly different from each other in terms of their chipped stone artifact assemblages (p = .1287). The South area assemblage is not significantly different from any of the other three. Referring back to Table 7-6, it can be seen that the most outstanding differences between the North area and the Midden areas can be attributed to the lower proportion of biface fragments and the higher proportions of unifacial tools in the North area assemblage. High percentages of marginally modified unifaces are characteristic of all four subareas (A through D) within the North Area. High percentages of steeply chipped unifaces occur only in subareas A and C which encompass the three house patterns. The steeply chipped uniface percentage is even higher in the assemblage from the House 1 block excavation, so it appears to be characteristic of the village component. If we combine the assemblages from features interpreted to be roasting pits in Chapter 4, a significantly different artifact

The uniqueness of this assemblage is due primarily to its relatively high percentages of cores and steeply chipped unifaces and relatively low percentage of biface fragments. These roasting pit features are also unique in that they contained substantial numbers of dart points, but no arrow points. The assemblage from the House 1 block excavations is also significantly different from those of all other proveniences. Table 7-8 shows that House 1 differs not only from the North area in general, but from each of its four subareas. The House 1 assemblage contains the highest percentages of both finished and aborted bifaces, as well as the lowest percentage of marginally modified unifaces. As mentioned above, the percentage of steeply chipped unifaces is also relatively high in this assemblage. Chapter 13 includes a discussion of the spatial distributions of various artifact classes within the House 1 block excavation area. Referring to Figure 13-15 in that chapter, it can be seen that bifaces exhibit three high-density clusters. Two of these clusters are inside the house, just outside the central hearth. The third cluster is outside the house, approximately 2 m to the north. This biface density map (see Figure 13-15) includes artifacts in the finished biface, aborted biface, and indeterminate biface fragment categories. The clusters within the house are composed primarily of aborted bifaces and, to a lesser extent, biface fragments. The outside cluster is composed of finished bifaces and biface fragments. The two interior clusters correspond to the locations of the two highest density clusters of lithic debris (see Figure 13-14). The spatial association of the aborted bifaces with the lithic debris suggests that both are related to biface production activities that occurred within House 1. In Table 7-9, the chipped stone artifact assemblage from the House 1 block excavation is divided into two subsets: artifacts recovered from excavation units located strictly within the house 105 versus those from outside. It can be seen that the percentage of aborted bifaces is about twice as high inside the house as compared to outside. Projectile points also occur with greater relative frequency inside the house. On the other hand, the percentage of marginally modified unifaces from inside the house is considerably lower than from outside. In general, these same differences are also found when the assemblage from inside the house is compared to those from each of the four subareas (A through D in Table 7-6). Houses 2 and 3 were located within subareas A and C, respectively, but very few of the systematically placed 50 x 50 cm units and none of the 1 x 1 m units actually sampled the interiors of these structures. Because of this, almost all of the artifacts in the subarea assemblages were recovered from outside of the house structures. Therefore, any consistent differences between the subarea assemblages and the assemblage from inside House 1 could be indicative of basic differences in the activities conducted outside versus inside of houses. The percentage of aborted bifaces within House 1 is higher than that of all subareas except B. However, the total chipped stone . artifact sample from subarea B (68 specimens) is small, and may not be representative. Although biface production, as indicated by the presence of aborted bifaces, appears to have taken place in all areas of the site, it is represented to a relatively greater degree inside House 1. The percentage of projectile points is also highest inside House 1. This does not necessarily indicate that projectile points were used more often inside houses than outside. Because projectile point production required a considerable investment of labor, they were probably curated more often than many other categories of lithic artifact. The higher percentage of projectile points within the house may reflect the fact that they were kept there in anticipation of future use. All of the subarea assemblages contain marginally modified unifaces in about twice the percentage as that of the assemblage from inside House 1. Many of these flake tools were probably retouched through use or with only a minor investment of labor. In this sense they represent expediently produced tools with relatively short use lives, and were probably not curated to any significant degree. In this case, the greater relative frequencies of these tools in the assemblages from outside the house structure most likely indicate their having been used more frequently in that context. SUMMARY UF ARTIFACT SPATIAL PATTERNING The recovered artifacts and radiocarbon dates suggest that Bird Point Island was a site of substantial prehistoric activity over a span of at least 1800 years (ca. 170 B.C, to A.D. 1650). The Archaic period dart point styles (e.g., Angostura, Bulverde, Palmillas, Pedernales, Wells, Yarbrough) indicate at least intermittent occupation for several thousand years before this. There are certain problems in defining and interpreting artifact patterning at an intensively occupied, multicomponent site like Bird Point Island, Patterns in the material remains of each component can become masked if the locations of earlier and later occupations tend to overlap spatially. Some of the differences recognized in the intrasite distribution of projectile point styles are very likely due to temporal changes in the locations favored for occupation. Although no particular area of the site appears to contain the remains of a single, unmixed component, differences in the ratios of arrow points to dart points indicate that the primary spatial focus of occupation changed over time. Along with the point style variation, other differences in assemblage composition have been demonstrated for certain proveniences within the site. It is not clear whether these differences in the relative proportions of artifact types are due to temporal or functional factors, but some tentative interpretations are offered as part of the following discussion.

Aside from the similarities in arrow to dart point ratios, the only consistent assemblage characteristic shared by the areas encompassing the three house patterns (House 1, and subareas A and C) is a relatively high percentage of steeply chipped unifaces. Relatively high percentages of marginally modified unifaces are shared by all of the North area assemblages except House 1. The high percentages of both finished and aborted bifaces are peculiar to House 1, and it has been shown that the aborted bifaces are likely to be the result of biface production activities that occurred inside this house structure. Jy? statistic with 6 degrees of freedom 2p-value (level of significance) The lithic artifact assemblages from the North Midden and South Midden areas are quite similar in composition. The higher ratios of arrow points to dart points (both approximately 2:1) indicate that these areas contain a greater representation of materials associated with the A.D. 1300 to 1650 period of site occupation. The only other exceptional aspect of the Midden area assemblages is the relatively high percentages of biface fragments, This is difficult to interpret unless this area served as a location where broken tools were discarded, or where significantly more bifacial tool use, breakage, and abandonment occurred. The representation of post-A.D. 1300 materials may increase even more in the South area assemblage. Here the ratio of arrow points to dart points is 4.3:1, although the sample size is relatively small. The South areas assemblage was not found to be significantly different from those of the other three areas (North,

However, it is not certain that the rather small artifact sample from this portion of the site is truly representative. Complicating the temporal interpretations of projectile point style offered thus far is evidence suggesting that there may be a functional determinant of projectile point morphology. This seems to be the best explanation for the predominance of dart points within the roasting pits and other features, even though many of Volume II, Part One these features have been radiocarbon dated to the Late Prehistoric period (see Chapter 12), While the roasting pits are most likely related to the A.D. 1000 to 1200 village occupation, the chipped stone artifacts recovered from their fill show significant differences from those of all other proveniences. In Chapter 9 it is argued that these large pits were used for roasting plant foods such as nuts, acorns, and Psoralea tubers. It is thought that the more frequent occurrence of certain artifact types (dart points, steeply chipped unifaces, and cores) could be related to the processing of these foods. It is possible that any artifact with a sharp edge, whether it was a formal tool or not, was employed in the removal of the shell of nuts or the skin of the Psoralea tuber. TECHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS The present analysis of the lithic artifacts from Bird Point Island views these materials only in terms of their morphology. These same artifacts can also provide information about the lithic reduction technologies employed in their production. In Volume IJ, Chapter 17, a sample of the chipped stone artifacts and lithic debris from several sites at Richland/Chambers Reservoir is analyzed from a technological perspective. The assemblage from the House 1 block excavation at Bird Point Island is included in | that analysis. The objective of the technological analysis is to define assemblage-specific reduction strategies and to compare these between sites of different time periods. This is accomplished with a detailed attribute analysis of both the unmodified lithic debris and the secondarily modified chipped stone artifacts. The methods and results of the technological analysis are presented in Chapter 17 of Volume III.

t4 ic rt G re of , al CERAMIC ARTIFACTS by James E. Bruseth with a contribution by Marilee Irvine From the excavations conducted at Bird Point Island over five field seasons, more than a quarter of a million artifacts have been uncovered. Despite this large sample, ceramics account for less than 2% of the total. This rarity is not uncommon for the reservoir, or for much of Central and North Central Texas for that matter, but it is in marked contrast to Caddoan sites to the east where ceramics can account for more than 90% of the overall artifact assemblage (Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Anderson et al. 1974). A total of 4967 sherds was found at the site, but only 4305 of these are discussed in this chapter. This reduction in number is due to the fact that 662 sherds lacked specific provenience, since they were collected from bulidozed or otherwise disturbed contexts. In addition, 11 sherds that are parts of pipes are described in a separate section of this chapter. The approach that we have chosen to use in analyzing the sherds from the site centers on the examination of several attributes in order to accomplish three basic objectives. The first and primary objective is to satisfactorily describe the ceramic sample from the site as a means of communication to others, Although the sherd sample is small, it is nonetheless important, since the large scale excavations conducted at the site place the ceramics into a well- documented cultural framework for North Central Texas archaeology. The second objective is to develop a refined framework of site chronology that can be used to date features and other contexts at the site which otherwise lack temporally diagnostic artifacts or radiocarbon samples. The additive nature of ceramic decoration (Deetz 1969) lends itself to detailed temporal tefinement, and this potential is investigated in this chapter. The final objective of the ceramic analysis is to determine if the sherds are from locally manufactured vessels or are the result of long- distance exchange. Based on the low frequency of sherds at sites in the area, it was initially hypothesized that trade was the principal means of acquisition of ceramic vessels. Several approaches are potentially available to deal with the stated objectives, depending on the theoretical orientation of research that is adopted. The type-variety system of classification, such as is used in the Lower Mississippi Valley, has been successfully employed to develop a refined ceramic chronology for Caddoan archaeology along the Great Bend of the Red River (Schambach and Miller 1984), and certainly has merit over simple “type-only" systems (e.g., Suhm and Jelks 1962). It has been suggested, however, that the type-variety system is only sufficient when attribute coassociations are used to define types (Brown 1971:1-5). While this approach would result in types that have some cultural validity, it necessitates that adequate samples of sherds are available and that these sherds are of sufficient size to accurately define decorative motifs. Unfortunately, the Bird Point Island sherds are small in size, with most measuring less than 5 cm in maximum diameter, making such an approach impractical. Another analytical approach for ceramic analysis is to utilize a classificatory system which divides ceramics initially by decoration or paste characteristics into groups, and then examines the variability among other attributes within each group (Irvine 1980; Hall 1981). Although this approach allows classification of sherds which are small in size, it suffers from an inherent assumption that the hierarchy of classificatory divisions have cultural significance. Without some type of coassociational analysis, however, this assumption is unverified. Nevertheless, it might be argued that the approach still provides a convenient framework for subdividing ceramic variability into smaller and more manageable subsets for description and information dissemination. However, if the classification fails to provide cultural insight, it is on the level of providing cultural lists and not offering explanations of cultural behavior (Brown 1971:1). Consequently, an attribute analysis approach is used in this chapter and is seen as the optimum type of ceramic analysis for the Bird Point Island sherd collection.

110 disseminate this data to others. A part of this descriptive responsibility is to compare the ceramics from Bird Point Island to existing type descriptions in an effort to show similarities to ceramics from other regions and to indicate possible directions and degrees of cultural affinity. ATTRIBUTES USED FOR ANALYSIS The attributes used in the Richland Creek Archaeological Project ceramic analysis fall into three groups: vessel form, ceramic manufacturing, and exterior decoration. Each is discussed below. VARIABLES RELATED TO VESSEL FORM The first group of attributes for ceramic analysis includes four variables that describe various characteristics of vessel form. These variables are (1) location of the sherd on the complete vessel, (2) lip form, (3) rim orientation, and (4) sherd thickness. Each is described in detail below, and should provide a means of describing the sherd assemblage and of examining possible chronological relationships that these variables might have. All of them have been found to have chronological variability at other ceramic sites (Brown 1971; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Hargrave 1982). Sherd location was divided into three attributes: whether a sherd was part of the rim, part of the body, or part of the base. Mention should be made that the base category cannot be consistently observed and therefore is not a reliable indicator of the presence of this vessel part. That is, bases from flat-bottomed vessels are often easy to recognize, whereas bases from round- bottomed vessels are more difficult. This difficulty is increased when the curvature of the base of round-bottomed vessels is similar to that of the walls. Moreover, the small size of the sherds from the Bird Point sample further increases the difficulty of recognizing bases. A major goal of this variable was to obtain information on the types of vessel forms represented in the sherd assemblage. Since vessel form could be directly observed on only a very smail number of sherds because of the small size of individual ceramics, it was hoped that this procedure might provide insight on the range of vessel forms used over time. Specifically, the relative frequencies of body to rim sherds provide an indicator of the overall range of vessel forms, albeit at a much grosser level than direct form observation (cf., Schambach 1970:294-298). For instance, a large number of body sherds relative to rim sherds would indicate a predominance of restricted orifice vessels, deep- bodied vessels, or a combination of the two. Conversely, a high incidence of rim sherds relative to body sherds would imply unrestricted orifice vessels, shallow body vessels, or some combination. The former might indicate more storage forms, such as jars and bottles, while the latter might indicate food preparation and eating utensils. Rim orientation was selected to further examine the forms of vessels, and specifically, to help determine if more or less restricted orifice vessels exist in a given sample. The attributes observed under this variable were straight (i.e., vertical), everted (i.e., inclining outward), and inverted (i.e., inclining inward). An additional variable used to describe vessel form was lip form, or examination of the cross section of the terminal margin of the vessel orifice (Brown 1971:120). Five categories were defined (see Table 8-3). The reason for inclusion of this variable is based on the tendency of established ceramic types to show a greater incidence of flattened or rounded lips during the Early Caddo period and a greater incidence of rolled lips in the Late Caddo period of East Texas (Suhm et al. 1954). Since most of the decorated ceramics from Bird Point Island show similarity to Caddoan types, it was anticipated that temporal change in this attribute might also be found at Bird Point Island. Volume II, Part One The final variable used was sherd thickness. This refers to the average thickness in millimeters of each sherd. This variable was included primarily as a means of increasing the level of description of the ceramic assemblage from Bird Point Island. VARIABLES RELATED TO CERAMIC MANUFACTURING Included within this group are several observations which pertain to the manufacturing environment of the ceramics. These variables are sherd temper, color, and petrographic constituents. Sherd tempers were selected to cover the observed range of nonplastic additives to the clay. However, in some instances it is not clear if certain tempers were originally part of the clay or clearly an additive, such as was occasionally the case with sand. Some of the clays in the vicinity are actually sandy clays and this material could have unintentionally been selected. At the same time, however, some sherds contained considerable quantities of sand and are quite clearly intentionally tempered wares; we refer to this temper as sandy paste. Tempers were megascopically identified unless there was a question, in which case microscopic examination was made. The predominant tempering agents were grog, sand (grit), bone, and shell. In some sherds no temper was visible, and these were identified as such. Sherd colors were identified according to a Munsell color chart to provide a consistent means of identification. All readings were taken under fluorescent light. The exterior, interior, and core colors were identified on a 10% sample of all ceramics from the site. A sampling procedure was employed since. the primary purpose of the technique was to communicate the range of sherd colors to other workers. However, there are some manufacturing interpretations that can be drawn from this variable. Shepard (1971:105) notes that there are two determinants of sherd color: clay source variability and firing environment. Generally lighter colors such as creams, yellows, oranges, and reds can be inferred to represent oxidized firing environments, whereas darker colors such as browns, grays, and black can be due to either reduced firing environments or clay sources (Shepard 1971:105). Thus, some indication of change or stability in clay sources and in firing environments over time can be obtained from this variable. A secondary objective of using sherd color was to help determine if the ceramics from the site were manufactured locally or were trade wares. It was reasoned that if all ceramics had been manufactured locally, similar firing techniques would likely have been employed and have resulted in a similar range of colors. On the other hand, if ceramics were being traded, then color variations representing different clay sources should be apparent when compared over time. This analysis assumes that vessels did not consistently originate from the same source over time, a situation that seems unlikely. The final variable of this grouping involved the identification of the minerological constituents through thin-sectioning and petrographic analysis of a sample of sherds to observe clay composition and to quantitatively approach the problem of ceramic exchange. A trial study of ceramic thin-sectioning and petrographic analysis was conducted during the survey and testing phase of the Project with encouraging results (Irvine 1982a), and further examination was considered necessary to resolve the question of ceramic exchange. Although this issue has not been completely put to rest, reasonable conclusions based on this analysis can now be made. VARIABLES OF DECORATION The final grouping of ceramic variables that have been used to analyze the Bird Point Island ceramic collection consists of those which pertain to vessel decoration. The first is decoration method, and refers to the manner in which ceramic designs were executed on the exterior of the vessel. The specific attributes observed were

In addition, decoration element configurations (Braun 1977:178) were noted for the assemblage; these refer to the combination and orientation of specific decorative elements. This is not to be confused with decorative elements alone, which refer to basic, irreducible parts of a design, such as a tool punctation or an incised line (Shepard 1971:266). A total of 13 element configurations was recorded (see Table 8-9). This variable was only recorded when a sherd was large enough for secure identification of a given element configuration, and a sample size of at least two sherds was required to define an element configuration. This resulted in several decorated sherds not being classified. _ RESULTS The ceramics were analyzed over five different field seasons during concurrent laboratory sessions. The ceramic analysis changed over time, becoming more refined, and earlier materials were reanalyzed to provide comparability with later changes. To maintain comparability from season to season, laboratory personnel were instructed by a person familiar with the procedure and coding system from the previous laboratory session. All attributes were entered onto computer coding forms for transfer to magnetic disk and final computer analysis. The presentation of the results is made with respect to the five spatial divisions of the site. These spatial areas, defined in Chapter 1 and displayed in Figure 1-1, are: North, House 1, North Midden, South Midden, and South. As outlined in Chapter 12, several periods of occupation are represented at the site and at least two of these produced ceramic artifacts. Chapter 13 presents data on the spatial distributions of each occupation and demonstrates that considerable spatial integrity of different temporal components exists at the site. Consequently, the ceramic data are analyzed according to spatial clusterings of ceramic artifacts in order to facilitate one of the goals of the overall analysis, namely refined ceramic chronology. In addition to the spatial divisions of the site, vertical division of the ceramic data is also employed. The above mentioned areas of the site only include ceramics from excavations into the A horizon. As outlined in Chapter 2, the A horizon is a sandy loam topsoil that has received extensive disturbance from various types of natural and cultural agents. In fact, most artifacts were originally dropped on a stable surface and have been worked into the soil by this activity (see Chapter 2). Subsurface features, in contrast, are less disturbed. They have been dug from the surface into the B horizon, and, where they have penetrated this zone, remain in relatively good condition. These contexts are "time capsules” of cultural behavior at the site and, consequently, have received separate consideration in this chapter. One last comment conceming the ceramic results is called for: the number of sherds used for analysis changes from variable to variable. This is because all attributes could not be observed on all sherds. For instance, even though a rim sherd could be identified as such, its lip form may not have been reliably discriminated if the sherd was very small and only a part of the lip was present. NON-FEATURE RESULTS VARIABLES OF VESSEL FORM Table 8-1 presents the results of analysis of the first variable in this grouping: sherd location on the complete vessel. The results are shown by the five spatial divisions of the site and by the variable categories of body, rim, and base. A base category has been included in the table, although as outlined earlier this observation cannot be consistently nor reliably made. Therefore, the frequencies of bases given in Table 8-1 should be viewed as minimal representations. ill Table 8-1 SHERD LOCATION BY SITE AREA North South North House 1 Midden Midden South (%) (%) (%) %) (%) Body 90.5 96.3 93.4 93.5 94.2 Rim 8.2 3.4 5.8 6.1 5.0 Base 1.3 3 6 7 38 Sample Size 539 324 986 1,764 483 All provenienced sherds from the site, excluding those from Feature 1, are included in the table. The results show that body sherds are clearly the most dominant type, as would be expected for any ceramic assemblage. This category ranges between 90% and 96% of all sherds. As argued earlier in this chapter, the relative frequency of body to rim sherds (with bases and body sherds collapsed) gives a rough indication of the vessel forms represented in the ceramic assemblage. The assumption behind this ratio is that vessels with restricted orifices and/or deep bodies will break into a large number of body sherds relative to rim sherds. Such vessel types are inferred to reflect storage forms. In contrast, large orifice vessels and/or shallow bodied forms will break into a lower frequency of body sherds relative to rim sherds. These forms are thought to reflect more short term activities such as food preparation or food consumption. It must be pointed out that one vessel form group is not expected to be found to the exclusion of the other; some degree of mixture will no doubt be observed. What is of importance is the relative mix of restricted orifice to unrestricted orifice vessels and how this varies from one occupation of the site to another. The results of this analysis, as presented in Table 8-1, support limited changes in the uses of vessel forms between areas at the site. The highest frequency of body sherds to rims occurs within House 1. We interpret the higher incidence of body sherds from this area to suggest that ceramic vessels were more often used for storage activities. In contrast, the frequency of body to rim sherds from the North area, outside of House 1, shows a much lower ratio, suggesting that storage was relatively less important and that other ceramic-related activities, such as the use of vessels as containers for short term uses, were dominant. Although data from inside two other houses are included within the North area, the relative contribution of the limited excavations within these structures is greatly outweighed by the excavation outside of the structures. In fact, for the purposes of our analysis, the North area may be viewed as indicating the types of activities undertaken outside of the houses, while House 1 can be used to reflect the range of activities inside the houses. The other three areas of the site, North Midden, South Midden, and South, have similar ratios of body to rim sherds. Whether this indicates that similar types of activities were conducted on all three areas or whether the assemblages are the mixtures of different occupations, cannot be determined at this time. Table 8-2 presents data on the orientation of rim sherds from the site. Again, only those sherds on which this observation could be reliably made are included. The purpose behind looking at the orientation of vessel rims is to add a further indicator of the range of vessel forms represented in the ceramic assemblages. This variable is particularly important since, as outlined above, direct observation of vessel form was not possible because of the small sherd sizes. Unfortunately, the rim orientation data are also biased by too few sherds large enough to examine for orientation. However, some statements about the ceramic assemblage overall can be made. Generally, straight rim orientations (i.e., those vertical to the plane of the orifice) are the most frequent, and everted (i.e., inclining outward) orientations are next most common. Only in the South Midden and South are inverted (i.e., inclining inward) sherds found. This may be related to a higher

Since carinated - vessels tend to be more common in the Late Caddo period of East Texas (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Bruseth and Pertuila 1981), this distribution suggests later occupations occurred in the southern areas of the site. Overall, the vessel form data (rim orientation and sherd location) indicate that restricted orifice types, such as bowls and bottles, are rare. Most vessels appear to have had straight wails with minimal orifice constriction, suggesting a dominance of jars. The next variable is the lip, with five lip profile categories presented (Table 8-3). It was hoped that lip forms would offer a means of refined chronological assessment of the ceramics, based on the findings of workers in East Texas (Bruseth and Perttula 1981:77). Unfortunately, the interpretability of the Bird Point Island data is severely limited by sample sizes from each area. Only 65 rim sherds were sufficiently intact and of adequate size so that lip forms could be reliably observed. For this reason, further observations of the lip data would be misleading, and the results should be used only to indicate the range of lip forms present in the overall ceramic assemblage. In all areas, the most common form is a rounded lip. Other forms present, in lesser frequencies include flat, bevelled, exterior rolled, and compound. Perhaps the occurrence of the exterior rolled type in the South Midden and South area is a reflection of later occupations in these parts of the site. The temporal significance of this lip form has been noted elsewhere in East Texas (Suhm and Jelks 1962). Table 8-4 displays the results of thickness measurements on a 10% sample of all sherds from each area of the site. A sampling approach was taken since only the average trends in thickness were desired, and it was felt that this could be most economically addressed by sampling. The actual sample size for each area is given in the table. All sherds were randomly selected. Although thickness is related in some degree to vessel size, with large vessel forms generally requiring thicker walls, we have included this variable primarily as a means of communicating data on the Bird Point Island ceramic collection. As the table shows, average sherd thicknesses range from 6.8 mm to 7.5 mm. Generally, thicknesses are similar among the areas, and the deviations about the means are also similar, with two exceptions. The House 1 and the South areas show slightly higher standard deviations. This is no doubt in large part due to the smaller sample sizes for these two areas. VARIABLES RELATED TO CERAMIC MANUFACTURING These variables were grouped together since they all relate in one manner or another to the manufacturing environment of ceramic vessels. The first is the tempering agents used, and these data are presented in Table 8-5. The entire sample of provenienced ceramics is used with the exception of those from Feature 1. The results indicate grog tempering is the most common in the North, and grit temper is second most common. House 1, which culturally can be viewed as a subset of the North area, shows grog to be less frequent and grog and grit temper combinations to be more frequent. This difference between these two areas is difficult to understand, since the two areas appear to represent part of the same village occupation. Volume II, Part One Table 8-3 Lip Form sy Sire AREA North South North House 1 Midden Midden South (%) (%) (%) (%) %) Flat 14.3 17.6 15.4 Rounded 80.0 85.7 76.5 65.4 90.0 Bevelled 5.9 7.6 Exterior Roiled 11.5 10.0 Compound 20.0 Sample Size 5 7 17 26 10 As with the House 1 and North areas, other parts of the site show a similar dominance of grog tempered wares. Grog and grit tempered combinations are nearly equally represented in all other areas, and considerable question is raised as to whether the grit tempering is intentional or the product of natural inclusions in the clay source. The most frequent grit is sand and the angular nature of the sand particles, as seen in the petrographic analysis presented later in this chapter, supports the conclusion of intentional inclusion. The South area shows a slight deviation from the Midden area and instead shows similarity to the North area in the overall range of tempering agents. This is confusing since other indicators, most notably projectile point styles, show that the two areas are the product of temporally distinct occupations. Perhaps the temper types are not temporally diagnostic but more a product of function. That is, the block excavations over House 1 have resulted in a sample from primarily inside the house, whereas the sample for the North area is based on excavations mostly from outside the houses. Thus, the temper differences may be showing that intra-household vessel functions required different temper agents compared to external household functions. A possible example of such a difference might be a higher incidence of ceramic.food storage inside the house and a greater frequency of food preparation outside the houses. However, in the case of shell temper, some degree of temporal relationship is also likely to be represented. Shell temper is rare from the site, and the few specimens that do occur are found only in the Midden, which is thought to be partially the product of later occupations at the site (see Chapter 12)--In addition, a Late Table 8-4 SHERD THICKNESS BY SITE AREA North South North House 1 Midden Midden South Mean (mm) 6.8 7.1 7.3 75 7.3 Standard Deviation 1.1 1.7 1.4 1.3 1.6 Sample Size' 54 33 99 176 48 110% random sample of all sherds from each area

In North Central Texas, specifically, shell temper has been identified as a trait of the temporally late Henrietta focus (Krieger 1946). However, at other sites in the reservoir, an early context for shell tempering has also been noted (see Chapter.18, this volumecand Chapter 15, Volume IID). The next variable examined to add information about ceramic manufacture is color. This variable can contribute data on the firing environment, specifically whether vessels were fired in an oxidizing or a reducing environment (Shepard 1971:105). As noted earlier, lighter colors, particularly creams, yellows, oranges, and reds, are reflective of oxidizing environments and darker colors of reducing environments. Although clay sources influence final sherd colors, lighter colors generally. indicate oxidizing environments. It was also hoped that ceramic color might be used to examine the problem of local versus non-local ceramic manufacture. This assumes that if vessels were obtained outside the Richland Creek area they would have had differing clay sources. On the other hand, similarity in colors would support local manufacture, since the same local clay sources probably would have been exploited over time. Table 8-6 displays the range of exterior sherd colors observed in the samples. Only the exterior colors are presented since these reflect the greatest variability and are thought to have the best chance of reflecting different clay sources. Interior colors tend to be darker, reflecting less complete oxidation of the clays, and are most frequently shades of brown and gray. Core colors have an even narrower range of colors and vary from shades of gray to black. The darkness of these colors represents incomplete oxidation of carbonaceous deposits. Exterior colors, in contrast, show lighter values and chromas and have probably been more completely oxidized. The data from exterior sherd colors are listed in Table 8-6 and exhibit considerable variability. Overall a similar range of colors is seen among all areas, although a few differences are noted. For instance, the North has more sherds in the SYR hue and House 1 has more sherds of a unique reddish color (10R4/6). The former may reflect sample bias, but the higher incidence of red sherds from the House 1 almost certainly relates to a single red slipped vessel that was broken inside the house. Although the pieces of this vessel could not be fitted together, the overall rarity of slipped sherds at the site and their similarity in paste argue for these sherds belonging to a single vessel. The remaining major difference in color among the areas is the high number of sherds from the South in the light yellowish brown category of the 10YR hue. None of the other areas has comparable frequencies in this color, and this suggests that the ceramics from this area may be coming from a different clay 113 source. Whether this represents a different local source or long distance importation cannot be deduced at this time. The color . range from the other parts of the site seem to indicate that similar clay sources were exploited, despite different temporal representations, and argues against long distance importation of vessels. Petrographic Analysis of Ceramics (by Marilee Irvine) The problem of local versus nonlocal manufacture of ceramics had been initially investigated prior to Season I mitigation when a petrographic analysis of thin sections of sherds recovered during testing was accomplished. The purpose of this analysis was to identify mineral inclusions in the paste in order to provide information to help in determining if the pottery was produced using local clay sources. This feasibility study was performed on eight sherds which had been selected as representative plainwares within the sample. The results were encouraging (Irvine 1982b), so it was decided to continue the analysis. Sixteen sherds from Bird Point Island were thin-sectioned for analysis. The analysis was performed using a Nikon microscope, type 115 with a UXF camera system. The sherds used in the analysis were impregnated with blue epoxy before they were cut for thin sections. This enabled the petrographer to discriminate actual void spaces (which would appear blue) from spaces where minerals had been removed during polishing (these spaces are clear). All of the thin sections were cut on the cross sections of the sherds to allow examination of the paste mixture. The significance of the combination of minerals within the clay matrix and the makeup of the sand can only be understood if there is some background information provided about the local geology and the minerals identified. The minerals that were identified in thin section are commonly associated with an igneous parent material. The presence of this material may be a result of its chemical and physical weathering. A source for this material is the sandstone bedrock (the Wilcox formation) that underlies a portion of the Project area, and outcrops at the southeast end of the reservoir. This bedrock material is highly eroded and has changed the soil to a very sandy loam. . A second source is the Pleistocene gravels known as the Uvalde gravels, which occur in the Project area and are found from eastern Texas (Bruseth and Perttula 1981) southwest into northern Mexico (Byrd 1971). These gravels were deposited in the Project area as a result of erosion and stream flow from the Llano Estacado area of the Texas Panhandle and northern New Mexico. The gravels are typically composed of waterwor pea gravel to boulder sized quartz, quartzite, chert, limestone, silicified wood, a few Cretaceous fossils, and granite. The granite is probably derived from the Llano Uplift region to the northwest (Menzer and. Slaughter 1971; Byrd 1971). There are nine minerals identified from the sample, but not every sherd contains all nine. Only one is common to all of the samples, quartz, while the others vary in their amounts. The other minerals include: quartzite clasts (which are basically recrystalized quartz), plagioclase and microcline (these are feldspars) and other types of mica, opaques (such as Fe-Ti oxides), calcite, zircon, and tourmaline (zircon and tourmaline are the only two heavy minerals present). All of these minerals are generally associated with a granitic parent material. The shape of the grains and their degree of sorting are important to determine distance from source localities. The more angular and poorly sorted the grains are the closer they are to their source, while the more rounded and well-sorted the grains are the further they are from their source. Related to this sorting effect is the breakdown and loss of certain minerals over distances. For example, the feldspars (plagioclase and microcline) break down much faster than quartz, which is probably the reason for their low percentages. The fact that the feldspars that are present appear to be fresh (angular, poorly sorted) may indicate that they have not traveled far from their source locality, or they have been

Thompson, personal communication 1981). Grain size and sorting may also help determine differences in source localities. Differences in average grain sizes may indicate that different localities were being exploited. If, for instance, the average grain size of one sherd within the sample was significantly greater than that of the other sherds, this would suggest that it represents a different source. The selected sample that was analyzed appears to be fairly homogeneous in its mineralogical make-up (Table 8-7). The sherds are quite similar in average grain size (100-150 microns). The proportions of certain minerals are also fairly consistent for all sherds as well as is the angularity of grains. The clay matrix constitutes an average of 70 to 75% of each sherd ranging from 55 to 90% within the sample. The clays are fairly homogeneous and more than 50% contain traces of hematite-rich inclusions or blebs, which are secondary inclusions within the matrix. Grog inclusions were identified as components within the matrix and were usually distinguished by a different color and their angular shape. In some instances it appears that two clays were mixed due to the differences in color, grain size, and volume. _ Quartz is the major component within the matrix averaging 20 to 25% for the sample with a range of 15 to 35%. Quartzite clasts were also detected in most of the sherds, but in a much lower percentage than the quartz grains. All of the sherds contained quartzite clasts that averaged between 4% and 5% of the total matrix. The remaining elements identified are only minor inclusions within the matrix of the sherd. Microcline is present in eight of the sherds and makes up 1% of the matrix. The Fe-Ti oxides (opaques) make up between 1% and 2% of the matrix in 12 of the sherds. The percentage of oxides would probably be greater, but in cases where the clay was dark the oxides are hard to distinguish within the matrix. The remaining elements (zircon, tourmaline, mica, and calcite) occur only in trace amounts. Bone was identified in nine of the thin sections ranging from only trace amounts to as much as 4% of the matrix.

Grain size averaged between 100 and 150 microns with a range between 40 and 170 microns. In some instances where two clays were mixed they could be distinguished by differences in average grain sizes. One of the most interesting observations about the sample is the homogeneity of the analyzed sherds. All of the sherds have very similar mineral constituents with virtually the same percentages within the matrix. They are also very similar in the grain size observed, amount of sorting represented, and the shape of the grains. The sherds represented within the sample are of all different types, both plainwares and decorated styles, and represent different periods of occupation of the site. The amount of homogeneity suggests that the pottery was all made from a common, or at least a similar, source. The minerals identified in thin section, as has been stated earlier, all appear to have an igneous parent material. It has been suggested that the parent material may be granitic. Granite and other igneous materials have been reported for the Project area either within the Uvalde Gravels or as a component of the Wilcox Formation sandstone bedrock underlying the area. Therefore, the minerals identified exist within the Project area and are most likely to be available either as a natural component of the clay or as a temper material available from the creek banks or from deposits on the terraces or in the uplands. The angularity of the grains and the relatively small amount of sorting that has occurred indicate that the grains have not traveled far from their original source locality. Particularly the fresh nature of the feldspars suggests that they may have been secondary inclusions within the matrix added as additional tempering for the pottery. The distance from the source may be as much as 200 km, which is plausible since both the Uvalde Gravels and the Wilcox

116 Volume II, Part One Table 8-7 — continued a Unit/Level (10 cm) 98 3 Description Matrix-70% fairly homogeneous light brown with dark oxidized inclusions, dark inclusions (5%) contain oxidized Fe- Ti Oxides, but the rest of the mineralogy seems the same; Sand-subangular, moderate sorting, average grain diameter 100 microns; Quartz~20%; Quartzite Clasts—2%; Plagioclase plus Microcline-2%; Bone Fragments—1 to 270; Mica— trace, Zircon and Tourmaline-trace, associated with light clay matrix. 98 6 Matrix-70 to 75% fairly homogeneous with minor fragments (subangular) of light greenish brown clay, mineralogy is approximately the same but lighter clay inclusions have a slightly lower grain density; Sand-subangular to subrounded, moderate sorting, average grain diameter 150 to 170 microns, range <50 to 450 microns; Quartz—23%: Quartzite Clasts—1 to 2%; Plagioclase-2%; Bone Fragments—less than 1%; Fe-Ti Oxides-1%; Mica and Tourmaline-trace, also some inclusions of apatite in plagioclase minor blebs of red hematite rich material. 98 6 Matrix-75% fairly homogeneous medium brown with minor small blebs of hematite rich material, usually rounded (0.9 mm average diameter); Sand-subangular to subrounded, moderate sorting, average grain diameter 100 microns, range <§0 microns to 1 mm; Quartz~20%; Quartzite Clasts-2%; Plagioclase~1 to 2%; Fe-Ti Oxides~2%; Microcline-trace; Zircon and Tourmaline-trace, possibly some biotite or hornblende altered to opaque oxides. Formation, as well as other sand formations (such as the Carrizo Sands), occur within that zone. So the problem becomes one of determining if the pottery was made somewhere else and brought into the area, or if it was manufactured locally from the nearby clays. A thin section of a sherd from a black-on-white stirrup spout vessel from the Southwest (recovered from Dallas County, Texas) has been analyzed under a petrographic microscope (McIntyre and McGregor 1982). In contrast to the matrix of the Richland samples, which are mainly quartz, this matrix and others from New Mexico (Shepard 1971) contain mostly basalt. Basalt is very common to the west of Richland and would be expected as a component of the clays from this area. - Thin sections of sherds from sites in eastern Oklahoma (Spiro, Brackett, and Paris Mounds) were also very different from the Richland samples (Ren Thompson, personal communication 1981). The samples analyzed had such small grain sizes that few of the matrix constituents could be identified. All of the sherds were similar. in that the matrix was made up of very fine-grained material. In contrast, the Richland samples had grain sizes identified as being sand size. The question of provenience may never be fully answered, but this analysis has provided some answers to questions about the nature of the sherds. In every instance the temper identified by the archaeologist was confirmed by the petrographer. In several instances the petrographer-identified bone in the matrix that was not originally observed, but in each case the bone occurred in the matrix of small grog pieces within the paste and was not observable except with a microscope. The question of the addition of sand (grit) to the matrix appears to be supported by the fresh, angular nature of the feldspar in comparison to the other grains observed in the paste. This seems to suggest that sand was being mechanically added in addition to what was present naturally in the clay. It would appear that the pottery from Bird Point Island was manufactured locally due to the similarity of the samples. Otherwise it would have to have come from a single area outside of the Project to account for its homogeneity, a situation that seems unlikely for the 800 years or so of ceramic occupation represented at the site. More than likely the prehistoric inhabitants were using the clays available to them on or near the site where they were residing to manufacture their pottery. VARIABLES OF DECORATION This variable grouping was devised to provide a means of refining the existing ceramic chronology for the site. Although decoration has been one of the principal tools of the archaeologist to devise cultural chronologies, these chronologies are often quite generalized in order to be relevant over large areas (cf., Suhm et al. 1954). Analysis of the Bird Point ceramics, in comparison, should provide a refinement to existing regional chronologies so as to provide a site-specific temporal framework. The first variable is decoration method and refers to the manner in which decorations were executed on the sherd. More specifically, this denotes whether the decorations were made by incised lines, punctations, or some other technique. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 8-8. Although some differences are noted among the areas of the site, overall there is a general level of uniformity. Plain ceramics account for 65% to 80% of all sherds, with incising the most common method of decoration in most areas. Punctations are next most common, followed by brushing. The exception to the overall uniformity is in the frequencies from the North area. Here there are more decorated sherds than from other areas. This is particularly puzzling in comparison to House 1, which is part of the same occupation as the entire North area. If the argument presented earlier is correct, that more storage related activities with ceramics were undertaken within House I, then this attribute difference may indicate that undecorated vessels were more often used for storage. However, this interpretation is somewhat tautological and should be viewed simply as speculation at this point. The second variable used to look at ceramic decoration is the configuration of design elements seen on the sherds. Based on the range of elements observed, 13 different categories were defined (Tables 8-9 and 8-10); many of the element configurations are illustrated in Figures 8-1 and 8-2. The small samples of sherds with identifiable element configurations minimize the interpretability of the data. Overall, however, simple random punctations are the most frequent element category, ranging from 26% to 56% of all sherds with decorations. The next most frequent categories of elements involve those with various combinations of incised lines at different angles relative to the vessel orifice. The incised elements are similar to established ceramic types, such as Maydelle Incised, Canton Incised, and Davis Incised. However, more definitive affinity to these types cannot be given because of the small sizes of many of the sherds. Comparison of element categories among the areas of the site show overall similarity. Perhaps the most meaningful difference is the occurrence of the "engraved triangle configuration.” Only one sherd from this category was found from the North and none from the other areas with the exception of the South Midden, where six were uncovered. This element is similar to elements found on some Late Caddoan ceramic types of East Texas, particularly Poynor Engraved. Although the sample size is small, the occurrence of this element in the South Midden supports a tentative conclusion that later occupations at the site occurred here and corroborates the results of other attribute analyses presented earlier.

The element configuration is very similar to the established type Weches Fingernail Impressed, and the dating of this type in East Texas supports the temporal assessment made for the decoration at Bird Point Island (cf., Suhm and Jelks 1962). RESULTS FROM FEATURES A few comments are in order on how the ceramic data from features are presented. First, only brief descriptions of the function and temporal assignment of each feature are made; more detailed discussions can be found in Chapters 4 and 6. The emphasis here is in the presentation of ceramic data, with only the minimum necessary amount of information given to acquaint the reader with each feature. Second, the sherd data are described in the text of this chapter as opposed to being put into a table. Although tabular presentation would eliminate the need to read through several paragraphs of text to understand the contents of a particular feature, the size and complexity of the table would cause even greater problems in data communication. Third, only sherds found in 1/4 inch screening are included. Although sherds were also found from flotation, these tended to be too small for the analysis presented here. These sherds, however, are tabulated and presented in Chapter 4. And finally, not all variables presented for the "Non-feature Results" section are included within the discussion for features. In most cases only a small sample of ceramics was found, and a detailed breakdown by several of the variable categories is of dubious value given the low frequencies. FEATURE 1 Feature 1 is the large pit that was proposed to be a Wylie focus pit. Chapter 6 of this volume discusses this large pit and concludes that its purpose was multifunctional, changing over time as the site was reoccupied. The initial utilization of the pit occurred between 170 B.C. and A.D. 130. At this time the pit was excavated, used for roasting and mortuary activity and partially filled; this layer of the pit is termed Zone 3. The next episode of cultural activity inside the pit was around A.D. 700. This layer of the feature is defined as Zone 2 and includes cremation burials. In addition, there is evidence of small pits having been excavated and used as roasting pits in this zone. This activity dates between A.D. 580 and A.D. 860. The final layer of the pit, defined as Zone 1, represents the 117 accumulation of trash associated with two periods of occupation dating between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1650. Despite two seasons of excavation into Feature 1 and the removal of more than 85 m3 by hand excavation, only 209 sherds were recovered. Table 8-11 shows the distribution of sherds according to depth within the feature and by the position of the sherd on the complete vessel. The first variable examined for ceramics from inside the pit is sherd location, The ratios of body to rim sherds, compensating for small sample sizes, remain fairly constant from zone to zone and level to level. Perhaps more informative than the ratios of sherds are the vertical distributions of all sherds within Feature 1. The vast majority are located in Zone I, or to a depth of about 40 cm. Only four sherds were found in Zone 3, corroborating the pre- ceramic radiocarbon dating of this layer. The presence of sherds in Zone 3 may be the result of rodent disturbance, which was prevalent in this part of Feature 1. Table 8-12 presents data on sherd temper by zone and level within Feature 1. A tendency exists for more grog-tempered ceramics to be located in Zone 2 of the pit than in Zone 1. Grog with bone and grit (mostly sand) temper becomes more common in the upper zone. The chronological implications of this are confusing, since they imply that pure grog temper was more common during the earlier ceramic occupations at the site (ca. A.D. 700) and that bone and grit additions to the grog were later (ca. A.D. 1000-1650). This late occurrence of grit tempering is the opposite of that observed by other workers who note that sand temper tends to occur early in Texas (cf., Story 1981). However, this trend shows up in both the Season I and Season III excavations and indicates that it is not a statistical fluke, but is instead a reflection of cultural behavior. The distributions of decoration methods within Feature 1 are shown in Table 8-13. The data show a difference between Zones 1 and 2 in the frequency of decorated ceramics. More plainwares were represented in Zone 2 than in Zone 1. A higher incidence of decorated sherds in Zone 1 is due largely to the occurrence of engraved wares, which are absent in Zone 2, and to a much higher frequency of incised wares. Other decoration types, which represent combinations of the major categories, also account fora high percentage of the decorated sherds. Table 8-14 examines the vertical distributions of specific ceramic element configurations within Feature 1. Since only those sherds which were large enough to determine element configurations are shown, the sample sizes become sufficiently small to limit the interpretive value of the data. Although we are able to form a picture of the types of decoration in use, we cannot make conclusions about how these changed over time. In general the assemblage from the pit is dominated by incised and punctation elements, a situation similar to that observed from the remainder of the site. All of these elements are common to established ceramic types, such as Canton Incised and Maydelle Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962). The dominance of the "Engraved Triangle” element in Zone 1 affirms its apparent late occurrence at the site. This element configuration seems to be a good temporal indicator . at the site. FEATURE 33 This feature is identified as a possible roasting pit dating between A.D, 580 and A.D. 1200 and located immediately to the north of Feature 1 (see Chapter 4). The dating of this pit is based on its similar shape and content to other pits on the site which date to this time. A single, plain body sherd was found in the fill of this feature; sherd temper is grog. FEATURE 34 Feature 34 is proposed to be a roasting pit in the North area. It dates, based on content and shape, to the A.D. 1000 to 1200 occupation of the site, Two sherds were found in this feature: both body sherds with grog and sand tempering. Both are plain.

Based on overall content and shape, it has been included with the period of occupation at the site dating between A.D. 1000 and 1200. A total of nine sherds was found. Six have grog and sand tempering, one has grog, sand, and bone, and two have grog and bone. All are body sherds; four are brushed, while five are plain. FEATURE 38 This proposed roasting pit is located to the southeast of House 1, and is one of the better investigated features at the site (see Chapter 4). A radiocarbon date of A.D. 1120 + 120 was obtained on charred wood and hickory nutshell (see Chapter 12). Three highly weathered sherds were found from within the pit fill; two from the 20-30 cm level and one from the 50-60 cm level. All three sherds appear to be from the same vessel and are of a grog- tempered paste. All are plain body sherds. FEATURE 57 Feature 57 is the central hearth associated with House 1 at the site. Its date, based on radiocarbon dating of wood charcoal, is A.D. 1030 £ 250 (see Chapter 12). Although this is a feature with excellent spatial context, only five plain body sherds were recovered from the fill. Sherd tempers: were sand (3), grog and sand (1), and grog, sand, and bone (1). Several more sherds were recovered from the upper portions of the hearth that were in the A horizon and have been combined with the remainder of the ceramics from the House 1 block excavation, discussed previously in this chapter. The reason A horizon sherds were not excavated as part of this feature is that plowing and soil disturbances made visual detection of the hearth impossible until excavations reached the B horizon inside the house. FEATURE 59 The function of this feature is inferred to be a storage pit located inside House 1. Dating of the feature is estimated to be between A.D. 1000 and 1200, based on contents and spatial positioning relative to other features at the site. Six plain body sherds were found: sherd tempers are sand (2), grog and sand (4), and grog, sand, and bone (1).

Based on its position at the edge of Feature 1 and its contents, it is assumed to date between A.D. 1300 and 1650. A single plain body sherd was found with grog, sand, and bone tempering. FEATURE 89 Feature 89 is thought to be a hearth dating between A.D. 1300 and 1650 and is located in the South Midden area. This temporal assessment was heavily weighed by the location of the feature in the part of the midden where other features associated with this temporal range are located. The ceramics from this feature are considerable, numbering 125. Most (118) are body sherds; seven are rim sherds. Five are grog tempered, with the remainder (120) being bone tempered. All but one of the decorated (and most of the plain) sherds are from a single, punctated and flat-bottomed bowl (Figure 8-3a). The other decorated sherd has parallel incisions of unknown orientation. Most of the breaks on the vessel are old, indicating that it was broken and discarded into the pit. The temper is large quantities of bummed bone with lesser amounts of grog well mixed in a very coarse texture. The other sherd is tempered with bone and grog in a medium texture. FEATURE 94 This feature is interpreted to be a dog burial associated with trash deposition. It is located in the South Midden. Three plain body sherds were found in the fill. Sherd tempers are all grog. FEATURE 95 The proposed function of this pit is roasting. It is thought to date between A.D. 1300 and 1650. Forty-nine sherds were found and belong to a variety of different vessels. Relevant attributes are summarized in Table 8-15. Overall most of the sherds are body sherds, and almost half are decorated, The decoration methods are similar to those found in other areas of the site with the possible exception being that punctations are more common and incised lines are less frequent. Tempering materials are similar to other parts of the site. ,

122 Table 8-11 SHERD LOCATION BY ZONE WITHIN FEATURE 1 Zone | Zone 2 Zone 3 Body 123 59 4 Rim 12 1 Base 1 9 Sample Size 136 69 4 FEATURE 97 This is a proposed roasting pit dating between A.D. 1300 and 1650, located in the South Midden. The temporal placement is based on artifact content, shape, and spatial positioning of the feature relative to other features. Sherd attributes are listed in Table 8-15. Essentially, the sherds are similar to those in other parts of the site, and are otherwise not noteworthy. FEATURE 101 Feature 101 is proposed to be a roasting pit. It has been radiocarbon dated to A.D. 1080 + 70 and is located in the South Midden. A total of 137 sherds was found, giving this feature one of the highest ceramic densities of any at the site. However, all but three of these sherds belong to two partially reconstructible vessels. One of these two vessels is a bowl with an outflaring (everted) rim and decorated with cross-hatched incised lines (Figure 8-3b). The paste of the vessel is a medium to coarse texture and tempered with grog. Exterior color is dark gray, interior color very dark gray, and core color black. The diameter of the vessel orifice is 28 cm. According to established ceramic types, the partial vessel would be categorized as Maydelle Incised, based on the outflaring rim. This ceramic type is considered a Late Caddoan style (Suhm and Jelks 1962). The other partially reconstructible vessel is quite unique for the site in that it is a compound bow! with a decorated scroll motif on the rim (Figure 8-3c). Red pigment has been rubbed into the engraved lines of the decoration. The paste is a fine to medium textured clay with occasional grog and sand tempering. Exterior, interior, and core colors are all black. Vessel diameter is 14 mm. The three sherds from Feature 101 not part of these two vessels are decorated with punctations (2) and engraving (1). Temper of the punctated sherds is grog; the engraved sherd has bone and grog temper. FEATURE 102 This feature is a proposed roasting pit in the South Midden and is estimated to date between A.D. 1300 and 1650. A single radiocarbon date run on charcoal found in the pit gave a modem Table 8-12 SHERD TEMPER BY ZONE WITHIN FEATURE | Zone 1 Zone 2 Zone 3 Grog 35 54 1 Grit 1 Bone 1 Grog/Grit 60 13 2 Grog/Grit/Bone 16 Grog/Bone 23 2. 1 Sample Size 136 69 4 Volume II, Part One Table 8-13 DECORATION METHOD BY ZONE WITHIN FEATURE | Zone 1 Zone 2 Zone 3 Plain 69 60 2 Engraved 8 Incised 25 3 Punctated 10 3 2 Punctated/Incised 3 Other ; 21 3 Sample Size 136 69 4 determination: this is believed to be due to natural soil disturbance in the pit. Sixty sherds were recovered from the pit fill and are summarized by relevant attributes in Table 8-15. Generally, the ceramic sample is similar to other parts of the site with a couple of notable exceptions. The dating of the feature to the latest occupation of the site does not fit entirely with the ceramic assemblage. Although the types of sherd decorations observed from the features are consistent with what would be expected from this period of occupation, there is a lack of engraved elements, most particularly the “Engraved Triangles" element configuration. Consequently, the actual temporal positioning of the feature is in question and may be earlier than previously believed. FEATURE 103 This is a hearth located in the North part of the site. Based on its similarity to Feature 85 at a nearby location at the site, which dated to A.D. 1640 + 60, an estimated temporal range of A.D. 1300 to 1650 is proposed. A single, plain body sherd was found in the hearth fill; the sherd temper is grog. FEATURE 106 This feature is a possible roasting pit situated in the North area of the site. It is estimated to date from A.D. 1000 to 1200. A single, plain body sherd was found; the temper of the sherd is sand.

FEATURE 113 The proposed function for this feature is that of a storage pit dating between A.D. 1000 and 1200. It is located in the North area. The dating of the pit is based on its location, content, and similar shape to other features with similar function. Two sherds were recovered: one plain and one decorated. Both are body sherds and have grog tempering. FEATURE 114 This feature is a possible cremation burial located in the North and estimated to date to the period from A.D. 1000 and 1200. Five sherds were found: three plain, one brushed, and one punctated. Four are grog tempered and one is bone and grog tempered. One is a rim sherd and the others are body sherds. FEATURE 120 This is a proposed roasting pit located in the North area of the site. An estimated date of A.D. 1000 to 1200 has been assigned to this pit, based on its location and similar shape to other features at the site. A single, undecorated body sherd was recovered. It has no visible tempering. CLAY PIPES A total of 10 pipe sherds was found during excavations at Bird Point Island, All but two are small in size (ie., less than 3 cm in diameter) minimizing the interpretive potential of these artifacts.

Sherd tempers are similar to the vessel sherds from the site with two exceptions: (1) paste textures tend to be finer, and (2) sand tempering (forming a sandy paste), either alone or with other agents, tends to be more frequent. Stem diameters, where measurable, are quite variable and range from 4.5 to 7.0 mm. Although these sherds are rare from the site, their overall distribution shows a nonrandom representation among the areas of the site, In the southem areas (i.e., North Midden, South Midden, and South End) pipe sherds account for 0.1 to 0.2%. In the North, and particularly inside House 1, sherds are more frequent and range between 0.3 and 0.9%, the latter from inside the house. This suggests a higher incidence of pipe smoking during the A.D. 1000 to 1200 occupation of the site. OTHER FIRED CLAY OBJECTS In addition to the sherds and pipe fragments, three other fired clay objects were recovered. Two of these are clay beads found in Unit 151 in the South area (Figure 8-4c and d). The beads are made from sand tempered clay. Each bead is similar in size and measures 7 mm in diameter; the central hole is less than 1 mm in diameter. The remaining fired clay object is problematical and was formed by squeezing a lump of clay in the hand and then firing it (Figure 8-4e). The result is an amorphous clay lump with hand impressions on some surfaces. Volume UU, Part One b d e 0 5 Figure 8-4.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS At the beginning of this chapter, three objectives were stated to serve as a guiding framework for the ceramic analysis: (1) description of the assemblage, (2) development of a refined chronology, and (3) determination of the location of vessel manufacture (i.e., manufactured locally or imported). In this section we summarize the data that bear on each objective. The first objective, description of the ceramic assemblage, was undertaken as a means of communicating data to other researchers. Through the tables and text descriptions, this goal has been accomplished. Hopefully, other readers will be able to extract the data they need to assess our conclusions or, if they wish, to examine other problems not discussed in this chapter. The second objective of providing a refined site chronology has not been entirely met. Unfortunately the data show greater uniformity among areas of the site, and hence among different occupations, than is desirable for optimum chronology building. Relevant chronological attributes are shown in Table 8-17. This similarity in attributes over time is seen in several variables. For example, sherd temper, although exhibiting some differences, shows that grog inclusions are the dominant type in most areas. Only within Feature 1 were possible temporally significant differences found. Here, Zone 1, which is radiocarbon dated between A.D. 1000 and 1650, was found to have a greater incidence of sand tempered sherds relative to Zone 2, dating to

Since few of the deposits outside of the pit can be identified with the A.D. 580 to 860 time range, the excavations within the pit may have provided us with our only unmixed sample from this occupation of the site. Still, it is perplexing that sand tempering would be chronologically later than grog tempering, since this is opposite of what Story (1981) reports from East Texas as well as contrary to the situation found at other Project sites (see Chapter 15, Volume III).

The "Engraved Triangle" category is from vessels with overall decorative motifs similar to type Poynor Engraved, and the category "Diagonal Incised Lines with Punctations” is similar to type Maydelle Incised. Both of these are Late Caddoan ceramic types and show some interaction with these eastern Table 8-17 SUMMARY OF TEMPORALLY RELEVANT CERAMIC ATTRIBUTES FROM BirpD Point ISLAND Corresponding ___ Decoration _ ___ Temper Vessel Component Decorative Element Configuration!

126 neighbors. The best element configuration designating the preceding component (A.D. 1000-1200) is “Fingernail Punctations Separated by Horizontal Incised Lines." This category is nearly identical to the design on type Weches Fingernail Impressed, and shows cultural similarity to the Early Caddoan period of East Texas. More details on ceramic chronology for the overall reservoir can be found in Chapter 15 of Volume III. An additional variable that showed temporal change is rim orientation. Of the three orientation classes identified, only the South Midden and South area had the inverted category. This may relate to a higher incidence of carinated bowl forms in these areas, a vessel form that occurs more frequently in the Late Caddo period of East Texas (Suhm and Jetks 1962). The occurrence of this rim orientation in the South Midden and South area is consistent with the temporal implications of the decoration element data. Another variable showing some temporal relationship is the occurrence of exterior rolled lips in the South Midden and South area, Although the sample sizes are small on which this interpretation is based, a tendency does exist for rolled rims to occur more frequently in the southern portions of the site, once again corroborating the results of other variables that suggest latest occupation in this area. In summary, the objective of a refined ceramic chronology for the site has, at best, only been partially successful. In the southern parts of the site (South Midden and South) ceramics are found Volume U, Part One which have some characteristics similar to the Late Caddoan types of East Texas. Otherwise the sherds from the site are quite consistent in attribute variability and show greatest affinity to the Early Caddo of East Texas. Concerning the objective of where these ceramics were manufactured, the data suggest that they were made locally. The petrographic analysis on thin-sectioned samples of sherds showed that all specimens had constituents and grain sizes that were most likely from local clay deposits. The analysis of exterior sherd colors also showed uniformity in colors among the areas of the site, with the exception of the South area. The uniformity is interpreted to indicate local manufacture of most ceramics. The aberrant colors from the South, however, may be due to vessels from this area having been made somewhere else. Perhaps the later occupation that seems to have occurred in the South Midden and South areas represents a temporary occupation by a non- indigenous group. Considering the close proximity of the reservoir to the East Texas Caddo, it is possible that the site was visited by groups of Caddo during the A.D. 1300 to 1650 time period and that these groups were at the site for a sufficient time to leave several broken pots. Unfortunately the petrographic analysis did not include sherds from this part of the site, so this hypothesis must remain untested. Chapter 14 discusses the occupation of this part of the site in greater detail, using other data sources to address the question of local versus non-indigenous group occupation.

weweuee Eee AU eee SUBSISTENCE PATTERNS by William A. Martin and James E. Bruseth with contributions by Gayle J. Fritz, Phillip Murry, and Richard Fullington In this chapter, the macrobotanical and faunal remains recovered from excavations at Bird Point Island are discussed within the context of human ecology. The ultimate goal of this approach is to examine changes in resource utilization over time in order to better understand the diet of the prehistoric populations occupying the site during the past two millennia. In the first section, human ecological theory is briefly discussed. In the second section, the macrobotanical data analyzed by Gayle Fritz of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are presented. In the third section, faunal data are presented by Phillip Murry of Tarleton State University, along with a description of molluscs identified by Richard Fullington of the Dallas Museum of Natural History. In the final section, the implications of these data sets are discussed with respect to human nutritional requirements and resource scheduling. At the outset, it must be noted that preservation of subsistence remains, particularly faunal remains, is rather poor. Acid soils, natural soil disturbance processes, and scavenging of discarded remains by wild animals have all had a negative effect on preservation. As a result, the sample is undoubtedly affected by preservational biases. Yet despite this problem, extensive sampling for floral and faunal materials has remained a major goal of the excavation strategy. The strategy applied to the study of subsistence remains at Bird Point Island was to sample as wide a variety of contexts as possible and to identify floral and faunal remains to the most specific taxon possible. Even though poor preservation limits the interpretive potential of the data, it appears that minimal data from a wide variety of contexts can provide a representative picture of subsistence patterns. This certainly provides a better overall understanding of subsistence patterns than does the sampling of only a limited number of features with good preservation, which may reflect idiosyncratic behavior or which may not represent the overall pattern of resource acquisition and utilization. ECOLOGICAL BACKGROUND HUMAN ECOLOGY AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL REMAINS In anthropology, two major theoretical approaches have been used to study the relationship between culture and environment. Cognitive anthropologists have examined living cultures to identify the social norms and values that affect subsistence behavior (Bamburger 1971; Levi-Strauss 1969), whereas materialists have attempted to identify the ecological variables that influence human subsistence behavior (Harris 1979; Rappaport 1968). The materialist approach toward the study of cultural ecology has been adopted by archaeologists because they can measure biophysical variables and relate them to site distributions and site contents, whereas they cannot measure variables associated with the value systems of extinct cultures (Hilliard 1980:3). The principal concept of ecological theory is energy and its flow throughout the ecosystem. The ecosystem is a system in which energy flows among the plants, animals and microorganisms which interact to form the food chain (Erlich and Erlich 1970:157). The biological concept of adaptation to a particular environment is applied to organisms which are altered as a result of natural selection in a manner such that they become better suited to their environment and increase their ability to reproduce in that environment. Cultural ecology, often referred to as human ecology, considers the biological concepts of energy flow and energy capture among organisms which interact with a human population. It also considers the nonbiological factors unique to human populations, i.e., social and cultural factors that influence the adaptive strategy of the human population (Raab 1976). 127

128 The ecological reconstruction of prehistoric diets from archaeological materials entails the céllection, quantification, and identification of the various food remains found on sites to establish their relative importance in the dietary intake of the population (Gilbert 1985:344). Understanding the season of resource availability, its abundance, distribution, and ease of collection is also necessary to make statements about subsistence related decision-making processes (Lee 1979:68). The resources that were available to the population and the socioeconomic means used to exploit resources must also be considered (Raab et al. 1982:99). This entails the collection of paleoenvironmental data from several disciplines in addition to the collection of archaeological data. At Richland Creek, the analysis of pollen from cores obtained in nearby bogs, and the geomorphological analysis of the terraces and floodplain provide information suitable for reconstructing changes in the environment over time (see Chapter 5, Volume I). Thus, changes in the resources available to human populations can be inferred at various points in time for comparison with materials recovered from archae- ological contexts. RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AND ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE The three environmental zones discussed in detail in the Introduction to this volume are within close proximity to Bird Point Island, so a variety of resources could have been exploited by the prehistoric inhabitants with a minimum investment of time and effort. These zones, the Post Oak Savannah, Bottomland Forest, and Tall Grass Prairie, contained several plant and animal species important in the diet of the inhabitants of Bird Point Island. Although detailed information is available in Chapter 1, a brief description of these environmental zones and their relative resource potentials is presented here. The highly diversified Post Oak Savannah is advantageous for nut procurement, since several nut producing species are present which can be relied upon to produce a crop year after year. When one species has a bad year, others can make up the deficit (Hilliard 1980:21). Since acorns are an important wildlife food for many species, and animal reproduction rates are directly tied to good and bad years of acorn production (Crawford et al. 1969:206), the Post Oak Savannah is also an ideal hunting territory. Whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) rely heavily on acorns (Ellis and Lewis 1967; Lay 1969). Deer concentrate their daily activity in the presence of a concentrated food supply and disperse when food becomes scarce (Byford 1969:77). This relationship between acorn production and animal behavior has important implications for the seasonal scheduling of resource exploitation. Raab (1976) believes that the aggregation of deer around nut resources would have increased hunter/prey contact during the fall, as human and animal populations competed for nut resources. Also, it is in the fall that the rutting season occurs and deer behavior changes dramatically as mating commences. Ethnographic accounts show that historic Indian groups took advantage of this season to hunt deer (Swanton 1946). Competition from mammals and insects would have forced human populations to collect and process acorns and other nuts early in the fall (Hilliard 1980:26). If the acorns were not collected shortly after they dropped, deer and squirrel competition would have made collection less effective. Moreover, if they were not roasted or processed in some form, massive infestation of weevil (Curculia sp.) larvae could have devastated the supply (Hilliard 1980:28). Ethnographic sources indicate that nut resources were extremely important to the native populations of the Southeastern United States (Swanton 1946; Hudson 1976; Heizer 1977). Hickory nuts and walnuts were usually processed to obtain vegetable oil for use as seasoning and thickening for soups (Hilliard 1980:26). The nuts were cracked by pounding with stones, and the meats and shells were boiled. The oil was skimmed off the top and stored in Volume H, Part One ceramic vessels or skin bags (Hariot 1590:18). Acorns were also processed to retrieve oil and were roasted (Swanton 1946:366). Analysis has shown that some prehistoric populations intentionally collected the most nutritious acorn species. For instance, Hilliard (1980:36) demonstrated that acoms of the red oak group were chosen over those of the white oak group by the prehistoric inhabitants of the Arkansas Ozarks, even though those of the white oak group were more. abundant. This strategy reflects the fact that acoms of the red oak group have a much higher fat content, and hence, a higher caloric value than those of the white oak group. In addition to nuts and deer, another important resource that would have been plentiful in the Post Oak Savannah is the prairie turnip (Psoralea sp.). Psoralea esculenta is a historically documented staple among numerous groups of Plains Indians (Wedel 1978; Reid 1977; Kaye and Moodie 1978). In the dry, grassland climate of the Plains where agriculture was marginal, this fleshy tuber was heavily relied upon by several groups (Kaye and Moodie 1978:329). From its name, one might expect to find the prairie turnip within the Tall Grass Prairie environmental zone; instead it would have been concentrated on the sandy soils of the Post Oak Savannah and terraces of Richland Creek (Correll and Johnston 1970:813-817). Although the tubers are present year round, they must be collected in the early spring before the above ground parts wither and are blown away (Wedel 1978:162). Once the plant tops are gone it is virtually impossible to locate the tubers; consequently, the scheduling of Psoralea exploitation within the Richland Creek vicinity must have occurred during a critical period in early to mid-May. Ethnographic accounts document the importance of Psoralea in the diets of Plains Indian groups. It accounted for most of the carbohydrate intake among several groups and was an important subsistence item because of its abundance and long term storage capacity. Lewis and Clark (1904-1905) noted that when dried, the tubers could last up to several years. Wedel (1978:166) notes that the tubers were eaten raw, boiled whole, sliced, or mashed with meat, berries, and other items. Other accounts note that the tubers were roasted, which may account for the high incidence of charred Psoralea inside roasting pits at Bird Point Island. Within the Bottomland Forest zone, aquatic resources were present in creeks and sloughs that would have provided good sources of protein. Gar and other fish would have been available in quantity after spawning in early spring and could be taken through fall before they moved to deeper water (Butler and Perttula 1981:122). Fish and turtle were probably abundant and could be collected with a minimum amount of effort during late spring and summer once they were confined to sloughs and pools after spring floodwaters receded (Gibson 1973:331). Aquatic resources are known to have supplied a reliable source of protein to Mississippian populations adapted to meander belt regions during the summer when deer were dispersed and more difficult to hunt (Smith 1975:481). Mussels from the stream beds also provided sources of protein that have been easily obtainable during periods of low flow in the summer and fall. The fruits and berries available within the Bottomland Forest zone would have been sought as sources of carbohydrates and vitamin C (Bruseth and Perttula 1981:125). They ripen in the late summer and fall and were probably dried and stored for winter use, a common practice among both Plains and eastern tribes (Wedel 1978; Hudson 1976). Small herbaceous annuals growing along the disturbed habitats of the floodplain would have yielded abundant quantities of seeds during middle to late summer. These seeds would have provided additional sources of carbohydrates and in the case of marsh elder, a vegetable oil high in fats as well as carbohydrates (Yarnell 1978). Thus, both plant and animal resources available within the Bottomland Forest zone would have been exploited primarily during the summer and fall. The resources of the Tall Grass Prairie were probably among the least important to the prehistoric groups occupying the Richland Creek valley since few edible species were available. The plant community was dominated by grasses, so few species would

Ine also 66). ally iard vere pric Subsistence Remains have been used as food items. Bison and jackrabbit could have provided sources of protein, and bison could have provided substantial quantities of fat. However, as Lynott (1979:95) has noted, bison hunting never seems to have been a primary focus of subsistence behavior in much of North Central Texas. PRESENTATION OF SUBSISTENCE DATA The following sections present data tabulations and discussions of macrobotanical remains by Gayle Fritz, faunal remains by Phillip Murry, and molluscan remains by Richard Fullington. Sampling techniques and factors of preservation are outlined here, showing their implications for underrepresentation of some species which could affect interpretation. First, macrobotanical remains were recovered by means of flotation from cultural features only. Faunal remains were recovered from the flotation samples too, but they were also analyzed from 1 x 1 mand 2x 2m units which were screened through 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh. This discrepancy in sampling is due to the fact that charred plant remains are too small to be recovered in 1/4 inch (6.4 mm) mesh, whereas numerous faunal elements are large and easily collectable in mesh of this size. The faunal remains recovered by flotation include small bones of fish and birds which would pass through the larger mesh. As a result, the total faunal assemblage from the site is more heavily represented by large mammal remains. In general, faunal preservation is relatively poor, particularly in the North portion of the site where the higher acidity of the Ultic Haplustalfs has deteriorated bone specimens (see Chapter 2). Within the midden where more alkaline Typic Haplustalfs and Typic Ustochrepts are present, bone preservation is better. In addition, concentrations of mussel shells in some of the features within the midden apparently neutralized the detrimental effects of acidity and resulted in relatively good bone preservation in a few instances. Charred macrobotanical remains are relatively well preserved in all features. However, Munson et al. (1971) point out that different plants have different potentials for being deposited, preserved, and identified in archaeological contexts, and the proportions of plants recovered from features do not necessarily reflect the actual proportions used. They define three classes of plants arranged in descending order of depositional, preservational, and identifiable potential. The plant remains most likely to be recovered are dense inedible parts such as nutshell and fruit pits. Next are the dense edible parts such as seeds, nut meats, and maize kernels. Finally, plants least likely to be encountered are nondense plant parts with high water content such as greens, tubers, and fruit pulp. Differences in nut shel! thickness, weight, and durability must also be considered. For instance, thick-shelled species such as hickory and walnut have much higher preservation potential than do thin-shelled species such as acorn (Munson et al. 1971:427). ANALYSIS OF CARBONIZED MACROBOTANICAL REMAINS (by Gayle J. Fritz) Carbonized plant remains recovered by flotation during all seasons of excavation at Bird Point Island have been analyzed at the Macrobotanical Laboratory, Research Laboratories of Anthropology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Field work at Bird Point Island has resulted in the recovery and examination of archaeobotanical remains from 87 features at the site. Approximately 3,744 | of soil were processed to yield these items. Analysis was conducted by the author with advice from Dr. Richard A. Yarnell. 129 METHODS The contents of each sample were passed through a series of 10 graduated, standard geological sieves with mesh sizes ranging from 6.4 to 0.2 mm in order to facilitate sorting. The size groups were examined under a low power (7x to 30x) binocular micro- scope, and fragments larger than 2.0 mm were sorted and weighed according to category. The combined weights of heavy and light fractions are recorded in Table 9-1. The smaller size groups were examined for seeds and types of materials not present in the larger fractions. They were not completely sorted since many fragments smalier than 2.0 mm cannot be identified with enough certainty to justify the time expenditure necessary for such separation. The kinds of seeds identified are presented in Table 9-2, A standard laboratory procedure developed by Yarnell (1974:113-114) involves using the weights of the sorted categories larger than 2.0 mm in order to calculate the weight of each type of carbonized material larger than 0.7 mm. This method was not applied to the Richland Creek samples due to the large number of rootlet fragments. The weight of the combined carbonized remains smaller than 2.0 mm or larger than 0.7 mm was not determined since they could not be efficiently sorted from the uncarbonized matter in the time available. The ratio of carbonized to uncarbonized remains appeared to vary considerably from feature to feature and from size group to size group, making highly questionable the assumption that types of materials were represented in the 0.7 to 2.0 mm fractions in the same proportions as they occurred in the larger sized part of the sample. Parts of the samples smaller than 0.7 mm contain a disproportionately high percentage of fine soil particles, so they are excluded from the calculations in this as well as other analyses, although they were always scanned for seeds. RESULTS Wood Wood was the most abundant component of the flotation samples both by weight and frequency of occurrence. All features sampled contained some quantity of wood charcoal for a total weight of 135.43 g. Features 30 and 125 consisted of little other than charcoal, and Features 18, 20, 21, and 36 were especially dominated by wood. Nutshell Nutshell ranked second to wood charcoal in frequency of occurrence. Hickory nut shell (Carya sp.) was most common, occurring in all features except Features 30, 122, 125 and Post Hole 102, Pecan shell (Carya illinoensis) occurred in 72% of the samples, being absent from only 19 features, 5 burials, and 10 post holes. Acom shell (Quercus sp.) was present in 61% of the samples, being in all but 21 features, 7 burials, and 6 post holes. The total weights for nutshell were 50.47 g for hickory, 3.2 g for pecan, and 1.64 g for acom. Black walnut (Juglans nigra) was also present in Feature 12 with a weight of 0.06 g. The over representation of hickory shell is a common phenomenon in archaeobotanical samiples due to the greater probability that hickory shell will have been charred and preserved in large enough fragments to reach the analyst. Most if not all of the thick-shelled hickory nut remains from Bird Point Island are presumed to belong to the species Carya texana based on modern species distributions (Correll and Johnston 1970). Likewise, underrepresentation of acorns is common. Yarnell (1974:119) estimated that weights of acorn shell in flotation samples need to be multiplied by 20 in order to compensate for differential preservation relative to thick-walled hickory nuts.

If so, acorns may have been more important than hickory nuts in the diets of prehistoric occupants of Bird Point Island. Psoralea Tuber Following the nut remains, the most ubiquitous item represented is the prairie turnip tuber, Psoralea sp., with a combined weight of 4.27 g over the four years of analysis. Previous analysis of carbonized plant remains from the Richland Creek Archaeological Project area (Fritz 1982) offered a tentative identification of tuberous material as belonging to the genus Psoralea. Reflections on discussion with Dr, William F. Mahler, Director of Southern Methodist University Herbarium, and microscopic comparison of the archaeobotanical remains in question with herbarium specimens at SMU have resulted in greater confidence that the identification is correct. Although the important Plains Indian food plant known as prairie turnip or breadroot (Psoralea esculenta Pursh) is not known to extend as far 01 01 97 06 .79 01 .03 75 .08 2.05 OL ll 9.95 02 02 23 01 01 <.01 13 1.87 : 27 01 62 26 33 01 34 03 47 03 74 05 18 1.21 01 15 1.37 01 02 1.10 03 32 .03 AT 02 22 01 OL 21 .O1 48 01 .20 01 67 1.03 .08 47 05 52 .03 .06 Rt} 15 52 7.32 260.78 south as the Project area, a closely related species, Psoralea latestipulata Shinners, does include the Project area in its range (Correll and Johnston 1970:812). Psoralea is found in 82% of the samples, being present in all but nine of the features, all but three of the burials, and all but four of the post holes, The ubiquity of Psoralea distinguishes the Richland Creek samples from any other known archaeobotanical assemblage. Wedel's (1978) overview of the significance of the prairie turnip among the Plains Indians demonstrates convincingly “that the plant was both widespread and relatively plentiful throughout the northern Plains and on the upper Missouri, and that the tubers were extensively utilized for sustenance and trade by those tribes within reach of the harvest" (Wedel 1978:19). Less ethnohistoric evidence, however, could be found for use of Psoralea in the central and southern Plains, causing Wedel (1978:2) to suggest that "it may have been of less importance economically to the Indians there than farther north.” The Richland Creek archaeological record, while not necessarily contradicting Wedel’'s statement, can be seen as a valuable supplement to the incomplete ethnohistoric record. Roasting of prairie turnip tubers may have been more common locally in the Southern Plains:

The throwing of discarded rinds into the fire during or after processing would also result in preservation. We are very fortunate to have this evidence for the importance of a distinctive but generally underrepresented plant part. Rhizome Small fragments of charred rhizomatous material were found in 14 samples totaling 0.41 g. The quantity in Burial 28, a cremation, (0.16 g) is worthy of notice since the substance constitutes 30.8% of food plants from that pit. Feature 103, a hearth, was especially dominated by rhizomatous material, containing 0.09 g of it compared to only 0.08 g of nutshell and 0.01 g of recognizable Psoralea tuber in that sample. No taxonomic recognition has been possible at this time, - however, making inclusion with the food plants in the first place somewhat questionable. Justification is based on the wide variety of underground stem parts documented ethnographically as subsistence items among native North Americans, but the possibility exists that the rhizomes in these features were incidental inclusions or were collected for purposes other than human consumption. Bulb One charred bulb weighing 0.02 g was found in Feature 61B. It is indistinguishable under low magnification from wild onion bulbs (Allium spp.), but taxonomic determination cannot be offered with confidence. Fruit Feature 12 contained a somewhat flattened fruit-like specimen ca. 6 mm in diameter and also contained a carbonized object that looked like a small fruit, measuring 3.0 by 2.2 mm but tapering at 9 1 4 9 1 2 1 1 4 6 2 2 2 2 1 3 one end. Feature 33 contained a small round carbonized fruit which measured 2.5 mm in diameter and had no distinctive morphological characteristics. Bud Tiny bud-like objects were seen in samples from Feature 20 and from Feature 34. These objects were smaller than 2 mm, so they are not listed in Table 9-1. Peduncle One small fruiting stem weighing 0.01 g was present in the top section of Feature 102. The type of plant represented could not be determined. Fungus Feature 61 and cremation Burials 19 and 20 contained tiny bits of material resembling carbonized fungus weighing 0.03 g. These occur in small numbers with some regularity in archaeobotanical samples, but their significance here is not assumed to be great. Possible Gourd Rind Samples from Features 59 and 88 include items larger than 2 mim that resemble Cucurbitaceae rind, but are not in good enough condition for any identification that is not highly tentative. In cross section, these fragments are more similar to Lagenaria (bottle gourd) than to cultigen Cucurbita rind. Since the presence of Lagenaria in eastern temperate North America is documented at several Late Archaic as well as more recent sites (Ford 1981:8; Yarnell 1983), its occurrence at Bird Point Island would not be too surprising. Gourd containers could have been grown elsewhere, or might have been part of local, small-scale, plant husbanding activities. Seeds A total of 248 identifiable seeds was recovered from Bird Point Island in addition to 92 unidentifiable seed fragments (Table 9-2). a a a a g B € . « a é iL Pe . | =.

Whole achenes, pericarp fragments, and interior "kernels" (true seeds) are all represented. Feature 113, a pit or hearth in House 3, yielded one of the highest seed counts among the submitted samples, and 29 of the 33 seeds present in that feature are Iva annua. Features 57 and 62 each contained nine /va specimens. No other feature yielded more than four seeds of this type. No feature yielded more than six vetch seeds, with the exception of cremation Burial 28 which contained 51 vetch seeds. Two other members of the legume family are represented. The single identifiable seed from Feature 85 appears to belong to the genus Desmanthus (bundleflower), several species of which occur in the Blackland Prairie counties. One seed from Feature 113 is classified as Fabaceae but not as any certain genus. Fleshy fruits are represented by seven grape seeds (Vitis sp.) from six features and 16 sumac seeds (Rhus coppalilina or Rhus glabra) from five features. Samples from Features 29, 34, and 95 each contained a single bedstraw or cleavers seed (Galium sp.). One three-seeded mercury (Acalypha sp.) seed occurred in Feature 33..Knotweeds and smartweeds (Polygonum sp.) are represented by seven specimens from four features and by a fragmentary seed in Feature 29 which might belong te the Polygonaceae family. One maygrass caryopsis (PhAalaris caroliniana) came from Feature 22, and specimens recognized only as members of the grass family (Poaceae) were found in Features 12, 21, 29, and 36. The other seeds present include a simple Chenopodium and 3 Oxalis seeds from Feature 12, a poison ivy seed Rhus toxicodendron from Burial 19 and 20, and 39 unidentified seeds from 18 features. Maize The two features with Late Caddoan ceramic types, Features 101 and 102, contained evidence for limited use of maize at Bird Point Island during Late Prehistoric times. Two very small cupules were present in the top section of Feature 101. Cupule widths are 2.7 mm and 2.6 mm. Thicknesses were measured at 1.8 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. The middle section of Feature 102 contained a single cupule fragment measuring 4.4 mm in width but missing at least 25% of one end. Combined with the single cupule from Feature 12 (recovered during Season I mitigation), these cob fragments constitute possible evidence for the practice of agriculture at Bird Point Island. However, the scantiness of maize fragments given the large scale of flotation recovery efforts over four intensive seasons of mitigation indicates that plant husbandry, if practiced at all, was probably not a large scale or a long term operation. Maize cobs could also have been brought to the site from elsewhere. INTERPRETATION Time Depth Excavations at Bird Point Island have revealed prehistoric occupation during four time periods: ca. 170 B.C. - A.D. 130, ca. A.D. 580 - 860, ca. A.D. 1000 - 1200, and ca. A.D. 1300 - 1650 (see Chapter 12). Table 9-3 (percentage of plant foods by weight) has been prepared in an effort to recognize changing patterns of plant utilization through time. However, as noted previously in Chapter 4, the temporal placement of several features is uncertain, so broad pattems of change in plant use must be regarded as best estimates. Some categories of plant remains are included in this tabulation in spite of their dubious qualification as foods. The rhizome fragments, for example, could not be narrowed down to any particular taxon and were, therefore, possibly not remnants of subsistence items at all. Grass stems were not recognized in these features, however, and underground piant parts were obviously being utilized. The rhizome fragments are therefore included with the plant food types. The bud or fruit category was likewise of questionable significance for subsistence, since the few tiny items classified as either buds or fruits could well have been incidental inclusions in the features. Some of the seed types also may not have been ingested, poison ivy, for example. ~ Unfortunately, macrobotanical specimens from the earlier two periods were recovered in only five and three features, respectively, that can be assigned with confidence to those periods. The combined weight of plant foods present in the flotation samples from these eight features is less than one gram, so the proportions of different types of plant foods may not be representative. The absence of pecan shell from the three A.D. 580 - 860 features could be a function of the small sample size. The differences between proportions of the other nut types (hickory and acorn) and Psoralea tuber are not felt to indicate any changing patterns between the two periods. The only trend possibly showing

ve Subsistence Remains up in these features is an increase in use of seeds and fruits through time, with sumpweed, vetch, knotweed, and sumac showing up in the samples dating to A.D. 580 - 860, and continuing to be present later. The A.D. 1000-1200 time period is represented in the macrobotanical sample by at least 15 and perhaps as many as 20 features and burials and 14 interior post holes from Houses 1, 2, and 3. The three circular house patterns indicate that a small hamlet occupied the site at this time. One of the features assignable to this period, Feature 38, is a large, irregular pit classified as a roasting pit. Five other features called roasting pits (Features 33, 34, 35, 36, and 45) may date to ca. A.D. 1000-1200 as well. Table 9-3 shows that, when averaged across the features, hickory nutshell accounts for approximately 75% of the plant food weight, followed by Psoralea tuber at approximately 10%, pecan shell at 4%, and acorn shell at 2.1%. Rhizomes and small fruits also are occasionally present. Seeds were recovered from 60% of the nonposthole features, with a total of 133 identifiable seeds. Only two seeds came from postholes. More than 65% of the seeds from features assignable to this period were concentrated in two features: Burial 28, a probable cremation; and Feature 113, a possible storage pit inside House 3. The 51 Vicia-type seeds (see Fritz 1983 and 1984 for descriptions) from Burial 28 are difficult to interpret given the lack of any comparable concentration of wild pea or vetch seeds in other features. In smaller numbers, however, the Vicia-type seeds were recovered from nine features (including post holes) assignable to the A.D. 1000-1200 time period, with a total count of 69. The use of this plant type for food is therefore a good possibility. The deliberate inclusion of vetch pods with this cremation (Burial 28) as a burial offering could have resulted in the concentration as found. Feature 113, with 29 sumpweed seeds, two Vicia-type seeds, one unidentified legume (Fabaceae), and one other unidentified seed, is seen as especially good evidence for intentional processing of sumpweed for subsistence use. [va was present in five other features of this period (n=46), making it the most abundant and most frequently encountered seed taxon after the vetch type. Use of fruits such as sumac and grape is indicated by four Rhus and one Vitis seed. The two Polygonum seeds from Feature 58 are weak evidence for exploitation of knotweeds and smartweeds for food. Nineteen features at Bird Point Island are assignable to A.D. 1300-1650. This most recent period does not appear to differ markedly from its earlier counterpart in terms of proportions of the major plant food types (Table 9-2). Hickory nutshell averages close to 75%, Psoralea tuber is just over 11%, pecan shell accounts for an average of 7.2%, and acorn shell averages 4.8%. Feature 12 yielded the only walnut shell recovered from the site, but its weight accounted for only 1.4% of the plant food remains. Rhizome and fruit continue to be minor categories as before. Two notable contrasts, however, are the presence of maize and a possible drop in the exploitation of seeds. The recovery of a few maize cupules from three features of the period raises more questions than it answers. Do four cupules from four seasons of intensive excavation constitute evidence for local maize husbandry, when contact with Caddoan farmers less than 100 km to the east was probable? Why was maize recovered from this later, nonsedentary component rather than from the A.D. 1000-1200 hamlet? These questions cannot be answered by considering macrobotanical evidence alone. Even in conjunction with bioanthropological data, it might be difficult or impossible to determine whether a small amount of maize was being produced locally or was being acquired through exchange. It seems clear, however, that all components at Bird Point Island were essentially nonagricultural. Some maize was present after A.D. 1300, but the main pattern of plant use remained one dominated by nuts and roots. The smaller number of seeds from the 19 features dating to A.D. 1300-1650 (34 as compared to 135) may reflect a decline in exploitation of the two most abundant taxa represented earlier: sumpweed and vetch. Each of these seed types, however, was recovered from five of the features dating to the most recent 135 occupation, so some use of them continued. Sumac and grape are more abundant in the most recent features, but still present only in small numbers. The other taxa (Oxalis, Polygonum, Chenopodium, Galium, and Desmanthus) were present in numbers too small to be considered significant. Seasonality Nuts must be gathered in the fall, but could be processed and stored for use throughout the year. Other fall-ripening plants found in the flotation samples at the site are sumpweed, sumac, grape, knotweed, and chenopod. Psoralea tubers are reported to have been gathered in the spring or early summer, because the stems and leaves break loose and blow away after spring flowering, leaving no indication of the location of the roots (Gilmore 1977; Wedel 1978; Reid 1977; Kaye and Moodie 1978). Although the tubers were stored in large quantities for winter use across the Plains, ethnographic sources cited by the above authors indicate that prairie tummips were peeled immediately after harvesting. Since the carbonized fragments recognizable archaeologically seem to be parts of the hard outer cortex, a spring or early summer occupation at Bird Point Island is inferred. Another good indicator of spring occupation is the presence of vetch seeds (Correll and Johnston 1970). Maize would mean spring and summer or summer and fall occupation, if produced locally. ' Dietary Considerations The proportions of plant food types in the features as shown in Table 9-2 are useful for making comparisons across time and space, but do not necessarily reflect the relative dietary importance of the items listed. Difficulties in reconstructing the botanical element of prehistoric human diets are widely recognized; the basic problems stem from considerable differences in the likelihood of various plants becoming carbonized, deposited, preserved intact, recovered, and recognized during analysis (Yarnell 1982). Thick hickory nut shell is probably vastly overrepresented, especially as compared to fragile acorn shell. So far, there is no good system of adjusting for this disparity. At Bird Point Island, it seems that nuts were extremely important. It is best at this point to refrain from speculations concerning which nut type may have been dominant. Acorn and pecan are both common enough to be viewed as very important. The possibility that acorns contributed more heavily to the diet than hickory nuts should not be discounted. Hickory nuts and acorns provide very different proportions of basic nutritional elements. Hickory nut meats are more than 70% fat (dry weight composition), 13-16% protein, and 8-10% carbohydrates. They provide more than 700 calories per 100 g of nut meat (Talalay et al. 1984). Acorns, on the other hand, are high in carbohydrates, although the red and white oak groups vary with respect to percentages of fat and carbohydrate content. The red oak acorns have more than 20% fat and 60-70% carbohydrates, while white oak acorns are characterized by only 4-8% fat but more than 80% carbohydrate content (Petruso and Wickens 1984), Protein content in acorns ranges from 6% to 8.5%. The number of calories per 100 g of acorn meat varies from 221 to 328, with red oaks being significantly higher than the white oak group. The nutritional value of Psoralea esculenta is discussed by Wedel (1978) and by Kaye and Moodie (1978). The main species represented archaeologically at Bird Point Island may be P. latestipulata Shinners, formerly included in the taxon P. esculenta Pursh, Shinners (1958:209) notes that this species "has been misidentified as P. esculenta Pursh, which occurs from Oklahoma northward.” Other species of Psoralea have swollen taproots, but do not offer the ovoid tubers that form on P. esculenta and P. latestipulata roots. Nutritional data for P. esculenta are provided SS

136 here in the hope that they closely approximate the southem relative represented in the Bird Point Island samples. The carbohydrate estimate is 80%, and protein content is about 7%, which is quite high for roots (cf. potato at 2%). Kaye and Moodie (1978:334) point out that Psoralea is a good source of Vitamin C, containing approximately 17 mg per 100 g, as compared with citrus fruits which range between 25 and 30 mg of Vitamin C per 100 g. In spite of the deterioration of Vitamin C that would have occurred after storage and cooking ”... the flour of P. esculenta would have been a valuable addition to the meat diet of winter of the Plains Indians which, with the exception of dried berries, was extremely low, or deficient, in Vitamin C.... (Kaye and Moodie 1978:334)." : The other plant for which nutritional data are available is Iva annua. Asch and Asch (1978) sent off achenes for determination of nutritional composition, and found sumpweed kernels to be "...a concentrated source of food energy because of their high fat and low moisture content.” Fat content was 44% and carbohydrate content was 11%. Although protein content was high (32%), protein quality was poor because of the uneven amino acid breakdown. The number of calories provided per 100 g was 535, higher than acorns but lower than hickory nuts. Sumpweed turned out to be an exceptionally rich source of several vitamins and minerals, including calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin. The primary plant foods, then, would have contributed fats (especially the hickories, the red oak acorns, and Iva seeds), carbohydrates (especially the acorns and tubers), and essential vitamins and minerals. Meat is assumed to have been the primary source of protein, but the nuts and sumpweed seeds could have supplied protein during times when meat was scarce. Sumac fruits would have been another good source of vitamin C, and grapes were probably enjoyed for sugar content. It is quite likely that other plants were utilized when in season without entering the archaeological record. All of the major plants recovered are known to have been gathered as foods or drinks by native North Americans, although medicinal usage also may have been practiced. The use and importance of vetch or wild pea seeds remains problematic. Gilmore (1977) lists a type of wild sweetpea, Lathyrus ornatus, which was eaten by the Ponca. "Children sometimes gathered the pods, which they roasted and ate in sport. The plant was not considered of any importance, although noted and named (Gilmore 1977:46).” Edible early-season legumes such as Lathyrus and Vicia on the southern prairies must have been welcome additions to the diet, even if they never played a major role. ANALYSIS OF FAUNAL REMAINS (by Phillip Murry) The presence of three major habitats in close proximity to Bird Point Island is reflected in the archaeological faunal assemblage by the presence of numerous species with varied habitat preferences. Some degree of preservational bias undoubtedly affects the faunal assemblage such that the sample, although representative of the total archaeological assemblage present at the site today, probably does not represent the assemblage in the same proportion that the animals were exploited (Smith and Wetterstrom 1978:99-100). There is a definite bias toward the preservation of large bones from large mammals. Dense elements resistant to destruction and not favored for tool use are more likely to be recovered. Despite the problems with representation of total numbers of individuals, several conclusions are possible on the basis of the wide range of seasonally exploitable species present. This section presents a description of the faunal composition of the site with regard to changing patterns of utilization over time. Each species recognized is discussed and conclusions are presented concerning seasonality and the general nature of the faunal assemblage. Volume II, Part One METHODOLOGY Vertebrate specimens were recovered from Bird Point Island through excavation and sieving with a minor amount of specimens recovered by means of flotation techniques. Recovered material was transported to the Archaeology Research Program laboratory in Corsicana, Texas, for cleaning and cataloging and then transferred to the Department of Physical Sciences at Tarleton State University for further analysis. Upon receipt of the faunal material a general survey of the assemblage was conducted to determine faunal components and trends. Bones were further cleaned with dental picks and brushes for analysis and measurement. Although many faunal analyses utilize numbers of bone specimens within the site in determining cultural patterns, such modes of analyses have certain drawbacks. For example, usually no distinction is made between large and small unidentifiable bone fragments and these are counted individually. Therefore, a site which contains numerous tiny bone fragments due to cultural or preservational factors would seemingly contain much more bone than is actually preserved within the site. A more accurate method for determining bone concentration is through measurement of bone volume or weight. Both measurements were attempted in this study. Numerous bone fragments were measured within the site to determine bone volume. However, the irregularity of bone fragments, the curvature of large bones, and the number of measurements necessary for analysis make this an impractical and somewhat imprecise method when large numbers.of specimens are involved. Therefore, it was determined that a more accurate and efficient method for determining bone concentration was through the weighing of all bone within each level. Also, so that midden and butchering areas could be better differentiated, the bone was separated into burned and unburned portions for measurement. After the initial survey and weighing of the bummed and unburned portions of the assemblage, each identifiable element was compared with species within the vertebrate osteology collection at Tarleton State University. Elk and mule deer specimens were borrowed from the private collection of Mr. Robert Scott for comparison with some of the larger cervid specimens. Counts of identifiable elements are presented in Tables 9-4 through 9-6. Bone weights are presented in Appendix C. After identification of the faunal elements was completed, the microfilm library of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Fort Worth was consulted in order to establish a regional interpretation of faunal distribution and utilization within the North Central Texas area.

Despite the poor bone preservation mentioned previously, considerable material was collected from the extensive excavations. Although preservational bias exists which may cause large mammal bone to be somewhat overrepresented, the results of the study provide important insights into the prehistoric. patterns of animal exploitation. ; Bone was recovered from a variety of contexts including 1 x 1 m and 50 x 50 cm units excavated in the A horizon (Table 9-4), material found within feature exposed at the interface of the A and B horizons (Table 9-5), and the 2 x 2 m excavation units within Feature 1 (Table 9-6). Although several units excavated within the A horizon were placed across the upper portions of features, and therefore may be related to feature content, they are discussed by area of the site rather than with the features, because the A horizon is the zone most subject to secondary deposition and bioturbation. Only elements recovered from clear feature contexts are included in Table 9-5. The material from Feature 1 is presented on a zone by zone basis in Table 9-6 to help assess changes in the use of the pit over time as well as changes in the species exploited over time. The overall site fauna is dominated by whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus) although other mammalian species were recovered from Feature 1 including bison (Bison bison), domestic dog (Canis familiaris), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), cottontail and swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanuslaquaticus), and opossum (Didelphis marsupialis). Also, a variety of rodent species was recovered including packrat (Neotoma floridana), cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), vole (Pitymys/Microtus sp.), pocket gopher (Geomys sp.), and white- footed mouse (Peromyscus sp.). Fish species recovered within Feature 1 were gar (Lepisosteous sp.), sunfish (Lepomis), and other unidentifiable teleosts. Both softshell turtle (Trionyx sp.) and testudinid turtles were recovered, as well as frog and iguanid lizard bones. A considerable variety of colubid snakes was recovered including racer (Coluber constrictor), pine snake (Pituophis melanoleucus), water snake (Natrix sp.), and possibly com snake (Elaphe sp.). Viperid species recovered included both cottonmouth water moccasin (Agkistrodon piscivorous) and western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox). Also, a number 137 of bird remains were found including what are probably bones of wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Bison (Bison bison Linnaeus) Bison remains were found at a level below Features 78 and 86, in Unit 401 of Feature 1, which are dated at A.D. 580-860. Since the remains are below the dated level it is assumed that they are older than A.D. 860. Bison remains from Feature 45 may date between A.D. 1000-1200. Burned bison material was present within Feature 102, which has been tentatively dated at A.D. 1300- 1650. A number of other bison elements of uncertain chronology were also found. Within the South Midden several bison remains were found, including material from Control Trench 4 at the southeast end of the midden, Within the artifact concentration near the slough in the South area of the site, bison remains were also found. According to Schmidly (1983), bison once ranged over much of Central Texas. Late records of bison within the Central Texas area include accounts of numerous animals within the northern part of Brazos County in 1822 and in the northern and western sections of McLennan County. Both counties are within 120 km of the study area. These populations soon became extinct with the appearance of Euro-American settlement within the area. Bison have been identified from numerous archaeological sites within North Central Texas (Lynott 1979; Murry 1982). However, their numbers are not nearly as numerous as whitetail deer within any of these sites. Lynott (1979) proposed that bison populations in North Central Texas were relatively smal! until the Late Prehistoric period (post- A.D. 1200). The reason for this apparent increase in the bison population after A.D. 1200 was supposedly related to the hypothesized expansion of the short grass prairies during times of drought. The substantial amount of chronological data from Bird Point Island, although limited in geographical area, provides a Table 9-6 DISTRIBUTION OF FAUNAL ELEMENTS BY ZONE WITHIN FEATURE 1 AT Birnp Pomt IsLanpD Zone 1 Zone 2 Zone3 Total Animal 170 B.C.-A.D. 130 A.D. 580-860 A.D. 1000-1650 Gar 1 8 9 Catfish 1 1 Other Fish 2 2 4 Softshell Turtle 1 3 4 Testudinid Turtle 1 1 2 Racer 2 26 28 Water Snake 1 4 5 Cottonmouth 1 lt 12 Rattle Snake 2 2 Frog/Toad 3 1 1 5 Bird 4 il 15 Cotton Rat 6 1 5 12 Pack Rat 1 1 2 Pocket Gopher 1 15 16 Vole 3 3 White-footed Mouse 1 1 2 4 Beaver 1 1 Cottontail/Swamp 7 3 3 13 Rabbit ; Jackrabbit 1 8 9 Raccoon 2 2 Dog 3 2 26 31 Whitetail Deer 82 66 20 168 Bison 1? 4 5 Opossum 9 2 6 17

138 method to test Lynott's hypothesis within a single site. Bison elements are relatively poorly represented in all features within the site, although some elements were found within three chronological periods; A.D. 580-860, A.D. 1000-1200 and A.D. 1300-1650. It is apparent that either not many bison were killed within the period from A.D. 1-1650 or that bison were killed elsewhere and only the meat was transported back to the site. It is also possible that the Bottomland Forest and Post Oak Savannah environments surrounding the site did not satisfy the habitat requirements of bison. More data from nearby prairie sites is needed for comparison to fully test this hypothesis. However, it is clear that, compared with other food species, especially whitetail deer, bison was only of minor importance in the prehistoric diet throughout all time periods. There is a slight tendency, though, for more bison to occur in parts of the site assigned to the A.D. 1300 - 1650 period. This is seen in Tables 9-4 and 9-5 where excavations in the South Midden and South areas produced more bison. Whitetail Deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) Deer bone dominated the faunal assemblage at Bird Point Island. The Post Oak Savannah and Bottomland Forest habitats are most favorable for deer because of the presence of plant browse species which account for approximately 50% of the deer's diet. The presence of such plant species will provide for large populations of deer. In 1981, for example, the Post Oak Savannah of Texas supported a population of over 279,000 deer, considerably higher than surrounding zones. Considering that the number of deer in East Texas has declined sharply due to recent agricultural practices, it is apparent that this habitat supported tremendous deer populations during the prehistoric period (Davis 1974; Schmidly 1983). Very large amounts of deer were apparently consumed by the prehistoric population of Bird Point Island. Examination of Table 9-4 shows that deer bone was found in the majority of units excavated in the A horizon. The vast majority of bone was found - in the North Midden and South Midden areas. This pattern probably reflects the higher rate of discard of refuse in the midden, coupled with the better bone preservation potential of the soils in these areas of the site as compared with the soils in the North area. Table 9-5 illustrates the ubiquitous nature of deer bone throughout the features. Only seven features (25%), out of the 28 containing faunal elements, lacked deer bone. The large variety of deer elements which has been recovered indicates that entire deer were transported to the site for butchering and processing. There is a sparcity of identifiable long bone elements at the site, except for metapodial fragments whose extremities tend to be preserved and which are easily recognized. The long bones were apparently broken for the extraction of marrow. Bone marrow, besides being a favorite food of prehistoric peoples, also provides a major source of vitamin C in hunting cultures (Speth 1983). The most common types of deer elements present are those which are resistant to destruction and which are little utilized for food or tool-making, such as teeth, calcanea, and astragali. Domestic Dog (Canis familiaris Linnaeus) A dog burial (Feature 11) in Zone 3 of Feature 1 is believed to date between 170 B.C. and A.D. 130. Dog remains found in Feature 86, also in Feature 1, probably date between A.D. 580 and 860. Other remains found within Zone 1 of Feature 1, date to later periods. A dog burial containing numerous elements was found within Feature 98, tentatively dated at A.D. 1300-1650. Burned. elements of dog were also found within Feature 87. Tentative identifications of domestic dog in Feature 95 and in Feature 116 were also made. One 1 x 1 m unit excavated in the South Midden contained dog elements, but all other canine remains were found within the context of features. Volume H, Part One The above chronology indicates that dog burials are present within three chronological periods; 170 B.C. - A.D. 130, A.D. 580 - 860, and A.D. 1300 - 1650. Considering the close proximity of the remains in Feature 88, dated at 170 B.C. to A.D. 130, to those within other parts of Feature 1 dated at A.D. 580-860, the former date range is somewhat suspect. However, it.is certainly evident that dog burials were more common after A.D. 580. It is curious that no dog burials are clearly associated with the A.D. 1000-1200 occupation, since this period produced much of the fauna found outside of Feature 1. Measurements of long bones, vertebrae, and maxillae of the dogs were compared to those of an adult coyote. The dog elements, parts of several individual adults, were approximately 80% of the size of the coyote. This indicates that their approximate total length was 1 m, if we assume that the animals were proportioned . similarly to the coyote. The presence of burned remains of domestic dog within Feature 97, and possibly Feature 95, may indicate some utilization as food or may possibly represent cremations. Raccoon (Procyon lotor Linnaeus) The only positively identified raccoon elements were recovered in Zone 1 of Feature 1, dating between A.D. 1000 and 1650, and from two 1 x 1 m units, one dug in the North area and one in the South Midden (Table 9-4). Possible raccoon elements were recovered from other 1 x 1 m units in the North Midden and South Midden, and a possible element was recovered within the context of Feature 102 (Table 9-5). The dates associated with these areas of the site range from A.D. 1000-1650. Today raccoons are commonly hunted for their fur, and this was likely the case during much of the prehistoric period. Although raccoons are found in many habitats, they prefer hardwood forests and are very abundant along the larger streams (Schmidly 1983). Therefore, these animals would be abundant components of the faund and certainly would be available for utilization. They have been widely utilized as food during historic times (Lowery 1974), and the fact that they are very fat may be one reason for their popularity as food items. As mentioned by Speth (1983), both modern and ancient hunters often sought fat- bearing species because they preferred their taste. Fat also supplies a concentrated source of energy in the diet. Black-Tailed Jackrabbit (Lepus californicus Gray) The only bones in Feature 1 which may represent jackrabbit were found in Zone 2, dating between A.D. 580 and 860 (Table 9- 6). Other features containing jackrabbit remains are Features 45, 97, and 102, which indicate utilization between A.D. 1000 and 1650 (Table 9-5). Jackrabbit remains were equally divided between the North area and the South Midden, which also suggests utilization between A.D, 1000-1650 (Table 9-4). Thus, jackrabbit is represented for every period except the 170 B.C. to A.D. 130 occupation. Bumed bones indicate that jackrabbits were a’ food source of the prehistoric inhabitants of Bird Point Island. Jackrabbits are characteristic of prairie communities and are often found within environments on the black clay soil. Jackrabbits become especially abundant where herbage has been thinned and actually benefit from grazing by cattle (Schmidly 1983). In fact, jackrabbits will remain only where there is open grassland. Eastern Cottontail and Swamp Rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus Allen and S. aquaticus Bachman) These two species of Syivilagus are considered together because of their taxonomic similarities. Although the swamp rabbit tends to be larger than the cottontail, there is considerable overlap in size and similarity of morphology during the life

Burned rabbit remains were found in Feature 1, in Zones 2 and 3 of Unit 401, ranging in age from 170 B.C. to A.D. 860. From the A.D. 1000-1200 period, Feature 45 contained considerable rabbit elements. Only one unit containing bones of Sylvilagus was found in the North area, whereas several units in the North Midden and South Midden area yielded Sylvilagus remains. It appears that these species were utilized to some degree during all periods of occupation but may have been utilized to a greater extent during the later occupations associated with the midden accumulation. The best habitat for cottontails is within brushy or grassy areas with good ground cover. They prefer grassy areas much more than woodlands. With increased grazing, cottontails tend to decrease in numbers, while jackrabbits tend to increase in population. Swamp rabbits tend to inhabit hardwood bottomland swamps. The species is seldom found far from water, and within the Tall Grass Prairie, Sylvilagus aquaticus is restricted to the floodplains of rivers-(i.e., the Bottomland Forest habitat). The lack of these rabbit elements with the assemblages dating from 170 B.C. to A.D. 130, and from A.D. 1300-1650, may prove to be significant for determining climatic conditions at these times. The data, albeit tenuous, suggest drier conditions during those periods. Rodents Several rodent species were encountered: beaver (Castor canadensis), pocket gopher (Geomys sp.), pocket mouse (Perognathus sp.), vole (Microtus/Pitymus sp.), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus sp.), cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), and wood rat (Neotoma floridana), The temporal distribution of rodents is difficult to assess, because their burrowing habits tend to cause disturbance to cultural stratigraphy, leaving recent remains within older zones of cultural deposition. Pocket gopher appears to span all periods of occupation from 170 B.C. to A.D. 1650, while cotton rat is present from A.D. 580-1200. Other rodent species cannot be assigned to temporal periods with any confidence. No rodent remains were found in the North or South areas, but a few units in the North Midden and South Midden did yield rodent bone. Rodent species common to the Bottomland Forest include some Peromyscus species (P. leucopus and P. gossypinus) and Pitymys (Microtus) pinetorum. A number of species evolved in interior grassland habitats and are most common with the Tall Grass Prairie of Texas. Those include Geomys bursarius, Perognathus hispidus, Peromyscus maniculatus, and Microtus ochrogastor. Pocket gophers, such as Geomys breviceps, prefer areas with sandy soil and will avoid areas with poor drainage or clayey soils. The hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus, prefers areas with very dense ground vegetation and with good surface drainage. Areas with dense stands of broomsedge and varieties of bluestem are preferred by these species. The beaver, Castor canadensis, has a very broad geographic range. However, they are essentially aquatic and are generally found in smaller bodies of water such as narrow creeks or tributaries which lead into larger rivers or ponds. Amphibians Frog specimens were recovered near the bottom of Zone 2 and within Zone 3 in Feature 1. No other amphibian remains were recognized from the rest of the excavations, so this class of fauna appears to have been either a very minor element of the diet or a natural inclusion unrelated to the diet. Reptiles Reptile species from Bird Point Island include: softshell turtle (Trionyx sp.), red-eared turtle (Chrysemys pseudemys scripta), 139 various testudinid turtle elements, racer (Coluber constrictor), water snake (Natrix sp.), cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorous), rattlesnake (Crotalus sp.), pine snake (Pituophis sp.), corm snaxe (Elaphe sp.), and various unidentifiable lizard species. The temporal distribution of reptiles shows only snake species in the 170 B.C. to A.D. 130 portion of Feature 1. In Zone 2, dating to A.D. 580 - 860, softshell turtle and snakes are present. The A.D. 1000-1200 period is represented by all species of turtle and racer. Turtle species comprise the entire reptilian assemblage in features dating between A.D. 1300 and 1650. The abundance of testudinid turtle elements after A.D. 860 increased dramatically. Both burned and unburned turtle sheil was present in many levels within the site, indicating extensive utilization of these animals. Softshell turtles, as well as many testudinids, are abundant within the period from A.D. 1000-1200. However, this may be somewhat misleading since most features within the site have been referred to this age. The distribution of reptiles by site area shows a predominance of remains in the South Midden. The reptilian species found at Bird Point Island tend to be either aquatic or aquatic/woodland species. The species which are predominantly aquatic are turtle, water snake, and cottonmouth. Racers are found in many different habitats, although they often occur within trees near water (Webb 1970). The copperhead is usually found in rocky or wooded country but also occurs in relatively wet environments such as floodplain areas and swamp edges (Behler and King 1979; Raun 1965). The presence of the above species indicates exploitation of the aquatic habitats within close proximity to the site. Fish A number of fish taxa was found at Bird Point Island. Most are represented by small fragmentary vertebrae which are virtually impossible to identify. However, positive identification of catfish ([ctaluras sp.), gar (Lepisosteous sp.), and sunfish (Lepomis sp.) has been achieved. Catfish was identified in Feature 45 and gar was identified in Feature 124, both of which date from the A.D. 1000- 1200 period. Sunfish was recovered from Zone 1 of Feature 1 and dates between A.D. 1000 and 1650. Fish species appear to have been minor components in the faunal assemblage at the site, despite the fact that they would have provided readily accessible sources of protein in the summer when they were concentrated in sloughs and pools. The lack of fish remains in the A horizon excavation units can be attributed in part to the data recovery methodology used. Soil from these units, as well as from 1 x 1 m and 2 X 2 m units inside features, was screened through 6.4 mm mesh which was large enough to allow many fish bones to pass through. Most feature fill, on the other hand, was floated, thereby avoiding the problem of underrepresentation due to mesh size. Yet, despite this, there was still a very low quantity of fish remains recovered. This lack of small fish bones and scales may be the result of the poor faunal preservation potential of the site which favors preservation of large mammal bones. In addition, small bones would have presented less of a disposal problem than large bones to the prehistoric inhabitants of the site, so bison and deer may have been intentionally placed in feature fill whereas fish bones may have been scattered about the surface of the site and subjected to rapid deterioration. Thus, although fish were a minor component of the faunal assemblage, no firm conclusions can be reached concerning their level of importance in the prehistoric diet. INTERPRETATION Although the archaeological faunal assemblage is dominated by deer, diverse vertebrate species were recovered which are very similar to the modern fauna found in the Richland Creek area. However, the presence of numerous jackrabbit bones and bison

140 remains has important implications for reconstructing the past environment. Today, the maximum eastern range of the jackrabbit includes only the western portions of Navarro County (Davis 1974), so the high incidence of jackrabbit at the site suggests that a period of aridity occurred which extended their range further to the east. Likewise,the presence of bison at Bird Point Island and at other archaeological sites further east in Texas suggests that the extent of the prairie habitat was greater at one time. The presence of aquatic species (fish, turtle, water snake, etc.) and species which prefer moderate rainfall (vole) along with bison.and jackrabbit in Zone 3 of Feature 1 suggests that localized aquatic habitats remained available for exploitation during the hypothesized period of prairie expansion. The relative abundance of fauna in Zone 3 of Feature 1 is partially due to the better potential for bone preservation. The human burials recovered from Zone 3 were in a better state of preservation than was Burial 8 in Zone 1, and were in much better shape that other burials found at the site. Yet, it is unlikely that preservation alone is responsible for the lack of aquatic species in the upper zones of the pit. Calculation of Minimum Number of Individuals Many faunal analyses place emphasis on the calculation of the minimum number of individuals in archaeological sites. Usually, the minimum number of individuals is given for each excavation unit, and faunal utilization patterns are hypothesized based on this data. Unfortunately, the remains of a single faunal member are not generally confined to one unit. If we consider the minimum number of individuals at Bird Point Island using the traditional approach, we would arrive at a much higher number of individuals than were actually present, since most deer were scattered over more than one unit. Therefore, a survey of the minimum number of individuals was conducted only for features, since these have a greater possibility of reflecting a limited activity usage, and thus have less chance of being mixed. Feature 1 was excluded since it encompassed a very large area, spanned a long period, and contained many units. The survey indicated that each feature contained only one identifiable individual per taxon, and suggests that all vertebrates, including deer, were processed and cooked individually. There was no concentration of a large number of individuals in any given feature, although several species were often processed together. Seasonality A good indication of seasonality is available based on the remains of whitetail deer. In Units 91, 95, 97, and 98 several fully developed antlers were found which were fused to the frontal . bones. All of these units are within Feature 1 and all specimens represent different individuals probably killed in different years. All specimens were recovered from Zone 1, except those from Unit 91 which were found at the interface of Zones 1 and 2 and may belong to the earlier period. The specimens could range from A.D. 860-1650. According to Schmidly (1983), whitetail deer in East Texas shed their antlers between late December and mid- February. Therefore, these deer must have been killed in fall, or early winter, when the antlers became mature. The hypothesis that many deer were killed in the fall or early winter is further substantiated by determination of age by means of dental characteristics. Based on the eruption and degree of wear of the lower third molar, deer found in Units 97 and 98 and in association with Burial 8 were determined to be approximately one year and seven months old at death. Considering that deer in Texas are born in May and early June (Schmidly 1983), this would place the time at which they were killed in the period from November to January. Therefore, several indicators suggest that major utilization of deer took place during late fall or early winter.

Numerous fragments were unidentifiable, but several species were recognized. The bivalves include species rep- resentative of both pool and riffle areas. These include: Quadrulla quadrulla, Quadrulla mortoni, Amblema plicata, Tritigonia verrucosa, Lampsillas teres, Truncilla truncata, Megolonaias gigantea, Potamilus purpata, and Plectomerus dombeyanus. These species are all represented in the modern molluscan assemblage along Richland Creek. The gastropods are also typical of modern assemblages. Two species were recognized, Helicina orbiculata tropica, and Polygyra texasiana, These are species commonly associated with terrace deposits. Their presence in the assemblage probably represents inclusion due to natural factors of deposition. Tables 9-7 through 9-9 list the frequencies of recovered molluscs by their distribution among features and by areas of the site. Little interpretive value is seen in the tables, however. Essentially, molluscs are more frequent where bone is more frequent, which is probably due to differential preservation of shell, as well as bone, on certain parts of the site and to greater food discard occurring on some areas, PREHISTORIC SUBSISTENCE PATTERNS NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS Recommended daily dietary allowances vary according to age and conditions, such as pregnancy.

There are no specific recommended daily allowances for fats and carbohydrates, but it is estimated that a well balanced diet will derive 50-60% of its caloric intake from carbohydrates and 20% from fats (Wilson et al. 1959:29-30). Protein intake of 10-12% of total calories is recommended. For adults the recommended quantity is one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight, but 0.6 g/kg of body weight has been found to be a minimal quantity to maintain nitrogen equilibrium in adults (Wilson et al. 1959:53). Table 9-10 presents nutritional data for the principal food species recovered at Bird Point Island. Only the most important contributors to the diet are included, so fruits, seeds, and animal species not well represented in the assemblage are omitted. Corn data from modem specimens is included for comparison, even though maize was never a major staple. It is clear from the breakdown in Table 9-10 that the major sources of protein came from animal species. Although the percentage of protein is similar among all species, deer were the most common species selected. This pattern is related to the fact that there is more edible meat per individual with deer (Smith 1975:137). Animals with high reproductive rates and/or high quantities of meat were selected for exploitation among Mississippian populations, and seasonal peaks in availability appear to have influenced the selection process to the greatest degree (Smith 1975:138). Hickory nuts and acorns of the red oak group provided the greatest quantities of fat in the diet, although this was no doubt supplemented by the occasional use of fat-bearing animal species such as bison and raccoon. Finally, the major sources of carbohydrate were acorns of the white oak group and prairie turnips (Psoralea sp.). Maize provided additional carbohydrates during the final occupation, but was never a major dietary item. SEASONAL AVAILABILITY OF NUTRIENTS The abundance of resources within the Post Oak Savannah (nuts, deer, and prairie turnip) and within the Bottomland Forest (nuts, deer, seeds, fruit, and aquatic fauna) provided the bulk of the dietary intake for the hunters and gatherers at Bird Point Island. Resources were available in both zones during spring, summer, and fall although spring and fall were the principal harvest periods for major species such as Psoralea (spring), nuts (fall) and deer (fall/winter). Deer were probably hunted to some extent on a year-round basis, but they would have been easier to approach and would have had higher quantities of edible meat in the fall. The faunal analysis conducted by Murry demonstrates that Id] the few seasonality indicators identified from the faunal assemblage support late fall/early winter as the principal period of deer exploitation. Examining the nutritional data from the standpoint of seasonal availability of protein, fat, and carbohydrates, it is clear that a relatively balanced diet could have been maintained throughout most of the year for a sedentary population at Bird Point Island. Although several important nut species were harvested in the fall, they could have been stored and used throughout winter and spring to provide fats and carbohydrates. Likewise, dried or roasted prairie turnips have excellent storage potential and could have provided the most important source of carbohydrates year-round if sufficient quantities were collected and processed. Although reliable estimates for the density of Psoralea in the Post Oak Savannah prior to modern grazing practices are not available, the ubiquity of Psoralea peels across the site indicates that it must have occurred in great abundance, especially considering the poor potential for preservation of tubers. Thus, it appears that sufficient quantities of prairie tumip were available and within exploitable range of the site. Fruits and seeds, although supplements to the major components of the diet, also have food storage potential and could have provided carbohydrates and vitamins in the winter. In fact, the species with the least potential for long term preservation are the faunal species, the principal sources of protein. Meat and fish would have been primarily consumed during the seasons of peak availability, although some storage by means of smoking or drying was probably practiced. Thus, fall and winter would have been a season cf high protein intake, and perhaps lowered carbohydrate intake depending upon the supply of acorns and prairie turnips. Protein intake during late spring and summer probably focused on the ease of collection of aquatic species during this period. Fish, turtle, and mussels would have been collected at that time, as well as small mammals which were present in all three habitats surrounding the site. . CONCLUSIONS Four important conclusions related to subsistence can be made from the analysis of floral and faunal remains from Bird Point Island. First, and perhaps most importantly, this is the first reported occurrence of Psoralea from an archaeological context. Although numerous ethnographic accounts have demonstrated its crucial role as a source of carbohydrates among Plains Indians, it was thought that Psoralea would not be detectable in archaeological deposits because of the poor potential for preservation of tubers (Wedel 1979). Now that charred rinds have been found at Bird Point Island, as well as at other sites in the Richland Creek drainage (see Volume IID), it is possible to understand the importance of this plant during prehistory. Future _ floral analysis in North Central Texas should be conducted with an awareness that this plant is detectable and was a primary resource. Second, the distribution of bison and jackrabbit through time may have important implications for understanding the paleo- environment. Bison remains were recovered in Zone 3 of Feature 1 and at the interface of Zones 2 and 3, so the utilization of bison in this feature ranges from at least 170 B.C. to A.D. 130. Bison are also frequent in the South Midden and South areas which date between A.D. 1300-1650. Jackrabbit was found also in features falling within the A.D. 1300-1650 period as well as in the North area which is predominately the product of the A.D. 1000-1200 occupation. These data suggest that prairie was relatively close to the site during later periods of occupation, but that exploitation of prairie resources was low. Slight increases in the frequencies of bison remains in the South Midden and South areas (ca. A.D. 1300-1650) suggest either that larger prairie areas existed close to the site during these periods, resulting in increased utilization of bison and jackrabbit, or that existing tall grass species were replaced by medium grass species preferred by bison. Both hypotheses suggest that drier conditions existed during these periods.

Moreover, a sedentary occupation appeared at the site between A.D. 1000 and 1200, based on a nonagricultural subsistence base. A sedentary occupation at Bird Point Island is indicated by the presence of three structures, believed to be dwellings, in the North area of the site (Houses 1, 2, and 3). The year-round nature of this occupation is revealed by the floral and faunal contents of the features inside the houses. The presence of Psoralea tubers and vetch seeds indicates spring occupation; the presence of turtle bone indicates spring-fall occupation; the presence of Iva seeds and nuts indicate fall occupation, and the presence of deer suggests late fall to early winter occupation.

Their contribution to the diet was not restricted to the seasons of availability as much as the protein sources were. Protein was available from turtle, fish, and small mammals during the late spring and summer and from deer during the fall and winter. Fourth, a shift in the mode of subsistence occurred during the A.D. 1300-1650 occupation when limited quantities of maize were introduced into the diet. However, the subsistence pattern based on hunting deer, gathering nuts, and collecting Psoralea tubers persisted. The presence of maize cupules demonstrates some dietary reliance on maize which may have been obtained either from local husbandry or by exchange with the Caddo of East Texas.

GEOPHYSICAL REMOTE SENSING by Robert J. Huggins, James E. Bruseth, and William A. Martin Geophysical remote sensing devices were used at Bird Point Island to locate cultural features prior to field work so that excavation could be directed toward potentially more productive areas of the site. Two techniques, magnetic survey and electromagnetic conductivity survey, were tested to assess their effectiveness for finding cultural features. The specific instruments used included Geometrics proton precession magnetometers and a Geonics Limited EM-38, All work was conducted by Spectrum Geophysics, Inc., of Fort Worth, Texas with the assistance of the Archaeology Research Program staff. This chapter presents a discussion of the principles of operation for each instrument, the methodology used, and results of the surveys. In the final section, the methodology and results of magnetometer experiments designed to test hypotheses pertaining to feature function are discussed. MAGNETIC SURVEY Magnetic survey to locate in situ cultural features was used in Britain and Europe as early as the 1950s, with much of the current knowledge of the field contributed by a few individuals (Le Brogne 1955; Belshé 1957; Aitken 1958; Linington 1964; Graham and Scollar 1976). Use of this technique has only recently been introduced into New World archaeology (Ralph 1964; Beven 1975). During the past decade magnetic survey has been used successfully to locate subsurface archaeological features at several sites across the United States (Tite 1972; Weymouth 1976; Weymouth and Nickel 1977; Weymouth and Huggins 1983). Its success elsewhere prompted the selection of this technique for use on sites within the Richland/Chambers Reservoir area. Since the magnetic properties of each site environment vary widely and can drastically affect the shape, magnitude and geometry of the measured anomaly, some form of preliminary testing and assessment is a prerequisite to the accepted use of magnetic surveying in any given region. Therefore, a feasibility study was conducted during mitigation Season I to test the effectiveness of this technique, during which five 20 x 20 m blocks : were surveyed at Bird Point Island and four blocks were surveyed at Adams Ranch. PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION The proton precession magnetometer measures total magnetic intensity by means of a signal generated by the precession of spinning protons in a proton rich hydrocarbon fluid. The spinning protons are temporarily aligned by the application of an electric current from a coil in the sensor. When the current is removed, the spin of the protons causes them to precess in the direction of the ambient magnetic field. The precession frequency is measured by digital counters as the absolute value of the total magnetic field to within 0.1 gamma. The gyromagnetic ratio of the proton is a well known atomic constant which allows the magnetic field intensity to be calculated from the precession frequency (Breiner 1973:3). FORMATION OF MAGNETIC ANOMALIES The location of buried archaeological features using magnetic methods depends on the measurement and recognition of anomalies in the earth's magnetic field caused by changes in the concentration, orientation, and type of iron oxides in the soil. In culturally sterile alluvial, or wind blown sediments, iron oxides are commonly found in the form of weakly magnetic hematite and are distributed in such a way as to produce a distinctive, often uniform magnetic field at the surface. In the presence of cultural activity, various forms of energy are brought to bear on the soil which can create localized changes in the magnetic properties of the oxides. These changes produce measurable variations or “anomalies” in the magnetic field over the area of interest. Three principal forms of energy act to create magnetic anomalies. The largest and most easily recognizable magnetic * 143

144 forms such as magnetite and maghemite. Even if the burned material is redeposited in a midden or is transported by wind or water, the magnetic enhancement is still measurable. Another form of energy that was commonly applied on archaeological sites is the excavation of pits which disturbs the original sediments. The topsoil is usually more magnetic than the sediment underlying it, so removal or redistribution of the A horizon is often reflected in the magnetic record. Unburned structures, borrow areas, or other depressions often produce anomalies in this manner. Finally, chemical energy can cause magnetic enhancement through the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter which alters the iron oxide content of the soil by a reduction-oxidation process. This phenomenon is common in regions where wet-dry seasonal climatic patterns have existed in the past. The shape, magnitude, and symmetry of magnetic anomalies provide information about the size and depth of buried features. Magnetic anomalies can assume a variety of shapes and magnitudes but are usually composites of two basic categories, the "monopole" and the "dipole." The monopole anomaly consists of a group of measurements which has a magnitude greater or less than the surrounding equally spaced values in the immediate vicinity. This type of anomaly is typical of more deeply buried or diffuse features. The dipole anomaly consists of two groups of measurements, one group higher than surrounding values and the other group, lower, but closely associated with the first group. Complicating factors often act to hinder the detection of cultural features. Noise-producing agents affect the ease with which magnetic anomalies can be detected and recognized as culturally significant. "Noise" as used in this discussion is defined as extraneous contributions to the earth's magnetic field which tend to obscure archaeologically interesting anomalies. Intrusive geology with any appreciable iron content produces strong magnetic fields which mask the typically weak archaeological fields. Soil disturbance caused by vandals or heavy equipment can also cause difficulties. Magnetic fields from recent iron trash such as cans or bits of farm machinery will often obliterate anomalies. These confusing effects can usually be minimized by appropriate computer image enhancement (filtering), but in some instances the archaeological magnetic record is not detectable above the surrounding noise. It should be noted that the phenomena that are being measured in a magnetic survey are not visible to the human eye. It is only because these phenomena usually have visible physical correlates that it is possible to associate magnetic anomalies with archaeological features. It is conceivable that some features detectable with magnetics are difficult or impossible to discern with the naked eye. In these cases it is necessary to utilize other types of analysis, perhaps of a chemical nature, to determine whether these ephemeral features are indeed culturally significant. For a more extensive discussion of the principles of magnetic surveying, refer to Aitken (1974), Breiner (1973), or Weymouth (1976). SURVEY PROCEDURES Prior to the magnetic survey, a visual inspection was made of the area around Bird Point Island to search for noncultural sources of magnetism which could adversely affect the results. A road cut through the terrace showed that the terrace soil appeared to lack intrusive features such as lenses, gravels, or other inhomogeneities that might produce magnetic anomalies. However, the iron stained Wilcox sandstone exposed along the southern end of the site was widely dispersed across the terrace because it had been gathered and used in hearths and roasting pits by the prehistoric inhabitants. Initially, it was thought that this iron rich stone would be strongly magnetic and might contribute adversely to the measurement of weaker magnetic fields from in situ cultural features. However, Volume I, Part One crude susceptibility measurements made using a method outlined by Breiner (1973) showed the rock to be weakly magnetic. Subsequent survey confirmed these initial susceptibility measurements, showing uncorrelated soil noise in the absence of cultural material to be less than 3 gammas. Measurement of the magnetic field over the site was accomplished using two Geometrics proton precession magnetometers in the difference mode capable of an accuracy of 1 part in 200,000. One magnetometer remained stationary on the site to monitor the time fluctuations in the earth's magnetic field (diurnal drift) while the other instrument measured the field over the area of interest at a sample interval of one meter. This interval was chosen because it represents a reasonable compromise between resolution and speed of surveying. It is feasible to cover up to 2,500 m2 per day under ideal conditions, but 1,200 m2 was the average during the Bird Point Island survey. A total of 6,400 m2 was surveyed during Seasons I and II. Figure 10-1 shows the area surveyed during both seasons, with the magnetometer survey area indicated by the bold outline. The objective of this broad coverage was to isolate clusters of cultural activity occurring within areas of sparse activity so that excavations could be directed toward potentially more productive areas. Three people were used for the survey, one person to remove ferrous objects with the aid of a metal detector, and two people to carry the sensor and instrument pack (Figure 10-2). All magnetic materials which could affect the readings were removed from the clothing of the person carrying the sensor. The instrument pack was carried by another person to ensure sensor isolation. The stationary sensor was continuously monitored by a computer. Although care was taken to ensure accurate positioning of the sensor during the survey, it is reasonable to assume a spatial error of 5 cm for any given reading due to terrain irregularities. In addition, the height of the sensor varied over the course of a survey although efforts were taken to account for small scale topographic changes. The magnetometers are factory calibrated to produce combined errors of 0.35 gammas, but once positional errors are taken into account, the repeatability of one reading might be more conservatively estimated at 1 gamma. RESULTS The area examined at Bird Point Island during Season I encompassed all of Feature 1 and the immediately surrounding area. The magnetic anomalies recognized were diffuse, suggesting widespread activity areas rather than discrete features. However, the excessive background noise resulting from pieces of metal obscured some of the readings, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the technique at the site. Better results were obtained from the survey conducted at Adams Ranch where excavation revealed a small oval pit beneath a magnetic anomaly. Additional survey was scheduled for Season II which required resurvey of the blocks affected by background noise and the survey of 13 other blocks. Prior to Season II, the site was systematically scanned with a metal detector to remove ferrous debris that would adversely affect the survey results. Data collected during the survey were first computer corrected for diurnal drift and then run through error checking routines. Preliminary contour maps were generated to detect the magnetic fields caused by archaeological features. Convolution filtering was then performed on some of the data to reduce contributions from the geology or recent iron trash. Convolution filtering, similar to removing general trends from data by polynomial regression, replaces each data value by a weighted sum of the surrounding data allowing more control over the size of the remaining residuals. As a result, anomalies from specific features remain while anomalies which are smaller and/or larger are diminished or removed. After preliminary processing, color density contour maps were produced on a computer graphics screen with the magnitude of the readings keyed to a color scale. The computer allowed interactive

Magnetic survey at Bird Point Island using the proton precession magnetometer. alteration of color scales to best enhance anomalies of interest and to magnify smaller anomalies which were indistinct. Over 30 anomalies of variable size-and magnitude were observed. The attributes used to select anomalies for investigation included: (1) (2) (3) (4) (3) (8} magnitude of anomaly, polarity of anomaly, direction of polarization, cross-sectional area of anomaly, symmetry of anomaly, similarity to models of idealized archaeological features, and (7) similarity to anomalies created by archaeological features from other areas. Figure 10-3 is a map of the total magnetic field at Bird Point Island. Virtually all of the anomalies shown on the map were caused by cultural features, but not every feature on the site resulted in the creation of a magnetic anomaly. General trends in the occurrence of magnetic anomalies are characterized by two clusters of high intensity along the crest of the terrace, with a definite reduction in variation of the magnetic field and a distinct lack of anomalies along the periphery of the survey area. The first concentration of anomalies lies between the 50N and 90N lines in the North area. Anomalies in this area appear to ring the highest elevation contour of the terrace, but none occur directly on the highest point. The second concentration of anomalies forms another ring within the midden between -20N and 40N. The distribution of anomalies appears to correspond with different uses of the two areas during different occupations of the site (see Chapter 12). Several anomalies exhibit pronounced differences in degrees of symmetry and polarity. Some are clearly caused by cultural Volume II, Part One features, having polarization toward north and a ratio of high to low components consistent with those found in association with cultural features at other archaeological sites. Many of these anomalies also exhibit pronounced bilateral symmetry which is a classic indicator of features with uniform composition. Other anomalies are clearly of modern origin, with signatures characteristic of iron objects. However, most anomalies are problematic, exhibiting slightly symmetric to irregular shapes and weak polarity. The excavation program discussed in Chapter 3, was initiated to investigate the source of these anomalies. Excavation revealed that nearly all anomalies were caused by cultural features. ELECTROMAGNETIC CONDUCTIVITY SURVEY Electromagnetic conductivity survey is a technique that measures soil conductivity, which is the inverse of galvanic resistivity. Although galvanic resistivity surveys have been used successfully to locate cultural features in recent years (Carr 1977), there has been little attempt to use conductivity survey for this purpose. However, the EM-38 conductivity sensor provides better resolution and more easily interpretable results than the equipment used to conduct resistivity surveys (McNeil 1980:5). It is also much easier to use in the field since it is a lightweight, hand held instrument that requires no additional probes and wires. Therefore, a feasibility study was conducted on 1,300 m2 at Bird Point Island to assess the potential of the EM-38 to detect cultural features. PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION The ability of electromagnetic conductivity survey, as well as of galvanic resistivity survey, to detect discrete subsurface features is dependent on differences in moisture content between features and the surrounding soil matrix. Whereas a galvanic resistivity survey measures changes in resistance between probes when an electrical current is passed through the soil between the probes, the EM-38 electromagnetic conductivity sensor operates on the principal of electromagnetic induction. The EM-38 is equipped with a transmitter coil at one end, a receiver coil at the other end, and a power source and meter in the middle. When the transmitter coil is energized with alternating current at an audio frequency, very small currents are induced in the soil. These currents generate a secondary magnetic field which is sensed, together with the primary field, by the receiver coil. The meter measures the ratio of the secondary field to the primary field, which is linearly proportional to soil conductivity. This provides a direct reading of soil conductivity in millimhos per meter (McNeil 1980:5). FORMATION OF CONDUCTIVITY ANOMALIES The creation of electromagnetic conductivity anomalies is directly related to fluctuations in soil moisture. Water, the most highly conductive substance in most soils, percolates through the soil matrix at differential rates due to variations in permeability. As a result, poorly drained areas display high conductivity readings since they retain soil moisture, whereas well-drained areas yield low conductivity readings due to their low moisture content. As is the case with magnetic anomalies, the effects of cultural activity upon the soil can alter soil moisture content to create conductivity anomalies. Excavation of pits into the B horizon is the principal form of cultural activity affecting soil moisture content. The sandy loam A horizon at Bird Point Island is a porous, well- drained soil ranging in depth from 20-40 cm, whereas the clay enriched B horizon is relatively impermeable. Under natural

148 conditions, water perches on top of the B horizon as it percolates down from the A horizon, increasing soil moisture at this depth and registering as highly conductive on the sensor. However, when the B horizon is completely penetrated by the excavation of large pits, drainage is drastically improved within the pits as water drains through the sandy C horizon sediments. As a result, soil moisture decreases within the feature and registers as a low conductivity anomaly. SURVEY PROCEDURES The EM-38, a portable sensor developed by Geonics Limited, was used to measure electromagnetic conductivity over 1,400 m? at Bird Point Island during Season II. Two people were used for the conductivity survey, one to move the sensor and the other to write down the meter readings (Figure 10-4).Three 20 x 20 m blocks (Grid 1) were surveyed immediately east and south of Feature 1 at a sample interval of 1 m. One 10 x 20 m block (Grid 2) was surveyed at the north end of the site because magnetometer data indicated that a large anomaly was present in that area. RESULTS Data were entered into the computer to produce contour maps reflecting changes in soil conductivity. Large scale, dominant trends were indicated, with an area of very low conductivity present over Feature. 1 and an area of very high conductivity southeast of the feature. To remove larger scale trends, the data were convolution filtered to reveal anomalies caused by discrete features. These anomalies are illustrated in Figure 10-5. Interestingly, substantial overlap was observed between high intensity magnetic anomalies and low intensity conductivity anomalies. The ability of the EM-38 to record soil conductivity is related to the vertical sensitivity of the instrument as well as to the moisture content of the soil. The vertical sensitivity curve of the EM-38 is bell shaped, with maximum sensitivity at a depth of 40 cm and lowest sensitivity above and below this depth, particularly near the surface and below 2 m (Figure 10-6). This implies that water perched in the soil at the 40 cm depth will contribute a much stronger reading than water perched at any other depth. At Bird Point Island, the EM-38 successfully distinguished pits dug through the B horizon because moisture in these pits had moved below the zone of maximum sensitivity. ADDITIONAL CONDUCTIVITY SURVEY The initial success of the EM-38 for detecting depth variation and disturbance to the B horizon prompted additional conductivity survey at the end of Season II to provide information useful for planning Season II] excavations. Three areas, Grids 3, 4, and 5, were surveyed in an attempt to identify the locations of structures (see Figure 10-1). Grid 3 was situated over a portion of the undisturbed half of House 1 and Grids 4 and 5 were located in areas thought likely to contain additional structures. It was hypothesized that post holes from prehistoric structures might produce conductivity anomalies because they often penetrate the B horizon, opening small pathways for drainage of soil moisture. Fortunately, an ideal setting existed at the end of Season IJ for testing the ability of the EM-38 to detect anomalies as small as post holes. The south half of House 1 had been exposed during excavation, with the north half left undisturbed (see Chapter 3). Grid 3 was established over the northwest quarter of the house in a 4 x 6 m area and was surveyed at a sampling interval of 10 cm to insure coverage of small anomalies. The location of post holes within the unexcavated portion of the house was estimated by extrapolating from the arc of post holes exposed during excavation. This provided a "map" which could be Volume II, Part One Figure 10-4. Electromagnetic conductivity survey of Grid 3 over House | using the EM-38 sensor. compared with the resulting color contour map to determine whether or not the instrument had detected the post holes. The results of this survey were not as easy to interpret as those obtained from the earlier surveys of Grids 1 and 2, because the close sampling interval introduced high levels of uncorrelated measurement noise not evident in data sampled at 1 m intervals. The raw data were convolution filtered to isolate anomalies which might be caused by post holes. Instrument noise was separated for possible association with the estimated arc of post holes. Although individual post holes were not apparent, an arc of low conductivity was visible in the vicinity of the house boundary stretching between 54.5N 19E and 58.8N 22E. Associated with this arc was a series of low conductivity anomalies that may represent areas of differential drainage. Although it was hypothesized that this arc may have been directly related to the distribution of wall posts in House 1, the block excavation conducted during Season IIT showed that the location of post holes did not correlate well with this arc. Grids 4 and 5 were sampled at 50 cm intervals, which provided greater detail than grids surveyed at 1 m intervals and allowed greater coverage of the site than could be obtained with 10 cm intervals. Grid 4 encompassed a 10 x 20 m area stretching from TON to 80N and from 20E to 40E (see Figure 10-1). Grid 5 covered a 20 x 27.5 m area stretching from 20N to 47.5N and from 20E to 40E (see Figure 10-1). Grid 5 overlapped the northern portion of Grid 1 which was surveyed at the beginning of Season II. The map of raw data from Grid 4 showed a broad area of low conductivity to the west with some localized areas of high conductivity centered at 75N 30E. These high conductivity areas coincided with one of five concentrations of lithic debris which

Map of the electromagentic conductivity field over Grid 1 at Bird Point Island. were thought to be related to structures, so this area was investigated further during Season III. Although House 3 was discovered within the lithic debris cluster during Season HI fieldwork, only a small portion of the conductivity anomaly coincided with the structure. In general, there was no obvious correlation between the two. The dominant trend in the raw data from Grid 5 was an area of high conductivity extending from 20N to 30N and from 20E to 30E. When this area was surveyed earlier in Grid 1, the same trend was observed (see Figure 10-5). No obvious low conductivity anomalies were observed on the map of raw data, so data were convolution filtered, Unfortunately, a higher level of measurement noise was present than had been the case for other grids surveyed, which precluded identification of anomalies of archaeological interest. ASSESSMENT OF REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES Both the magnetometer and the EM-38 were able to detect cultural features at Bird Point Island, but each instrument responded to different phenomena. Figure 10-7 illustrates the responses of both instruments along with the depth to clay for points sampled at 2 m intervals along the 15E line. Soils and magnetic data were collected between 36N and -20N, but conductivity data was only collected as far south as ON, so the graph of conductivity response ends at that point. The 15E line was selected to illustrate these responses because it encompassed the edge of Feature | and all of Anomaly 18, which contained several features. Depth to the clay B horizon was recorded by Ed Janak of the Soil Conservation Service, using an auger to collect specimens. 149 The upper graph in Figure 10-7 provides a plot of the depth to clay which shows that the B horizon was encountered between 35 and 40 cm in this portion of the site, except where clay had been removed by the excavation of large pits (i.e., features associated with Anomaly 18 and Feature 1). The plot of the conductivity response closely parallels the plot of the depth to clay in the area over Anomaly 18. A sharp decrease in conductivity occurs at the same point that depth to clay increases. The relationship between depth to clay and soil conductivity is not strictly a one to one relationship, as demonstrated by the gradual decrease in conductivity toward Feature 1, where depth to clay remains more or less constant. However, it is clear that the EM-38 responded to large pits which had completely penetrated the B horizon, since the lowest conductivity responses were recorded within Feature 1 and the features associated with Anomaly 18. The results of the additional conductivity survey indicate that the EM-38 may only be effective for locating large features which have completely penetrated the B horizon. Although several anomalies were observed on maps of Grids 3, 4, and 5, excavation revealed that they were not associated with any of the small features present. Since the vast majority of cultural features on archaeological sites are similar in size to these, the inability to record small features appears to be a major limitation of this instrument. The magnetometer response along the 15E line is more complex than the response of the EM-38. The variations in the magnetic readings shown in Figure 10-7 appear to be only slightly related to the depth of clay, which should be expected since the magnetometer responds to changes in the distribution of iron oxides and magnetically enhanced rock. Even though the plot of the magnetic data fluctuates considerably, it clearly shows the location of Anomaly 18 as a group of low readings ranging between 0 and -10 gammas to the north followed by a dramatic increase to the south of readings between 30 and 45 gammas, This is the characteristic response of a dipole anomaly. Excavation revealed that subsurface features were present beneath nearly all of the magnetic anomalies. Although many features did not exhibit magnetic anomalies, more features were detected by the magnetometer than by the EM-38 relative to the areas surveyed by both instruments. In addition, the magnetometer recorded features as small as 1 m in diameter as well as large features, whereas the EM-38 only recorded large features. Also, the magnetometer picked up anomalies over the same large features which were recorded by the EM-38. For these reasons, the magnetometer appears to be a more effective and efficient instrument for use in locating cultural features, at least within this Project area.

Large pits were uncovered within the areas encompassed by the anomalies, and it was hypothesized that the differences in symmetry and polarity reflected different degrees of redigging and reuse of these pits. Further excavations into many of these pits showed them to have irregular shapes in profile and poorly defined boundaries at their interface with the B horizon. The pit fill was comprised of sandy loam A horizon soil which contained artifacts similar to those found in the A horizon around the pits, however higher frequencies of fire cracked rock (Wilcox sandstone), dart points, steep unifaces, and cores occurred within the features (see Chapter 4). Three of these anomalies are discussed in greater detail below as examples of the variations in symmetry and polarity observed and the way in which these variations correspond with different degrees of feature reuse. Anomaly 7 (Feature 34) had a magnitude of 18 gammas and exhibited the greatest degree of bilateral symmetry observed among ail anomalies on the site, with a single peak in magnetic response in the center. It also exhibited a strong polarity oriented toward the north (Figure 10-8). These factors suggested a fairly homogeneous magnetic source and a feature subjected to little reuse. The pit fill was a homogeneous, dark brown sandy loam containing fire cracked rock, lithic debris, and baked clay. Macrobotanical remains included charred nut shell and prairie turnip (Psoralea). The high content of fire cracked rock and charred plant remains suggested that the pit may have been used for roasting. Anomaly 9 (Feature 36) had a magnitude of 45 gammas and an irregular shape in plan view. The most striking aspect of the Volume I, Part One anomaly was that it exhibited a polarity shifted nearly 30 degrees east of north which is an unusual phenomenon for features magnetized in situ (Figure 10-9). Another unusual characteristic was the fact that two magnetic peaks occurred within the anomaly rather than one. Other anomalies also exhibited the shift in polarity and multiple magnetic peaks. It was hypothesized that these characteristics reflected episodes of redigging and reuse. Excavation of Anomaly 9 (Feature 36) revealed a basin-shaped pit with an undulating bottom. The pit fill was a mottled mixture of A and B horizon soil, but the artifact content was identical to that of Anomaly 7 (Feature 34), The artifact content suggested that both pits had been used for the same purpose; however, Feature 36 appears to have been reused to a greater extent than Feature 34. Anomaly 23 (Features 47, 95, 97 and Burial. 16) had an overall magnitude of 56 gammas, but exhibited a variety of localized magnetic peaks. The anomaly exhibited very little symmetry and only weak polarity oriented in several directions (Figure 10-10). These characteristics were thought to represent a complex feature subjected to several episodes of reuse. Excavation supported this hypothesis, revealing a circular pit (Feature 97) tangent to two overlapping pits (Features 47 and 95) with an intrusive burial (Burial 16) inside Feature 95. , These three examples demonstrate that magnetic survey data can be used successfully for assessing the general nature of cultural features prior to excavation. The next step in the use of magnetic data was the interpretation of feature function by conducting magnetic survey of experimental features designed to replicate those found at the site.

However, little charcoal or oxidized soil was present, unlike hearths found on the site which contained substantial quantities of both. This led to the hypothesis that the sandstone was heated outside of the pits and placed inside while hot. The fact that charred specimens of acorn, hickory, and pecan shell, as well as Psoralea tuber, were identified (Fritz 1983) argued for use of the features as either storage pits or roasting pits. The latter possibility seemed most likely because of the presence of fire cracked rock and because roasting is a historically documented means of nut preparation (Swanton 1946:364), as well as of Psoralea preparation (Reid 1978). Earlier during the course of the research at Bird Point Island, the archaeologists (Bruseth and Martin) and the magnetic specialist (Huggins) met informally on several occasions to discuss possible causes of anomalies and excavation strategies. At this point, additional meetings were convened to devise a means of testing the hypothesized function of the features. A series of experiments was designed to examine the two hypotheses related to storage and roasting, and to determine the precise source of magnetism within the features. It was reasoned that magnetic enhancement of the iron-rich Wilcox sandstone probably occurred when it was heated for use in cooking or roasting. This idea could be tested by examining the magnetic response of Wilcox sandstone before and after heating in an experimental hearth. On the other hand, the disturbance of iron oxides in the soil caused by digging a storage pit and backfilling after use may have accounted for the observed increase in magnetism. This could be tested by measuring the magnetic response of a pit dug and refilled as part of the experiment. If a magnetic increase was observed over the heated rock, but little increase was observed over the pit, this would lend support to the roasting hypothesis. If the reverse was observed, then the storage hypothesis would make more sense. The test required an area free from excessive background noise and devoid of cultural anomalies. A nearby terrace was selected which had geological and soils properties identical to Bird Point Island, but which lacked cultural material. Two contiguous areas of 440 m2 each (designated Area 1 and Area 2) were surveyed with readings taken at 50 cm intervals. The results showed that little variation existed in the natural magnetic field of the terrace. No anomalies were recorded in Area 1, and only a small anomaly due to an iron object was recorded in Area 2. In retrospect, the data from the control areas would have been useful for the initial interpretations of the magnetic field at Bird Point Island. The data demonstrate that virtually all of the anomalies observed at the site 51 Direction of Polarity Direction of Polarity —— meters iv Direction of Polarity Figure 10-10. Magnetic contour map (in gammas) of Anomaly 23 over Features 47, 95, 97, and Burial 16. are the result of cultural activity, including small anomalies of lesser intensity that were initially omitted from investigation. The magnetic properties of the Wilcox sandstone were examined during the first part of the experiment. Approximately 22.7 kg of Wilcox sandstone were gathered from the outcrop south of Bird Point Island and spread evenly over a 1 m2 pit dug toa depth of 10 cm within Area 1 (Figure 10-11). A magnetic survey conducted over this pit and the surrounding area revealed that the rock was very weakly magnetic, with a low component of -12 gammas to the north (Figure 10-12). A fire then was built over the pit to heat the rock, and another survey was conducted after allowing several days for the rock to cool. This time a magnetic anomaly exceeding 400 gammas with a strong north-south polarity was recorded, demonstrating beyond a doubt that Wilcox sandstone becomes magnetically enhanced when heated (Figure 10-13). It was clear from these results that any hearths containing Wilcox sandstone would be clearly visible on the map of the magnetic field of the site. Reexamination of this map revealed an anomaly within the midden, Anomaly 32 (Feature 104), that was virtually identical in size, shape, and polarity to the anomaly produced by the experimental hearth. Prior to the experiment, it Figure 10-11. Wilcox sandstone in the experimental hearth prior to burning.

However, excavation revealed a rock and charcoal filled hearth (Feature 104) measuring 1 m in diameter that looked nearly identical to the experimental hearth (Figure 10-14). The archaeological hearth had a magnitude of 140 gammas, approximately 35% of the magnitude of the experimental hearth, and contained 6.8 kg of rock, approximately 30% of the quantity used in the experimental hearth. This indicates that the magnitude of the anomalies observed at the site is directly related to the quantity of burned rock contained in the features. To examine the effect of excavation and mixing of soils on the magnetic field, a pit 1 m in diameter and .75 m deep was excavated in Area 2. This depth.was selected to insure that A and B horizon soils would be disturbed and mixed to a similar degree as that found in the the prehistoric features at Bird Point Island. The pit was refilled and surveyed with the results showing no detectable anomaly. The conclusion derived from these experiments is that the pits at Bird Point Island are magnetically detectable largely due to the presence of fire cracked rock. The next question addressed concerned the site formation processes responsible for the deposition of fire cracked rock in the pits. Although it was clear that the magnetism in the pits was due to the presence of fire cracked rock, it was not clear whether this rock had entered the pits as the result of a primary, heat related activity or was introduced as discard from activity elsewhere on the site. Since trash disposal in pits has been observed elsewhere in Texas (Bruseth and Perttula 1981), disposal of the fire cracked rock was considered a likely possibility until otherwise ruled out. Once again, magnetic properties were used to provide the answer to this problem. One of the properties of magnetically enhanced rock is that as it cools in situ, the iron oxides become oriented toward magnetic north, giving the rock the same magnetic declination and inclination as the earth’s magnetic field at the time of cooling. This realignment of iron oxides during heating is the same property utilized by the archaeomagnetic dating technique. If the rocks had been placed in the pit while hot and had cooled in situ, they should all exhibit the same, or allowing for the effects of bioturbation, very similar orientations.

Magnetic field (in gammas) over the experimental hearth after burning. other hand, if the rocks had been discarded into the pit, then their orientations should vary and no central tendency should be apparent. Five samples of Wilcox sandstone, from three rocks in one of the large pits, were collected by Holly Hathaway of the Colorado State University Archaeomagnetic Laboratory. Horizontal strikes were made on each rock while in situ and the rock's compass orientation was recorded. One inch cylindrical cores were taken from the rocks in the laboratory, then cut to appropriate lengths and sanded to remove impurities from the coring process. Three samples were taken from the largest rock (Sample Numbers 1-3) and one sample each was obtained for the other two rocks (Sample Numbers 4 and 5). The cores were measured for their natural remanent magnetism on a Schonstedt Spinner Magnetometer (Hathaway, personal communication 1983). The results indicate that all of the rocks had magnetic fields oriented towards north. Figure 10-14. Feature 104, a hearth filled with fire cracked rock similar to the experimental hearth.

ne cir be of do es Ss en hs ec he al er te Geophysical Remote Sensing Hathaway reports: Each of the cores is generally oriented in a northerly direction. Sample 4 is the possible exception to this, but this is probably due to the incomplete field orientation. Although there appears to have been slight shifting of the fragments prior to field collection due to their small size, the magnetic natural remanent magnetism directions indicate a strong possibility that these fragments have generally retained their original in situ position from past heating of the material (Hathaway, personal communication 1983). These results seem to rule out the possibility that fire cracked rocks found in the pits were the result of trash disposal and lend additional support to the roasting pit hypothesis. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF FIRE CRACKED ROCK Aside from providing information about feature function which could have been obtained by no other means, magnetic data also aided the interpretation of spatial distribution of fire cracked rock. In recent years, increasing emphasis has been placed on the study of spatial patterning of artifacts as a means of delineating discrete activity areas on archaeological sites. The generation of maps from large data sets has been simplified by computer programs such as SYMAP (Jermann and Dunnell 1976). The definition of spatial distribution of features and activity areas was a major research goal at Bird Point Island, so SYMAPs were generated for each artifact category. Use of magnetic survey data, in conjunction with the expertise of the magnetic specialist, helped to explain puzzling patterns observed with respect to the distribution of fire cracked rock across the site. When the SYMAP for large fire cracked rock (2.5 cm or greater) was compared with the SYMAP for small fire cracked rock (1-2.5 cm), major differences were observed. A 20 X 7m cluster of large fire cracked rock was observed curving around the wall of House 1, but the distribution of small fire cracked rock exhibited a low density in the same location (see Chapter 13). This phenomenon was rather confusing, so the map of the magnetic field was examined to search for some interpretive clue. Although two small magnetic highs, which may represent hearths, were observed within the area encompassed by the large cluster, the vast majority of the cluster exhibited an overall decrease in magnetism. Since the magnetometer experiment had demonstrated that Wilcox sandstone is weakly magnetic in an unfired state and becomes strongly magnetic when heated, it was clear that the majority of rock in this cluster had never been fired. Because of the natural reddish to black color of the unmodified sandstone, it was often impossible to visually distinguish bummed from unburned sandstone in the laboratory. As a result, the rock in the cluster had been misidentified as fire cracked and included on the map. Without the aid of the magnetic survey, this fact would not have been recognzied. The presence of a concentration of unburned rock makes sense if Wilcox sandstone was stored on site for use in hearths and roasting pits. The fact that the rock outcrop in the slough is under water during a significant portion of the year strongly implies that collection and storage must have occurred during the dry season. A likely location for storage would be an area in close proximity to hearths and roasting pits. The location of the cluster next to House 1 would have placed rock within easy access for household cooking and for roasting in a nearby pit associated with House 1. The unburned large fragments recovered from excavation 153 probably represent pieces that broke off as rocks were tossed in piles. The broader spatial implications of this information are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 13. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Magnetic surveys and electromagnetic conductivity surveys were conducted at Bird Point Island over the course of three seasons of field work. A large area was surveyed with a proton precession magnetometer, an instrument proven effective for locating cultural features on other archaeological sites. The results of the magnetic survey were positive, with most anomalies marking the locations of subsurface pits. In addition, the shapes of many of the anomalies closely resembled the shapes of the corresponding archaeological features. A small area was surveyed with an EM-38 to assess its utility for locating features. The initial results were good, with the sensor recording the same large features recorded by the magnetometer, so additional areas were surveyed. However, the EM-38 did not pick up small features and therefore recorded fewer features than the magnetometer. As a result, magnetic survey appears to be the best remote sensing technique for use in locating features at sites such as those in the Richland Creek area. : For a magnetic survey to successfully locate cultural features, a broad area should be covered and the survey of a control area is highly recommended. Only under rare circumstances is it possible to survey an entire site, but it is usually feasible to include some marginal site areas. where little activity is believed to have occurred. This information is useful for delineating site boundaries and isolating areas of concentrated activity. The survey of a control area having geological and pedological properties similar to those of the site also provides useful data for comparison and is an essential part of any overall program. The magnetic field over the control area can allow cultural anomalies to be separated . from any natural anomalies that may be present by providing a picture of the natural level of background noise and the extent of natural anomalies. Once features have been located and excavated, magnetic data can often aid in their interpretation. The experiments conducted with the magnetometer to test hypotheses about feature function provided important information which could not have been obtained in any other manner. Although most excavations are subject to time constraints which preclude the design and execution of such experiments, long term projects can benefit by budgeting for experimentation designed to identify sources of magnetism. Such identification is a major step toward defining feature function. Finally, the necessity of communication between the archaeologist and the magnetic specialist cannot be emphasized strongly enough. The ability of a proton precession magnetometer to detect cultural anomalies depends on the geological and pedological properties of the site as well as the kinds of cultural features present. Data collection requires corrections for diurnal drift and a knowledge of natural factors that can adversely affect survey results. Once data have been collected, interpretation of the results requires a knowledge of the correct ratio of high and low components for cultural features in the latitude of the survey area, as well as a knowledge of filtering techniques necessary to remove extraneous responses. Only someone with training in remote sensing applications can be expected to interpret these data accurately. Archaeologists who believe that a magnetometer can be used with the ease of a metal detector and attempt to conduct surveys without the aid of a specialist will probably be disappointed in their results. Certainly their results will be less useful than they could be if the expertise of a specialist had been enlisted.

ANTHROPIC SOIL DISCOLORATION by James E. Bruseth Prior to commencement of the 1980-1981 testing season at Bird Point Island, information was supplied by Mr. Bill Young, an avoca- tional archaeologist from Corsicana, Texas, that a midden deposit existed at Bird Point Island. According to Young, the midden was detectable after the site had been cleared and plowed during the 1970s. Unfortunately, precise definition of the midden could not be made during the 1980-1981 season. Since one of the objectives of the Season II methodology at the site was an accurate definition of the midden through delineation of its dark soil color, two techniques were used to accomplish this. The first was aerial photography, with panchromatic and infrared black and white film. The other technique was the systematic collection of Munsell soil color values and computerized contouring of these values. Both techniques were used during Season II, and this chapter describes the methodologies employed and the results obtained. AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY METHODS Although the use of aerial photography has become a common tool of many archaeologists (Gumerman and Lyons 1971; Lyons and Avery 1977), the results that can be obtained on a given site are only generally known. Procedures for the interpretation of phe- nomena that are of potential archaeological significance are avail- able, but accurate identification of these phenomena often must be determined through site excavation. Consequently, the aerial pho- tography at Bird Point Island was planned as an experimental tool for delineating the limits of the midden, as well as for detecting potential features to aid subsequent site investigation. To minimize photographic variability caused by vegetation, the site was plowed. Two flights were made over the site. The first was flown at an altitude of 570 ft during sunny weather at midday. A 35 mm camera was used mounted to the bottom of a small aircraft, and Kodak pancromatic black-and-white film was used. The altitude was high enough to cover the site with a single frame. The second flight was flown at a lower altitude to achieve larger scale photographs. A series of 37 photographs was taken using Kodak black-and-white infrared film with the same camera used for the higher altitude photography. The individual frames were triggered by hand and sufficient overlap between frames was allowed to provide stereo pairs. RESULTS The aerial photographs produced from the two flights over Bird Point Island were not as successful as had been hoped. The first, and perhaps most important, cause of the poor results was a lack of ade- quate planning prior to actually taking the photographs. Unfor- tunately, too little attention to detail was paid to the percentage of coverage between adjacent photographs and to the scale. The coverage between frames (i.¢., overlap) and between rows of frames (i.e., sidelap) was poorly controlled, and as a result, adjacent rows of some photographs failed to have overlap and could not be used for distance measures. The lack of an adequate scale was most notable in the distortion of the image. This distortion, which prevented ground distances from being taken by direct measurements, was probably due to three factors: (1) optical dispacement, (2) tilting of the camera lens, and (3) terrain variations. The exact contribution of each of these is not known; but the first, optical displacement, was probably the largest contributor. A metrically corrected camera would have avoided this problem. Photographs then could be used for direct measurements and could be digitized for computer image enhancement and filtration. We had assumed that the pilot flying the airplane would take care of determining photographic scale and percent coverage. These variables, in retrospect, should have been decided by the archae- ologist in consultation with the pilot. Another problem with the aerial 155

156 photographs was that the film format (i.e., 35 mm) was too small for adequate enlargements. Although enlargements were made, the photographs were excessively grainy and recognition of small detail was difficult. A larger format film, such as 2-1/4 by 2-1/4, would have been more suitable. Aside from these difficulties, the aerial photos were useful during Season II field work. One major area of assistance was in locating portions of the site where brush from recent clearing had been piled and burned. Based on information from Young, three such locations were known approximately, and the aerial photos delineated the locations exactly. Consequently, charred remains found during excavation in the A horizon of these areas were discarded. Two other dark, soil color areas of suspected cultural origin were also found on the photographs. On both the infrared and panchro- matic photos, the general outline of the midden noted by Mr. Young was identified. The best definition was on the panchromatic film print, largely because the entire site was shown on a single frame. This allowed the slightly darker soil color of the midden to stand out, whereas on the larger scale infrared photos, the size of the midden cut across several frames and was difficult to observe. The other dark area was a small zone, about 3 to 4 m in diameter, on the northern third of the site. The area was examined in the field and it seemed to contain increased frequencies of charcoal as compared to sur- rounding areas. As a result, this area was thought initially to be simply another location where brush was burned during recent clearing of the site. However, the results of the spatial analysis of systematically collected artifacts from A horizon excavations at the site showed that charcoal was abundant in this area (see Chapter 13 and Figure 13- 9). The distribution of charcoal was found to overlie House 2, with an elongation to the southeast. Moreover, quality of the charcoal was not as ‘fresh’ as specimens from the recent brush-burned areas, and we interpret the charcoal to represent the remains of a structure, associated with the house pattern, that burned. The implications of this interpretation on overall community patterning are discussed in Chapters 13 and 14. SYSTEMATIC COLLECTION OF MUNSELL SOIL COLOR METHODS The differential distribution of Munsell color values for the soils across the site was used to help define midden boundaries. This Table 11-1 CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN MUNSELL COLOR CODES AND DIGITIZED VALUES Munsell Code Numeric Rank Hue Value Chroma Name 1 10YR 4 4 dark yellowish brown 2 10YR 4 3 brown 3 10YR 3 4 dark yellowish brown 4 10YR 3 3 dark brown 5 10YR 4 2 dark grayish brown 6 10YR 4 1 dark gray 7 10YR 3 2 very dark grayish brown 8 10YR 3 1 very dark gray 9 10YR 2 2 very dark brown 10 10YR 2 1 black Volume H, Part One Table 11-2 CONDENSED DiaiTiZED Soi, CONTOURS Contour Level on Numeric Fig. 11-1 Code General Color Range 1 1, 2,3 browns with yellowish tint 2 4, 5,6 dark browns with gray tint 3 7 very dark grayish brown 4 8,9, 10 very dark colors of gray, brown, and black technique, although somewhat experimental, has been used to define midden limits at the Spoonbill site in East Texas (Bruseth and Perttula 1981:42). Soil samples, consisting of about 10 g, were collected at 5 m intervals across the site. The samples were taken at a depth of 20 cm, or below the plow zone, and sealed in plastic bags to preserve soil moisture. Samples were collected below the plow zone to minimize the effect that plowing may have had upon soil color. When soil is churned by a plow, certain soil constituents such as organic matter will leach out more quickly and may cause the soil to display a lighter color (Ed Janak, personal communication 1983). Once the samples were collected they were brought back to the Project laboratory for processing. This consisted of opening each sample and identifying its color code on the Munsell Soil Color Chart (1975). Lighting was provided by a fluorescent light, and all observations were made by the same individual. The sample values were then entered into a microcomputer which digitized the Munsell color codes into numeric representations. The correspondence between color codes and digitized results are shown in Table 11-1. The digitized values were used to rank the Munsell color ordinally from lightest to darkest. This ranking reflects an attempt to relate both color value and chroma onto a single scale. These digitized values were then input into a SYMAP computer program to generate spatial maps of color values. The data were simplified from the ten values to four values or contour levels to provide a simpler map. The grouping of values into four levels also insured that noise arising from individual chromas or values being slightly out of order (a possibility, since some of the Munsell codes were difficult to rank exactly) was minimized. The ranges of Munsell values for each contour level are shown in Table 11-2. RESULTS The map produced by the SYMAP program is shown in Figure 11-1. Overall, the techniques worked well in identifying culturally relevant variability in soil color at the site. The midden, the primary area to be delimited, shows clearly and corresponds to the darkest soil color contour. This midden could not be visually defined by walking across the site during Season II. How Young was able to observe the midden after clearing in the early 1970s is unknown. Perhaps, since the site had been recently cleared, soil color was “fresher” and in subsequent years the dark soil color leached to a lighter color. The midden also corresponds to the distribution of surface and subsurface artifacts (see Chapter 13) corroborating the fact that the soil darkness is due to cultural factors and not to modern conditions or natural soil color variations. In addition, several other areas of dark soil color are observed elsewhere across the site. Two of these are locations where trees were piled and burned a decade ago when the site was cleared and also show on the aerial photographs. These areas are labeled ‘““Bumed Brush Areas” on Figure 11-1, and are characterized by substantial quantities of charcoal in the soil.

Bruseth and William A. Martin The objective of this chapter is to discuss the major classes of chronological data from the Bird Point Island site. Following this presentation, the data are integrated into a culture-historical framework that outlines the major periods of site occupation. This framework forms the foundation for the concluding chapter of this volume, which summarizes all the data and presents an overview of cultural activity at the site. Three classes of data are included in this chapter: (1) radiocarbon dates, (2) projectile point styles, and (3) ceramic artifacts. The first class, radiocarbon dates, has been presented to some degree in previous chapters whenever this information was needed, However, this prior presentation has often been brief, awaiting fuller explanation in this chapter; for this reason, the radiocarbon dates from the site are discussed in detail. The other two data classes, projectile point styles and ceramics, have been more fully explained elsewhere and are only summarized here. These data were presented in Chapters 7 and 8, respectively, as part of the overall analysis of artifacts from the site. Only the stylistic quality of the points, namely their typological ascriptions, are used in this chapter since these have primary temporal significance. Although a complete ceramic analysis was presented in Chapter 8, only that part of the analysis which uncovered chronologically meaningful results is used here. RADIOCARBON DATING A total of 26 carbon samples has been dated from Bird Point Island from a variety of contexts, including burials, pits, hearths, and post holes. During the collection process, every attempt was made to be discriminating in the choice of specimens and to be even more so in the final selection of samples to be submitted for dating. The overall goal of the radiometric dating program has been to obtain dates from the most meaningful contexts possible. Despite this intention, the dates listed in Table 12-1 show considerable variation in time, even among features of similar types from adjacent locations. In addition, several modern dates have been obtained from what seemed to be good contexts. The perplexing quality of many of the dates necessitates a detailed discussion of each one, especially in regard to how it relates to site interpretations. In some instances a date can be assumed to be a bad indicator based on its association with temporally sensitive ceramics or points. However, these artifacts are, at best, general chronological indicators and can only corroborate or reject the grossly errant dates, In other cases, spatial proximity of features can imply contemporaneity and thus give some indication of whether a radiocarbon date is acceptable or not. Implicit in this discussion is our intention not to let preconceived notions of site chronology shade our acceptance of data. This type of bias is impossible to eliminate entirely, but the discussion of our reasons for accepting or rejecting each date permits the reader to examine our logic. Basic information on each date is also presented to enable other conclusions to be made on intrasite chronology. The following discussion focuses on groups of dates that either are from similar contexts or have similar problems in regard to acceptability. Detailed comments on specific dates can be found in Table 12-1. The first group of dates is Beta-5590, Beta-5595, Beta-5597, and Beta-9106. All of these specimens were found to be modern. Two of these, Beta-5590 and Beta-5595, are from a shallow depth and from general midden deposits overlying Feature 1, (Figure 12-1). The stratigraphy within the pit was complex and these samples were collected in an attempt to date the upper zone of the Stratigraphy. Unfortunately, the shallow depth (i.e., between 20 and 40 cm) from which the samples were collected suggests that they were contaminated by modem carbon in the plow zone. The other two dates, Beta-5597 and Beta-9106, are more difficult to understand. Beta-5597 is from a depth of 80 cm within Feature 12 which was located within Feature 1. Feature 12 was an irregularly shaped pit located in the southwestern slope of Feature 1; no evidence of modern disturbance to the feature could be seen. The modern date, however, certainly suggests that disturbance of some type, possibly from gopher burrowing which was common in 159

Another group of dates, consisting of Beta-7156, Beta-7157, Beta-8388, and Beta-9101, are all from small, circular and basin shaped pits which are believed to be cremation burials.

The charcoal was associated with the burned bone and appears to accurately date the cremation to A.D. 720 + 140. Corroborating this is a sample dated to A.D. 700 + 100 (Beta- 5593) from the same stratigraphic zone, but outside the cremation. The other three dates are from possible cremation pits located in the northern half of the site. The pits are identified here as possible cremations, since the burned bone within them is too fragmented for clear identification. However, the proximity of these pits to others that have been positively identified as cremations, together with their near identical shape and size, strongly argues that all of these pits are cremations. Furthermore, the close spatial proximity of these features to one another argues for their contemporaniety (see Chapter 4 for further discussion). Radiocarbon dates from these pits, however, show a wide spread: 180 + 230 B.C., A.D. 1190 + 100, and A.D. 1590 + 220. The A.D. 1190 date is from the same period as the occupation of the houses, and since these pits are located between Houses 2 and 3 and do not overlap the houses, a good argument can be made that they are associated with this occupation. The 180 B.C. date may represent old charcoal from an earlier occupation of the site that was incorporated into the cremation pit fill. The later (A.D. 1590) date is more difficult to explain, but may be due to bioturbation. Finally, it should be noted that none of the carbon samples from these three pits had carbon in a context clearly associated with the cremated remains. In other words, it is possible that none of the three dates may be accurately dating the cremations. Two of the roasting pits on the site have been dated. These are Features 35 and 38, both located in the North area to the east of the three houses (Figure 12-1). Feature 35 was dated with several pieces of charcoal collected from a 1 m2 unit in the center of the feature. The charcoal fragments were distributed from 30 to 70 om below the surface, and a radiocarbon date of 30 + 220 B.C. was obtained. The large standard deviation is due to the small size of the carbon sample after cleaning (0.2 g). Feature 38 was also dated by several small pieces of charcoal scattered inside the pit. This roasting pit was dated to A.D. 1120 + 120 (Beta-9102). This date agrees well with one of A. D. 1030 + 250 (Beta-7158) from the

If the Feature 38 date is considered acceptable based on the corroborating date from House 1, then the date for Feature 35 must be considered suspect. Both features are nearly identical in size, shape, and content, and both are located to the east of houses (Feature 35 is adjacent to House 2).

Chronological Assessment argues for the contemporaneity of many of them, particularly the larger ones. There is a pronounced lack of superpositioning of features within the North area in contrast to the Midden area, where numerous examples of overlapping features are seen and where temporally sensitive artifacts suggest at least two substantial periods of occupation. For this reason, we believe that the 30 B.C. date from Feature 35 does not accurately date the feature and represents charcoal from some earlier Archaic occupation that was incorporated at a later date into the pit fill. Perhaps the best sequence of dates from a common context comes from Feature 1, the large pit. The stratigraphic sequence is presented in detail in Chapter 6, and is only briefly reviewed here. Three cultural zones have been defined for the pit. Zone 3 is associated with the Late Archaic period and represents initial construction and use of the pit for ritual activities. Four dates have been obtained from this zone, all from Burial 9/11. In each case, portions of the skeleton were dated because no other suitable dating material was available, and the temporal placement of this zone was critical for understanding site chronology. Since the reliability of radiocarbon dating of bone is somewhat controversial, samples were sent to two different labs. One sample was submitted to Beta Analytic, and the insoluble collagen fraction dated to A.D. 140 + 110 (Beta-5598). Samples were also submitted to the SMU radiocarbon lab, where three separate dates were run on bone apatite (bone mineral), soluble collagen, and insoluble collagen. The bone apatite date was A.D. 521 + 81 (SMU-1162) and was considered the least reliable by the lab director (Herbert Haas, personal communication 1985). The other two SMU dates were A.D. 36 + 203 and 107 + 239 B.C. The standard deviations of these two dates overlap with each other and with the standard deviation of the Beta date. Since different bone fractions were dated, an estimated midpoint of A.D. 1 was chosen.as the date of Burial 9/11 (and hence, Zone 3) instead of the strict numerical average. Zone 2 within Feature 1 consists of a layer of dark sandy loam above Zone 3. Two carbon dates have been obtained from this zone. One is from the cremation (Burials 19 and 20) discussed earlier that dates to A.D. 720 + 140. The other date is from charcoal outside the cremation, but at the same stratigraphic level. This date is A.D. 700 + 100 (Beta-5593), and these two dates together convincingly place this zone at A.D. 700. Above this zone are midden deposits labeled Zone 1 and part of the larger area on the southern half of the site referred to as the Midden (see Figure 1-1). Several radiometric determinations have been obtained on carbon specimens from the Midden. Two of the dates were obtained from within the plow zone, and as noted earlier, were determined by the lab to be modern. Dates from deeper levels in the Zone 1 midden, however, are good approximations of the age of these deposits. The dates are A.D. 1280 + 110 (Beta-5594), A. D. 1350 + 90 (Beta-5592), A.D. 1370 + 50 (Beta 5596), A.D. 1422 +56 (SMU-1130), and A.D.1510 + 60 (Beta-5591). The two latest dates (A.D. 1422 and 1510) are both from a log associated with Burial 8. The difference between the dates may well be due to different parts of the log having been dated; that is, one date may represent the interior portion and the other the exterior part of the log. The log diameter was sizable, and it could well have been a hundred years old or older when cut. If this is indeed the case, then the burial must date to sometime after A.D. 1510. The other three midden dates are all within 80 years of one another and indicate that the midden in this area was produced during the fourteenth century A.D. However, many of the ceramic artifacts from the Midden suggest an earlier temporal span, between A.D. 1000 and 1200. The ceramic decorations are similar to types associated with the early Caddoan period of East Texas (see Chapter 8), and identical ceramics within House 1, dated to A.D. 1030, A few ceramic decorations that are probably associated with the late Caddoan period do occur within the _ midden, but are rare in number. What may actually occur in the Zone 1 midden are two separate cultural layers. The dark soil color may have obscured their separation, and charcoal associated with the upper and more recent layer may have been churned 163 downward into the lower layer. This compares well with data from the Midden over Feature 1 that show substantial deposits from two temporally distinct components, one dating from the occupation of the houses around A.D. 1000-1200 and the other from sometime after A.D. 1300. Three additional dates from the site were collected from several features within the Midden. These are: A.D. 1080 + 70 (Beta-9105), A.D. 1280 + 280 (Beta- 7158), and A.D. 1290 + 60 (Beta-9107). The first date is from a pit (Feature 101) containing lithic debris and several large sherds. The sherds form major parts of two vessels and minor parts of several more. Identifiable sherds were very similar to the Late Caddoan type, Maydelle Incised. The dates associated with this type do not correspond with the carbon date, and presumably, older charcoal was incorporated into the pit fill during use, or alternatively, carbon from midden deposits around the pit was chumed into the fill. However, the date does fit well with ceramic types in the Midden overall, and is further evidence of occupation during the eleventh century A.D. The A.D. 1280 date is from a post hole in the Midden. No pattern with surrounding post holes could be observed, and the dated post hole does not seem to be associated with a structure. Only 0.1 g of carbon from this feature was datable, and as a result it is not known exactly what the charcoal represents. It is certainly not from the post that filled the hole, since there is little evidence of the post ever having been burned. Instead, the charcoal probably represents a specimen that was present in the Midden and was accidently incorporated into the pit. Consequently, the date is only useful as an indicator that occupation took place in the Midden during the specified time. The third date of A.D. 1290 is from a hearth, Feature 104. A large amount of charcoal was associated with this feature, as well as several burned pieces of Wilcox sandstone. Based on the large sample of charcoal, we consider this to be a good date and to accurately reflect the time of hearth use. ; Two additional dates were obtained from probable hearths in the North area of the site. These dates are A.D. 1440 + 230 (Beta- 9103) from Feature 103 and A.D. 1640 +. 60 (Beta-9104) from Feature 85. Both samples were charcoal recovered in pits containing oxidized clay and are assumed to be accurate. Although accurate, Beta-9102 is not very precise since it has a 230-year standard deviation. This is due to the small quantity of carbon available (0.15 g) for dating. Based on the foregoing review of the radiocarbon determinations from Bird Point Island, we can see that many dates appear to be valid and useful temporal indicators. These dates form the building blocks of our interpretations of intrasite structure discussed in Chapter 14, At the same time, several dates contradict other temporal indicators, such as ceramics, projectile points, and spatial associations. It is difficult to understand why more of the dates are not useful. All are probably accurate indicators of the dated charcoal, but whether they date the features from which they were collected is debatable. Although we attempted to follow the advice of Story and Valastro (1977:88) by collecting samples from discriminating contexts, our results suggest we did not receive the full benefits of this advice. Rather than simply selecting charcoal from within a pit or post hole, we should have selected charcoal that was definitely associated with a feature. For instance, the charcoal from Feature 104, a hearth, was clearly part of the fuel used for heating. Thus its radiocarbon date provided an accurate date of feature use. On the other hand, scattered bits of charcoal from a feature are suspect. The charcoal may be dating some unknown episode of cultural activity unrelated to the feature's use. This activity may have been contemporaneous with, or years older than, the pit. PROJECTILE POINT CHRONOLOGY A total of 734 reasonably complete projectile points was analyzed using the typological system outlined by Suhm et al. (1954) and modified by Suhm and Jelks (1962). Other typological refinements for Central and East Texas were also considered for

164 this analysis (Johnson 1962; Duffield 1963, Prewitt 1974b, 1981). The temporal estimates for each type are used only as general time indicators, and radiocarbon dates are used to refine the projectile point chronology for the site. Results of the typological analysis reveal point styles ranging from Early Archaic dart points through Late Prehistoric arrow points (see Chapter 7). The overall assemblage indicates repeated occupation of the site over the course of several millennia. The dart point styles associated with the Early to Middle Archaic period (Angostura, Bulverde, Marshall, Palmillas, Pedernales, and Yarbrough) are relatively scarce, indicating that Archaic occupation was sporadic. The Gary point is the most common dart point within all spatial subdivisions of the site, but it is a poor chronological indicator which appears to have been used from the Archaic period into the Late Prehistoric period. It is impossible to precisely define the extent or intensity of Archaic occupation because it is not possible to separate early Gary points from later points (except for the small variety). Arrow point styles vary considerably among the spatial subdivisions of the site. In the North area, Alba, unidentified contracting stem, and unidentified expanding stem types are most frequent. In the Midden, Alba, Perdiz, and unidentified contracting stem types are common. In the South, Alba is most common, followed by Perdiz (see Chapter 7). Based on the published temporal placement of Perdiz points (Suhm et al. 1954; Prewitt 1981), it appears that one early arrow-producing occupation was concentrated in the North and Midden areas, whereas a later arrow-producing occupation occurred on the southern portion of the site. This interpretation is supported by the fact that arrow points in general increase in frequency from the North area to the South area. ; Originally, the occurrence of dart points within all areas of the site was believed to represent widespread Archaic occupation. However, the consistent co-occurrence of dart and arrow points within features radiocarbon dated to the Late Prehistoric period Jed to the hypothesis that many dart points were contemporaneous with arrow points. To test this hypothesis, projectile points from features within House 1 (ca. A.D. 1030 + 250) and from Feature 38 (ca. A.D. 1120 + 120) were examined. Four of the five points associated with House 1 features were dart points, and all 17 points found in Feature 38 were dart points. This information demonstrates that dart points were in use during the Late Prehistoric period. CERAMIC CHRONOLOGY Although nearly 5,000 ceramic sherds were found during excavations at the site, the chronological value of these items is ‘minimal. There seems to have been minor change in their mode of manufacture and method of decoration throughout the Late Prehistoric occupation of the site. These areas of minor change are the focus of this section. , The primary evidence for temporal change in the ceramic assemblage at the site comes from comparison of sherds in the southern portions of the site (i.e., the South Midden and the South) to other parts of the site and from comparison of Zones | and 2 inside Feature 1, the large pit. Starting with the differences between the southern and the northern halves of the site, four attributes show temporal significance. The first of these is in the range of lip forms present. The most frequent lip forms at the site are rounded and squared. The rolled form, in contrast, occurs rarely, but when it does, it is found only in the South Midden and the South. This lip treatment is common on several Late Caddoan ceramic types (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Bruseth and Perttula 1981). The second attribute which tends to have chronological importance is the rim orientation of the complete vessel. As outlined in Chapter 8, few rims were large enough for this attribute to be observable, but where it could be seen, there is a tendency for inverted rims to occur in the South Midden and in the South, A third variable, again with smal! samples upon which to Volume II, Part One base conclusions, that shows temporal value is tempering. Shell temper, rare overall, shows up only in the Midden. This kind of temper occurs more frequently to the north of the Project area where it is thought to date relatively late (Lorrain 1969:14; Krieger 1946). Mention should be made that shell tempering has been found in the lowest level of Feature 1 at Adams Ranch and is dated to the Late Archaic period. The shell tempered ceramics from the Midden however, do not appear to be from Late Archaic occupations, but from Late Prehistoric use of the site. Fourth, the occurrence of a particular ceramic design element configuration adds another spatial-temporal clue. This element is the engraved and excised triangle. Almost certainly this decoration is part of a larger pattern of vessel decoration similar to that of the type Ripley: Engraved or Patton Engraved, but the small size of the sherds precludes accurate type association. From within the zones of Feature 1 we find additional data on the chronological meaning of the sherds. The context of this pit offers the best time control at the site, since discrete layering is observed within the feature. Although some degree of mixture of levels has occurred from bioturbation and prehistoric digging, radiocarbon dates show that sufficient integrity exists to warrant detailed examination. There is a tendency for more decorated sherds to occur in Zone 1 than in Zone 2, and Zone 1 dates between A.D. 1000 and 1650. Zone 2 dates from A.D. 580 to A.D. 860. The higher incidence of decorated sherds in Zone 1 is solely due to the higher frequency of engraving, which implies that this mode of vessel design was used more frequently during the later occupations at the site. It is worth noting that the engraved and excised triangle element configuration only occurs in Zone 1. In more general terms, these data show a pattern of limited temporal change in ceramics at the site. Overall, ceramics remained similar over time with comparable manufacturing techniques, similar clay sources, and similar decorations and vessel treatments being used. However, more decorated sherds occurred later (ie., after A.D. 1000). Also during this period or later, after A.D. 1300 based on dating of similar developments in East Texas (Bruseth and Perttula 1981), shell tempered, outflaring lips and carinated bowls may have been made occasionally. Design motifs that employed the element configuration of Engraved Triangles were used. The overail trend is similar to that seen in East Texas during the Caddoan archaeological period from the transition of Early to Late Caddo (Suhm et al. 1954; Krieger 1949). Despite the low frequency of ceramic artifacts, this similarity in ceramic change to the East Texas Caddo certainly argues for some type of repeated contact. OCCUPATION SEQUENCE AT BIRD POINT ISLAND Having reviewed the radiocarbon dates, projectile point styles, and ceramic data as to their applicability for intrasite dating, we are now able to view these data as a whole for isolating major periods of prehistoric occupation at Bird Point Island. Although individually each data set has yielded information about some of the major periods of site occupation, together the data serve to form a more complete framework for site chronology. Figure 12-2 graphically displays ali of the relevant radiocarbon dates from the site in chronological order along with their standard deviations. It should be noted that all carbon dates except modern determinations have been included in the graph. Although some of the samples do not date to the time of use of the feature from which they were obtained, they do provide a date of cultural activity at the site. Since we are interested in viewing the overall pattern of occupation at Bird Point Island, these dates provide useful information. If the dates are viewed without regard for their spatial contexts, then a relatively smooth overall trend is seen which lends support to the idea that the site has been occupied intermittently over a long period of time. At a more specific level, though, the graph of the dates shows several points in time that have few or no dates and other times with many averlapping dates.

Graph of uncalibrated radiocarbon dates from Bird Point Island. Although sampling bias may be partly to blame, we believe the lack of dates for certain periods is more a reflection of less intensive occupation. For instance, between A.D. 250 and A.D. 425 there was little or no occupation at the site. At the other extreme, however, multiple overlapping dates do not necessarily reflect increased occupation. For example, the five dates overlapping the period between A.D. 1 and A.D. 25 suggest an intensive occupation of the site. However, three of these dates (SMU-1173, SMU-1180, and Beta-5598) are bone dates from a single burial, Burial 9/11. The multiple dates from this individual tepresent our attempt to check, through redundancy, the reliability of bone dating. Thus, the number of overlapping dates here is not an accurate indicator of occupation intensity. ; The span of dates, viewed as a whole and with the above comments in mind, is an indicator of the major expanse of site occupation. Figure 12-2 shows several clusterings of dates, particularly when the midpoints are viewed. These clusters have been labeled to provide a basic radiometric chronology for the site. Gaps in the graph which are considered to be culturally relevant, and are therefore somewhat subjective, are used to formulate temporal boundaries for each occupation, but associated non-radiometric variables such as ceramic and projectile point types are also considered. Each of the occupations is reviewed briefly below. Although undoubtedly Bird Point Island was occupied repeatedly over millennia, only those occupations that have resulted in radiocarbon determinations and substantial occupational debris observable today are discussed. OCCUPATION I: LATE ARCHAIC The first major use of the site occurred around the time of Christ and is labeled Occupation I on Figure 12-2. With one standard deviation added, the dates from this period range from 410 B.C. to A.D. 250. Three of the dates are from Burial 9/11 from inside Feature 1, and the other two dates are from features in the North area of the site. Given the large sigma values and the deviation among ages of the bone dates from Burial 9/11, it is difficult to accurately estimate the temporal duration of this period. A span of approximately 300 years is indicated on Figure 12-2 based on the overlap of four or more date standard deviations (bone and charcoal dates included). Based on this a time frame of 170 B.C. to A.D, 130 is proposed, although this is at best a rough approximation. During this occupation, Feature 1 was excavated and used for human burial and roasting of plant and animal foods. The skeletal remains of seven individuals were recovered from Zone 3. Since 38% of the pit was excavated, we can estimate the total population of burials inside the pit. However, since excavations were concentrated more in the center than in the periphery of the pit, and because there seems to have been a tendency to bury in the central part of the pit, we estimate 50% of the total number of burials have been recovered. This indicates a total burial population of at least 14, but perhaps as many as 18 when infant underenumeration is taken into account (see Chapter 6). Two of the carbon dates for this period are from pits outside of Feature 1: one is from a roasting pit (Beta-7160) and one is from a cremation burial (Beta-7156). In both cases the charcoal which was collected was not integrally associated with the feature. Although it was collected from within the feature, it seems to represent Late Archaic period charcoal that was accidentally incorporated into the feature at a later time. This interpretation is supported by the physical similarity of these features to others which had later radiocarbon dates and temporally diagnostic artifacts. If this interpretation is correct, then all that can be concluded is that occupation did occur around the large pit, but did not result in features that are clearly identifiable with this period. Although several Late Archaic projectile point styles have been identified at the site, particularly from the North area, it is difficult to discern with any degree of reliability which styles are definitely attributable to this occupation. Certain styles, most notably Gary, seem to have been used for a long period of time, even into the Late Prehistoric period. However, styles from the lower levels of Feature 1 (Table 12-2), and also from excavations

No ceramic artifacts are known to be associated with this period of occupation, even though Late Archaic period shell tempered ceramics were discovered in Feature 1 at Adams Ranch (see Chapter 18). This suggests that the Late Archaic occupation at Bird Point Island predates the Late Archaic occupation at Adams Ranch. OCCUPATION I: RICHLAND CREEK PHASE The next major component on the site has been labeled Occupation II. In addition, phase names have been ascribed to this and the following occupations, in convention with the culture- history nomenclature presented in Part Two of Volume III. Although these phases are described in detail in Volume II, a brief discussion is in order here to clarify what is meant by the use of the term phase. We use this term to refer to a cultural episode that occurred within a given time and that possessed a given set of traits sufficiently distinctive to be separated from other cultural episodes. More specifically, a phase in the reservoir area is a period of time during which we have sufficient information on the types and styles of artifacts in use, the range of features present, the economic strategies employed, and the general internal structure of sites to say that this period is distinctive from other periods. Only a few sites are presently understood well enough to be used for the formation of phases. Only two radiocarbon dates are available for the Richland Creek phase at Bird Point Island, and both suggest a midpoint date of between A.D. 700 and 720. With standard deviations added, the dates range from A.D. 580 to 860; but the close correspondence of the midpoints, both of which are from the same stratigraphic level within Feature 1, argue for a relatively short occupation. One of the dates (Beta-8388) is from charcoal associated with Burials 19 and 20, both from the same cremation pit; and the other (Beta- 5593) is from the same stratigraphic position in the pit but outside of the cremation burial. No radiocarbon dates from this period have been identified outside of Feature 1, which indicates that little occupation occurred around the pit. It seems that occupation during this time was solely for the burial of cremated remains in the pit and that this process may have resulted in some debris accumulating over Feature I (i.e., the charcoal for date Beta- 5593) but nowhere else on the site. The main evidence for a phase designation comes from other sites in the area (See Volume IID). It is difficult to identify the projectile point or ceramic styles that were used during this period since we have no features other than a cremation to provide a temporally specific context. Based on the estimated time span of this period, it is probable that both arrow and dart points were used. In all probability some of the Gary points and earlier arrow points (e.g., Alba and Scallorn styles) belong to this occupation. The only evidence for use of ceramics from this occupation comes from Zone 2 within Feature 1. In this layer, as previously noted, a few sherds were found. However, due to reuse of the pit for roasting activities and other cultural and natural disturbances, it is difficult to determine if these ceramics were actually used by the occupants of the site during the Richland Creek Phase. If we assume they belong to this phase, then a lower incidence of decoration was used. OCCUPATION III: ROUND PRAIRIE PHASE Occupation ITI is by far the most extensive, and during this period a small hamlet was located on the site. An estimated 60% of all features, including the houses, belong to this occupation. This assignment of features is largely derived from the quantities of temporally diagnostic artifacts and the spatial arrangement of features, since the frequency of radiocarbon dates would suggest that this period was not as intensive as later periods. Four dates are considered to be from the Round Prairie phase: Beta-8387, Beta- 9102, Beta-9105, and Beta-7157. One date, Beta-8387, is from the hearth in the center of House | and is a critical temporal indicator for the phase. An estimated span of A.D. 1030 to 1190 represents the maximum deviation of the date midpoints, and the extremes in one standard deviation extend from A.D. 780 to A.D, 1290, Due to the low frequency of dates, any estimate of duration for this phase is somewhat arbitrary; however, a time frame of A.D. 1000 to 1200 is suggested as bracketing the period of site use. It should be noted that the actual length of occupation was almost certainly shorter than 200 years.

Based on the other points, styles that were most commonly used appear to have been Alba, Hayes, Scallorn, and Gary. Gary points, in particular, were by far the most common projectile point. From the data obtained as a result of the excavations inside House 1, the range of ceramics used by the inhabitants of this structure can be seen. Although ceramic vessels were rare, those found indicate that jars and other straight rim forms with rounded lips were most popular. Grog and sand were the most commonly used tempering agents, and vessels were decorated much of the time with incised and punctated designs similar to those found on the type Canton Incised. Engraving and slipping, although rare, were used. 167 OCCUPATIONS IV AND ¥: ST. ELMO PHASE We have grouped occupations IV and V into the St. Elmo phase, since we do not have sufficient evidence to justify a separate phase for each occupation. The only evidence in favor of separation is an 80-year gap in the radiocarbon chronology, and this alone is not considered adequate. Over 40% of the tadiocarbon dates from the site fall into the St. Elmo phase, but artifacts relating to this phase are less common than from the preceding Round Prairie phase. It is quite likely that individual occupations were relatively brief but recurrent; the lack of substantially built habitation structures suggests only temporary encampment at the site. ; This phase was long-lived at the site, extending from A.D. 1280 to A.D. 1640 base on radiocarbon date midpoints. The standard deviation extremes range from A.D. 1000 to 1810; this is biased considerably by two dates with unusually large standard deviations (Beta-7158 and Beta-9101). Ignoring these extremes in sigma values, an estimated phase range of A.D. 1300 to 1650 is offered. A similar range of projectile point types seems to have been used during this phase as was used during the previous Round Prairie phase, with two major exceptions. These are: (1) the less frequent use of Gary dart points and (2) the greatly increased use of Perdiz arrow points. The Perdiz points in particular seems to be a good indicator of this phase. The ceramic evidence indicates that much of the same technology, decorative form, and style of previous occupations continued to be employed during the St. Elmo phase. A few exceptions have been noted which show that shell tempering, _outflaring lips, carinated bowls, and design motifs using engraved and excised triangles were added to the preexisting ceramic inventory. However, as the radiocarbon dates suggest, several different periods of occupation may be represented in this phase, and the ceramic attributes mentioned above may relate only to one or a few of these occupations. In other words, it is quite possible that two or more distinct ceramic assemblages existed during this phase, and that we are not able to temporally discriminate between them. :

SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS by James E. Bruseth and William A. Martin This chapter presents the results of spatial analysis conducted on systematically collected artifacts from the site. Three data sets are used for this analysis. The first consists of artifacts collected during a surface collection of the site. The site was plowed prior to this activity, and all artifacts were gathered from 5 x 5 m squares. The second data set comprises artifacts from the excavation of 50 x 50 cm units systematically placed across much of the site. The units form a data base that is useful in making interpretations about cultural activity over large portions of the site and is valuable for assessing the merits of subsurface sampling relative to systematic surface collections. The third data set consists of artifacts collected from a block excavation over House 1. This house was partially exposed by a bulldozer trench during Season II. Approximately 60% of the pattern remained intact, and during Season IH this area was block excavated to obtain a sample from inside the house (see Chapter 3 for details on this excavation), CONTROLLED SURFACE COLLECTION Until recently, many archaeologists had assumed that disturbances caused by plowing were too great to allow the study of plow zone artifacts, except as crude indicators of subsurface features. Recent experiments conducted by tillage engineers and archaeologists have shown that agriculturally altered deposits follow predictable patterns of artifact displacement and breakage (Roper 1976; Kouwenhoven and Terpstra 1979; Nartov 1979; Lewarch 1979). Once these patterns are understood, plow zone data can be used effectively. Controlled surface collection has been shown to be a useful indicator of artifact populations for sites located on stable landforms in East Texas (Bruseth and Pertulla 1981). Since Bird Point Island is a terrace with a stable surface, it is ideal for this technique. The soil type, equipment used, direction of plowing, and length of plowing time all influence the displacement of artifacts (Lewarch 1979:106). Experiments have shown that longitudinal movement is greater than transverse movement and that objects at greater depth are less subject to movement than those near the surface. Vertical displacement is cumulative, and a point is reached after several equipment passes where further cultivation will not change this distribution. Lateral displacement, on the other hand, can be randomized by the effects of multiple equipment passes. In fact, multiple passes may disturb the original context less than a single pass would (Lewarch 1979:106). Prior to surface collection at Bird Point Island, the site was plowed twice, with tractor passes in opposite directions to randomize lateral artifact displacement and to insure consistent soil exposure. After sufficient rainfall had exposed artifacts, collection began. A unit size of 5 x 5 m was selected. Collection units were demarcated quickly by setting stakes at 5 m intervals in between 20 m grid stakes and stretching string between them. One 20 x 20 m block (16 units) was collected at a time with 10 crew members working one to a unit. All artifacts were collected regardless of size of class, and no time limit was imposed. The northwest comer of each unit was used to designate provenience, and specimen bags were labeled only by supervisors to minimize errors. A total of 31 blocks (496 units) was collected with a minimal amount of labor (30 person-days). - In the laboratory, artifacts were sorted into the following morphological categories: lithic debris, biface, core, uniface, projectile point, ground stone, miscellaneous stone (including fire cracked rock), ceramics, baked clay, bone, and shell. Lithic debris included whole flakes, broken flakes, and shatter. Miscellaneous stone consisted primarily of fire cracked rock but also included unmodified cobbles. Artifact data were entered onto microcomputers in the laboratory and subsequently were transferred by telephone to the main computer in the Bradfield Computer Center at Southern Methodist University. This permitted access to the SYMAP program, a synographic computer mapping program which uses a complex algorithm to construct contours of similar artifact frequencies. This program allows the use to select the number of contours and the interval magnitude for each contour. Five contour intervals were used, based on studies conducted by Bruseth and Perttula (1981) which have shown that this number is optimal for sites in eastern Texas. 169

170 SYMAPs generated for all artifact classes were examined to search for evidence of specialized work areas. However, because stone tool manufacture was conducted in and around other activity areas, such as houses, hearths, and specialized work areas, the quantity of lithic debris was substantially greater than the quantity of other artifacts deposited. As a result, the lithic debris SYMAP provided the clearest view of the principal activity areas at the site. Figure 13-1 shows the major activity areas delineated by surface lithic debris distribution. The Midden south of Feature 1 is clearly visible as a large cluster extending from 30N to -25N and from -20E to 50E. Within this large cluster are smaller, high-density clusters which mark hot spots of activity. A dramatic decline in frequency occurs south of this Midden, until another cluster is encountered adjacent to the slough from -70N to -80N and OE to 20E. Finally, several small clusters are visible on the north half of the site, which lacks the high-density clusters found within the Midden. SYSTEMATIC SUBSURFACE COLLECTION During Season JI at Bird Point Island, a major emphasis of the field work was the excavation of systematically placed 50 x 50 cm units spaced 5 m apart. Details on the excavation procedures and screening methods of this work are presented in Chapter 3. Although this method of excavation had been employed on several historic sites in the Project area, it had not been used on prehistoric sites and useful results could not be guaranteed. Consequently the 5 m spacing was selected to minimize the time spent on this activity. After analysis, the artifact data were input into the SYMAP computer program to produce maps of artifact density. The maps showed that several clusters occurred for most artifact classes and the clusters were highly interpretable when compared with the locations of features. The initial success of the maps prompted the excavation of additional 50 x 50 cm units during Season III field work; these units were placed in between the 5 m units to increase the map resolution in the hope of providing even greater interpretability. This resulted in a final spacing of 1.67 m. However, since the 1.67 m spacing greatly increased excavation time over the 5 m spacing, not all of the areas sampled during Season II could be sampled during Season III (see Figure 3-5). Despite this limitation, more than 6,000 m2 of the site were sampled by this technique, including the highest elevations of the site where the principal cultural activity took place. Spatial imaging of the new data set was undertaken in a more complex manner than for the 5 m data alone. The 1.67 m interval data set encompassed several areas where adjacent 50 x 50 cm units were missing due to bulldozer test trenches that had been cut across the site. Program SYMAP was used to interpolate across these areas in order to provide a spatially complete data set. Next the output from SYMAP was smoothed by a custom program to provide more interpretable maps. Due to the fine grained sampling, the unsmoothed data had a very patchy quality with frequencies in adjacent units varying 50% or more in some instances. Although large scale trends were apparent in the data, these were difficult to define and in places were obscured by the patchy quality. Since the goal of the systematically spaced units was to sample site variability over large areas at the the sacrifice of localized detail, data smoothing was considered a necessary step in the interpretation process. The smoothing program selected 16 units surrounding a central point and computed a weighted average to replace the central value. The values were weighted so that units closer to the center were counted more heavily than units located further from it. This procedure allowed large scale trends in the data to become more clearly visible. Once the data were smoothed, they were input into a spatial contouring program developed by Robert Huggins. This program permited user interaction and instantaneous modification of Volume II, Part One NORTH 120 100 80 -20 -20 0 20 40 EAST PIECES OF LITHIC DEBRIS Clo.

This interactive capability permitted rapid selection of the opti- mum contour range for each artifact class.

Figure 13-2 shows the smoothed map for lithic debris. Portions of the map are based on 5 m data only and portions on 1.67 m data. Figure 3-5 should be referenced to determine the areas of the site that are covered by each of the data spacing schemes, Five features are superimposed over the map: Houses 1, 2, and 3, Feature 1, and the outline of the Midden. These are the major features at the site and are shown for convenience in comparison with artifact densities and as registration points for intermap comparisons. Two major lithic clusters occur at the site, one in the North area of the site and the other in the Midden area; both clusters tend to occur over the higher elevations of the site. The clusters are defined by the occurrence of 20 or more pieces of lithic debris per 50 x 50 cm unit. Within each major cluster, several smaller clusters of even higher density occur. These indicate areas of 28 to 48 artifacts per 50 x 50 cm unit for the next denser cluster and 48 to 92 artifacts for the highest cluster. In the North area, high- density clusters occur partially over and to one side of Houses 1 and 2. No high-density clusters occur over House 3, although the house is located within the first-level cluster in the North. The high-density clusters over Houses 1 and 2 show locations where lithic debris noticeably increases in frequency and indicate 171 120N Feature 1 -20N PIECES OF HEAT TREATED LITHIC DEBRIS [] o-8 9-13 14 - 21 MM 22 «43 Figure 13-3. Distribution of A horizon heat treated lithic debris. probable areas of intensive stone tool manufacture and use. The. clusters are located on opposite sides of each house but are situated towards House 3 and suggest that stone tool manufacture and use was directed to a "plaza" between the houses. The first-level cluster that incorporates all of the houses probably represents the limits of less intensive stone tool manufacturing. Two elongations, one to the west and one to the east, occur on the first-level cluster in the north. These do not correlate with features and may | represent either isolated activity areas or trash dumps. Considering their locations down the slopes of the site, trash disposal is a likely interpretation. Within the Midden a single large cluster occurs. Three contours make up this cluster and indicate that it is the location of the highest density of lithic debris at the site. There is a tendency for lithic debris to be more numerous over several of the large pits in the Midden (e.g., Features 42, 45, and 54) but the large size and general lack of internal detail of the cluster precludes more localized interpretation. Figure 13-3 is the spatial map of heat treated lithic debris. In the laboratory heat treatment was identified by a reddish color imparted to local quartzites and by various other color changes on

This attribute of lithic debris was examined as a means of determining if chert heat treatment was clustered around features at the site interpreted to be roasting pits. Such clustering would indicate that these pits were multi-functional, being used also to heat treat cobbles prior to flaking. This also assumes that the cobbles were subsequently worked in the vicinity of the pits. As Figure 13-3 shows, however, heat treated lithics do not occur consistently over the roasting pits and instead show a distribution similar to total lithic debris. Although some minor differences do occur between the two distributions, it is difficult to assess whether these are the result of variation in the heat treating of the raw material, sampling bias, or variability in the laboratory in identifying heat treatment. All these possibilities are probably involved. Thus we are left with a general interpretation that heat treatment was undertaken on a more or less even percentage of the lithic raw materials and, further, that the heat treated materials were worked in the same location as the nonheat treated materials. This interpretation, however, does not disprove the original hypothesis that heat treating took place in the roasting pits. The distribution of heat treated debris indicates only those locations Volume IT, Part One 120N -20N -20E 60E LARGE FRAGMENTS OF FIRE CRACKED ROCK CL] 0-6 - 10 - 22 Mi 23-78 Figure 13-5.

The roasting pits could well have functioned in this capacity, but we simply do not have direct indication of this. Figure 13-4 is the spatial map for ceramics. Overall, the distribution is similar to the distribution for lithic debris. At a more detailed level, however, some important differences are apparent. In the North area ceramic clusters occur in association with each of the three houses. In particular, House 3, which did not have a lithic debris cluster of similar density to Houses 1 and 2, has a ceramic cluster comparable in density to the other two houses. As noted in Chapter 4, House 3 had the most poorly defined post hole pattern of the three houses, and a question was raised as to whether the pattern actually represented a house or instead represented the remains of a ramada or other covered work area. Since lithic debris correlates only with Houses 1 and 2, while ceramics correlate with all three houses, the implication is that House 3 functioned in a different manner from the other two houses. Based on this evidence, a non-dwelling function in which activities such as cooking were undertaken may be a more accurate interpretation of House 3. Although this suggests that a different name might be better used when referring to the post hole pattern

ne ON BROMPCRAPESRPR RR Ge HB AK Spatial Analysis of House 3, we continue this usage to standardize the terminology of this report. In Chapter 14 we expand the discussion of function of the houses, and this chapter should be referenced for our final interpretations based on all data. Further comparison of the lithic debris and ceramic clusters associated with Houses 1 and 2 provides additional information. The cluster of ceramics associated with House 1 is located over and to the northeast of the house and compares closely with the cluster of lithic debris associated with the house. House 2, on the other hand, does not show a correspondence between lithics and ceramics, Ceramics are located to the north of the house, whereas lithics are situated to the southwest of the house. In addition, several small clusters of ceramics occur over much of the North area and are not directly associated with any of the houses. In fact, the overall distribution of ceramics, despite computerized smoothing of the data, remains patchy in contrast with the map of lithic debris which shows a much smoother overall distribution, The differences between the two are partially related to differences in sample sizes. Up to 48 pieces of lithic debris were collected from individual units in the North compared with a maximum of 14 sherds from units in this area. The higher frequency of lithic debris accounts for some of the differences in smoothness between the two distributions. Some portion of the differences, though, is probably related to the relative intensity of ceramic and lithic activities in the North. Lithic tool working seems to have been undertaken over a broad area. A few clusters of increased activity occur, but generally lithic tool manufacture was a spatially restricted task. Ceramic use, probably associated with cooking activities, occurred in more localized locations, suggesting that this task was spatially Jess restricted. The distribution of ceramics within the Midden shows a large overall cluster with numerous localized clusters. The basic pattern is similar to lithic debris in that the central portion of the Midden contains the greatest frequency of artifacts. However, ceramics show a tendency to be more concentrated in the southern third of the Midden, indicating that ceramic-related activity occurred more frequently in this area. As noted in Chapter 12, the Midden appears to be the product of two major periods of occupation at the site: one between A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1200 and one from A.D. 1300 to A.D. 1650 or later. Both of these occupations used ceramics and the sherds from the Midden are believed to be the product of both occupations. The heavier frequency of ceramics in the southern third of the Midden may irdicate that the later occupation, which occurs mostly in the southern half of the site, was more intense in this area. The results of the ceramic analysis, which showed a higher frequency of late period (A.D. 1300-1650) attributes in this area, also support this conclusion. Figure 13-5 shows the distribution of large (greater than 2.5 cm) pieces of fire cracked rock and Figure 13-6 the distribution of small pieces of fire cracked rock (between 1 and 2.5 cm), Fire cracked rock was size graded in the laboratory into these two groups to investigate any differential spatial distributions each size might have, The impetus for this action was an observation made in the field that smaller fire cracked rock seemed to occur in clusters away from larger pieces. Spatial maps were then produced on each of these data sets. The two maps show significantly different distributions. Large fire cracked rock occurs mostly across the southern half of the map and is clustered into several distinct groups. Most small fire cracked rock, on the other hand, is | located in a single northeast to southwest extending cluster that follows the crest of the site. As discussed in Chapter 10, the small pieces of fire cracked rock correlate with magnetic anomalies, | particularly in the North area. Chapter 10 presents the argument that the small pieces represent the residue of earth oven Toasting with Wilcox sandstone, the raw material used for fire cracked rock. This conclusion was reached after detailed experiments were conducted on Wilcox sandstone to observe the action of heat upon this material. Substantial amounts of each stone were exfoliated by the heat, and the residue of this process was numerous pieces of bumed Wilcox sandstone identical in size and appearance to the small category of fire cracked rock identified in the laboratory. 173 Chapter 10 also notes that the Wilcox sandstone is weakly magnetic in a natural state but becomes highly magnetic after firing. Therefore, the correlation of magnetic anomalies with small pieces of fire cracked rock shows that these rocks have been heated and further supports the notion that the small pieces of rock are residue from pit roasting. The distribution of large pieces of fire cracked rock appears to represent the location of Wilcox sandstone that has not been subjected to heat. A possible clue to the purpose of the large, unburned rock comes from the cluster located immediately outside of and to the southwest of House 1. The location of this large fire cracked rock cluster lacks a corresponding cluster on the small fire cracked rock map. In fact, the map of small fire cracked rock distribution shows a frequency “low” in the same location as the large fire cracked rock cluster. Since no large magnetic anomaly was located in this area, we know that this cluster is unburned rock and not really fire cracked. The lack of subsurface pits in this area further supports the argument that the rock was not used for roasting. What then was the purpose of the large rock in this cluster? ‘ A possible clue is the seasonal availability of the outcrop of Wilcox sandstone along the southern margin of the site. During the rainy season in this part of Texas, which occurs from March through June, the outcrop is often inundated by the overflow of Richland Creek. The periods of flooding are not predictable within the rainy season and are related to the occurrence of major storms. In contrast, an important plant food that was roasted in the pits, Psoralea tubers, is a predictable resource that must be gathered and processed within a two to three week period beginning in early May (Wedel 1978). This period occurs in the middle of the rainy season, and it is likely that Wilcox sandstone was collected and stored to provide an adequate supply for later Psoralea processing. As a result, the sandstone cluster on the southwestern side of the house may represent the remains of such a storage location. This is not to imply that the entire cluster, measuring 7 x 20 m, was used at once, but that several episodes of small scale storage likely took place over many years and resulted in what appears today as the large cluster. The rock that makes up this cluster probably represents residual pieces that were not used and were ultimately churned into the A horizon, In the Midden the examples of inverse relationships between the large and small fire cracked rocks are not as clear. The Midden is thought to represent debris from two major periods of site occupations, and the spatial patterns of fire cracked rock are difficult to interpret. Although some areas of large, unburned rock occur where there is a corresponding lack of small pieces, various degrees of overlap occur more frequently. This general lack of clarity in the patterns is believed to be due to overlapping activities. Figure 13-7 is the spatial map for bone. Unlike the previous spatial maps, bone shows a markedly reduced distribution, partly the result of a smaller sample size. A single small cluster of bone is located in the North part of the site. Since no other bone clusters occur in this area, this material may be modern and unrelated to prehistoric activity at the site. The soil conditions on the North result in poor bone preservation (see Chapter 2), which may account for the lack of bone recovered in this area. Bone is better preserved in the Midden and the principal clustering is in the central part. Lithic debris occurs over much of the area where bone is found and the major clusters of ceramics are found around the bone concentrations to the west and the south. In addition, the spatial clustering of bone shows’ prominently over Feature 45, a proposed roasting pit. The distribution of shell is displayed in Figure 13-8. Shell shows a very similar distribution to bone with dominance in the Midden. A cluster of shell shows over Feature 45, as was the case with bone, and these two faunal residues may indicate that the pit was used for trash disposal after it ceased to be used for plant roasting. Perhaps the broader distributions of shell and bone, which show overall correspondence, indicate that trash disposal took place in the central part of the Midden.

Figure 13-9 shows the distribution of baked clay. This artifact category, although more numerous than shell and bone, shows a patchy distribution due to the small sample size. In the North area, baked clay is scarce. A major concentration is detected over House 1 and represents baked clay associated with use of the hearth in the center of the house. Although the concentration of the cluster is not directly in the center of the house, this is probably a result of the 1.67 m spacing of the units that make up the map. These maps have a spatial error up to 1.67 m. The other smail clusters are not easily interpretable, although they may relate to small hearths that were sampled by the 50 x 50 cm units. Interestingly, no hearths were detected over Houses 2 and 3. This is not surprising for House 3 since this structure is thought to be a covered work area rather than a house, but House 2 is certainly a structure identical to House 1. The lack of a hearth suggests that either this house functioned in a different manner than House 1 (i.e., summer vs. winter house; cf., Swanton 1946) or that the house was not occupied as long. In the Midden, bummed clay occurs more frequently, with a particularly high density cluster in the center of the Midden.

Distribution of A horizon bone. this area of the site there is a correlation between baked clay and ceramics although the correlation is not perfect. With this in mind, the overall distribution in the Midden suggests that hearth cooking involving ceramics took place in the central and southern portions of the Midden and that trash disposal, based on the maps of bone and shell, occurred slightly to the east of the cooking area. The distribution of charcoal, shown in Figure 13-10, adds an important piece of information concerning House 2, Three charcoal clusters are seen on the map; the northwestern and southwestern clusters are both from recent tree burning when the site was cleared about 10 years ago (Bill Young, personal communication 1983). The remaining cluster is over House 2, and despite reservations in the field about the antiquity of this charcoal, it now is thought to be prehistoric and in some way associated with House 2. Our initial reservations about the charcoal stemmed from the "fresh" quality of this material and the fact that it was largely from the A horizon. Unlike much of the clearly older charcoal from features at the site, specimens from this area were brittle and well preserved. However, once the hearth from the center of House 1 was excavated and the charcoal

That is, the charcoal from this clearly prehistoric feature was-also fresh-looking and from the A horizon. If our assumption is correct, that the charcoal cluster over House 2 is prehistoric, this adds an important clue to the function of House 1. As mentioned during the discussion of the baked clay Spatial map, no concentration was observed over House 2. House 1, in contrast, possessed a large and clearly defined cluster. A reasonable hypothesis is that House 2 burned prior to intensive use | and that the charcoal concentration is burned debris from the house. Although some artifact clusters occur over the house, most notably ceramics and lithics, the clusters are smaller than the concentrations over House 1. These data suggest that the structure was occupied long enough to establish an artifact residue but not long enough to create a distinctive central hearth, perhaps within the range of a year or less. The other small charcoal.concentrations scattered across the site represent locations where individual 50 x 50 cm units encountered isolated amounts of charcoal. Considering the sporadic and almost random nature of these small clusters, they 175 120N -20N -20E , 60E Figure 13-9. Distribution of A horizon baked clay. are difficult to interpret. They may represent residue from prehistoric activity or pieces of charcoal from recent burning at the site. HOUSE 1 MAPS House 1 was discovered during the initial phase of A horizon removal at the site. The purpose of this activity was to look for features which were only visible at the contact between the sandy loam A horizon and the sandy clay B horizon. Nine east-west trenches were excavated across the site with a bulldozer, and during this process approximately 40% of the house was exposed. As a result of this discovery, a decision was made to block excavate the remainder of the house so that spatial analysis could be undertaken on the artifacts. This intra-house level of information was considered a good complement to the site-wide patterns observed from the systematic 50 x 50 cm units. A total of 46 1 x 1 m units was excavated; two levels of vertical provenience were maintained. Level 1 consisted of the top 15 to 20 cm and included the plow zone. Level 2 was the soil from below level 1 to the top of

176 Volume HH, Part One 120N Figure 13-13 is a map of the distribution of ceramics from within House 1. Again a single primary cluster is seen over Feature 57, the hearth. However, in this instance an elongation of the cluster to the west is also observed, which may indicate where food was prepared prior to cooking. In addition, an overall lower level cluster is apparent through much of the house pattern with an extension to the northeast. A cluster extension in this same direction was also observed with fire cracked rock which may indicate that an entranceway existed on this side of the house. The distribution of baked clay within House 1 is shown on Figure 13-14. A more restricted overall distribution is seen with two smaller but more intense clusters on either side of the central hearth. These smaller clusters are difficult to interpret, but may be related to cleaning of burned soil from this feature. Figure 13-15 shows the pattern of lithic debris from the house. Since this was the most common artifact class, an overall denser map is seen. These greater samples also give us better definition on where activities took place inside the house. Significantly, the hearth shows up as a negative on the map indicating that lithic debris was deposited around the central fire. This is in contrast to the previous artifact distributions, and demonstrates that flint knapping took place around the hearth, while cooking activities were undertaken over the hearth. While this conclusion is not unexpected, the fact that it can be empirically shown is significant; usually archaeologists must simply assume such distributions. The concentration of lithic debris between the interior posts of the house suggests that flint knapping was restricted to between the house interior posts. Although this artifact type was encountered between the interior and wall posts, the frequencies were much less than in the central portion of the house.

Since the subsurface pits found within House 1 occurred principally between the interior posts and the central hearth (see Figure 4-18), most storage would have been above ground, Figure 13-16 is a map of the pattern of bifaces from House 1. The distribution is remarkably similar to lithic debris and suggests that bifacial reduction was the objective of the flint knapping that produced the debris. A semicircular distribution is observed with a low frequency area over the hearth and a primary clustering inside of the interior posts. Importantly, two greater clusters are apparent inside the semicircular cluster and denote the locations where flint knapping activities were conducted more often. The bifaces from these two clusters have been examined in Chapter 7 and shown to principally be aborted bifaces, or rejects of the flint knapping process. Another cluster is located outside of the house to the north, This cluster, in contrast, consists of finished tools and broken bifaces, and represents the location where finished tools were used for some activity. The final distribution map (Figure 13-17) is of projectile points (both darts and arrows). Despite these artifacts also being lithic tools, they show a markedly different pattern than that seen for lithic debris or bifaces. These are finished tools that were discarded from use as opposed to bifaces and debris that were CO 6-8 gammas 8-17 gammas 177 discarded from stone tool manufacture. The points are located in four primary clusters. One is situated over the hearth and demonstrates that these items were either involved with food processing prior to heating or with cooking. Two of the other clusters are located within the house, but are situated between the interior posts and the exterior posts. As mentioned previously, several artifact classes show low-density clusters over this part of the house, which may suggest the location of an entranceway along the northeastern wall of the house. The remaining cluster of projectile points is located to the northwest of the house and represents an activity of unknown purpose. CONCLUSION The systematic collection of artifacts from the site has formed an important data source for making cultural interpretations at the intrasite level. Although several suggestions on what these distributions indicate have been made in this section, Chapter 14 uses these data to form an overall synthesis of intrasite cultural behavior. It must be pointed out that not all of the spatial data sets are equally as valuable. The surface collected data basically mirrored the distributions produced by subsurface artifacts. However, the surface matetials showed a general blurring of cluster outlines and an inability to reliably detect smaller clusters. The value of the surface data must be viewed in relation to the relatively short amount of time spent on this activity (see Chapter 3 for details). Within this perspective, it did produce useful data to plan subsequent work; however, for little additional time the cone" 3.

PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT AT BIRD POINT ISLAND by James E. Bruseth and William A. Martin . In the previous chapters of this report, information has been presented from five seasons of field work at Bird Point Island. Each chapter has concentrated on a specific set of data, such as lithic artifacts or subsistence remains, with little concern for the broader interrelationships of the data. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize the major points of the earlier chapters and use this information to formulate an overall intrepretation of prehistoric settlement at the site. The format of this presentation is by the major periods of site occupation outlined in Chapter 12. Although the site has undoubtedly been visited numerous times over the past several millennia, major periods of occupation are evident from only four periods: Late Archaic, Richland Creek phase, Round Prairie phase, and St. Elmo phase. Each period forms a major division later in this chapter. Mention should also be made of the hypotheses, formulated during the survey and testing phase of the project (Raab and Moir 1982), that initially served to guide research at the site. These hypotheses pertained to the age and function of Feature 1 (see Chapter 1), and the results that bear upon each hypothesis are presented within the appropriate time period. INTEGRATIVE PROBLEMS Within each of the temporal periods of site ocupation, five problem areas are addressed as a means of synthesizing the site data and presenting a picture of cultural activity. Hopefully, the investigation of these problem areas serves to elevate the discussion from the simple presentation of trends in the data to an understanding of cultural behavior for the groups present during each period of occupation. The first problem area is the definition of architectural features. Specifically, this refers to pits and above ground structures constructed during each period, such as houses, drying racks, and ramadas, as denoted by features such as post holes, 181 hearths, and storage pits. Discussion of the second problem area employs the spatial data presented in Chapters 11 and 13 to identify the locations of activities on the site and to understand overall community patterning. The distribution of features presented in Chapter 4 is also used. Since the site has multiple components with a certain degree of spatial overlap, features are assigned to periods of occupation according to the criteria used in Chapter 4 (see Table 4-10); however, as previously noted, the temporal assignments in some cases are only estimates. The third problem area focuses on the economic strategy utilized by each group to maintain an adequate food supply. The data from Chapter 9 are used to understand the patterns of economic exploitation for each time period. Even though the preservation of subsistence remains at the site was relatively poor, overall trends in the exploitation of food species can be seen. The fourth problem concerns the size of the occupying group during each period. This problem area is more difficult to address since some occupations represent accumulations of debris from sporadic visits over several decades or centuries, whereas other occupations reflect the accumulation of debris from sedentary habitation. Estimates of population size for mobile groups are less likely to be accurate than those for sedentary groups. Similarly, the final problem is the duration of occupation for each group and is equally difficult to estimate; particularly for the mobile groups who occupied the site. ; It is not possible to address all problems for every time period because the quality and quantity of data attributable to each period varies markedly, and little or no information exists for some problem areas during certain periods. For example, even though Late Archaic projectile points are found across the site, the only clearly dated Late Archaic context is Zone 3 of Feature 1. Other artifacts found outside of Feature 1 are almost certainly related to the Late Archaic occupation, but only the diagnostic projectile points can be separated with certainty from the lithic debris and stone tools of later occupations. As a result, it is very difficult to define the community layout for this period. Therefore, only those problems for which meaningful conclusions can be reached are discussed.

182 OCCUPATION I: LATE ARCHAIC (170 B.C. TO A.D. 130) Projectile points attributable to all periods of the Archaic have been found at the site, but the only recognizable cultural activity in good context is found within Zone 3 of Feature 1. As stated in the conclusion of Chapter 6, Feature 1 represents four major periods of use, beginning with the Archaic period. Originally, Feature 1 was the focus of ritual activity involving the processing of plant and animal foods, as well as the interment of deceased humans and dogs. The means of several radiocarbon dates from skeletal remains in Zone 3 range between 170 B.C. and A.D. 130 (see Chapter 12). This supports the hypothesis posited prior to mitigation that the pit had a Late Archaic origin (Raab and Moir 1981:203). Few conclusions can be drawn for the Late Archaic group with respect to the five problem areas outlined above because so few data were clearly associated with this occupation. No conclusions about architectural features can be made other than that despite extensive work inside Feature 1, no evidence of a superstructure was found within or around the pit. Likewise, few conclusions can be made regarding intrasite activity since few artifacts can be positively associated with the people who first occupied the site. Nevertheless, the paucity of Late Archaic features and associated artifacts indicates that only short term occupations occurred during this period. The subsistence strategy employed by this early group can be inferred on the basis of faunal remains found in Zone 3 of Feature 1. Bone preservation was better in this context than in any other found on the site, and a varied assemblage was collected. Whitetail deer dominated the assemblage, but fish, turtle, bird, rabbit, bison, and opossum were also consumed. Dog remains were found in Zone 3, but most are attributable to intentional interments rather than to use for food. Although very few floral remains were recovered, the most important appear to have been hickory nuts, acoms, and Psoralea tubers. A diffuse economic strategy in which a wide variety of species were used appears to have been practiced (Cleland 1976). The size of the Late Archaic group and the length of occupation are largely speculative. From the relatively low quantities of artifacts attributable to this period, it would appear that only limited, short-term occupations occurred. However, this is based on the few artifacts that can be definitely associated with this occupation; it is quite probable that many of the lithic artifacts from A horizon contexts around Feature 1 may be associated with Late Archaic occupations. Based on the present data, the best interpretation for Late Archaic period use of the site is that it served as a location for interband feasting and as a cemetery for local hunting and gathering groups (see Chapter 21). Seven burials were found in the central portion of Zone 3 that was excavated (nearly 50% of the central portion), suggesting that 14 individuals may have been present. Accounting for possible infant underenumeration, there may have been as many as 18 individuals interred in Feature 1. Although this estimate is speculative, such a group size is compatible with mortality expectations for a small band. OCCUPATION II: RICHLAND CREEK PHASE (A.D. 580 TO 860) Little is known about this period of occupation at the site. It is marked only by two cremations in the upper portion of Zone 2 in Feature 1 (see Chapter 6). Although artifacts from this occupation probably occur elsewhere on the site, the imprecise chronology for most artifacts prevents the detection of these deposits. In fact, the rationale for classifying this occupation as a "phase" comes from data recovered at other sites in the reservoir (see Chapter 15, Volume III). Consequently, discussions of architecture, intrasite activity areas, subsistence strategy, group size, and duration of Volume II, Part One occupation are presented in Chapter 18 of Volume III. It can be said here that the overall pattern of this phase is similar to that of the Late Archaic and is marked by the diffuse economy but with a less mobile settlement pattern. It is possible that the concentration of features immediately south and east of Feature 1 represents Richland Creek phase activity, although no radiocarbon dates were obtained from any of these features which would permit exact chronological placement. The presence of cremation Burial 27 immediately southwest of Feature 1, and the fact that other features excavated in this area look very similar to cremations found elsewhere on the site, suggest that at least some of the activity in this area is related to the Richland Creek phase. Since Richland Creek phase cremations were placed within Feature 1, the presence of one, and possibly several, cremations in this area may represent an extension of the cemetery outside of the pit during this period. Of course, cremations were also present during the following Round Prairie phase, so it is possible that this area was used as a cemetery by the groups of this later period. Unfortunately, the lack of identifiable human bone in most of these features precludes their firm identification. All of these features are listed as possible cremations and as possible hearths in Table 4-10 because their contents were similar to both of these types of features. However, the presence of a definite cremation (Burial 27) in this area suggests that these other features may also be cremations. OCCUPATION ITI: ROUND PRAIRIE PHASE (A.D. 1000 TO 1200) This phase is marked by the presence of a hamlet consisting of three houses in the North area of the site. Although some features were directly datable by chronometric means or on the basis of diagnostic artifacts, few intrusive features were observed suggesting that most features were created during a single occupation. This contrasts with the Midden where radiocarbon dates indicate two major periods of occupation and considerable superpositioning of features is evident. Most discussion of the Round Prairie phase is limited to the features which are present in this North area. This is largely because the principal living area at this time appears to have been in this portion of the site, and because the Midden is too mixed to permit clear conclusions to be drawn. This phase receives the most detailed treatment of all phases at the site because the data base is largest for this occupation. ARCHITECTURE Three structures were identified on the basis of circular patterns of post holes with four interior post holes arranged in a rectangular pattern (Figure 14-1). The interior posts were larger and set deeper than the wall posts, and apparently provided the primary support for the structure. The roof was probably formed by timbers spanning the area from the wall posts to beams supported by the interior posts, with roof timbers tied together near the center of the structure. The roof was probably pitched and may have had an opening in the center to release smoke froma central hearth. Figure 14-2 is a photograph of a Caddo house taken in the 1860s in Oklahoma that is similar to the houses found at Bird Point Island. In all probability, other above-ground structures were present near the houses. Drying racks, covered work areas (arbors), and isolated posts set in the ground are often pictured in nineteenth century photographs of Indian villages. The locations of possible drying racks and arbors are illustrated in Figure 14-1, These areas have been identified on the basis of clusters of post holes that are not parts of houses. Extensive scraping of the B horizon revealed these clusters, but failed to turn up complete house patterns. For example, in the complex cluster of post holes west of House 3, a Prehistor

It is suggested that this may be an arbor, perhaps rebuilt several times, creating the complex pattern of post holes which is visible. If the suggested areas for drying racks and arbors are correct, then it appears that each house was in close proximity to such an area. INTRASITE ACTIVITY ANALYSIS The locations of different types of activities in the North area are assessed in this section by combining spatial data for A horizon artifacts (see Chapter 13) with the distribution of cultural features (see Chapter 4). The isolation of activity areas is a goal which

Figure 14-2, Caddo house from Oklahoma (ca. 1860) (Smithsonian Institution Photo Number 1373-C). cannot be entirely accomplished because obfuscating factors exist which blur the overall picture. For instance, curation behavior (Binford 1973) can result in artifact deposits with certain key elements of tool assemblages missing, since unbroken tools can be used for activities on other parts of the site. Also, differential preservation, particularly for economic reasons, can create a biased view of the activities that were conducted in any given location. For the analysis of activity areas within the hamlet, specific statements can be made with respect to lithic tool manufacture, food preparation, and activities associated with features of known function, The spatial maps of artifact distributions in the following figures are based on data collected from the 50 x 50 cm units spaced at 1.67 m intervals (see Chapter 13). Two levels of lithic debris contours are shown in Figure 14-3. The lower contour represents 20-28 artifacts per 50 x 50 cm unit and encompasses all of the houses and the areas in between the houses. The houses and the majority of the low-density cluster occur on the crest of the terrace, except for two elongations to the east and west. Both elongations are located downslope and probably reflect trash disposal areas. This idea was examined in Chapter 7, but no definite conclusions could be reached. Two high-level clusters are present, consisting of 28-45 artifacts per unit. One is located over part of House 1 and extends to the northeast; the other is situated immediately south of House 2. This suggests that most stone tool manufacture was conducted in and around the houses and especially between Houses 1 and 3. Interestingly, no high-density cluster was found over House 3, so this activity may not have occurred near this structure. No correlations were observed between lithic debris and features other than houses, so stone tool making appears to be unrelated to the use of features. Ceramic distributions, pictured in Figure 14-4, indicate that ceramic related activities, such as cooking, serving, and storage, were conducted in less restricted locations than was stone tool manufacture. Low ceramic density levels represent one artifact per unit and high-density levels represent more than one artifact per unit. The low-level clusters occur over and to one side of each of the houses and show general agreement with the location of lithic debris clusters. On the other hand, the high-level clusters that reflect intensive ceramic use are distributed in a different manner than high-level lithic debris clusters. Assuming that stone tool manufacture was a male activity and that cooking was a female activity, it appears that each sex worked in slightly different areas within the hamlet. The only exception to this is the area northeast of House 1 where larger clusters for many artifact classes were present. The longer period of occupation of House 1, as suggested Volume II, Part One by an extra pair of interior posts from a repair episode, may account for the observed overlap of lithic and ceramic clusters. The distribution of large fire cracked rock in Figure 14-5 is very interesting, since magnetometer studies have shown that several clusters exhibit little magnetism and actually represent unburned rock concentrations which were misidentified as fire cracked rock (see Chapter 10). These unburned clusters occur adjacent to the wall of House 1, immediately northeast of Feature 38 (a roasting pit), immediately south of House 3, and along the western edge of the scraped area. All of them are believed to be storage areas for rock used in hearths and roasting pits. It appears that substantial quantities of Wilcox sandstone were gathered from the slough during the dry season and stored for use near habitations and roasting pits. Figure 14-6 illustrates the distribution of charcoal by weight within the A horizon units. The location of a single, large cluster with two high-level clusters inside it coincides with the location of House 2 and is believed to represent the charred debris that fell upon the surface and was scattered by natural forces after the structure burned. In addition, no magnetic anomaly was recorded over House 2, such as the large anomaly recorded over the hearth in House 1 (Feature 57). It appears that House 2 may have burned before the quantities of fire cracked rock built up to a level sufficient to be detectable by the magnetometer. This hypothesis of a shorter duration of occupation in House 2 is also supported by the smaller artifact clusters found over this structure. The final spatial distribution map illustrates the accumulation of midden over portions of the North area as indicated by darkening of the soil by increases in organic matter content from human occupation (Cook and Heizer 1965:10). The area over and immediately southeast of House 1 is the largest area of midden accumulation in the North (Figure 14-7). This probably reflects the gradual addition of organic matter from plant and animal residues during the occupation of the house rather than intentional disposal of refuse within the structure. The increase in soil color over Feature 38 does not correspond to lithic debris or ceramic clusters and may represent intentional disposal of plant and animal refuse. Smaller clusters of soil discoloration occur over Houses 2 and 3, which suggests that they were utilized to a lesser extent than House 1. An area of dark soil also coincides with the clusters of lithic debris and ceramics to the southeast of the three houses, supporting the idea that this represents a trash disposal area. ; The intra-house activity pattern within House | is illustrated in Figure 14-8. Three zones of activity are apparent, based on the block excavation data from the northern 60% of this house. First, the central hearth and the immediately surrounding area are marked by a concentration of fire cracked rock, ceramics, and projectile points denoting use as a food preparation area. Although projectile points are traditionally assumed to reflect hunting activity, the consistent occurrence of projectile points, especially dart points, within hearths and roasting pits at Bird Point Island suggests that they were also used as knives and scrapers. Second, the zone between the hearth and the interior posts is marked by the highest frequency of lithic debris and aborted bifaces and is the location of most storage pits. Therefore, this area of the house appears to represent a work and storage area in which tool manufacture occurred and foods were preserved in subfloor storage pits. Finally, the zone between the interior posts and the wall posts was marked by the lowest frequency of artifacts and features. This area probably was used for sleeping and above ground storage. An artist's reconstruction of the site during the Round Prairie phase is shown in Figure 14-9. This accurately depicts the locations of houses, roasting pits and activity areas based on site maps. Feature 1 is shown in the foreground to register the scene, and House 3 is shown under construction to illustrate details of architecture. The activities of food preparation, pit roasting, stone tool manufacture, and refuse disposal in the upper zone of Feature 1 are all depicted. In conclusion, different degrees of use are apparent for houses 1, 2, and 3 both in terms of artifact concentrations and degrees of

Generalized layout of activities inside House 1. soil discoloration. This could reflect the use of structures for different functions or simply differences in duration of occupation. House 1 exhibits the largest and clearest magnetic anomaly, the largest artifact clusters, the most soil discoloration, and contains extra interior posts and closely spaced wall posts indicative of rebuilding. Thus, House 1 was probably occupied longer than any of the other structures. House 2 apparently burned before it was occupied for any substantial length of time. Its similarity to House 1 and its degree of completeness suggest that it was used in a similar manner. On the other hand, House 3 is marked by an incomplete post hole pattern, different distributions of artifacts, and less soil discoloration than observed for the other houses. In Chapter 13, it is suggested that House 3 was actually a covered work area. Another explanation is that it served as a summer house. Swanton (1946:386-392) notes the occurrence of two seasonal house types among several tribes of Southeast Indians: a winter house of substantial construction, and a summer house of less substantial construction, often with portions of walls missing. It is possible that House 1 was a winter house, and that House 3, with the southeast portion of the wall missing, represented a summer house. Warm weather would have permitted daily activities to be conducted in a less restricted area, thereby reducing the likelihood of accumulating artifacts within the structure. . SUBSISTENCE STRATEGY: SEDENTARY HUNTERS AND GATHERERS Faunal and floral remains recovered from storage pits, roasting pits, and other features clearly associated with the hamlet occupation provide an important interpretation of prehistoric economic patterns during this phase. Although dozens of features were excavated and subjected to flotation recovery, including storage pits and post holes clearly related to house occupation, no evidence of agriculture was recovered. The absence of maize does Volume H, Part One not prove conclusively that this food was not used, but some corn should have been found if it was used even as a supplement, based on com recovery rates from agricultural groups in East Texas (cf., Bruseth and Perttula 1981). The subsistence strategy hinged on the use of three naturally abundant wild foods. These were (1) deer, forming the principal source of protein; (2) acorns and nuts, providing fats and carbohydrates; and (3) Psoralea tubers, forming an additional source of carbohydrates. The presence of significant quantities of Psoralea remains is a particularly important discovery because this represents the first evidence, to our knowledge, of this resource found within an archaeological context. In fact, Wedel (1978) stated that this resource might never by found in an archaeological context because of its poor potential for preservation. The principal plant foods are complementary from the standpoint of harvesting, with nuts and acorns abundant in the fall and Psoralea available in the spring. All of these species have high storage potential once dried or roasted, so they formed dependable supplies of food. Although nut production is cyclical, different species produce in different cycles so that a bad year for one species is often offset by a good year for another (Hilliard 1980). Psoralea is a relatively drought resistant species, so it also forms a reliable subsistence base (Wedel 1978). Thus, these plant species can be relied upon despite fluctuations in annual rainfall. The location of Bird Point Island within the Post Oak Savannah has important implications for economic exploitation. Large quantities of nuts and acorns would have been available in this zone, which in turn would have attracted populations of deer. The open woodland of the savannah would have also contained many “edge” areas that provide browse for deer. Psoralea would also have been found in this zone because it prefers the sandy soils that are confined to the Post Oak Savannah. Thus, the Post Oak Savannah would have provided alt of the staples, whereas the other neighboring zones would have provided numerous supplements to the diet. It is no coincidence that Bird Point Island is in the center of this zone, and as presented in Chapter 18, Volume III, we argue that the Round Prairie phase occupation represents a specialized adaptation to the Post Oak Savannah. In addition, Bird Point Island provided an important mineral resource, Wilcox sandstone. This material, which was heated for roasting, provided a necessary resource required for processing the plants in roasting pits, thus enabling the abundant food resources of the Post Oak Savanah to be processed and stored. GROUP SIZE In Chapter 4, ethnographic sources were used to obtain estimates of population size for the hamlet occupation. Assuming that all three houses were occupied simultaneously, a maximum population of 20 was derived. However, as noted in the previous section, it is unlikely that all houses were inhabited concurrently. If House 1 and House 3 were occupied at the same time, the estimate is reduced to 13. Finally, if House 1 was a winter house and House 3 was a summer house, then a single household with a population no greater than eight would have formed the group occupying the site. None of the estimates point to the presence of a large population, and all of them could represent a single extended family. ; DEGREE OF SEDENTISM AND DURATION OF OCCUPATION The degree of sedentism reflects the total length of time the group occupied the site during a single year, whereas the duration of occupation is related to the number of years that the hamlet was occupied. The presence of substantial structures argues for a high degree of sedentism during the Round Prairie phase, and this idea is supported by floral and faunal data. The occurrence of vetch, Psoralea, and certain fruits indicates a spring harvest; Polygonum

Artist's rendering of the Round Prairie phase hamlet in the North area. and other weedy species are available in late summer, and nuts are exploitable in the fall. Deer remains from Zone 1 of Feature 1, which are related to this occupation and to the final occupation, include antlers fused to frontal bones, and deer mandibles from individuals aged approximately 1.7 years. Since antlers are shed in the winter, and deer are born in the spring, the presence of fused antlers and the age of deer at time of death both indicate a fall/winter period of exploitation (see Chapter 9). The well developed hearth inside House 1 suggests that it was used for household heating as well as cooking, and further supports the hypothesis that the site was occupied during the winter. Thus, the evidence indicates a year-round, or sedentary, occupation of the site, apart from brief periods of abandonment for nut collecting or hunting trips. This sedentism based on a hunting and gathering economy was made possible by high concentration of important food resources in the Post Oak Savannah (see Chapter 18, Volume III). Little data are available with which to make an estimate of total length of the Round Prairie phase occupation. Using post decay rates provided by the Texas Forest Service, Good (1982) estimated that houses at the De Shazo site lasted an average of 20 years, and perhaps as long as 30 years. The houses at Bird Point Island were situated on the highest elevation of the terrace, almost certainly to facilitate drainage. However, the evidence that two interior posts of House 1 were replaced suggests that it was occupied long enough for wood decay to become a problem. Good's estimate of 20 years is probably reasonable for the length of use of House 1. Since this structure appears to have been occupied longer than any of the others, the entire duration of hamlet occupation probably fell within this 20 year period. OCCUPATION IV: ST. ELMO PHASE (A.D. 1300 TO 1650) Several separate occupations actually occurred during this 350- year period (see Chapter 12), but insufficient data are available to draw conclusions about individual occupations, so the overall characteristics of the entire period are discussed. The nature of St. Elmo phase artifacts and features suggests that there was a high degree of cultural similarity among all occupations of this period, and that the nature of occupation was quite different from occupation during the Round Prairie phase. Most evidence for the St. Elmo phase comes from the North Midden, South Midden, and South areas of the site. Unfortunately, features and artifacts dating to the Round Prairie phase are mixed in among these areas along with later St. Elmo phase materials. Vertical mixing of the artifacts in the A horizon and the inability to associate many features with individual components makes it

192 difficult to formulate definitive statements. Consequently, the discussion of cultural behavior during the St. Elmo phase is subject to a greater degree of speculation than for the preceding phase. ARCHITECTURE No complete house patterns were uncovered within the Midden, but a cluster of post holes was recognized in the southwest portion of the South Midden (Figure 14-10). The cluster falls within an area comprised primarily of St. Elmo phase ceramics and projectile points and is interpreted as evidence for one or more above ground structures related to this period. Despite intensive scraping and examination of the area for additional post holes, no complete arc or rectangle of post holes was recognized. The few post holes present suggest that structures built during the St. Elmo phase were more temporary than those constructed during the Round Prairie phase. This interpretation is supported by data from site 41NV173, another St. Elmo phase site, which lacked evidence of house patterns despite extensive scraping (see Chapter 11, Volume III). Instead, isolated clusters of post holes similar to those found at Bird Point Island were present. This suggests that people may have been more mobile, occupying sites for shorter periods, during the St. Elmo phase. Figure 14-11 is an artist's conception of the more temporary structures hypothesized to have existed in the Midden and South areas of the site during this phase. INTRASITE ACTIVITY ANALYSIS It is difficult to make definitive statements about activity areas because of the mixture of components present within the Midden. For instance, the lithic debris distribution shows a single large cluster over the entire Midden and it is impossible to make statements about the specific locations of tool manufacture within this cluster. Ceramics provide the most interpretable clusters within this area because their relative scarcity at the site creates small discrete clusters. Figure 14-12 illustrates the ceramic concentrations in the Midden along with the features assigned to the St. Elmo phase. Most ceramics occur in the South Midden, and most late ceramic types occur in the South Midden and South areas (Chapter 8). The ceramic cluster in this area occurs over the cluster of post holes in the South Midden, showing a similar distribution to the ceramics over Round Prairie phase houses. However, the spatial data are too mixed to draw firm conclusions other than that the most intense occupation during the St. Elmo phase occurred in the South Midden area. SUBSISTENCE STRATEGY: MOBILE HORTICULTURALISTS The overall pattern of economic exploitation remained unchanged between the Round Prairie and the St. Elmo phases, with one very’ important exception. This exception was the introduction of maize as a supplement to the diet of wild foods. Three features associated with this phase contained very small quantities of maize, indicating a minimal use of corn. Trace element data and an increase in dental calculus associated with Burial 8 also suggest that maize was a supplement (see Chapter 5). However, it is significant that maize was added to a diet that previously was sufficient to maintain a sedentary population. This implies that some type of stress may have occurred which stimulated a need for a change in subsistence strategy. Archaeological evidence indicates that the Caddoan people to the east were producing corn contemporaneously with both the Round Prairie and St. Elmo phases (Bruseth and Pertulla 1981; Story 1981). Why then was corn absent from the botanical specimens recovered from the Round Prairie phase features? Sampling is not the answer since a greater number of features and Volume II, Part One a larger volume of fill was floated from the Round Prairie phase than from the St. Elmo phase. The best interpretation is that St. Elmo phase groups were mobile, perhaps only seasonally, occupying Bird Point Island. The ceramic design elements attributable to this phase are very similar to late Caddoan styles in East Texas (Bruseth and Perttula 1981:6). This similarity to ceramic styles of the Caddo combined with the lack of permanent structures, and the use of maize, suggests that St. Elmo phase people were mobile and maintained more direct contact with the Caddoan tribes than did the Round Prairie phase group. Although Caddoan people themselves may have visited the site on bison- hunting trips to Central Texas, such as occurred among the historic Caddo (Swanton 1946), it seems unlikely that they were responsible for the St. Elmo phase occupation. The Caddo were adapted to a pine forest environment which lacked Psoralea, so it is difficult to imagine Caddoan visitors adopting an economic strategy involving the use of these tubers. It is more logical to interpret the St. Elmo phase subsistence pattern as one in which mobile groups of hunters and gatherers utilized small quantities of maize, perhaps obtained from contact with the East Texas Caddo. In Chapter 18 of Volume II, the stress induced impetus for the change in subsistence strategy is related to climatic fluctuation. The results of paleoenvironmental studies based on pollen analysis of cores recovered from bogs outside the reservoir, pollen analysis of floodplain sediments within the reservoir, and geological work within the reservoir are presented in Chapter 5 of Volume I. These data suggest that the climate of the past two millenia has been slowly drying. About 2,000 years ago, rainfall was greater than that observed today and the floodplain of Richland Creek was rapidly alluviating. Sometime around A.D. 700 the annual precipitation level began dropping until around A.D. 1200, when a significant drought is proposed to have occurred and alluviation in the floodplain of Richland Creek ceased. This proposed climatic change parallels the shifts in subsistence strategy from a sedentary occupation based solely on wild foods to a more mobile occupation with an increased reliance on corn. This correlation of climatic change to cultural behavior is explored further in Chapter 18, Volume III. GROUP SIZE AND DURATION OF OCCUPATION It is difficult to make statements about St. Elmo phase group size or duration of occupation owing to the mixed nature of the data base. As mentioned previously, the available data indicate that the occupation was not sedentary. Only three burials were clearly associated with this component, which indicates that group size was small or that the site was infrequently visited during the 350 years of the St. Elmo phase. The duration of each visit to the site is also difficult to estimate, but probably varied according to the season of the year and the nature of the resources being exploited. These issues are considered in more detail in Part Two of Volume III where data from several sites in the reservoir are used to examine this phase. CONCLUSIONS The data base accumulated from Bird Point Island over the course of testing and four seasons of mitigation, as well as the numerous data collection and analytical methodologies used to assess the data, have allowed us to reach conclusions about four major periods of occupation ranging from approximately 170 B.C. to A.D. 1650. The spatial arrangement of features, particularly of post holes, permitted the identification of three structures dating to the A.D. 1000-1200 period. Analysis of post hole spacing and depth allowed us to reconstruct the architecture of these structures, and a spatial analysis of the artifacts using the SYMAP program allowed us to identify the locations of various domestic activites within the structures and also across the site in general. Floral and faunal analyses demonstrated that a hunting

During the final occupation, maize was introduced as a supplement both at Bird Point Island and at other sites within the Richland Creek area. It is suggested that the introduction of maize reflects a response to a deteriorating climatic regime culminating around A.D. 1200. The sequence of occupation may be summarized as follows. At some point between 170 B.C. to A.D. 130, Feature 1 was excavated by a Late Archaic hunting band. Roasting was conducted, as evidenced by the presence of fire cracked rock and food refuse, perhaps for ritual feasts related to seasonal macro- band aggregation (see Chapter 21). The feature also served as a cemetery into which males, females, infants, and dogs were interred. The mortuary function of this feature continued until the end of the A.D. 580-860 occupation. Artifacts from both of these periods are present outside of Feature 1, but no other features have been definitely dated to either period, so little is known about the nature of these groups. It is suggested that numerous short term seasonal occupations occurred during the Late Archaic and early portion of the Late Prehistoric periods. Then between A.D. 1000 and 1200, a sedentary hamlet consisting of three structures existed along the crest of the terrace. Numerous features, including roasting pits containing charred nut shell and Psoralea tubers, date to this period. In fact, most of the artifacts and features found in the North area are believed to date to this period. Although the presence of substantial structures and recovery of food species representing all seasons of the year demonstrate that the occupation was sedentary, no evidence of agriculture was found. Apparently, nuts, deer, and prairie turnips provided enough food to maintain a settled existence. Finally, between A.D. 1300 and 1650, a shift in settlement and subsistence occurred. No evidence of substantial structures was found which suggests that temporary shelters were used, probably by mobile bands of hunters and gatherers. Small quantities of maize were introduced into the diet, either as a result of increased trade with agricultural Caddoan groups or experimentation with plant husbandry by local groups.

THE ADAMS RANCH SITE by William A. Martin with a contribution by Edward F. Janak, Jr. The Adams Ranch site (41NV177) is a multicomponent site with a large depression that was discovered by avocational archaeologist, Mr. Bill Young. Young noticed the depression along the southern slope of the terrace when the site was cleared of vegetation in 1970 and suggested that it might be a Wylie focus pit. He also made surface collections:that contained both Archaic and Late Prehistoric period artifacts; however, he did not find a large midden deposit like the one present at Bird Point Island. Therefore, he suggested that this site was occupied less intensively than was Bird Point Island.- The pit at Adams Ranch yielded the chronological data used to formulate the two hypotheses about Wylie focus pit utilization generated in 1982. These hypotheses stated that (1) the Wylie focus pit developed from a local Archaic stage cultural base, and (2) the nature of pit utilization changed through time (Raab and Moir 1982:203). Intensive excavations at Bird Point Island during Seasons II and III supported these hypotheses, demonstrating an Archaic period of-origin for initial pit excavation and use. Both economic and mortuary uses were observed in the original fill from this period, followed by increased usage of the depression for roasting and trash disposal during the Late Prehistoric period. The mitigation research at Adams Ranch addressed these hypotheses, but also examined questions related to similarities and differences between the pits at both sites. For instance, were both pits first used as cemeteries as well as for economic activities such as roasting? Were these pits used concurrently or sequentially? The data recovery program at Adams Ranch was designed to provide a better understanding of the function and chronology of these large pit features. The report on the Adams Ranch site, Chapters 15-20, follows the format used.to ‘report the Bird Point Island data. However, because far less data were recovered from Adams Ranch than from Bird Point Island, Part II is much shorter than Part I. Classes of data that were complex enough to warrant treatment in separate chapters in Part I are treated as subsections of Chapters 15-20 in Part IT. In addition, much: of the information about soils and the 199 various methodologies discussed for Bird Point Island also applies to Adams Ranch, so the pertinent discussions in Part I are referenced in Part II to avoid redundancy. As a result, theoretical discussions already presented in Part I are kept to a minimum in this portion of the report. PEDOLOGICAL BACKGROUND (by Edward F. Janak, Jr.) LANDFORM DESCRIPTION The Adams Ranch site is located approximately 1 km north of Richland Creek and about 2 km northwest of Bird Point Island. The site is bounded by a farm road on the north and a slough on the south, Studies conducted by David Pheasant, geomorphologist for the Richland Creek Archaeological Project, and Edward F, Janak, Jr., area soil scientist for the USDA Soil Conservation Service, demonstrate that both sites are situated on Pleistocene terrace sediments which overlie the Wilcox formation of the Tertiary system. During Season I, Pheasant ran chemical and particle size analyses on soil samples recovered from backhoe trench Units 51 and 53 to assess geological discontinuities. He recognized both recent alluvial soils and Pleistocene terrace sediments within these trenches, and described the landform as part of the T-1 eroded terrace system. During Season IV, Janak examined the soils across the entire terrace to provide a soils map with information pertinent to the selection of excavation methodologies. He noted that the type and extent of soil development provide additional support for the designation of the site as an eroded T-1 terrace as defined by Pheasant (1982: 217-228). The geological atlas shows the site to lie on the Wilcox formation (University of Texas, Bureau of Economic Geology 1970), Presumably, Wilcox sediments are present at some depth, but they were not encountered within 2 m of the surface at any of the observation points used for soil mapping.

Distribution of soils across the terrace at Adams Ranch. SOIL DESCRIPTION Backhoe trenches and archaeological excavation units were examined to supplement information obtained from auger-hole observations along north-south and east-west transects. These data were used to construct a soils map of Adams Ranch (Figure 15-1) as well as a cross section of the landform (Figure 15-2). The soils recognized at the subgroup level are the same as some of the soils recognized at Bird Point Island. Chapter 2 presents detailed descriptions of the composition and properties of these soils. Soils from three classifications at the subgroup level were recognized at the site, but only two of these are present in mappable amounts. Udic Haplustalfs are on the highest, best drained portion of the site, and Typic Haplustalfs occupy the intermediate elevations.

All of these soils are characterized by sandy loam A horizons 20-30 cm thick which overlie sandy clay loam B horizons. A calcic horizon, which includes visible carbonate nodules, is present in the lower portion of the B horizon and within the C horizon of some pedons. The absence of visible carbonates at Bird Point Island was due to the dominance of highly leached Ultic Haplustalfs, which contain carbonates at depths far greater than those penetrated by the excavation units. At Adams Ranch, the less freely drained lower footslope position of the site resulted in the accumulation of carbonates much closer to the surface. As groundwater moved downslope along the terrace/Wilcox contact, the increased moisture content at the lower elevations restricted leaching and contributed to the accumulation of the carbonates observed in the lower B and C horizons today.

Cross section of the terrace at Adams Ranch showing variations in soils (exaggerated vertical scale). The Typic Haplustalfs at the south end of the site are covered by three layers of recent Holocene sediments. The profile of backhoe trench Unit 500 revealed a layer of black clay of alluvial origin immediately above the Typic Haplustalf profile. This same flood deposit also occurred within the profile of Feature 1 at a depth of 60-75 cm below surface, dating to between A.D, 800 and A.D. 1000 (see Chapter 17). On top of this layer, a dark loam of colluvial origin was present in both profiles, and the uppermost layer was black clay loam alluvium confined to the plow zone. As shown in Figure 15-2, these overlying sediments thin out with increasing elevation. At the lowest elevations they lose their integrity to the recent floodplain alluvium. The post-A.D, 800 time frame for the deposition of the alluvium and colluvium seems accurate from the perspective of soil development. For example, the expression of horizonation is the same for both the Typic Haplustalfs exposed on the surface at the middle elevations, and those further downslope which are buried by the Holocene sediments. This parallel development of the soil profile strongly suggests that all Typic Haplustalfs were subjected to the same soil forming processes until a relatively recent period on the geological time scale. Therefore, these alluvial and colluvial sediments must represent relatively recent deposits. The Holocene sediments appear to represent an alluvial- colluvial-alluvial series, judging from the low elevation of the site, and the textural variability of the three layers. The original flood layer is of a textural and mineralogical content that precludes any source other than alluvium from Richland Creek. The physical properties of these sediments correlate well with sediments deposited on nearby natural levees and point bars at corresponding elevations. In addition, these sediments are much too clayey to be colluvial in origin, considering the sandy nature of the soils upslope. The layer overlying the alluvium is distinctly coarser and appears to represent colluvium. Although a high energy flood deposit could result in the accumulation of similar coarser- textured material, the fact that artifact content was relatively high throughout this layer suggests that it formed gradually, rather than as a single event. Cultural material density generally drops within a flood deposit because normal activities are interrupted by the flood. On the other hand, this density decreases only slightly in a colluvial deposit where normal activities are continuously conducted throughout an extended period of gradual colluvial deposition. The top layer, confined to the plow zone, is comprised of clayey sediments similar to those described for the initial flood layer. This deposit appears to represent alluvium which was subsequently mixed with the underlying colluvial layer by cultivation. ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS The properties of the A and B horizons have a pronounced effect on the selection of an appropriate excavation methodology because they have very different potentials for the preservation of cultural features, perishable remains, and interpretable cultural stratigraphy. The detailed discussion of the archaeological implications of soils presented in Chapter 2 also applies to the soils at Adams Ranch, so the major points are merely summarized here. Briefly, the sandy loam A horizon is the organically enriched zone characterized by dark chromas that is subjected to maximum disturbance from biological and mechanical agents, The high degree of disturbance obscures the boundaries of cultural features and creates a vertically mixed stratigraphy, removing artifacts from their original point of deposition. The B horizon has a high clay content which resists bioturbation and impedes the vertical movement of artifacts. In addition, the chroma associated with the B horizon is lighter than the dark chromas of the A horizon. Asa result, cultural features which are difficult to detect within the A

Most of the ground surface at Adams Ranch has been eroding rather than aggrading, with only minimal aggradation at the extreme south end of the site (Figure 15-2). Consequently, debris deposited during the various occupations of the site have become mixed together in the sandy loam A horizon. Given the vertically mixed nature of the eroded T-1 terraces, an excavation strategy designed to isolate vertical stratigraphy is inappropriate. In these soils, vertical separation of artifacts is the result of bioturbation and does not represent chronological separation of components. However, the horizontal distribution of artifacts is largely. unaltered by the natural forces which result in vertical mixing, so cultural patterns are still discernible when spatial relationships among artifacts and features are examined. Outside of Feature 1, which has been gradually aggrading since its original excavation, an excavation program focusing on the horizontal, rather than the eo 40 x 40 cm unit Six tm unit OMB Backhoe trench a Figure 15-3. Test excavation units dug at Adams Ranch. vertical, separation of artifacts is most appropriate. The relatively shallow depth from the surface to the B horizon (20-30 cm) assures that many features would have penetrated the B horizon. A strategy designed to sample the A horizon for artifact content and the B horizon for cultural features, is a more suitable approach for this site, considering the nature of the soils. HISTORY OF INVESTIGATION AND DATA RECOVERY METHODOLOGY The archaeological significance of the Adams Ranch site was recognized in 1970 when the land owner deforested the site and Bill Young examined the freshly cleared area. Aside from noting the presence of the pit, Young collected dart points including Yarbrough, Gary, Kent, Darl, Wells, Godley, Carrollton, Ellis, sss.

He also collected arrow points such as Bonham, Cuney, Bassett, Alba, and Scallorn, as well as bone and grog tempered ceramics with incised and engraved decorations (McGregor et al. 1982:48). These arrow points and sherds are diagnostic of the Late Prehistoric period. Therefore, multiple occupations of the site must have occurred, beginning during the Archaic period and continuing into the Late Prehistoric. In 1976, the site was recorded by archaeologists from Southern Methodist University during the Tennessee Colony Lake survey, and its potential significance was noted (Richner and Lee 1977). The site was visited again in 1980 during the survey of the Richland/Chambers Reservoir conducted by Southern Methodist University. In early 1981, a testing program was conducted to assess the significance of the archaeological deposit. Six backhoe trenches (Units 4 and 17-20) totaling nearly 60 m in length, 26 40 x 40 cm shovel tests (Units 1-3, 5-26, and 21-33), andalxim _ unit (Unit 14) were excavated. Unit 14 was excavated to the bottom of the cultural deposit (110 cm) to provide a controlled collection of artifacts. The large depression was bisected along its north-south axis by backhoe trench Unit 4, and was sectioned along its east-west axis by backhoe trench Unit 17 (Figure 15-3) to provide profiles for examination of pit stratigraphy. The goals of the testing program were: (1) to determine whether the depression was of cultural or natural origin, (2) to delineate the horizontal and vertical extent of the deposit, and (3) to obtain samples of artifacts from within and around the depression. The results of the testing program showed that the depression was definitely of cultural origin. Fourteen major strata were recorded, and soil samples were collected to test for chemical composition of each stratum. In addition, two human burials were uncovered and several artifacts were recovered (McGregor et al. 1982:45-48). The depression was labeled Feature 1, and additional in-depth work was recommended to mitigate the loss of significant

Because shovel tests failed to produce many artifacts or any signs of midden accumulation outside of the pit, Feature 1 was recommended as the primary focus of excavation. In the summer of 1982, Season I data recovery began with a magnetic survey of 1100 m2 over and around the Feature 1 depression. Prior to the initiation of field work, the southwest quarter of Feature 1 had been targeted for investigation. However, this plan was modified to include excavation outside of Feature 1 when the results of the magnetic survey revealed the presence of anomalies of possible cultural origin north of the depression. Units 34-40 were 40 x 40 cm units dug at 1 m intervals in the vicinity of the anomaly to search for cultural features. Unit 41 wasa 1 x 1m unit dug near the center of the anomaly, and Unit 43 was an additional shovel test dug to examine the source of the anomaly. Since no evidence of cultural features was observed in these units, mechanical stripping of a 2.5 x 6 m area over the anomaly was conducted to expose a broader area. This scraped area, labeled Unit 50 (Figure 15-4), was found to contain a small oval pit near the center of the anomaly (Feature 5). Most Season I investigation was conducted within Feature 1. The backhoe trenches were reopened and the trench walls were shored for the safety of the crew prior to the excavation of seven contiguous 2 x 2 m units (Units 42 and 44-49). These units were placed parallel to backhoe trench Unit 4, south of its intersection with Unit 17, to form a block measuring 2 x 14 m (Figure 15-4). Units were excavated in arbitrary 10 cm levels, but none of the units were completed because the crew was moved to Bird Point Island to assist in the excavation of Feature 1 at that site during the last part of Season I. The excavations were shored to prevent slumping until additional excavation could be conducted. In addition to the archaeological excavations, five backhoe trenches totaling 33 m in length were dug to provide profiles for geomorphological study (Units 51-55). Units 51 and 55 were dug

Although care was taken to avoid disturbance to Feature 1 and other important archaeological deposits, Unit 53 cut across a pit immediately southeast of Feature 1 (Feature 102) which contained two human burials (Burials 4 and 5). Although these burials were badly disturbed by the backhoe, useful information was recovered (see Chapter 16). A total of 105 person-days was expended at Adams Ranch during Season I. The majority of data collection occurred during Season IV between October and late December 1984, but inclement weather prevented completion of data collection until February 1985. Approximately 370 person-days of labor were expended at the site during Season IV. By the start.of Season IV, the best procedures for data recovery at sites located on terraces had been determined by experiment- ation at Bird Point Island. These techniques were used to investigate Adams Ranch, and included: magnetic survey, excavation of systematic excavation units for the generation of SYMAPs, excavation of 1 x 1 m units to investigate magnetic anomalies and artifact concentrations, completion of the excavation across Feature 1, and mechanized scraping to uncover features for mapping and excavation. Season IV field work began with a magnetic survey of six 20 x 20 m blocks (2400 m2) immediately north and west of the blocks surveyed during Season I, bringing the total area surveyed during both seasons to 3500 m2 (see Chapter 19). Systematic excavation of 50 x 50 cm units was conducted across the site while the magnetic survey data were being processed. Season IV excavations began with the systematic sampling of the site using 50 x 50 cm units spaced at 4 m intervals to provide data for the generation of artifact density maps (SYMAPs). Once the SYMAPs were produced, seven additional trenches of | x 1 m units (Units 1101-1144) were excavated in areas where high

206 density clusters for several artifact classes overlapped (Figure 15- 5). A large pit (Feature 51) was encountered within Units 1108- 1115, so additional units were excavated adjacent to this trench to expose more of the feature (Units 1140-1144). When the results of the magnetic survey were received, six trenches of contiguous | x 1 m units (Units 61-100) were dug to search for cultural features in the areas of anomalous magnetism. Excavation began at each end of the Adams Ranch anomaly and proceeded in toward the center, as had been done at Bird Point Island. However, unlike the results at Bird Point Island, no cultural features were observed in the B horizon beneath most of the anomalies. The excavation strategy was modified once it became clear that the complete excavation of trenches was not productive. For instance, every other unit was excavated in the trenches laid out for Units 68-76 and 93-100 (Figure 15-5). The majority of the Season IV excavation effort was expended inside Feature | to complete the units begun during Season I, and. to excavate Units 56-60 immediately to the north of Unit 49. This strategy created a trench measuring 24 m long by 2 m wide which: bisected Feature 1 parallel to backhoe trench Unit 4, providing a. complete profile across the pit. More detailed information regarding the Feature 1 excavation strategy is provided in Chapter 17, Mechanized scraping was conducted by a small bulldozer and a tractor equipped with a backblade to remove the A horizon and expose the B horizon for feature identification on selected portions of the site. Areas were scraped which had SYMAP clusters similar - to those seen over areas at Bird Point Island in which habitation structures and roasting pits were found. Exposed features were mapped, excavated, photographed, and profiled. Up to 60 | of fill were floated to recover small artifacts and macrobotanical remains. This strategy is discussed further in Chapter 16. SPATIAL DIVISIONS OF THE SITE Unlike the spatial divisions defined for Bird Point Island, which in many cases represented chronologically distinct areas of occupation with minimal overlap of occupations, those recognized Volume HU, Part Two at Adams Ranch cannot be separated temporally. Four subdivisions (Areas A-D) were selected on the basis of overlapping high density SYMAP clusters (Figure 15-6). These represent discrete areas of intensive activity aside from the activity confined to Feature 1, which is treated as a separate area of the site for the purposes of analysis. The lithic, ceramic, floral, and faunal data were separated into these discrete areas for analysis in an effort to identify functionally distinct areas (activity areas), and temporally distinct areas. Unfortunately, it was not possible to delineate temporally distinct areas because of the substantial overlap of Archaic and Late Prehistoric artifacts. The four subdivisions of the site are separated by areas containing units which have been lumped together under a category called "Other" for the purposes of data presentation. Only those units within the high artifact density SYMAP clusters were included in Areas A-D, in order to maximize information pertinent to the activities conducted in those areas. Units falling outside of these clusters were omitted to minimize background noise that would tend to obscure the principal activities that were conducted in each area. It should be noted that 2 x 2 m Units 42, §9, and 60 adjacent to Feature 1 are included in the "Other" category which is otherwise comprised of 50 x 50 cm and 1 x 1m units. As a result, the assemblage listed under this category is dominated by artifacts from these 2 x 2 m units. Area A lies between 100-120 N, 80 E and 100-120 N, 104 E and encompasses the area over and around a large roasting pit (Feature 51). Area B is between 100-112 N, 104 E and 100-112 N, 128 E which overlaps the south end of Feature 1, and includes the area over two large pits adjacent to Feature 1 (Features 101 and 102). Area C lies between 116-128 N, 116 E and 116-128 N, 140 E and represents an activity area immediately east of Feature 1 that included some small pit features. Finally, Area D extends from . 132-200.N, 80 E to 132-200 N, 140 E and includes the entire north half of the site. This area was marked by a large lithic debris cluster which included overlapping clusters of bifaces and ceramics similar to the clusters found over the houses at Bird Point . Island. Although several small pits were uncovered in this area, no house patterns were found. ee ee ee ee a a a

CULTURAL FEATURES AND HUMAN BURIALS by William A. Martin with a contribution by Gary Rutenberg All features and burials recorded at Adams Ranch, including those associated with Feature 1, are described in this chapter. However, Feature 1 is complex enough to warrant treatment in a separate chapter, so Chapter 17 discusses the features and burials found within it in greater detail. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the dimensions, color, texture and contents of all features and to classify the features into categories with chronological and functional meaning. In addition, the osteological analysis - conducted by Gary Rutenberg is presented. This chapter is divided into three sections, beginning with the descriptive data for cultural features identified at Adams Ranch and a discussion of the analytical methodology used to classify them. All cultural features mapped at Adams Ranch are shown in Figure 16-1, and those features that were excavated are illustrated in Figures 16-2 through 16-4. Brief discussions of each feature class are presented to summarize their principal attributes. Finally, the osteological analysis of Burials 1 through 7 is presented by Rutenberg. FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS Tables 16-1 through 16-3 follow formats similar to those used for the description of Bird Point Island features (Tables 4-1 through 4-5). Gaps between the feature numbers listed in these tables are the result of the reclassification of some features as post holes or burials according to the numbering system described in Chapter 4. In some cases, natural disturbances were mistakenly assigned feature numbers and were later eliminated from the list. Table 16-1 lists metric attributes of features, as well as the color and texture of the feature fill. These categories are fairly straightforward and are discussed further in Chapter 4. The categories listed in Table 16-2 are identical to those listed in Table 4-2, See Chapter 4 for a discussion of each category contained in these tables. Volume-corrected densities are listed as counts per 100 1 or weight in grams per 100 1, as indicated by the notations in Table 16-3; actual frequencies for each data class are listed in Appendix H. DATA COMPARABILITY The data collected during Season I at Adams Ranch is very comparable to that collected during Season IV, except for the omission of fire cracked rock from the Season I data base. The difference in the rate of recovery and artifact breakage noted between dry screening and water screening at Bird Point Island was not a problem at Adams Ranch because water screening systems were used during both Season I and Season IV. The type of flotation recovery device used during each season was different. During Season I a froth flotation device was used (Appendix E) whereas during Season IV a simpler direct flotation process was employed (Appendix F). The principal difference between the two devices lies in the relative proportion of seeds recovered in the heavy and light fractions. Since both fractions were saved, sorted, and added together for presentation, the data from both seasons are directly comparable. MISSING DATA Some categories in Tables 16-1 and 16-2 have missing data. In Table 16-1, incomplete metric data were available for Burials 1 and 3 from the testing phase and for Burials 4 and 5 from Season I because they were disturbed by a backhoe. Burials 7 and 8 were represented by single elements that were not in primary context, so no measurements could be taken. Several features inside Feature 1 extended beyond the limits of the excavation units, so they were only partially excavated, and complete dimensions could not be obtained. The incomplete dimensions are designated by the symbol meaning greater than, indicating that the feature extends beyond the listed measurement by an undetermined amount. In Table 16-2, it was impossible to estimate the percentage excavated for those features that extended beyond the limits of excavation units. These are designated by question marks in the percent excavated column. In some instances, features were excavated, but the samples were not processed due to time constraints. These features are marked by an X in the processing column of Table 16-2 and are omitted entirely from Table 16-3. 207

ANALYSIS OF FEATURES | The analysis of Adams Ranch features was adapted from the Bird Point Island feature analysis, drawing upon the lessons learned from experiments designed to determine feature function. Characteristics of size, shape, artifact content, and magnetic response were examined in light of relationships observed between these variables and feature function at Bird Point Island. For example, at Bird Point Island roasting pits were consistently large, usually asymmetrical, and contained high densities of fire cracked rock which produced intense magnetic anomalies. At Adamis Ranch, pits which shared these characteristics were also classified as roasting pits. At Bird Point Island, principal components analysis of feature content isolated roasting pits as a single factor, but grouped features with different functions together into other factors. This analysis provided useful information about the relationship of feature content to feature function, demonstrating that feature content alone cannot be used to identify feature function in most cases. Therefore, this kind of analysis of feature content was avoided for the classification.of feature function at Adams Ranch. ; FEATURE CLASSIFICATION Several features could not be assigned to specific functional classes and are listed as unknowns with respect to function in Table 16-4, Feature function cannot always be ascertained on the basis of content alone because secondary deposition of artifacts inside the feature fill can create a false impression of feature use.-Unless a pit contains a very high proportion of a few specific artifact classes, it 209 is often impossible to determine its original function. For example, a small circular pit with high charcoal, baked clay, and fire cracked rock densities can be classified as a hearth, whereas the same pit without significant artifact increases cannot be classified with any degree of certainty. The effects of secondary deposition are especially prevalent for features within Feature 1. Features dug into the various zones of Feature 1 contained artifacts originally deposited in the zones as well as the artifacts associated with feature use. The contents of feature fill and the fill of the surrounding matrix were often so thoroughly mixed that they were indistinguishable. This fact is illustrated in Table 17-6 where macrobotanical remains floated from the fill of Zone 2d are nearly identical to those within features found in Zone 2d (see Chapter 17). As a result, these features are designated with an "f" in Table 16-4 to indicate that their classification represents a best estimate of function rather than a positive identification. Feature size and shape were important criteria for classifying features as roasting pits (large, asymmetrical pits) and post holes (small, symmetrical pits with tapering profiles). However, the results of a Chi-square analysis for size and shape at Bird Point Island (see Chapter 4) indicated that several features, such as hearths and storage pits, ranged in size from small to medium and could be either symmetrical or asymmetrical in shape. Therefore, size and shape alone could not be used as criteria for the classification of many features, just as feature content alone could not be used. This lack of criteria capable of providing positive identification of feature function is responsible for the large number of features assigned to the unknown category or _ designated by an "f in the other categories of Table 16-4. At Bird Point Island, features were assigned temporal designations on the basis of their vertical location within Feature 1 or their horizontal location with respect to dated features or structures such as House 1. At Adams Ranch, however, the only radiocarbon dates obtained came from Feature 1, so only those features inside Feature 1 can be confidently placed in a chronological scheme. Those features located outside of Feature 1 are listed as unknowns with respect to temporal placement, but the abundance of features found in the pit that date between A.D. 800 and A.D. 1000 suggest that most of these features also date to that period. ROASTING PITS Fewer roasting pits were found at Adams Ranch than at Bird Point Island, but those that were found looked nearly identical to the Bird Point Island features in size, shape, and content. Two definite roasting pits, Feature 12 and Feature 51, were recorded along with possible roasting pit Feature 101. Feature 12 was encountered in Units 59 and 60 just north of Feature 1 (Figure 16- 5). It was only partially excavated because it extended beyond the limits of these excavation units, so its complete dimensions are unknown, It must be fairly large, since it measured 252 cm x 72 cm within these units, and the incline of the pit wall indicated that the deepest portion of the pit was west of Units 59 and 60. Its high fire cracked rock content and its irregular, undulating profile are characteristic of roasting pits identified at Bird Point Island. Feature 51 was completely exposed by mechanical scraping after it was observed in 1 x 1 m Units 1108 - 1115 and 1140 - 1144. Its large size (ca. 16m?) and asymmetrical plan view (Figure 16-4) are remarkably similar to Features 34 - 36 and Feature 38 at Bird Point Island. The assemblages of both Feature 38 and Feature 51 were dominated by fire cracked rock; comparing all artifact classes listed as counts, 90.6 % of the Feature 38 assemblage and 89.9% of the Feature 51 assemblage were comprised of fire cracked rock. Feature 51 also contained an abundance of dart points, cores, and scrapers like those associated with Bird Point Island roasting pits. The fire cracked rock content of Feature 101 was high, although not as high as that of Feature 51, and the bone and mussel

These differences suggest that Feature 101 was used for fewer episodes of roasting than Feature 51, and perhaps more for the roasting of faunal resources than floral resources. A HORIZON ROASTING AREAS The A Horizon roasting areas form a class of features unique to Adams Ranch. Only one such feature (Feature 104) was recorded, but fire cracked rock concentrations corresponding to magnetic anomalies elsewhere on the site suggest that other such features exist (see Chapter 19). These features are concentrations of fire cracked rock confined to the A horizon, with no pit extending into the B horizon. It is clear from magnetic data that the rock concentrations have been burned and do not represent storage areas like those observed outside the structures at Bird Point Island (see Chapter 19). Because of the difficulty involved in observing A Horizon pits, there is no means of determining whether these features represent shallow roasting pits or simply areas where rock was piled, burned on the surface, and later entered into the soil by trampling and bioturbation.

These units were full of rock in the A horizon, but rock accumulation ceased at the interface with the B horizon. Examination of the artifact summary table (Appendix F) reveals that the frequencies for lithic debris and other artifacts are relatively low, whereas the fire cracked rock content is up to 15 times higher than the content of other 1 x 1 m units excavated at the site. This is unquestionable evidence that heat related activity took place in this location; the low frequencies of heat treated lithic artifacts at the site suggest that little thermal alteration of stone occurred, Therefore, roasting is the most likely function of these A horizon features. HEARTHS The same criteria used to identify hearths at Bird Point Island were used to classify features as hearths at Adams Ranch. The presence of oxidized soil indicative of in situ burning and the presence of charcoal were the principal criteria. Some hearths contained fire cracked rock, but not all hearths did. Feature 25 was a definite hearth inside Feature 1 which contained lumps of oxidized clay and an ash lens (see Figure 17-7). Similarly, Feature 68 contained lumps of oxidized clay. Features 100 and 103 contained high charcoal and fire cracked rock frequencies. Other features listed as possible hearths contained significant quantities of baked clay, but many were found within Zone 2d of Feature 1, which also contained a high proportion of baked clay (see Chapter 17) throughout the fill. Consequently, it is impossible to determine whether their high baked clay content is the result of in situ burning or simply secondary deposition resulting from their location within the fill of Zone 2d. DOG BURIALS Only one dog burial, Feature 52, was observed at Adams Ranch. This skeleton consisted of long bone fragments. and a mandibular ramus found in Zone 2c of Feature 1 (see Chapter 17). Although only a single dog burial was recognized during the course of excavation, other dog bones were recovered from Feature 1 fill that may represent dog burials which were too poorly preserved to be recognized by the excavators. POST HOLES Size (0.01 - 0.15 m2) and shape (circular in plan view, straight to tapering in profile) were the principal criteria used to classify features as post holes. No structures were recognized by the spatial arrangement of post holes at Adams Ranch, but post holes were found at scattered locations across the site. Post holes were present east of Feature 1 (P8 - P10) and north of Feature 1 (P11 - P13). Two post holes, P8 and P10 extended down 60 cm or so below the top of the B horizon (Figure 16-6). This is deeper than the other post holes, which ranged from 10 - 26 cm deep. Several post holes were found within Feature 1 (P1.- P7) and probably represent posts that formed drying racks or some other utilitarian structures, No house patterns were observed at Adams Ranch. POSSIBLE CREMATIONS Four features (Features 42, 47, 48, and 73) are classified as possible cremations because they contain high ‘densities of unidentifiable burned bone fragments. and, therefore, look quite

Unfortunately, the sample size from Adams Ranch is too small and too fragmentary to formulate conclusions regarding changes in dietary intake over time, sexual division of labor, or population dynamics. This section presents descriptions of the human skeletal remains recovered at Adams Ranch during the testing program and two seasons of mitigation.

BURIAL DESCRIPTIONS A total of eight human burials was recovered from Adams Ranch during testing and two seasons of intensive excavation. In addition, three proveniences were identified that contained burned bone which might possibly be human, although none of this burned

The locations of the burials and possible cremations are illustrated in Figure 16-3 and listed in Table 16-5. Burials are concentrated in Feature 1 and in Feature 102, a large (ca. 4.2 m2) pit immediately southeast of Feature 1 which was bisected by backhoe trench Unit 53 during Season I. Two of the three possible cremations were recovered between 140 and 160 cm below surface in Feature 1, at the interface of Zones 2 and 3. Feature 73, which is the most likely feature to contain cremated human remains, is located in the mechanically scraped area north of Feature 1 (Figure 16-3). DESCRIPTION OF SKELETAL REMAINS Osteological data are presented in tabular form. The age, sex, skeletal position, and orientation of the skeletons found at Adams Ranch are summarized in Table 16-6; brief descriptions of each individual are presented in Table 16-7. Anthropometric measurements for Burial 6 are presented in Table 16-8. Finally, pathologies noted are listed in Table 16-9. Since portions of Burials 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were disturbed by backhoe trenches, it was impossible to determine body position and was usually impossible to identify the orientation of the skeleton. Age determinations for sub-adults (Burials 2, 4, and 7) were based on dental eruption patterns. Burial 2 exhibited deciduous teeth, as did Burial 4. A radiographic analysis of the Burial 4 mandible revealed adult dentition within the dental crypts. This pattern follows an estimated age of 7 - 9 years (Shour and Massler 1941; Ubelaker 1978). All but the deciduous first molars of Burial 7 had been lost post mortem; development of the permanent dentition was observed from broken portions of the mandibular ramus.

PALEOPATHOLOGY The general disease categories recognized among individuals at Adams Ranch include: (1) arthritis, generalized degenerative boney changes inclusive of articular surfaces and vertebral bodies; (2) periostitis, generalized boney changes of the endosteum, cortical bone, or combinations of the two; and (3) neoplasms, new growths of abnormal tissue (i.e., tumors), The distribution of these pathologies is summarized in Table 16-9. Obviously, the small sample size precludes the formulation of conclusions regarding changes in diet, nutrient deficiencies, or infectious disease patterns over time. Only the A.D. 200 - 700 period burials from the site were complete enough or old enough at death to exhibit pathological lesions. No evidence of trauma was observed among any of the skeletal remains, suggesting that warfare was not a common occurrence at Adams Ranch.

J } L Features and Burials contain roasting pits, hearths, post holes, human burials, and dog burials. Some important differences between the sites also exist. No post hole patterns indicative of substantial structures were found at Adams Ranch. However, the presence of features related to food preparation (i.e., hearths and roasting pits), as well as the refuse discarded from meals (i.e., bone, mussel shell, and charred plant remains in feature fill) demonstrate that substantial occupation ocurred at Adams Ranch. The structures that were used as shelter must have been less substantial than those constructed at Bird Point Island; supporting poles must have been anchored entirely within the A horizon, since no post hole patterns were observed in the B horizon. . Another difference between the sites is the presence of A horizon roasting areas at Adams Ranch, and the apparent lack of these features at Bird Point Island. Although there are no chronological indicators associated with an A horizon roasting area, it is possible that A horizon roasting occurred during occupations when the roasting pits were not in use. An alternative hypothesis is that A horizon roasting areas were used for processing different materials than the roasting pits, and that both were used synchronously. Since few artifacts, other than fire cracked rock, were recovered from these features, it is not possible to test these hypotheses with the current data base. 219 The presence of human burials at Adams Ranch is another indicator of prolonged use of the site. Most burials that can be assigned to dated contexts were recovered from Zone 3 of Feature 1 (A.D. 200 - 700). These are the only burials that exhibited pathological lesions, but no conclusions about the health status of the population over time can be made because later burials were too young to exhibit degenerative changes or too incomplete to provide pathological data. The burial distribution is similar to that at Bird Point Island in that most burials were found within Feature 1. Like Feature 1 at Bird Point Island, burials recovered in Feature 1 at Adams Ranch included males and females as well as children. However, one important difference is that no cremations were positively identified at Adams Ranch. Only three proveniences were listed by Rutenberg as possible cremations. Another difference is a lack of additional cemetery areas such. as the cluster of burials found between Houses 2 and 3 at Bird Point Island. The only burials found outside Feature 1 at Adams Ranch were in nearby Feature 102. Additional features are listed in Table 16-4 as possible cremations because of their similar appearance to positively identified cremations at Bird Point Island. Unfortunately, the smail sample size of the Adams Ranch burials does not allow rigorious testing of bioarchacological hypotheses.

INVESTIGATION OF FEATURE 1 by. William A. Martin Like Feature 1 at Bird Point Island, Feature 1 at Adams Ranch is the largest and most complex feature at the site, and contains the only cultural deposit with interpretable stratigraphy. The size and depth of both features are also remarkably similar, For example, the pit at Bird Point Island measures 17 x 13 m and is 2.2 m deep, while the pit at Adams Ranch measures 18 x 15 m and is also 2.2 m deep. Even though Unit 49 was dug to a depth of 2.6 m, the area excavated below 2.2 m proved to be a rodent den rather than a cultural feature. The similarities between both features suggest thay they had similar uses and that the hypotheses generated as a result of excavations at Bird Point Island can be addressed with Adams Ranch data. The goal of this chapter is to examine all sources of data recovered from Feature 1 at Adams Ranch in light of the hypotheses generated during testing (Raab and Moir 1982:203) and in relation to the findings in Feature 1 at Bird Point Island. Whenever important similarities or differences between these two features warrant discussion, comparisons are made. However, many comparisons are reserved for the discussion of the Wylie focus concept in Part III of this volume (see Chapter 21). An understanding of Feature 1 utilization requires an explicit discussion of sampling strategies and an assessment of all data classes observed within the feature. These data classes include soils, features, burials, artifacts, floral and faunal remains, and radiocarbon dates. Although most of these classes are reported for the site as a whole in other chapters of the report, an effort to avoid redundancy is made here by examining data from a different perspective. For example, in this chapter artifact densities are used to understand different utilization within different layers of pit fill, whereas a discussion of the artifact types associated with these zones is reserved for the discussion of chronology presented in Chapter 18. Due to the complex nature of Feature 1, an accurate picture of pit chronology and use cannot be drawn unless some of the conclusions presented in subsequent chapters are considered. These conclusions are alluded to at appropriate points in the discussion, but repetition is kept to a minimum. SAMPLING AND EXCAVATION STRATEGIES The pit at Adams Ranch was investigated by a series of increasingly focused data recovery strategies, beginning with the testing phase and continuing through two seasons of mitigation. The testing phase excavation strategy was designed to examine the depression rapidly by excavating two intersecting backhoe trenches through its center (Units 4 and 17) to determine if it was of cultural or natural origin (see Figure 15-3). The trench profiles revealed distinctive soil layers which contained varying quantities of artifacts, demonstrating that the depression was the result of cultural deposition within a large man-made pit. Intrusive pits were also visible in the profile, reflecting continued use of the feature over time. Unit 14, a 1 x 1 m unit, was dug north of the intersection of Units 4 and 17 to recover a controlled sample of artifacts. It provided 240 lithic artifacts, many of which were associated with bone and mussel shell near the bottom of the unit between 90 and 110 cm below surface (McGregor et al. 1982: 46). Fourteen soil zones were recognized in the trench profiles on the basis of differences in soil color, texture, relative frequencies of charcoal, bone, and shell, and the presence of carbonate nodules (Figure 17-1) (McGregor et al. 1982:45). However, not all of these zones of soil color and texture differences represented cultural strata resulting from successive layers of deposition. Instead, two zones (Strata 11 and 12) were part of the natural C horizon subsoil, one (Stratum 3) was actually the sandy clay B horizon, another (Stratum 1) denoted the plow zone, and one (Stratum 7) represented the fill of an intrusive pit visible in the east profile (see McGregor et al. 1982:47 for illustrations of Strata 4, 7, 8, and 9 which were only visible in the east profile). The remaining strata represented layers with varying degrees of cultural deposition and temporal separation. Stratum 2 was defined as a homogeneous layer of very dark gray sandy loam 221

222 Volume II, Part Two UNIT 4 - WEST FACE werees vo UMENCAVATED © Busse, SHELL @ orvereance Sy CALICNE MODULES Figure 17-1. West profile of backhoe trench Unit 4 excavated during the 1980-81 testing program (after McGregor et al. 1982:47). containing some charcoal flecks and a small quantity of bone and lithic debris that capped Strata 5, 6, and 10. Stratum 5 consisted of black clayey soil containing a concentration of animal bone and mussel shell. An intrusive burial pit containing Burial 2, and a charcoal sample dating to A.D. 910 + 210 were found in this layer. Stratum 10 was comprised of lighter colored brown and dark brown sandy loam with carbonate nodules present throughout the matrix (McGregor et al. 1982:45). Burial 1 was recovered from this layer near the bottom of the pit in Unit 17 (Figure 17-1). These strata identified during testing were simplified into 3 major zones on the basis of Season IV data analysis. During Season I excavations at the site, the southwest quarter of Feature 1 was the focus of excavation. Season I research goals were: (1) to excavate a portion of the feature all the way to the bottom so that the original excavation and fill sequence could be examined, (2) to obtain radiocarbon dates necessary to address hypotheses related to periods of pit utilization, and (3) to collect artifacts indicative of pit function. These research goals were designed to test the hypotheses posited by Raab and Moir (1982:204). These hypotheses stated that (1) the pit had an Archaic period origin with use continuing through the Late Prehistoric period, and (2) pit utilization changed over time. Seven contiguous 2 x 2 m units were opened up parallel to Unit . 4 south of its intersection with Unit 17. Unit 42 was situated completely outside of the pit, whereas Units 44-49 were located inside Feature 1 (see Figure 15-4). During the last part of Season I, the crew moved to Bird Point Island to assist with the excavation. As a result, the only levels completed during Season I were: levels 1-3 in Unit 42, levels 1-6 in Units 44, 45, and 47, levels 1-5 in Unit 46, and levels 1-9 in Units 44-49. None of the hypotheses could be addressed with the limited set of data obtained from Season I excavations, so further research was postponed until an adequate sample could be excavated during Season IV. By the time Season IV began, all work within Feature 1 at Bird Point Island had been completed and refined hypotheses had been formulated regarding the nature of pit utilization (see Chapter 6). During Season IV at Adams Ranch, work conducted within Feature 1 was designed to test the hypothesized function of these features based on the findings at Bird Point Island (i.e., that the pits originally served as Late Archaic cemeteries and roasting pits, followed by intensive Late Prehistoric economic use for both roasting and trash disposal). The excavation strategy changed from excavation of the southwest quarter of the pit to the excavation of a trench all the way across the feature, as had been done at Bird Point Island. Contiguous 2 x 2 m Units 56-60 were excavated adjacent to Units 44-49 to complete the trench through the center of Feature 1 (see Figure 15-5). More than 47 m3 were excavated within the confines of Feature 1, which is estimated to be about 22% of the entire feature. The profile of this excavation revealed the entire fill sequence inside the pit, while Units 59 and 60 provided a sample of artifacts from the area immediately outside of the pit for comparison with artifacts recovered from the fill of Feature 1. Figure 17-2 shows the location of 1 x 1 m and 2 x 2 m excavation units dug to investigate Feature 1, as well as the location of backhoe trench Units 4 and 17, All units were excavated in arbitrary 10 cm levels, keeping the strata recognized by McGregor et al. (1982) separate within each level to maintain maximum control of provenience. In fact, additional transitional strata (2/10, 5/6, and 6/10) were defined to accommodate soils that had characteristics of two or more of the strata defined in 1982. This fine level of separation permitted analysis both by level and by stratum to determine which of the strata had clear functional or chronological implications important for understanding the aboriginal uses of the pit. Under this system, a single level could have three or more bags of artifacts associated with it, one for each of the strata observed within the level. For example, in Unit 56, levels 9-13 contained Strata 6, 5/6, and 14; these were collected separately and coded separately so that they could be recovered from the computer printout by either stratum or level, depending on the the nature of the analysis desired. Screening procedures were identical during Seasons I and IV, ‘so both data sets are very comparable. Ten liters of soil were coliected from the northwest corner of each level and water screened through 1/16 inch (1.4 mm) mesh; the remaining soil was water screened through 1/4 inch (6 mm) mesh. The only discrepancy between the Season I and Season IV data sets occurs with respect to fire cracked rock. During Season I, the numerous fragments of Wilcox sandstone found all across the site were thought to be natural inclusions in the soil and were not collected. As a result, fire cracked rock frequencies for the upper portion of the pit are missing from Units 44-49 and can only be examined for Units 56-58 which were dug during Season IV. During Season I, the upper 10 cm of soil in some units was comprised entirely of overburden consisting of backdirt from backhoe trench Units 4 and 17. In these units, level 1 actually began 10 cm below the present ground surface after the overburden was removed. In units with insignificant amounts of overburden, level 1 began at the present ground surface. As a result, the depth of level 1 in the first group of units matches the depth for level 2 in the relatively undisturbed units. A line level attached to a vertical datum was used to guide excavation in Units 42 and 44-49, so all levels match up along the same horizontal plane. However, to make accurate comparisons among units, depths of levels should be compared rather than level numbers. Because Units 56-60 were situated on a slope, arbitrary levels were measured down from all four corners of each unit in increments of 10 cm (20 cm for plow zone level 1), rather than from the line level attached to the vertical datum. These units were dug parallel to the existing ground surface, so that all levels match up along the same inclined plane to avoid crosscutting the strata. Finally, in Unit 56, level 18 was accidentally dug as a 20 cm thick level. Since sterile C horizon soil was present in most of the unit at this depth, level 19 was removed by scraping the feature fill away from the subsoil until it lensed out 40 cm below level 18. The bottom 30 cm of Unit 57 represented Feature 54, which was excavated as a feature rather than as a series of 10 cm levels. SIMPLIFICATION OF STRATA INTO ZONES Upon completion of the data analyses, Strata 1-14 and the transitional strata recorded during Season IV were examined to

Strata 1 and 2 were collapsed together and designated as Zone 1 because they exhibited similar artifact densities and similar proportions of artifact classes (Figure 17-3). The only distinction between these Strata was due to recent cultural disturbance (plowing) that created a slight color difference due to the leaching of organic matter in the plow zone. Zone 1 at Adams Ranch was very similar to Zone 1 at Bird Point Island both in color (1OYR3/ 1), and depth of the deposit (75 - 90 cm below surface). Stratum 5 was quite distinctive visually, and contained a distinctive assemblage that included the highest densities of bifaces, baked clay, bone, and mussel shell found within Feature 1. The top of Strata 5 and 6 appeared to form an old surface upon which Zone 1 accumulated. Although some differences in assemblage composition were noted between these strata (more fire cracked rock in Stratum 6 and more bone, shell, etc. in Stratum 5), both strata exhibited increased artifact density in their uppermost levels, suggesting that both were the result of an episode of intensive occupation. A similar increase in artifacts occurred in the uppermost levels of Stratum 10 in Units 46 and 47. Stratum 10 in these units lay directly beneath Zone 1 at about the some depth as Strata 5 and 6, so even though the soil color was Similar to the Stratum 10 fill in the bottom of the pit, the increase in artifact content indicated that it was related to the same episode of intensive occupation. A heavy clay flood deposit was present from 60 - 75 cm below ground surface, immediately over the top of these strata. Since all of these layers contained artifacts related to the same period of intensive occupation, these strata were grouped together to form Zone 2 (Figure 17-3). Zone 2 was subdivided into Zones 2a through 2d on the basis of assemblage variability and soil color variability. A separate pit dug into the south end of Feature 1 contained arrow point types identical to those found in the rest of Zone 2. Although this pit was listed as a possible pit intrusive into Stratum 10 in McGregor et al. (1982), it was not until Season IV that clear evidence of a separate pit was found. This outer pit was first observed at a depth of 80 cm below surface, where undisturbed yellowish brown subsoil formed a division between the original excavation of Feature 1 and the subsequent outer pit excavation (Figure 17-3). In the field, the outer pit fill was designated as Stratum 15; it was redesignated as Zone 2a for the purposes of this report. Stratum 10 (above level 10 in Units 46 and 47) and Stratum 2/10 were collapsed to form Zone 2b. Similarly, Strata 6, 6/10, and 5/6 were collapsed to form Zone 2c, and Stratum 5 was redesignated as Zone 2d. Stratum 10, apart from the upper portion in Units 46 and 47, had low artifact content and moderately high faunal content with great faunal diversity like Zone 3 of Feature 1 at Bird Point Island, Stratum 10 represents the original fill episode of the pit, and was

OL]JOIg isaey —> Feature 1 redesignated as Zone 3. Zones 1, 2, and 3 in Feature 1 at Adams Ranch are very similar to Zones 1, 2, and 3 in Feature 1 at Bird Point Island with respect to soil color, artifact content, and depth below ground surface. However, Feature 1 at Adams Ranch also exhibits differences from the pit at Bird Point Island. For example, the outer pit dug into the south rim of Feature 1, and the flood layer marking an old surface are unique to Adams Ranch. DESCRIPTION OF FEATURES AND BURIALS Although metric data and the volume-corrected contents of all features are presented in Chapter 16, and raw data for all features are presented in Appendix G, verbal descriptions of Feature 1 features are provided here to examine patterns of Feature 1 utilization. The distribution of features, burials, and post holes within Feature 1 is broken down by zone in Table 17-1, and Figure 17-4 illustrates their locations within the pit. For the purposes of this study, features are considered to belong to the zone within which they were first observed and are placed within the temporal span assigned to that zone unless clear evidence show them to be associated with a later zone. ZONE 1 Of the 35 features, 5 burials, and 7 post holes recorded within the entire Feature 1 block excavation, only Features 6, 14, and 22 could be definitely placed within Zone 1. It is assumed that all of the post holes found in Zone 2 were actually associated with Zone 1, but were not visible until they penetrated Zone 2. Feature 6 was a concentration of midden debris in Units 47 and 48 between 50 and 60 cm below surface. It consisted of a deer mandible, teeth, long bone fragments, and antler. It also contained four incised sherds which fit together to form a single large rim sherd (see Figure 18-4e), No pit was visible and no soil color or texture change was noted. This feature appears to represent an episode of refuse disposal in which bones and broken pottery were discarded into the depression in the pit during one of the later occupations of the site. Feature 14 was an oval, roughly basin-shaped pit containing a high density of fire cracked rock within a very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) matrix. It was probably used as a hearth and was situated on the rim of Feature 1, between 25 and 57 cm below surface in Unit 58 (The term rim as used in this discussion denotes the edge of the pit at its contact with the B horizon, not an earthen berm along the perimeter of the pit.) Since it is situated near a roasting pit (Feature 12) and another hearth (Feature 13) in Unit 59, this hearth was probably part of a roasting/cooking activity Table 17-1 DISTRIBUTION OF FEATURES IN FEATURE 1 AT ADAMS RANCH Zone 1 Zone 2 Zone 3 6 28 20 16 10 36 14 40 21 17 ll 37 22 41 31 18 15 53 Pl 42 33 19 Bl P2 45 34 25 B3 P3 47 35 B2 B6 P4 48 43 B8 B7 PS 49 44 P6 46 P7 50 52 54 225 UNIT $8 UNIT 57 UNIT 56 BACKHOE TRENCH UNIT 17 ORIGINAL EXTENT OF FEATURE 1 (A.D. 200) UNIT 49 UNIT 48 UNIT 47 Sandy Clay B Horizon UNIT 46 ZONE 2a Antler OUTER PIT {A.D, 800) UNIT 45 UNIT 44 ZONE 1 ZONE 2 ave ZONE 3 Figure 17-4.

226 area north of Feature 1 and was not intentionally placed within Feature 1. Feature 22 was a concentration of poorly preserved bone, probably deer bone, in a poorly defined pit in Unit 45 at a depth of 63 cm. This feature must have been dug after the initial flood episode because the pit fill was a 10YR3/2 sandy loam, whereas the surrounding soil at this depth was comprised of the 10YR3/1 black clay flood deposit. The pit boundaries were impossible to delineate once the flood deposit was removed and all soil in Unit 45 became a homogeneous dark sandy loam. Therefore, the bottom of the feature was never precisely defined. It appears to represent refuse tossed into a pit after use for some unknown function. Most of the post holes from later Zone 1-were first observed in Zone 2a and in adjacent Zone 2b, except for P5 which was observed near the center of the pit in Zone 2d (Figure 17-4). No clear post hole pattern indicative of a structure was observed, but the presence of post holes indicates that some specialized activities involving structures, perhaps drying racks, were conducted at the south end of Feature 1 during one of the later occupations. Profiles of these post holes are illustrated in Figure 16-6. Zone 2 Zone 2 contained the vast majority of the cultural features recorded within Feature 1, including 32 features and two human burials. Some features were found in the center of the pit, but many features were concentrated near the edges of the pit. For example, eight features were found in Zone 2a at the south edge (the outer pit) and 11 features were within Zone 2c near the north edge. This pattern contrasts with the pattern observed in Zone 2 at Bird Point Island, where most features were found in the center of the pit. Zone 2 features and burials are discussed by the four subdivisions described earlier. Zone 2a Zone 2a contained eight features, but no burials were identified. Feature 28 consisted of fragments of a charred log spread over a 120 x 40 cm area in Unit 45 at a depth of 86 cm. Numerous small fragments were collected along with a few large fragments for a total of 120 g of charcoal. This log must have bumed in situ, judging from the pieces of baked clay that were recovered from the matrix surrounding the charcoal. Feature 40 is an enigmatic feature present in Units 45 and 46 and extending east into backhoe trench Unit 4. It was not observed until Unit 46 was completed and the pit became visible in profile in Unit 45. Feature 40 was intrusive into Zone 2a and extended 40 cm deeper than the rest of the zone, down to a depth of 180 cm below surface. The pit walls were nearly vertical and actually undercut the subsoil in the lower 40 cm of the pit. No clear upper boundary was visible, so it is not possible to determine the depth at which the feature originated. The pit fill was a series of soil lenses ranging in color from brown (10YR4/3) to very dark gray (10YR3/1), with a lens of oxidized reddish brown (7.5YR4/6) soil in the upper portion of the feature (Figure 17-5). The artifact content was moderate to low; although bone and shell were relatively frequent, and macrobotanical content was extremely low. The fill was divided into upper, middle, and lower portions for flotation sampling. This sampling scheme revealed that the greatest concentration of charcoal and hickory shell was in the middle portion of the fill, but artifact content was uniform throughout the entire feature. The most unusual aspect of Feature 40 was the presence of an entire deer antler with five tines found within the reddish brown soil lens (Figure 17-6). The antler showed no evidence of cutting or utilization of kind, very much like the antler in Feature 62 at Bird Point Island. In Chapter 6 it was proposed that the antler in Feature 62 may have been interred ceremonially due to its close ‘proximity to cremation burials.

South profile of Unit 45 (below level 7) illustrating the profile of Feature 40. burned bone densities were found in Zone 2a, the bone was unidentifible. Since no positive identification of cremations was made, the presence of antler appears unrelated to funerary ceremonial activity. Feature 40 probably had an economic function, but its exact use is difficult to ascertain. The low density of fire cracked rock and baked clay, coupled with the virtual absence of plant foods, indicates that it was not a roasting pit. The series of lenses visible in the pit fill suggests that it was intentionally filled in after use. Thus trash disposal is masking the initial function of the pit. The remaining features recorded within the outer pit (Zone 2a) were observed near the bottom at a depth of 130-140 cm below surface. Their dark 10YR3/2 and 10YR3/3 fill stood in distinct contrast to the yellowish brown 10YR5/6 subsoil at the bottom of Zone 2a. Features 41 and 49 could not be assigned a specific function because there was nothing distinctive about their shape or content that reflected their use. They may represent areas where the bottom of Zone 2a penetrated deeper into the subsoil, creating the impression of separate features once the subsoil surrounding them was exposed. Features 42, 45, 47, and 48 appear to represent hearths, or possibly secondary cremation burials (Figure 17-7). They are marked by high densities of charcoal, baked clay and burned bone. Because of their high burned bone content, they appear very similar to cremations found at Bird Point Island and

Feature I Figure 17-6. Whole deer antler recovered from the reddish brown clay lens in Feature 40. have been listed both as hearths and possible cremations in Table 16-4 to indicate this similarity, The bone was too fragmentary to be positively identified by either the physical anthropologist or the faunal analyst, so the cremation hypothesis remains untestable. Cremations outside of Feature 1 at Bird Point Island contained little or no baked clay, but Burials 19 and 20 inside Feature 1 exhibited very high baked clay densities (see Chapter 4), so the presence of baked clay in the Zone 2a features does not necessarily eliminate the possibility that they might be cremations. Although most of these features cannot be positively eliminated from either class of feature, some evidence suggests that Feature 42 was most likely a hearth rather than a secondary cremation burial. A patch of oxidized reddish brown (2.5YR4/8) soil was found beneath a pitted stone in the center of this feature, along with large fragments of charcoal. Both of these phenomena suggest in situ burning characteristic of hearths. Zone 2b Zone 2b contained only two features. The color of the fill in these features was barely distinguishable from the surrounding matrix, so their outlines in plan view and profile were nearly impossible to delineate. Feature 20 was an oval patch of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) sandy loam that was only 6 cm deep in profile and only contained a few fragments of fire cracked rock. Feature 21 contained charcoal and baked clay in quantities very similar to those found in Zone 2c. It may actually represent a remnant of Zone 2c which consisted of refuse dumped into the depression. Likewise, Feature 31 consisted of a bone concentration within a poorly defined patch of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) soil. This appears to represent trash discarded into the depression. Features in Zone 2b contain refuse, but there is no clear evidence of hearths or roasting pits like those found in other subdivisions of Zone 2. Zone 2c Zone 2c comprised the largest portion of Zone 2, and it contained 12 features. However, very few of these features can be classified with confidence because their low artifact density is indistinguishable from the artifact density for Zone 2c as a whole. Several of these features were classified as unknowns with respect to function because they contained so little artifact data. Features 16, 17, and 18 were found together at a depth of 80cm below surface in Unit 57. The high charcoal, baked clay and fire 227 Figure 17-7. Features 47, 48, and 49, hearths or possible cremations in the bottom of the outer pit (Zone 2a). cracked rock densities of Feature 18 indicate that it was used as a hearth, but little can be concluded from the content of Features 16 and 17. Since Feature 17 and 18 were only about 10 cm and 3 cm deep respectively, they may have originated in Zone 1. Feature 33 appears to represent refuse tossed into the depression, since no pit was visible when the amorphous very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) stain was sectioned. Feature 34 was an oval pit with very dark gray (1OYR3/1) fill containing only 5 flakes and 11 fire cracked rock fragments. Feature 35 was a shallow pit, only 12 cm deep, containing dark brown (10YR2/2) fill that was practically devoid of artifacts. Feature 43 was a circular basin-shaped pit found at a depth of 150 cm in Unit 57. It contained very dark grayish brown 10YR3/2 fill with 18 flakes, 24 fragments of fire cracked rock and 1.3 g of burned bone and charcoal. These contents suggest that Feature 43 was a hearth, but the volume-corrected densities for these artifact classes are lower than for other hearths, so this classification is uncertain. The same is true of Feature 44, an oval basin-shaped pit containing 19 flakes, 47 fragments of fire cracked rock, high bone content (20.3 g unburned, 1.2 g burned), and two untyped dart points. Feature 46 was a shallow pit in Unit 57 with very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) fill containing 4 flakes, 6 fragments of fire cracked rock and negligible quantities of everything else. Similarly, Feature 50 contained only three flakes and six fragments of fire cracked rock. Feature 52 was the only dog burial recognized within Feature 1 at Adams Ranch (although dog bone was recovered elsewhere in the pit). It consisted of a poorly preserved canine mandibular ramus and friable long bone fragments scattered within an area measuring 30 x 15 cm. The presence of these bones in such a small area suggests that this feature represents a dog burial; however, no articulated bones were observed, so it is also possible that the bones represent refuse from a meal. Dogs were usually eaten only on ceremonial occasions according to historic accounts from several cultures across the North American continent (cf., Quimby 1962; Tooker 1965). Therefore, the presence of these dog bones may reflect ritual feasting rather than ceremonial dog interment. Feature 54 is another enigmatic feature similar to Feature 40 that was found at the bottom of northenmost end of Feature 1. It contained only three flakes and 23 fragments of fire cracked rock, but contained 215.5 g of antler and unburned bone, and a relatively high density of charcoal. Traces of hickory nut shell and Psoralea were also present, but the low fire cracked rock quantity indicates that it was not a roasting pit. Like Feature 40 in Zone 2a, Feature 54 exhibited a series of lenses of fill including dark organically enriched layers (1OYR3/1, 3/2, and 3/3) with lenses of yellowish brown subsoil (10YR5/6) and mottled brown fill

228 Figure 17-8. Features 10, 11, 15, 19, 25, and PS being excavated in Zone 2d of Feature 1. (10YR3/3 with 10YR5/4). Also like Feature 40, Feature 54 contained a deer antler within one of the darker lenses. However, the tines had been removed from this antler, so it was probably used as a tool. Again, the variety of lenses is interpreted as evidence of an intentional fill episode. Thus, artifacts included in the feature fill may be unrelated to feature use. ZONE 2d Zone 2d, originally called Stratum 5, appears to represent a short term episode of refuse disposal along with cooking and roasting activity. This zone contained five features and two burials (Figure 17-8). The black (10YR2/1) soil contained very high baked clay, deer bone, and mussel shell densities (Figure 17-9). The high faunal and baked clay content is reflected in all of the intrusive features found in Zone 2d, making them all appear to be hearths. Many are classified as possible hearths (Features 10, 11, 15, and 19) but only Feature 25 contains baked clay and fire cracked rock densities far exceeding those of Zone 2d as a whole. Feature 10 was a nearly perfectly circular pit with a diameter of 95 cm. It contained very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) fill, a bifacial scraper, 36 flakes, 14 fragments of fire cracked rock, 31.9 g of unburned bone, 11.4 g of burned bone and 19.5 g of baked clay as well as large quantities of charcoal and Psoralea. Feature 11 was a smaller oval pit east of Feature 10 that contained 14 flakes, 11 fragments of fire cracked rock and a similarly high proportion of bone, baked clay, and macrobotanical remains. Feature 15 contained no fire cracked rock but had a high proportion of bone, mussel shell, hickory nut shell, and Psoralea. Feature 19 contained a high quantity of burned bone (16.7 g) anda moderate amount of fire cracked rock (11 fragmerits). It had contents similar to the cremations at Bird Point Island and is listed as a possible cremation in Chapter 16. Feature 25 was the only oval pit with all the attributes characteristic of a hearth (Figure 17-10). Oxidized clay (218.5 g) was visible within an ash deposit in the center of the feature, both of which indicate in situ burning. Approximately 91 g of unburned Volume II, Part Two Figure 17-9. An example of the deer bone and mussel shell concentrated throughout the fill of Zone 2d. Many deer bones had been intentionally split to remove marrow. bone, 18 g of burned bone, and 141 g of mussel shell were recovered from this feature. Even though Feature 25 contained a similar quantity of burned bone as Feature 19, the evidence of in situ burning precludes the possibility that it was a secondary cremation burial. Burial 2, a juvenile, and Burial 8, an adult cranial fragment, were also recovered within Zone 2d. The lower long bones of Burial 2 were recovered in backhoe trench Unit 4 during the testing phase, and the remainder of the skeleton including the cranium, axial skeleton, and upper long bones was carefully recovered during Season IV investigations. Examination of the dental eruption pattern by a physical anthropologist confirmed the original age estimate of 6 to 8 years (Rutenberg, personal communication 1985). Burial 8 is the right parietal fragment of an adult of indeterminate sex that was found within the grave pit for Burial 2. This fragment was situated adjacent to the Burial 2 cranium, about 5 cm to the west. ZONE 3 Only three features were identified within Zone 3. Feature 36 and 37 were found in the uppermost part of the zone and may have Figure 17-10. Feature 25, a hearth in Zone 2d.

Only Feature 53 was well within Zone 3, near the bottom of the pit in Unit 49. Zone 3 also contained four human burials, two of which were within the block excavation and two of which were in backhoe trench Unit 17. Feature 36 was observed as a diffuse brown (10YR4/3) stain in plan view; it was more clearly visible in profile as a basin-shaped pit. The fill contained high frequencies of baked clay (12.3 g) and bone (11.8 g) but low densities of other artifact classes and macrobotanical remains. It is classified as a possible hearth primarily because of the high baked clay content. Feature 37 appeared as.an irregularly shaped patch of dark grayish brown (10YR3/3) against the yellowish brown (10YR5/4) fill of Zone 3. However, no pit was visible in profile, so this appears to represent a load of refuse-laiden fill tossed into the depression. Moderate densities of lithies, fire cracked rock, baked clay and bone were recovered from this patch of dark soil. Feature 53 was found at the bottom of Zone 3 in Unit 49, between 220 and 231 cm below surface. The fill was a loosely compacted sandy loam containing charcoal flecks, five flakes, eight fragments of fire cracked rock, and traces of baked clay and bone. Its content was too low to determine its function. Burials 1 and 3 were recovered in Unit 17 during the testing phase near the bottom of Feature 1 at a depth of 170 - 180 cm below surface. Burial 1 was a female who was at least 35 years old at the time of death. Much of the skeleton was left in situ, so the burial orientation was not established, but the skeletal material disturbed by the backhoe was collected and analyzed. Burial 3 is the left temporal bone of an adult of unknown gender, This bone was found in association with Burial 1 and exhibited slight pitting similar to that observed on the Burial 1 cranium (Rutenberg 1982:86). During Season IV excavations, Burials 6 and 7 were recovered from Zone 3. Burial 6 was the nearly complete, tightly flexed skeleton of an adult male, whereas Burial 7 consisted of the mandible of a child (see Chapter 16). The soil covering Burial 6 was indistinguishable from the yellowish brown (10YR4/6 and 5/6) subsoil marking the bottom of Feature 1. The lack of darker A horizon soil in the grave fill indicates that the grave was excavated shortly after Feature 1 was dug, and was then filled with C horizon soil sometime before Feature 1 was partially refilled to form Zone 3. Burial 7 was found within a rodent run near the bottom of Unit 49, so its original point of deposition is unknown. CHRONOLOGY OF PIT UTILIZATION Only five radiocarbon dates were obtained at Adams Ranch, and all of these were recovered from features, burials, or general fill within Feature 1. Table 17-2 lists these five dates by zone, along with their maximum range; Figure 17-11 illustrates their approximate locations within the pit profile. Unfortunately, charcoal sufficient for a reliable radiocarbon date was not obtained from Zone 1. The charcoal sample from the highest point in the pit profile came from the interface of Zones 1 and 2d at a: depth of 100 - 110 cm below surface in Unit 49. This date (A.D. 960 + 80) could be associated with either the Zone 2 occupation or one of the earliest Zone 1 occupations. Temporal distinctions between Zones 2 and 3 are indicated by the remaining dates. The early date from Zone 3 (A.D. 200.+ 100) was obtained from wood charcoal scattered throughout levels 19 and 20 in Unit 49 near the bottom of the pit. Collagen from Burial 1 provided the later date of A.D. 640 + 70. Since bone collagen from Bird Point Island burials consistently dated later than charcoal found in the same ' proveniences, it is possible that the date obtained for Burial 1 may also be too recent. The earliest date from Zone 2 (A.D. 910 + 210) extends back only as far as A.D. 700, even when the broad standard deviation is included. Thus, a clear temporal separation is apparent between Zones 2 and 3. In addition to radiocarbon dates, other lines of evidence demonstrate temporal differences among zones, with the clearest distinctions observed between Zones 2 and 3. The vertical distribution of arrow points, which are clear markers of the Late Prehistoric period, shows a marked decline in arrow point frequency in Zone 3 (Figure 17-12). Including all fragments, the ratio of arrow points to dart points for Zone 1 is 38:14 or 2.7:1 which is very similar to the Zone 2 ratio of 35:16 or 2.2:1. In Zone 3, however, the ratio drops to 2:7 or .28:1. The ceramic data are even more striking. Zones 1 and 2 contained grit/grog/bone tempered wares, whereas Zone 3 contained only thin, shell tempered ware (Figure 17-13). Two shell tempered sherds were present in the lower portion of Zone 2, but were located in portions which are clearly intrusive into Zone 3; they were mixed into Zone 2 as a result of the intrusive digging. Although conventional chronologies place shell tempered ware after grit, grog, or bone tempered wares (cf., Suhm and Jelks 1962), shell tempered ceramics have been recovered in Late Archaic contexts at three other sites in the Richland Creek area (see Chapter 15, Volume III). Therefore, the ceramic distribution agrees well with the radiocarbon dates obtained from the pit. The chronology of utilization for Feature 1 can be defined on the basis of radiocarbon dates and the temporal information supplied by the distribution of artifacts. Since shell tempered ceramics were present in Zone 3 at Adams Ranch, but were absent from Zone 3 at Bird Point Island (ca. 170 B.C. - A.D. 130), it is clear that the introduction of shell tempered wares occurred after A.D. 130. Thus, the original excavation of Feature 1 at Adams Ranch probably occurred close to the A.D. 200 radiocarbon estimate, The final utilization of Zone 3 appears to be represented by Burial 1, extending the range as late as A.D. 700. The ceramics in Zone 2 are part of the ceramic tradition of East Texas which began around A.D. 800 (cf., Suhm and Jelks 1962). The maximum range of the radiocarbon dates places the upper limit of Zone 2 occupation at A.D. 1120. However, A.D. 1000 may be a more accurate estimate, since the ceramics deposited in Zone 1 are similar to those associated with the houses at Bird Point Island dating between A.D. 1000 and 1200. Zone 1 must be assigned to the post-A.D. 1000 period, but additional refinement is impossible because no radiocarbon dates are available for this layer.

Feature 1 The final chronological estimates for the three zones within Feature 1 (and hence, for the major periods of site occupation) are summarized as follows. Zone 1 dates from A.D. 200 - 700 and falls within the Late Archaic period. Zone 2 dates from A.D. 800 - 1000 and represents an early Round Prairie phase occupation. Finally, Zone 1 dates after A.D. 1000 and represents a mixture of Round Prairie and St. Elmo phase occupations. UTILIZATION OF FEATURE 1 In this section, artifact density, features, burials, and the floral and faunal remains associated with each zone in Feature 1 are examined to address the hypotheses related to feature function. Specifically, the results of Bird Point Island excavations led to the hypothesis that these features were originally intended for limited economic use as well as for mortuary purposes. Later, economic uses such as roasting and trash disposal took precedent and the mortuary role diminished during the later occupations. Evidence for both mortuary and economic uses of the pit is examined in the following sections. MORTUARY AND CEREMONIAL USE The presence of human burials within Zones 2 and 3 of Feature 1 clearly demonstrates that the pit served a mortuary function. However, unlike Feature 1 at Bird Point Island, the mortuary role at Adams Ranch was very limited. Only six burials were recovered in Feature 1 at Adams Ranch as opposed to 13 burials at Bird Point Island. At both sites, the burials were confined to the trench of contiguous 2 x 2 m units and backhoe trenches which bisected the feature. Since, this represents a comparable area in both features, the greater number of burials at Bird Point Island cannot be attributed to the excavation of a larger area at that site. The relatively low density of burials in Zone 3 at Adams Ranch suggests that the mortuary function was secondary, and that the pit was originaly excavated for some other purpose. The majority of burials (67%) was found within Zone 3 between 125 and 240 cm below surface, whereas only two burials (33%) were present in Zone 2, Zone 1 was devoid of human remains, which indicates that Feature 1 ceased to be used as a cemetery during the later periods of site occupation. Unlike Bird Point Island, no definite human cremations were identified at Adams Ranch. However, some burned bone fragments were classified as possible human bone (see Chapter 16) and features with very high burned bone densities similar to the cremations at Bird Point Island were present in Zone 2a. Therefore, it is possible that cremations occurred at the site even though no definite conclusions may be drawn. Ceremonial interment of dogs occurred in the lower zones at both sites. Three dog burials were recognized in Feature 1! at Bird Point Island, but only one was recognized at Adams Ranch (Feature 52 in Zone 2c). However, other dog bones were found at various levels within the lower zones of both pits. The poor state of preservation of these remains makes it difficult to determine whether they were ceremonial interments or simply refuse from meals. Even if these dogs were eaten and their bones were discarded in the pit, ceremonial behavior is still indicated. Ethnohistoric accounts across the North American continent repeatedly note that dogs were eaten ordinarily on ceremonial occasions as part of ritual feasts (cf., Quimby 1962; Tooker 1965). Therefore, the presence of dog bones reflects either intentional interment or evidence of ritual feasting, both of which indicate that Feature 1 had a ceremonial function. The mortuary function of Feature 1 was greatest during the A.D. 800-1000 period. Although Zone 1 was devoid of human burials, Burial 2 in Zone 2d may have been intrusive from Zone 1, so limited use of the pit for burial purposes could have continued into the post-A.D. 1000 period before it ceased entirely during the final occupations of the site. 231 NONMORTUARY USES The extremely low density of human skeletal remains attests to the fact that Feature 1 was not intended to be used solely as a cemetery. To understand the primary function of this large pit the floral, faunal, and artifact contents of each zone must be scrutinized. In Table 17-3, artifact densities are presented by zone as artifacts per cubic meter. The assemblage composition of each zone is expressed as percentages in Table 17-4. The Zone 1 data presented in Table 17-4 include only Units 56-53 for which fire cracked rock data are available. Zone 1 contained relatively low densities of all artifact classes, except ceramics, which were the highest. The low density for most classes reflects both infrequent use of the depression after A.D. 1000, and increased colluvial deposition during this period. Colluvium gradually covered the artifacts, resulting in fewer artifacts per cubic meter of soil. After A.D. 1000, trash disposal may have been the primary function of the depression. Features 6 and 22 appear to represent discarded refuse. The high sherd frequencies were concentrated in the upper three levels of Zone 1, reflecting episodes of trash discard during the final occupations of the site, well after A.D. 1000, However, fire cracked rock and charcoal densities, as well as magnetic data (see Chapter 19), suggest that some degree of roasting also occurred. When the assemblage composition is compared, the Season IV data indicate that Zone 1 has proportions of baked clay, charcoal, and fire cracked rock similar to those associated with roasting pits at Bird Point Island (Table 17-4). This activity may have been confined to the north end of Feature 1, since other roasting pits are located just outside of Feature | to the north. Zone 2a had low artifact densities for most classes, but had the highest dart point and uniface densities. The significance of these two classes is difficult to assess, but the low density of fire cracked rocks and baked clay indicates that roasting was not the primary . function of the outer pit. Likewise, Zone 2b had high densities of arrow points and unifaces, but low densities of other classes. Therefore, its function also remains unclear on the basis of artifact density. On the other hand, Zones 2c and 2d contained high densities of fire cracked rock, baked clay, charcoal, bone, and shell. These items are characteristic of roasting and cooking activities. In addition, the presence of hearths further supports the idea that economic activities were concentrated in Zones 2c and 2d. Zone 2d had extremely high densities of bone and shell, the highest of any zone in Feature 1. At least three deer and 193 mussels were present in this layer (see Chapter 18). Since Zone 2d was an intrusive pit into Zone 2c, its contents probably represent a short term deposit, perhaps the refuse from a single season's occupation or even the remains of a large feast. The specific events are not discernible, but it is clear that the primary function of Zones 2c and 2d was cooking and/or roasting. Zone 3 contained the lowest densities for most artifact classes, . but had moderately high bone and shell densities. From the perspective of artifact density alone, this would suggest that refuse from cooking was discarded into the Zone 3 fill, and that other activities did not occur aside from interment. However, when the percentages in Table 17-4 are examined, the Zone 3 assemblage appears to be dominated by fire cracked rock, just as in Zone 2c. These zones also have similar proportions of baked clay, charcoal, bone, and shell. Therefore, roasting must have occurred in the pit during the original period of use in addition to ceremonial activities. The low density of fire cracked rock and other artifacts simply indicates that roasting was limited to a short duration, not that the activity did not take place. A more precise look at the vertical distribution of artifacts is provided by Table 17-5. This table presents artifact densities on a level by level basis for Units 45, 47, 49, and 57. Collectively, these units represent all of the zones observed in Feature 1. The most striking vertical changes in artifact densities occur within the levels comprised of the clay flood deposit and those levels immediately beneath this deposit. For example, in Unit 47, artifact density drops dramatically within the flood deposit (50 - 70 cm)

Likewise, Unit 49 shows a sharp increase in artifact density for all classes immediately beneath Zone 1 (90 - 100 cm). These trends reflect the intensive level of occupation associated with Zone 2, and the temporary cessation of activities that occurred during the flood episode. Units 45 and 57 do not exhibit evidence of occupation along this surface, Zone 2a in Unit 45, (the outer pit) was excavated sometime around A.D. 800 and the flood occurred shortly thereafter, sometime between A.D. 800 + 80 and A.D. 960 + 80. As a result, there was little opportunity for artifacts to accumulate along the surface. In Unit 57, Zone 2c contained several intrusive pits which disturbed any evidence of a surface. These pits also mixed Late Prehistoric period artifacts deeper into the pit fill. For example, arrow points in this unit are concentrated down to 160 cm, and are found as deep as 200 cm below surface. The same general trends discussed for each zone are also apparent on this level by level comparison. For instance, extremely high densities of bone, shell, baked clay, and fire cracked rock occur in levels associated with Zone 2d in Unit 49 (90- 140 cm). Beneath these levels, in Zone 3 (140 - 240 cm), densities of lithic debris, fire cracked rock, and baked clay decline, with a sharp drop below 190 cm. In these same levels, bone and shell densities remain high and actually increase in some levels, illustrating the major role of fauna in the Zone 3 assemblage. At Bird Point Island, the macrobotanical contents of features in each zone illustrated an increased economic utilization of Feature 1 over time. At Adams Ranch, the macrobotanical contents of features were also examined to assess the level of economic activity conducted in each zone. Table 17-6 lists the volume- corrected macrobotanical contents of the features by zone. In addition, a flotation sample of non-feature fill (FS 429) recovered from Zone 2d is included. Notice that this sample contained very high densities of plant remains, equal to or surpassing the contents of the features intrusive into Zone 2d. This situation demonstrates the fact that feature content is directly related to the contents of the fill in each zone of Feature 1. Thus, feature content is a relatively accurate representation of zone content. Conversely, this example demonstrates that feature function usually cannot be accurately determined on the basis of feature content alone. The distribution of macrobotanical remains indicates that most plant foods were processed in Feature 1 during the Zone 2 (A.D. 800 - 1000) occupation. Hickory, pecan, acorn, Psoralea, and seeds are weil represented in the Zone 2 floral assemblage, especially in Zones 2c and 2d. Although floral remains occur in Volume II, Part Two Zones 1 and 3, the primary food appears to have been hickory nuts. Very low densities of other plant foods are indicated for the majority of Zone 1 and 3 features, although Psoralea is present in two of the three Zone 3 features. On the basis of artifact, floral, and faunal densities, it is clear that some degree of economic activity was conducted within all zones of Feature 1. Whereas at Bird Point Island the greatest amount of economic activity occurred within Zone 1, at Adams Ranch, Zone 2 was the focus of economic activity. At both sites, Zone 3 was used for both mortuary and economic activity related to the processing of fauna and the preparation of plant foods. At Bird Point Island, burials and cremations were observed in the center of Feature 1, whereas features with economic functions concentrated near thé edge of the pit. This was not true of the distribution at Adams Ranch, where burials and features were evenly divided between the pit edge and the center (Table 17-7). No clear patterning is discernible with respect to this distribution of features. The horizontal distribution of artifacts is similarly inconclusive. Artifact densities increase immediately outside Feature 1 in Unit 59, similar to the pattern observed immediately outside the pit at Bird Point Island. This increased density is due in part to the fact that erosion has removed much of the A horizon sandy loam and deposited it downslope within the depression of the pit. However, increased activity around a roasting pit (Feature 12) immediately north of Feature 1 is probably responsible for most of the observed increase in artifact density. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Feature 1 is a complex feature containing a variety of soils that have been grouped together into three major zones. Each zone yielded either radiocarbon dates or specific artifact types that permitted the site chronology to be reconstructed. On the basis of this information, three major periods of site occupation are proposed. First, the pit was originally dug and partially filled to create Zone 3 between A.D. 200 and 700.

Finally, after A.D. 1000, the pit gradually filled with colluvium and alluvium. Although occupation continued during this period, the low artifact densities of Zone 1 indicate that it was less intensive than the previous occupation. Both ceremonial mortuary activity and economic activities were conducted within Feature 1. The sequence of Feature 1 utilization may be summarized as follows. The original Feature 1 excavation occurred sometime around A.D. 200 and encompassed the area from the center of Unit 46 on the south, northward to the present pit edge in Unit 58 (see Figure 17-3). Economic and mortuary uses of the pit appear to have occurred simultaneously. Burials 1 and 6 were definitely interred at this point in time, judging from their location in the bottom of the pit and the presence of only C horizon subsoil in the grave fill, Burials 3 and 7 may have been interred at this time, but their fragmentary nature precludes a final determination. The composition of the artifact assemblage is marked by a high proportion of fire cracked rock ‘ indicative of roasting. The high faunal and relatively low floral content of Zone 3 suggests that animal foods may have been processed to a greater extent than plant foods. Low densities of all classes suggest that economic activities were confined to a relatively short duration. Zone 3 appears to represent a rapid fill episode. The fill is a mixture of A, B, and C horizon soils characterized by a mixture of soil colors. The dominant chromas of Zone 3 are light chromas, indicating that there has been little accumulation of organic matter in the fill (Janak, personal communication 1985). If Feature 1 had been left open for an appreciable length of time, organic matter would have entered into the fill and created a darker soil layer

Apparently, the pit was intentionally refilled to within 1.4 m of the present ground surface by the Late Archaic period inhabitants. . Zone 2 appears to have been:created by the gradual deposition of artifacts and the simultaneous erosion of the remaining backdirt surrounding the pit, which washed in to fill the depression to within 80 cm of the ground surface. A flood episode deposited sediment that brought Zone 2 to within 65 cm of the surface. The darker soil color is due to the accumulation of organic matter from natural sources (leaf litter, etc.) and the leaching of organic matter from the organically rich flood deposit. The addition of refuse by the site inhabitants also contributed to an increase in organic matter. The artifacts found between 80 and 140 cm below surface in Zone 2 were deposited during an intensive period of occupation between A.D. 800 - 1000. Shortly after A.D. 800, Feature 1 was enlarged by the excavation of an outer pit (Zone 2a). This pit cut through the original south edge of Feature 1 and extended the south edge an additional 3 m to the south.

The inclusion of a whole deer antler in Feature 40 may represent ceremonial activity, but the principal focus of activity appears to have been related to cooking,” judging from the number of hearths found in the bottom of this it. P Roasting and cooking activities were conducted in all subdivisions of Zone 2, especially Zones 2c and 2d where densities of fire cracked rock, charcoal, baked clay, and flora and fauna were extremely high. Although Burials 2 and 8 were found in Zone 2d, the mortuary role of Feature 1 appears to have diminished by that point in time. After A.D. 1000, colluvial deposition continued as the sandy loam A horizon from upslope washed in to fill the depression even further, creating Zone 1. The low artifact density of Zone 1 indicates that site occupation was less intensive after A.D. 1000. The depression was used primarily for trash disposal, except at the extreme north end where cooking and roasting activities were concentrated, The final layer of sediment deposited within the Volume II, Part Two depression was a clayey flood deposit which was confined to the modern plow zone. The few post holes observed in Zone 2 are assumed to have originated in Zone 1 and are therefore associated with the post A.D. 1000 occupation. No coherent post hole patterns were observed that would suggest the construction of substantial architecture within the pit. The few post holes that were found probably represent arbor-like structures or drying racks used during one of the later occupations. In conclusion, results of the excavations inside Feature 1 at Adams Ranch show many similarities with trends observed in Feature 1 at Bird Point Island. For instance, Zone 3 at both sites dates from the Late Archaic period and contains human burials, low artifact densities, and moderately high faunal densities. Some differences are also apparent between the two sites. Zone 3 at Bird Point Island contained more burials.than found at Adams Ranch. It also lacked shell tempered pottery like that found at Adams Ranch, which suggests it was in use earlier than Feature 1 at Adams Ranch. However, the presence of fauna and fire cracked rock at both sites indicates that the pits were not designed solely for mortuary use. Apparently, economic activities such as cooking and roasting were conducted within Zone 3 at both sites. During later occupations, economic utilization continued while the mortuary role diminished. Other similar trends are apparent, but they are associated with different zones at each site. For instance, at Bird Point Island there are few artifacts and features clearly associated with the A.D. 580 - 860 occupation of Zone ,whereas Zone 1, dating from A.D. 1000 - 1650, contains greater densities of artifacts and features. At Adams Ranch, on the other hand, the highest artifact densities and greatest number of features are associated with the A.D. 800 - 1000 occupation responsible for the Zone 2 deposit, and artifact densities drop in the post-A.D. 1000 deposit of Zone 1. These data suggest that both pits were originally excavated and used during the Late Archaic period. Then, intensive occupation was concentrated at Adams Ranch until A.D. 1000. After A.D. 1000, intensive occupation shifted to Bird Point Island. Thus, the use of these features at both sites appears to have been sequential rather than concurrent.

CULTURAL MATERIALS AND SUBSISTENCE REMAINS by . William A. Martin with contributions by James E. Bruseth, Gayle J. Fritz, Phillip Murry, and Richard Fullington The lithic tools, ceramics, and floral and faunal remains recovered from all contexts at Adams Ranch are described in this chapter. The results of analysis are presented within a chronological framework to examine changes in projectile point and ceramic manufacture over time, as well as changes in the selection of plant and animal species exploited for food from one period to the next. All lithic tools are described in the first section, and their distributions are presented in the second section. The vertical distribution of projectile points within Feature 1 is used to develop a projectile point chronology for the site, and the horizontal distribution of all tool classes is examined to investigate activity areas, The ceramic sherds are described and analyzed by James E. Bruseth, who places them within the framework of the ceramic traditions recognized elsewhere within the Project area. Next, the floral species are described by Gayle Fritz, who compares the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch flora and discusses similarities and differences in the assemblages. The vertebrate faunal assemblage is described by Phillip Murry, and finally, the molluscan faunal assemblage is discussed by Richard Fullington. LITHIC ARTIFACTS LITHIC ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS In this section, the various classes of lithic artifacts identified at Adams Ranch are described and quantified. The definitions of each class are presented in Chapter 7, so they are omitted here. PROJECTILE POINTS Arrow Points Alba (22 specimens, Figure 18-1a). These specimens have rectangular stems with straight to slightly convex bases. They exhibit triangular blades with prominent right-angled shoulders. Large specimens with blades more than 3 cm in length are not uncommon in the Adams Ranch assemblage. Catahoula (1 specimen). This specimen has concave blade edges, full barbs with squared ends, and an expanding stem with convex base. Cliffton (7 specimens). All of these specimens exhibit broad triangular blades with very short contracting stems. All specimens were recovered from Feature 1 between 70 and 100 cm below surface. Cuney (2 specimens). Both specimens are characterized by short expanding stems with concave bases and triangular blades with barbed shoulders. Fresno (1 specimen; Figure 18-1b). This is a small triangular point without a stem. The base is straight to slightly concave. Friley-like (1 specimen). This specimen has an expanding stem and recurved barbs along with a serrated blade. Hayes (1 specimen). This specimen has a triangular blade with concave edges and a bulbous stem with a rounded base. Livermore-like (1 specimen). This specimen has a. long slender blade with prominent shoulders and an expanding stem. Perdiz (6 specimens; Figure 18-1c). These specimens exhibit triangular blades with pronounced shoulders and contracting stems. Blade edges are marked by fine serrations. Scallorn (11 specimens, Figure 18-1d). These specimens are corner notched, with triangular blades and expanding stems. They have prominent right-angled shoulders or downward pointing barbs and straight to concave bases. 237

Arrow points from Adams Ranch: (a) Alba, (b) Fresno, (c) Perdiz, (d) Scallorn, (e) Steiner, (f,g) Untyped, contracting stem, (h) Untyped, straight stem, (i,j) Untyped, bifurcated stem. Steiner (26 specimens; Figure 18-1e). These specimens have deeply serrated triangular blades, straight to slightly expanding stems, and straight to convex bases. Untyped Contracting Stem (13 specimens; Figure 18-1f,g). These specimens are highly variable, but some are deeply serrated and look like Steiner points except for their contracting stems. Untyped, Straight Stem (14 specimens, Figure 18-1h). Untyped, Expanding Stem (12 specimen). Untyped, Bifurcated Stem (6 specimens; Figure 18-1i,)). These specimens vary in morphology, but two major patterns are repeated. In the first pattern, the bifurcated base is formed by a combination of corner notching and basal notching. Specimens belonging to this pattern have pronounced downward-pointing barbs that project outward from a narrow serrated blade (Figure 18-1i,j). The second pattern is characterized by a straight stem with a concave base. The shoulders form an obtuse angle with the stem and are moderately to weakly developed. Untyped, Bulbous stem (1 specimen). Untyped, Fragmentary (17 specimens). Volume II, Part Two Dart Points Dawson (5 specimens; Figure 18-2a} All of these specimens have narrow triangular blades, weakly developed shoulders, and straight to slightly contracting stems. Two specimens have rounded bases, and three exhibit cortex on their bases. Elam (3 specimens). These specimens are short with weakly developed shoulders, rectangular stems and slightly convex bases. Gary, Regular Variety (30 specimens; Figure 18-2b). These specimens have triangular blades, contracting stems, and rounded bases. Blade morphology varies with shoulders ranging from weakly developed to prominent. The blades of three specimens are beveled. Gary, Small Variety (4 specimens; Figure 18-2c). These specimens are identical in morphology to the Gary, regular variety, but they are all less than 3 cm in length. Stratigraphic information from site 41FT193 indicates that this variety may date later than the regular variety. Gary, Serrated Blade (6 specimens, Figure 18-2d). These specimens are nearly identical to the Gary, regular variety, except that they exhibit pronounced serrations along the blade. Two of the specimens have beveled blades. The serrated specimens are similar to the Neches River, oletha variety defined by Prewitt (1974b:67). Untyped, Corner Notched (1 specimen; Figure 18-2e). This broken specimen is corner notched with an expanding stem and convex base. It is similar in form to an Ellis point. Untyped, Contracting Stem (13 specimens; Figure 18-2f). These vary dramatically in morphology. Some points, such as the one illustrated, are very similar to Gary points except that they exhibit straight bases instead of the round bases characteristic of Gary points. The illustrated specimen is beveled and one other specimen is serrated. Untyped, Straight Stem (9 specimens; Figure 18-2g). These specimens have highly varied morphology. Two specimens are beveled and one is serrated. Untyped, Expanding Stem (5 specimens; Figure 18-2h). These specimens vary in morphology, but none are beveled or serrated. Untyped, Bulbous Stem (1 specimen). This specimen has a triangular blade with a broad convex stem exhibiting cortex along the base. Untyped, Fragmentary (9 specimens). BIFACES Finished Bifaces Gouge (2 specimens). Both specimens have steeply chipped bits that represent unifacial retouch, but other edges exhibit bifacial retouch. The gouges are roughly rectangular in shape. Drill (1 specimen). This is the narrow blade portion of a reworked dart point. Drill/Awl (4 specimens; Figure 18-3a). These specimens are identified by their long, very narrow and thin, bifacially worked blades. The bases on these specimens are the unworked proximal portions of flakes.

Bristol Biface (4 specimens). These specimens are circular in outline with non-sinuous edges. All of the specimens found at Adams Ranch were within the 1 x 1 m units cutting across roasting pit Feature 51. Knife (27 specimens; Figure 18-3b,c). These specimens have at least one straight blade edge formed by fine, secondary retouch, Outline morphology ranges from leaf shaped (Figure 18-3b) to subtriangular (Figure 18-3c). Scraper (2 specimens). These specimens each have a single working edge that is more sinuous than the edges associated with knives. 239 Aborted Bifaces Early Stage (19 specimens). These are thick specimens with highly sinuous edges that appear to represent aborted attempts at the bifacial reduction of cobbles, or large, thick, primary flakes. Some specimens exhibit cortex. Late Stage (16 specimens). These specimens have been bifacially thinned to a greater extent than the early stage bifaces as -evidenced by less sinuous edges. However, no evidence of fine secondary retouch is present. Arrow Point Preforms (12 specimens). These specimens are bifacially retouched flakes that are subtriangular in outline. They lack basal modification for hafting. Biface Fragments Possible Projectile Point Tip Fragments (39 specimens). These are pointed distal fragments of projectile points. Of the 27 specimens, 19 are dart point size and 6 are arrow point size. Possible Projectile Point Base Fragments (21 specimens). These are the proximal ends of stemmed projectile points.

240 Possible Projectile Point Medial Fragments (27 specimens) Fourteen of these specimens are dart size medial blade sections and thirteen are arrow point size. Possible Projectile Point Indeterminate Fragments (171 specimens). These are broken specimens showing bifacial retouch along one or more edges. UNIFACES Steeply Chipped Unifaces End Scraper (14 specimens). These are thick flakes exhibiting steep unifacial retouch along the distal or proximal end. Some specimens also exhibit retouch along their sides. Side Scraper (22 specimens; Figure 18-3d). These are thick flakes which have steep unifacial retouch along one or more edges. Scraper with Graver Spur (5 specimens). These are side scrapers which have one or more pointed tips along the steeply chipped edge. Seraper on Tabular Pieces of Silicified Wood (15 specimens; Figure 18-3e). These are thin slabs of silicified wood which have been steeply chipped to form a bit. Many specimens exhibit retouch along one end and also along one or more lateral edges. Marginally Modified Unifaces Graver (16 specimens). These are small thin flakes with one or more pointed tips resulting from retouch. Denticulate (12 specimens). These are flakes exhibiting retouch along one lateral edge such that three or more regularly spaced, pointed tips are present. Concave Working Edge or Notch (99 specimens). These specimens have been retouched such that one or more concave notches are present. Straight to Convex Working Edge (941 specimens). These specimens consist of flakes and broken flakes with minimal retouch flake scars along one edge. Regularly patterned flake scars are visible on some specimens, but the majority exhibit random flake scars. Flakes in the latter group look similar to flakes which have sustained edge damage as a result of post-depositional trampling (cf., Gifford-Gonzalez et al. 1985:815). MISCELLANEOUS ARTIFACTS Cores Split or Tested Nodule (30 specimens). These are cobbles with one or very few flakes removed. Freehand Percussion Core Bifacial Platform (7 specimens). Flakes were removed bifacially from the core, but with no attempt to thin the parent nodule. Cortex Platform Single Platform (1 specimen). This specimen has a single cortex platform at one end. Double Platform (3 specimens). These specimens have two cortex platforms located at opposite ends. Multifaceted Nodule (33 specimens). On these specimens flakes have been removed from a number of directions without consistent platform development. Volume II, Part Two Prepared Platform (3 specimens). The platforms were prepared by splitting the cobbles. The resulting flat surfaces were then used as platforms for the removal of flakes. Small Bidirectional Cores (1 specimen). This specimen is similar to a bipolar core formed using the hammer and anvil technique. Core Fragments (48 specimens). These are broken cores which are too fragmentary to allow further classification. Pecked, Ground, and Battered Stone Hammerstone (16 specimens). These specimens are cobbles which exhibit battering on one or more ends. Seven of the eight are quartzite cobbles and one is a chert cobble. Mano (2 specimens). These specimens are oval cobbles of quartzite with flattened smoothed surfaces on one side. Grinding Slab (3 specimens). These specimens are all slabs of limestone with smoothed surfaces forming shallow depressions. All of the specimens were recovered inside Feature 1. Pitted Stone (2 specimens). These are oval to rectangular blocks of sandstone which have one or more small depressions or “pits” pecked into their surfaces. These are sometimes called nutting stones or anvil stones. Grooved Abrader (2 specimens). These sandstone specimens vary in outline, but both have a smooth linear groove which was apparently used for grinding or abrading. Ground Stone Fragments (2 specimens). These specimens have a ground surface, but are too fragmentary to permit further classification. LITHIC ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS CHRONOLOGICAL PLACEMENT OF PROJECTILE POINT TYPES As stated in Chapter 17, Feature 1 contained the only well dated contexts in which projectile points were recovered. The projectile point types recognized within the various zones of Feature | are listed in Table 18-1 (dart points) and Table 18-2 (arrow points). The chronological estimates for each zone are used to estimate the periods of use for each type. The earliest occupation at Adams Ranch, ca. A. D. 200 - 700, was dominated by the use of dart points. Gary points and untyped, contracting stem points are associated with this time period. Although an arrow point fragment was recovered deep within Feature 1, it was probably removed from its original point of deposition higher up in the profile by the action of burrowing rodents. Certainly, more than a single arrow point fragment would have been found if the bow and arrow had been in use during the first period of Feature 1 utilization. During the A. D. 800 - 1000 period, Gary points and untyped contracting stem dart points continued to be used, but untyped, straight stem dart points also came into use. In addition to the Gary, regular variety, the Gary, serrated blade variety began to be used. This type is similar to the Neches River, oletha variety which is associated with the Middle Archaic period by Prewitt (1974b:67). However, it has been found in a post-A.D. 300 context at site 41FT193, and appears to be associated with Late Archaic through Round Prairie phase sites in the Richland Creek vicinity. Arrow points limited to the A.D. 800 - 1000 time frame (i.e., those found only in Zone 2) include Steiner, untyped, straight stem points, and untyped, bifurcated stem points. Several arrow point types were present in both Zones 1 and 2, indicating a long period of use beginning around A.D. 800 and continuing to some c _" ot gua gu wT a we oe ot eee Oe

These post-A.D. 800 types include Alba, Cliffton, and Scallorn points, as well as untyped, contracting stem and untyped, expanding stem styles. Arrow points that occur only during the post-A.D. 1000 occupations associated with Zone | include Catahoula and Perdiz points. This time frame agrees with the temporal estimate for Perdiz points of A. D. 1200 to 1500 (Turner and Hester 1985:187), and falls within the upper range of dates for Catahoula points set at about A. D. 1100 (Turner and Hester 1985:168). Gary _ points continued to be used along with arrow points throughout the entire span of the Late Prehistoric period occupations, as evidenced by their presence in the uppermost levels of Feature 1. The projectile point chronology established for Feature 1 was used to examine the horizontal distribution of point types across the site in an effort to identify areas associated primarily with a single occupation period. Unfortunately, point types from all major periods of occupation were distributed uniformly across the site, so no chronological separation of site areas was observed. The presence of a Fresno point on the north half of the site indicates that occupation continued well into the Late Prehistoric period, but artifacts from all periods of occupation were present. Most of the dart and arrow point types found outside of Feature 1 are associated with the A.D. 800 - 1000 occupation. ASSEMBLAGES OF SITE SPATIAL DIVISIONS The stone tool assemblages found within the different spatial divisions of the site are examined here to assess functional variability. Specific tool classes (Table 18-3) were collapsed into generalized categories (Table 18-4) to obtain ceil frequencies large enough to permit Chi-square analysis. This analysis was conducted to identify statistically significant differences among the assemblages which might reflect different activities associated with each of the site areas. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 18-5 as a matrix of Chi-square values and associated probability values. The .05 level of significance was selected to test the hypothesis of assemblage homogeneity. The assemblage of Area A is significantly different from the assemblages of Areas C and D. Likewise, the Area B assemblage is significantly different from that of Area C. The source of these differences and their relationship to different activities can be observed by examining Table 18-4. This table reveals that Area A contains much higher proportions of projectile points, finished bifaces, and steeply chipped unifaces than do Areas C and D. A high incidence of these classes was observed for roasting pits at 241 Bird Point Island (see Chapter 7), and since Area A encompasses roasting pit Feature 51, the similarity to a roasting pit assemblage is not surprising. Activities directly related to the use of Feature 51 must have been concentrated around the edge of this feature, so any artifact classes present inside the feature would also have been discarded along its periphery. On the basis of lithic tools, Area A appears to have been the focus of roasting and food processing activities associated with Feature 51. Area B differs from Area C in that it has slightly higher proportions of all tool classes, except aborted bifaces and marginally modified unifaces. Only finished bifaces are found in Area B whereas twice as many aborted bifaces are found in Area C than finished bifaces. At Bird Point Island, a higher incidence of aborted bifaces was noted inside House 1, which appears to reflect stone tool manufacture that occurred inside the house (see Chapter 7). Although sampling error resulting from the small sample size of the Area C assemblage might be responsible for the observed pattern, the results indicate that Area C was a locus of stone tool manufacture. Activities involving the use of finished bifacial tools, such as butchering, occurred within Area B. However, when lithic debris concentrations are considered in addition to the tool classes described here, Area B also appears to have been a locus of lithic reduction (see Chapter 19). The assemblage of Area D does not fall into an easily recognizable pattern; this is probably due to the fact that the size of the area is large enough to encompass several smailer activity areas which were used for a variety of purposes. The activities conducted within Area D, as well as the other site areas, can be better understood when the spatial maps for all artifact classes are considered (see Chapter 19). Tables 18-3 and 18-4 also include the lithic tool assemblage recovered from each zone of Feature 1. However, all frequencies were too low to permit statistical analysis of assemblage homo- geneity, so only general observations are noted here. Zone 3 contains a higher proportion of steeply chipped unifaces than any other zone of Feature 1. The high proportion of steeply chipped unifaces, together with the high proportion of fire cracked rock is characteristic of roasting pit assemblages, and supports the idea that Zone 3 was used for roasting. However, the Zone 3 assemblage differs from a typical roasting pit assemblage in its extremely high proportion of marginally modified unifaces. This difference suggests that some other economic activity in addition to roasting was conducted in Zone 3.

Zones 2b and 2c have high proportions of projectile points and low proportions of marginally modified unifaces, similar to roasting pits, but lack high proportions of steeply chipped unifaces. Lack of clear patterning in the lithic assemblages of these zones might be due to activities that did not require the use of specific stone tool assemblages, but more likely are due to multiple activities which resulted in a mixture of assemblages. CERAMICS (by James E. Bruseth) A total of 354 sherds was recovered from the Adams Ranch site. Table 18-6 lists selected ceramic attributes according to the spatial areas of the’ site, the zones defined for Feature 1 and selected features. The Feature 1 sherds are examined by zone to illustrate chronological relationships within this well dated Stratigraphic context. Information on the design element configurations observed in the ceramic assemblages is presented in Table 18-7 and a sample of these is illustrated in Figure 18-4. These element configurations have been discussed in Part One of this volume, and the reader should reference Table 8-9 for descriptions of specific configurations. The majority of the ceramics from the site belong to the grog, grit, and bone temper tradition found at most sites within the reservoir and dated between A.D. 900 and A.D. 1600. These ceramics occur across all spatial divisions of the site and within Zone 1 of Feature 1. Paste textures of these sherds vary considerably and range from coarse to fine, Exterior sherd colors also vary and range from shades of yellow (7.5YR6/6 and 10YR6/6), to brown (7.5YR3/4, 10YR3/2, 10YR6/4), and gray Table 18-4-continued Zones within Feature 1 # % # % # % # % # % # % Projectile Points 17 89 8 10.7 17 (27.4 18 25.4 12 15.2 4 53 Finished Bifaces 1 Pe] 4 33 5 81 1 #14 1 #13 Aborted Bifaces 5 26 1 13 4 65 4 56 1 13 3 3.9 Biface Fragments 28 «14.7 21 28.0 8 13.0 23 «(31.4 10 12.7 9 118 Steeply Chipped Unifaces 4 21 2 27 2 32 2 29 4 5.1 6 7.9 Marginally Modi- fied Unifaces 115. 60.2 38 «50.7 22 «36.0 18 25.7 44 55.7 52 68.4 Cores 21 11.0 1 13 4 6.6 3.71 7 89 2 26 Total 79 76

Interior and core colors tend to be darker (10YR3/1, 10YR3/2, and 10YR4/1). Sherd thicknesses range from 6 to 11 mm and average 8.3 mm. Only one rim sherd was large enough for a diameter measurement to be made; this measurement was 12.6 cm. Vessel shapes were difficult to discern from the small size of most sherds. However, those shapes that could be observed included carinated and simple bowls and straight and flaring rim jars. Lip forms were most often rounded with occasional flat and beveled varieties also occurring. The ceramics belonging to this tradition were decorated with a variety of techniques. Incision was the most common decorative technique, usually forming the design element configurations Crosshatched Incised Lines and Diagonal Incised Lines. Both of these configurations are similar to the ceramic type Canton Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962). Punctations are next most common and are generally randomly placed. Brushed and slipped sherds were also recovered. The distribution of design element configurations across the site is shown in Table 18-7. Minimal interpretation can be made about the distributions since the sample of identifiable specimens is small. However, the configurations tend to indicate that occupation around Feature 1 occurred primarily during a single period of time approximately corresponding to the Round Prairie phase identified at Bird Point Island. The relatively distinctive element configuration, Fingernail Punctations Separated by Incised Lines (similar to types Weches Fingernail Impressed; Suhm and Jelks 1962), is also found at Bird Point Island. . In addition to the grog tempered sherds from the site, 10 shell tempered sherds were recovered. These sherds all possess a platey texture with shell tempered paste and belong to a shell tempered tradition seen at other sites within the Project area. Not all of the sherds of this group have shell visible in the paste, but those lacking shell show vesicules where this material has leached eut. Evidence for sherds once having had shell comes from other sherds which have both shell and vesicular (or leached) areas. The surfaces of the shell tempered sherds are eroded and pitted. Exterior colors are generally light (7.5YR6/4, 7.5YR7./4, and 10YR8/3) with interior and core colors darker (10YR3/1 and 10YR4/2). The thickness of the sherds is uniformly thin, ranging from 4 to 6 mm and averaging 4.9 mh. All of the sherds are undecorated body specimens. It is quite significant that the majority of these sherds occur within Zone 3 of Feature 1. The ceramic distributions from Feature 1, where radiocarbon dates allow good chronological control, indicate a temporal estimate for the shell tempered ware between A. D. 200 and A. D. 700. This Volume II, Part Two dating is consistent with the temporal occurrence of this ceramic tradition at other sites within the Project area. Finally, a single sandy paste sherd was recovered from Zone 1 of Feature 1. Elsewhere in the Project area, this type of ceramic has been associated with A. D. 700 to 900 dates and has been found in association with grog tempered sherds. The occurrence of this sherd in the upper layer of the large pit is confusing since a later temporal estimate has been assumed. The sherd may not be in primary context. The exterior color is a very dark brown (10YR3/1) and the interior and core colors are yellowish brown (10YR5/4). The sherd thickness is 7 mm. Three sherds from Zone 1 of Feature 1 were thin-sectioned and examined by a petrographic microscope. The results are fully presented in Appendix C of Volume III. Briefly, the analysis supported the results of visual identification of certain temper types and demonstrated local manufacture of the ceramics from the site. MACROBOTANICAL REMAINS (by Gayle J. Fritz) Fifty-nine flotation samples from Adams Ranch were examined for macrobotanical remains using the methodology explicitly stated in Chapter 9, Table 18-8 lists the weights of macrobotanical remains recovered from these samples. Wood charcoal was present in 58 samples, with sorted particles greater than 2 mm weighing a total of 23.56 g. Hickory nutshell, in 54 features, weighed a total of 26.68 g. Pecan shell from 20 samples weighed 0.86 g and acorn shell from 15 samples weighed 0.14 g. Psoralea tuber fragments weighing 1.52 g were recognized in 23 samples, while charred rhizome segments were found in four samples with a total weight of 0.12 g. Fragments of unknown substances were present in 37 samples, weighing 1.79 g. A total of 202 seeds other than “unidentifiable” fragments was sorted from the Adams Ranch flotation samples. The seeds fall into only six categories (Table 18-9). The collection was clearly dominated by wild-sized sumpweed (Iva annua), which was present in 18 features, totaling 166 specimens. Complete achenes (fruits), pericarp fragments, and free kernels (true seeds) were all represented. The seed counts of individual samples adjust for duplication of specimens if kernels and pericarp fragments are both present; in other words, a sample with two loose kernels and half of a pericarp shell would be counted as two specimens rather than three. Other seeds at Adams Ranch are the vetch type (Vicia and/or Lathyrus) with 11 specimens from six samples, grape family (Vitaceae), with 13 specimens from 13 samples, spurge family (Euphorbiaceae), with two specimens from separate samples, maygrass (Phalaris caroliniana), with one specimen, and nine unidentified seeds. Twelve fragments from six samples are currently considered unidentifiable. The Vitaceae specimens are mostly present in fragments. They are believed to be a type of wild grape (Vitis), but other genera such as Ampelopsis and Parthenocissus can not be ruled out. Thirty-eight of the features from which flotation samples were processed could be assigned temporally. Of these, three features were assigned to the A. D. 200 - 700 time period, 27 features to the A. D. 800 - 1000 time period, and eight features to the post-A. D. 1000 time period. Table 18-10 presents percentages of plant food remains by weight for the three periods. The three A. D. 200 - 700 features combined yielded less than a gram of carbonized plant foods, consisting of an average of 83.7% hickory nutshell, 10.4% tuber, and 5.9% seed (2 Vitaceae and 2 unidentified). The 27 features assigned to A. D. 800 - 1000 accounted for 18.65 g plant food remains, or 78% of plant food weight from the site as a whole. Hickory nutshell contributed 85.1%, followed by 4.9% pecan shell, 3.1% Psoralea tuber, 1.3% acorn, and 0.1% rhizome. Seeds were present in 21 features of this period, with a total of 191 seeds. The 5.5% value for seed weight is, of course, distorted by the procedure of calculating any weight of less than

The figure is skewed even more by the high weight of seeds in Feature 34. The 73 sumpweed seeds from that feature weighed 0.1 g, more than the 0.02 g hickory nutshell and 0.05 g pecan shell, the only other plant food types represented. All but one of the 166 sumpweed seeds recovered from Adams Ranch came from features assigned to the A. D. 800 - 1000 period, as did seven of the 11 vetch seeds, nine of the 13 Vitaceae seeds, both spurge seeds, the single maygrass caryopsis, and seven of the nine unidentified seeds. Most (97.7%) of the plant food weight in the eight post-A. D. 1000 features consisted of hickory nutshell. No plant food remains other than hickory nut shell were recovered from six of these features, and the other two contained only smail amounts of pecan, acom, Psoralea tuber, and rhizome. Three seeds were recovered from the later features: two vetch and one Vitaceae. In general, the A. D. 800 - 1000 assemblage indicates a more intensive occupation than in earlier or later centuries, with a relatively more even distribution of food types. The presence of so many seeds from features dating to A. D. 800 - 1000 may be in part a function of greater soil disturbance due to the concentration of more people or of longer term settlement episodes. The macrobotanical remains from Adams Ranch are similar in many ways to those from Bird Point Island, but are distinctive in certain respects. For example, the flotation samples from Adams Ranch consisted of more nutshell than wood, whereas the Bird ~ Point Island features consisted of more than twice an much wood

Hickory nutshell contributed a consistently higher relative proportion of plant foods at Adams Ranch, with all time periods yielding more than 80% hickory nutshell. At Bird Point Island, the two major components (A. D. 1000 - 1200, and A. D. 1300 - 1650) averaged approximately 75% hickory nutshell for plant foods by weight. Pecan nutshell was most abundant in the A.D. 1300 - 1650 component at Bird Point Island, averaging 7.2% of the plant food weight, but it was also important at Adams Ranch, contributing 4.9% of plant food weight in the A.D. 800 - 1000 features. Acorn was less prevalent at Adams Ranch than in averaged samples from any time period at Bird Point Island, as was Psoralea. Psoralea tuber fragments were present in only 48% of the A.D. 800 - 1000 features at Adams Ranch, constituting 3.1% of the plant food weight. During the A.D. 1000 - 1200 component at Bird Point Island Psoralea was recognized in 90% of the non- post hole features, averaging approximately 10% of the plant food weight, and it was slightly more ubiquitous still in features from the A.D. 1300 - 1650 component. Seeds, however, were relatively well represented at Adams Ranch, with the 202 identifiable seeds distributed through 30 of the 59 features (50.8%). The 248 seeds from Bird Point Island were distributed across 47 of the 87 features (54.0%) analyzed. The seed-to-hickory nutshell ratio is higher for Adams Ranch (7.6) than for Bird Point Island (4.9). The vetch type was the most common seed at Bird Point Island, with a total of 96, largely due to the presence of 51 seeds in a single feature. Sumpweed came in second with 63 specimens.

(sumac), and Rhus toxicodendron (poison ivy). FAUNAL REMAINS In the following sections, the vertebrate faunal assemblage from the entire site is discussed by Phillip Murry and a sample of the molluscan faunal assemblage is presented by Richard Fullington. The methodology used at Bird Point Island was also used to identify species at Adams Ranch. Detailed discussion of the methodology and of the habitat requirements for each species identified is presented in Chapter 9. Faunal data from Adams Ranch are presented in tabular form paralleling the format used to report Bird Point Island faunal data. The results of the analysis are summarized to address changes in faunal exploitation over time, indicators of seasonality of site occupation, and indicators of climatic change over time. VERTEBRATE FAUNAL ASSEMBLAGE (by Phillip R. Murry) The Adams Ranch faunal assemblage is dominated by whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and testudinid turtles, just like the faunal assemblages at most of the sites in the Richland Creek drainage. All of the mammalian species described in Chapter 9 were also identified in the Adams Ranch assemblage except the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus sp.). In addition to these species, squirrel (Sciurus sp.), wood rat (Neotoma floridiana), skunk (Mephitis mephitis), coyote (Canis latrans), and armadillo (Dasyphus sp.) were recovered at Adams Ranch. Gar (Lepisosteus sp.) and catfish (/ctaluras sp.) were the only species of fish that could be clearly identified, although other fish bones were noted. The reptilian species include all those identified at Bird Point Island except softshell turtle (Trionyx sp.), pine snake (Pituophis melenoleucus), and com snake (Elaphe sp.). Avian species identified include the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and the cardinal (Richmondena cardinalis); however, most bird bones recovered at Adams Ranch could not be identified to genus or species. The distribution of identifiable faunal remains within the zones defined for Feature 1 is presented in Table 18-11. Fauna identified from cultural features is presented in Table 18-12, with features 247 arranged by time period. The faunal content of the features mirrors the contents of the zones within Feature 1 in which they are located. For example, Zones 2d and 3 contained the greatest numbers of identifiable elements found within Feature 1 and the features present within these zones also contained a great number of identifiable elements. As a result, Tables 18-11 and 18-12 offer similar information that must be viewed together to understand changes in faunal utilization over time. The earliest occupation at Adams Ranch, A. D. 200 - 700, is denoted by Zone 3. Like the Late Archaic faunal assemblage at Bird Point Island, this assemblage also contains the greatest number of identifiable elements and the greatest faunal diversity associated with any occupation at Adams Ranch. The highest frequencies of reptilian and avian elements are associated with this period, and high frequencies of deer, cottontail rabbit and rodents are also present. Whitetail deer, testudinid turtle, and cottontail rabbit appear to have formed the principal sources of protein in the diet during the Late Archaic period. Prairie species are poorly represented during the Late Archaic period; no jackrabbit bones were identified and only two bison bones were found. This lack of prairie species during the Late Archaic period is identical to the pattern observed at Bird Point Island. The heavy utilization of cottontail rabbit suggests that rabbits were a common food source, but the lack of jackrabbit elements indicates that the Tall Grass Prairie was not within easily exploitable range of the site. The climate must have been moister during the Late Archaic period, promoting the growth of Bottomland Forest while keeping the prairie further to the west. The few bison bones probably represent occasional hunting trips out onto the prairie specifically to acquire large game. Seasonal bison exploitation has been observed among the Caddo Indians during the historic period (Swanton 1942) and was probably a common subsistance practice throughout much of prehistory. The density of features and artifacts within Feature 1 suggests that Late Archaic occupation was limited, and that the most intensive occupation occurred during the A. D. 800 - 1000 early Round Prairie occupation. However, the faunal assemblage is greatest for the Late Archaic occupation. This apparent discrepancy is probably due to the greater potential for bone preservation in the carbonate enriched soil of Zone 3. The carbonates create a neutral to slightly basic pH which promotes bone preservation. In addition, some rodent and reptilian remains may represent natural inclusions of burrowing animals subsequent to the filling of Zone 2. The early Round Prairie phase occupation, A. D. 800 - 1000, is represented by Zone 2. The faunal assemblage contains reptilian, rodent, and avian species, but is dominated by whitetail deer and testudinid turtle. Significantly, jackrabbit elements occur during this period while fewer cottontail rabbit elements are found. This suggests that a shift to a drier climate occurred which reduced the area encompassed by forest and moved the Tall Grass Prairie to within an exploitable range of the site. There is little evidence to draw on from the post-A.D. 1000 faunal assemblage with respect to the principal food species exploited or climatic changes that may have occurred. The refuse in Feature 6 is the primary source of identifiable faunal remains from this late period of occupation. The concentration is dominated by whitetail deer, but some turtle and bison bone is also present. Thus, Bottomland Forest, Post Oak Savannah, and Tall Grass Prairie species were all utilized after A.D. 1000, but the small sample size prevents a determination of the relative importance of each biotic zone from being made. It is assumed that deer and turtle continued to form the principal sources of protein. Faunal indicators of seasonality of occupation are limited to the post-A.D. 1000 period. Deer mandibles were recovered from Feature 6 and general Zone 1 fill which indicated an age at death of approximately 1 year 6 months. This age places the season of exploitation in the late fall or early winter, since deer give birth between May and June in this part of Texas (Schmidly 1983:296). One other indicator of fall exploitation of deer is a large antler attached to a frontal bone. Since deer shed their antlers between December and mid-February, the deer must have been taken prior

Unfortunately, this specimen was recovered from backhoe trench Unit 4 during the testing program, so its provenience is unclear and it cannot be assigned to a particular period of occupation. Table 18-13 lists the faunal remains identified by site areas. Although the sample is rather smaill, the emphasis on deer and turtle exploitation observed for all time periods is clearly expressed. More fish remains were identified from Areas A, D, and Other than were found within Feature 1, so fish may have played a more important part in the diet than indicated by Tables 18-11 and 18-12. The most striking aspect of the horizontal distribution of bone is that the area in between the activity areas, that is, the area labeled Other, contains the highest bone frequencies. This pattern would be expected around areas where activities were conducted on a regular basis and refuse was discarded away from the work areas. MOLLUSCAN ASSEMBLAGE (by Richard Fullington) Seven mussel species and four species of gastropods were identified at Adams Ranch. A sample was selected from the large molluscan assemblage which would encompass all of the occupation periods represented at the site. Units 48 and 49 in the center of the Feature 1 block excavation were selected for the purposes of this analysis, encompassing Zones 1, 2c, 2d, and 3. The results of this analysis are represented in Table 18-4. Like the vertebrate faunal assembage, the highest molluscan frequencies were observed in Zone 3, representing the A.D. 200 - 700 period. However, when volume is taken into account, a greater density of mussels and gastropods is associated with the A.D. 800 - 1000 occupation of Zone 2d which has a much smaller volume than Zone 3. Finally, frequencies for all species decreased dramaticaly during the post-A.D. 1000 period. The species composition remained unchanged over time and is identical to the bivalve fauna found in Richland Creek today. No conclusions may be formulated regarding environmental change because the mussel species are poor indicators of change and the gastropod sample is too small to be of use. Amblema plicata is a species which prefers pooled areas, whereas the other mussel species occupy riffle zones. Apparently, the aboriginal population exploited the shallow water species to a much greater extent than the deep water species. The season of procurement was probably summer to fall, when the creek was low and the mussels were easy to collect. However, mussels were

Species forming the principal sources of food value remained relatively constant throughout all periods of occupation, although use of other species fluctuated over time. Deer, turtle, hickory nuts, acoms, and Psoralea tubers were common during all periods, with a variety of other riverine and - savannah resources used to supplement the diet. During the Late Archaic occupation (A. D. 200 - 700), cottontail rabbit was a major food source in addition to the species previously mentioned. During the early Round Prairie phase, jackrabbit and cottontail rabbit were both exploited, indicating utilization of prairie species for the first time. This use of prairie species continued into the post-A.D. 1000 period, although savannah and forest species continued to provide the bulk of protein in the diet. The floral assemblage at Bird Point Island included a few more species than did the floral assemblage at Adams Ranch, but the Table 18-13 DISTRIBUTION OF IDENTIFIABLE FAUNAL ELEMENTS BY SITe AREAS AT ADAMS RANCH ee ee UU EEE EI EEREE AERA Eneennmnant Species A B Cc D Other Total ee Gar 3 5 8 Other Fish 2 3 5 Testudinid Turtle 3 4 4 3 14 Watersnake 1 1 Bird 2 1 3 Rodent 2 2 Cottontail/Swamp Rabbit 1 1 2 4 Jackrabbit 2 2 Raccoon 2 2 Dog 1 1 Whitetail Deer 1 5 4 3 13 Bison 3 2 5 Armadillo 1 1 2 4 Zone 3 Other Total 36 37 ~=—B6 12 101 3 5 1 2 3 N a Qo 2 1 13 3 3 1 5 7 1 1 1 8 2 7 3 1 2 3 1 3 1 1 2 #4 12 1 6 3 1 1 4 39 4 utilization of seeds was greater at Adams Ranch. At Bird Point Island, the spring ripening species, vetch, outnumbered the fall ripening species, sumpweed, whereas the reverse was true at Adams Ranch. Since the features containing most of the seeds belonged to the A.D. 800 - 1000 occupation, fall occupation must have been common at Adams Ranch during this period. The deer mandibles recovered from the post-A.D. 1000 layer of Feature i indicate that fall occupation continued to occur. Wild turkey was recovered from the A. D. 200 - 700 layer, so some degree of fall occupation apparently occurred during all periods. Likewise, spring plants such as vetch and Psoralea, were present in refuse from all periods, so some degree of spring occupation also occurred. Table 18-14 DISTRIBUTION OF MOLLUSCAN SPECIES!

wwe eae eS SE ere eee Eee TSS ~ see INTERPRETATION OF ACTIVITY AREAS by William A. Martin The goal of intrasite spatial analysis is to understand the different kinds of activities that occurred in different parts of the site. Systematically collected data from the magnetic survey and from the excavation of 50 x 50 cm units were used to create computer generated maps of magnetic anomalies and artifact concentrations. These maps were compared with each other and with similar maps from Bird Point Island, where habitation and work areas were clearly identified, in an effort to interpret the spatial patterns observed. These maps were also compared with the map of cultural features recorded after mechanical stripping of the A horizon to assess the relationships among magnetic anomalies, artifact clusters, and cultural features. Activity Areas A through D were defined on the basis of overlapping high density SYMAP clusters for various artifact classes. The patterns used to divide the site into these areas are discussed, the composition of each area is described, and conclusions concerning the activities conducted within each area are made. The area outside of Areas A through D, particularly the area over Feature 1, is also examined. Although three periods of occupation are defined for Adams Ranch, the majority of activity took place between A. D. 800 and 1000. There is undoubtedly some mixture of the three components in Areas A through D, but the distribution of ceramics and arrow points (see Chapter 18) suggest that most activity across the site occurred during the A. D, 800 - 1000 period. The discussion in this chapter is not presented by time period because this distinction is not possible outside of Feature 1. It is assumed that most of the activities indicated by the presence of artifact concentrations and features were conducted during the early Round Prairie phase occupation. Maps of artifacts recovered from the systematically excavated units were examined to identify patterns indicative of specialized activity areas, such as habitation, roasting, stone tool manufacture, etc. The SYMAP patterns used to divide the site into Areas A - D are discussed, and the composition of each area is described. 253 MAGNETIC DATA The magnetic survey procedures used at Bird Point Island were also used at Adams Ranch (see Chapter 10). During Season I, 1000 m2 were examined over and around Feature 1. Most magnetic anomalies were diffuse, suggesting the presence of a widespread activity area over Feature 1 rather than discrete features, However, a large symmetrical anomaly that appeared to represent a discrete feature (Anomaly 1) was identified just south of the 140 N 120 E stake. Excavation in this area uncovered an oval pit (Feature 5) near the center of the anomaly. The initial success of the magnetometer prompted additional magnetic survey prior to Season IV excavation. An additional 2400 m2 were surveyed adjacent to the Season I survey area, forming a total survey area of 3500 m2. Using the criteria discussed in Chapter 10, the remote sensing consultant designated 35 magnetic anomalies as possible cultural features (Figure 19-1). Most magnetic anomalies fall within the range of 50 - 75 gammias, but a few (Anomalies 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, and 34) exhibit intense highs of more than 75 gammas. The largest and most intense anomaly covers nearly 100 m2 and is characterized by N-S polarization with a high greater than 75 gammas to the south and a low of 5 - 10 gammas to the north. This anomaly is caused by recent iron trash accumulation which, unfortunately, obscures any readings resulting from cultural features that may have been located in this area. Most anomalies greater than 75 gammas were located in Area D on the north half of the site. Trenches of contiguous 1x 1m units were excavated across the centers of these anomalies with the expectation that roasting pits similar to those found at Bird Point Island would be found. However, none of these anomalies were caused by features which penetrated the B horizon. This pattern was puzzling because it was quite the opposite of the pattern observed at Bird Point Island. Crew members did not notice high

As stated in Chapter 16, Feature 104 contained 3 to 15 times the quantity of fire cracked rock found in other 1 x 1m trenches excavated at the site. This extremely high density of rock was confined to the A horizon, so Feature 104 was noted as an A horizon roasting area as opposed to a roasting pit. Once the SYMAPs of artifact distributions were completed, some of the remaining enigmatic anomalies were also recognized as A horizon roasting areas. The fire cracked rock SYMAP exhibited moderately high clusters in several areas encompassed by the anomalies. The fragments of fire cracked rock in these areas were so small, and their increase in frequency was so slight, that crew members could not recognize them as features. This situation illustrates the fact the magnetometer can successfully locate cultural features that cannot be seen by the archaeologist. In retrospect, Anomaly 1 over Feature 5, investigated during Season I, was too large to have been caused by Feature 5 alone. The SYMAP of this area shows that a cluster of fire cracked rock was present, so Anomaly 1 may have been an A horizon roasting area, with Feature 5 representing the bottom of a large shallow roasting pit that was primarily confined to the A horizon. The distribution of magnetic anomalies was compared with the map of cultural features to detect possible hearths and roasting features. It has been demonstrated that the principal source of magnetism in features detected by the magnetometer is fire an a ae a a. 6a oe oe Yl ee ae ee el. oe ae eT

Roasting cracked rock, and that fire cracked rock content is high in hearths and roasting pits (see Chapter 10). Therefore, features which correspond with magnetic anomalies can be confidently assigned to one of these classes. Table 19-1 lists the fearures that correspond with magnetic anomalies and their probable functions. The correspondence of the distributions of magnetic anomalies, fire cracked rock clusters, and features is illustrated in Figure 19-2. The generalized magnetic high observed over portions of Feature 1 is also visible in this figure. ARTIFACTS FROM SYSTEMATIC EXCAVATIONS SYMAP DESCRIPTIONS Analysis of the Bird Point Island data indicated that the spatial patterns which were identified using 1.67 m spacing between 50 x 50 cm units could also be recognized using larger intervals. At Adams Ranch, units were excavated at 4 m intervals which provided enough information to recognize important artifact patterning at a greatly reduced cost in time and labor. Systematic units were excavated in a single level down to the interface of the A and B horizons (20 - 30 cm), except along the southern edge of the site where the B horizon was buried by alluvium and colluvium. Units in this area were excavated to a depth of 30 cm. The artifact data were transferred to the mainframe computer at SMU and were processed with the SYMAP program to provide maps of the spatial distributions of lithic debris, bifaces, unifaces, projectile points, ceramics, fire cracked rock, baked clay, bone, shell, and charcoal. Although ail of these maps were carefully examined, only those most important for identifying activity areas are illustrated here. At Bird Point Island, the lithic debris SYMAP generated during Season II from units spaced at 5 m intervals exhibited large clusters which covered Houses 1 - 3 and the roasting pits located near those structures. The lithic debris SYMAP from Adams Ranch was examined for similar clusters, but only one cluster of the correct dimensions was observed. This cluster was observed in the northwest portion of the excavation area (Figure 19-3). The lithic debris map was dominated by a large cluster which was concentrated along the northern, eastern, and southern edges of Feature 1 nearly encircling the depression. The densest clusters of lithic debris indicate that stone tool manufacturing occurred in the northwest cluster and around Feature 1, especially within the high density cluster immediately adjacent to the pit on the southwest. The SYMAP of fire cracked rock (Figure 19-4) shows a large moderate to high density cluster surrounding Feature 1 and occurring partially within the feature. Fire cracked rock appears to be absent inside the depression. However, from the , magnetometer data, it is clear that the absence of fire cracked rock 255 in the center of Feature 1 is due to sampling error. The portion of Feature 1 which had been removed during Season | ecavations (Units 44-49) was recorded as a block of missing data during the Season IV systematic excavations. The missing data caused the SYMAP program to produce a map showing the central portion of Feature 1 as an area with a low density of fire cracked rock. The distribution of fire cracked rock within 50 x 50 cm units in the remainder of the depression demonstrates that cooking and roasting activities were concentrated around and within Feature 1. Since the 50 x 50 cm units only encompassed the upper 30 cm of Feature I, roasting activity must have been conducted in the pit during the post-A. D. 1000 period. This fact was not discernible from excavation through the center of Feature 1 because Season I fire cracked rock data were missing. Although the fire cracked rock outside Feature 1 could have been deposited during any of the occupations at Adams Ranch, the high density of fire cracked rock observed in Zones 2b and 2c (see Chapter 17) suggest that much of it was deposited between A. D. 800 and 1000. The SYMAP for charcoal is of little value for interpreting prehistoric activities at Adams Ranch because it shows one large cluster within a recent tree-burn area, but little else. Baked clay is also high in the area, but small clusters on the other parts of the site coincide with fire cracked rock, suggesting that hearths were located in those areas. Although the bone and mussel shell data are not influenced by recent cultural activity, their distributions were not very informative because each map had only a few small clusters. These clusters encompassed only one or two units each, reflecting the virtual absence of bone and shell in the A horizon due to the poor preservational qualtities of the acidic soil. Bifaces, unifaces, projectile points, and ceramics are low density artifact classes, so the SYMAPs obtained for these classes lack the large scale clusters observed for high frequency classes such as lithic debris and fire cracked rock. Maps of low density artifact classes have a patchy quality characterized by small clusters scattered across the site. The only way to understand activity patterning for these classes is to plot the clusters from each SYMAP onto overlays and examine their co-occurrence. Areas A through D were defined using this technique. AREAS A THROUGH D The moderate to high density clusters observed on all SYMAPs were plotted onto overlays so that co-associations could be examined and compared with patterns observed over the houses and roasting pits at Bird Point Island (Figure 19-5). At Bird Point Island, Houses | - 3 were marked by large clusters of lithic debris which encompassed small clusters of ceramics, projectile points, bifaces, and fire cracked rock. The variety of artifacts found together in these areas reflects the broad variety of activities associated with household maintenance (i.e., cooking, tool manufacture, storage, etc.). The areas over Bird Point Island roasting pits were visible as large high density clusters of fire cracked rock which encompassed smaller clusters of baked clay, projectile points, and bifaces. At Adams Ranch, three discrete areas of overlapping artifact concentrations were observed within the south half of the site near Feature 1. These areas were labeled A, B, and C and were intensively investigated to search for possible roasting and habitation areas (Figure 19-5). Area D on the north half of the site was characterized by the co-ocurrence of small clusters of fire cracked rock, baked clay, and ceramics indicative of numerous hearths and A horizon roasting areas. Area D also contained a large lithic debris cluster similar to clusters observed over structures at Bird Point Island. Other artifact classes were also concentrated within this cluster. It was carefully investigated for signs of a structure, but no post hole pattern was observed in the B horizon once the A horizon had been scraped away. Spatial data from SYMAPs, in conjunction with the spatial distribution of features, can be used to understand the activities conducted in Areas A through D. In Area A, a large high density fire cracked ore

Within the high density cluster, other clusters of ceramics, projectile points, bifaces, lithic debris, unifaces, and baked clay occur together (Figure 19-5). This pattern is typical of the assemblage found in association with all large roasting pits at Bird Point Island and within Feature 51 at Adams Ranch. No clusters of artifacts associated with stone tool manufacture or other activities occurred within Area A. Therefore, Area A appears to have been used primarily for food processing, especially for roasting. In Area B, only clusters of lithic debris, projectile points, ceramics, and bifaces are found (Figure 19-5). All other artifact classes exhibit very low densities, Since the concentration of lithic debris in Area B is higher than in any other area of the site, it was undoubtedly used frequently for stone tool manufacture. The features within Area B indicate that other activities were associated with this area, even though the lithic reduction function is the only one clearly discernible on the basis of the SYMAPs. For example, large pits (Features 101 and 102) contain fire cracked rock and food items associated with roasting. In addition, Feature 102 contained two human burials. Apparently, economic uses including lithic reduction and food preparation, were conducted in Area B, but mortuary activity also occurred, In Area C, small localized high density clusters of fire cracked rock, lithic debris, and projectile points occurred. Also, this is the only area of the site outside of Feature 1 which contained a small 257 NORTH 100 120 EAST FRAGMENTS OF FIRE CRACKED ROCK [| 0-5.55 §,56-16.65 ed 44.41-77.7 16.66-44.40 77,.7-111.00 Figure 19-4.

The lack of largé clusters and the broad variety of small clusters suggests that several different activities were conducted in Area C. The variety of cultural materials suggests that Area C may have been the location of a habitation. A hearth (Feature 72) was found when the area was scraped, but no post hole pattern was observed (Figure 19-5). Any structure that may have been present must have been less substantial than structures found at Bird Point Island. Area D contained small fire cracked rock concentrations which coincided with baked clay and with magnetic highs. These are believed to represent A horizon roasting areas. The high density lithic debris cluster in the northwest portion of the site coincided with a moderate density cluster of fire cracked rock, and high density clusters of bifaces and unifaces (Figure 19-5). This pattern is characteristic of a habitation area, but again, no post holes were observed. Hearths and numerous pits with unknown functions were found throughout Area D, which suggests that domestic activities were conducted on the northern half of the site. However, it is impossible to determine the precise location of the habitations. CONCLUSION The use of magnetic data in conjunction with the spatial distributions of artifacts and features is an invaluable aid for the

wo Activity Areas interpretation of site utilization. The relationship between magnetic enhancement of site areas and the site's distribution of fire cracked rock is virtually one to one for sites in the Richland Creek drainage. Maps of magnetic anomalies and fire cracked rock distributions at Adams Ranch do not appear to correlate on a one to one level, but this is because of differences in sampling strategies. Since the magnetic data were collected at 1 m intervals, as opposed to the 4 m intervals used to collect artifacts, the magnetometer recorded more hearths and roasting areas than did the SYMAPs plotted from systematic excavation data. Some features that could not be classified on the basis of content alone were classified as hearths because they exhibited magnetic anomalies with the same symmetry and polarity observed for hearths at Bird Point Island. Thus, the magnetometer provided insights into the function of features that otherwise would have remained uninterpretable if traditional approaches toward feature classification had been the only methods used. 259 Activity areas can be defined by examining the co-occurrence of artifact clusters generated by the SYMAP program, and comparing the assemblages from these clusters with those from proveniences where function has been determined. The dis- tribution of features of known function within an area of overlapping clusters can then be compared with the artifact data to formulate conclusions about the utilization of the area. Although it is rarely possible to identify all of the specific activities that occurred across a site, this method serves as a useful starting point for the investigation of community patterning. Using this approach, four subareas of the site were defined (Areas A-D). Area A appears to have been primarily a food roasting area, whereas Area B seems to have been a stone tool manufacturing area at one time, and a burial area at some other point in time. | Areas C and D contained a wide variety of tool clusters and features and probably represent areas where house structures and attendant domestic activities were concentrated.

PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT AT ADAMS RANCH William A. Martin This chapter provides a synthesis of all the Adams Ranch data presented in earlier chapters. It is modeled after the discussion of the Bird Point Island occupational sequence. Five problem areas were addressed at Bird Point Island: (1) architectural features, (2) intrasite activities, (3) subsistence behavior, (4) group size, and (5) duration of occupation. Some of the problem areas addressed in the Bird Point Island discussion do not apply at Adams Ranch. For instance, even though post holes were found at Adams Ranch which are undoubtedly related to structures, these structures were not substantial and no house patterns were defined, As a result, assessments of architecture and estimates of group size cannot be made. On the other hand, sufficient data were recovered to address problem areas related to the study of intrasite functional variability, subsistence behavior, and duration of occupation. The first section is a brief summary of the chronological data (radiocarbon dates, projectile point types, and ceramic types) presented in detail in Chapters 17 and 18. First, the evidence for three major occupation periods is presented, then each of the problem areas outlined for Bird Point Island in Chapter 14 are addressed when applicable. The primary focus concerns the community patterning associated with the early Round Prairie phase occupation, since most of the data are related to this occupation. The spatial distribution of artifacts and features across the site is used to summarize the Round Prairie phase community. Finally, the subsistence strategies for each period are outlined and paleoenvironmental implications are discussed, CHRONOLOGY Three major periods of site occupation were identified on the basis of radiocarbon dates and the distribution of projectile point and ceramic types within Feature 1. The earliest occupation was a Late Archaic period occupation placed at A. D. 200 - 700 on the basis of two radiocarbon dates from the bottom layer (Zone 3) of Feature 1. This layer was nearly devoid of arrow points, which are by diagnostic artifacts of the Late Prehistoric period, further supporting for the Late Archaic placement for the origin of Feature 1. In addition, a distinctive shell tempered ceramic tradition was limited to this bottom layer and to pits intrusive from into this layer from the subsequent layer (Zone 2). This type of pottery has also been found in Late Archaic contexts at other sites along Richland Creek, and is characteristic of the Transitional/Late Archaic phase (see Chapter 15 Volume III). The next period of occupation, between A. D. 800 and A. D. 1000, represents the most intensive occupation of the site. This early Round Prairie phase occupation was responsible for the deposition of most of the artifacts and creation of most of the features found at Adams Ranch. The temporal frame for this occupation is provided by three radiocarbon dates from the middle layer of Feature 1 (Zone 2). One date is around A. D. 800, whereas two of these dates are close to A. D. 1000. The projectile point types and ceramic types associated with the middle layer of pit fill are identical to those associated with the Round Prairie phase occupation at Bird Point Island. Arrow points include Alba, Scaliorn, Steiner, and several untyped varieties. Gary, regular variety and Gary, serrated blade dart points are associated with this phase. The ceramic tradition is comprised of grog/grit/bone tempered utility wares; this tradition completely replaced the shell tempered tradition of the earlier period.. The final period of occupation began sometime after A. D. 1000 and persisted for an indeterminate length of time. No radiocarbon dates were obtained from the upper layer of Feature 1 (Zone 1). The post-A. D. 1000 estimate is based on the fact that the upper layer of the pit was deposited on top of the layer with terminal dates of A. D. 1000. The projectile points found in Zone 1 link the final period of occupation to the St. Elmo phase. Perdiz points, which are a late type, were found within Zone 1, but are absent from lower zones. Perdiz points were also found in Area D along with a Fresno point, another late type. The scarcity of late point types and ceramics related to the St. Elmo phase indicates that occupation was sporadic during this period, 261

262 OCCUPATION I: THE LATE ARCHAIC PERIOD (A.D. 200 TO 700) Few conclusions can be drawn for the Late Archaic group with respect to the five problem areas outlined in Chapter 14. No evidence of structures was found in association with the Late Archaic layer of Feature 1; all post holes found within this feature were associated with later occupations. Intrasite activities cannot be defined because few of the artifacts or features can be positively associated with the first occupants of the site. The scarcity of Late Archaic point types suggests that other Late Archaic artifacts were also scarce, judging from ratios of lithic debris to projectile points observed in the context of House 1 at Bird Point Island. Therefore, short term occupations probably occurred during the temporal span of A. D, 200 - 700. SUBSISTENCE The Late Archaic subsistence strategy is inferred from the plant and animal remains recovered from the bottom layer of Feature 1. A hunting/gathering subsistence strategy is indicated, with a heavy reliance on deer, turtle, birds, and cottontail rabbit as well as hickory nuts, Psoralea tubers, and seeds. The wide variety of fauna associated with the Late Archaic period is far greater than from subsequent periods. This is due in part to the better potential for bone preservation in Zone 3. However, the number of bird, cottontail rabbit, and snake elements are much higher in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which contained a relatively well preserved assemblage, so a shift in the selection of animal species is suggested following the Late Archaic period. The Late Archaic population appears to have followed a diffuse economic strategy involving the selection of a broad variety of species (Cleland 1976). DURATION OF OCCUPATION It is impossible to provide estimates of group size for the Late Archaic population because of the low quantities of artifacts and features associated with this period. Obviously, considerable labor was expended to excavate Feature 1, so at some point a number of individuals occupied the site. However, the low incidence of artifacts and burials in the lower layer of Feature 1 indicates that such occupation was short term, perhaps representing the seasonal gathering of bands for ritual and mortuary purposes. The presence of charcoal dating from A. D. 200 + 100 and a burial dating from A. D. 640 + 70 indicates that short term Late Archaic occupations occurred over a long duration of time, approximately 500 years. OCCUPATION II: EARLY ROUND PRAIRIE PHASE (A.D. 800 TO 1000) The densest concentrations of artifacts and features within Feature 1 were found in Zone 2, the layer dating from A. D. 800 to A. D. 1000. Also, the distribution of arrow points and ceramics across the rest of the site suggests that the most intensive occupation occurred during this period. Therefore, the features observed outside of Feature 1 are assumed to be related to this period of occupation. Data from features and the spatial distribution of artifacts provide sufficient information to address several of the problem areas in detail. ARCHITECTURE Post holes were found within Zones 2a and 2d of Feature 1, but they appear to be intrusive from the post-A. D. 1000 occupation. Volume II, Part Two Very few post holes were observed outside of Feature 1 within the scraped areas. Those that were recorded were isolated posts, so no pattern indicative of structure shape or size was observed. These posts occur close to hearths and probably represent supports for less substantial structures than were present at Bird Point Island during the Round Prairie phase. However, no conclusions can be reached regarding the nature of these hypothesized structures due to the lack of visible remains. INTRASITE ACTIVITIES The distribution of features with known functions, the distribution of magnetic anomalies, and the co-associaton of artifact classes across the site permit the recognition of activity areas for the early Round Prairie phase. The evidence indicates that Area A, west of Feature 1, was used primarily for roasting and food processing activities. Area A encompasses roasting pit Feature 51 which contained high densities of fire cracked rock, baked clay, bifaces, steeply chipped unifaces, and dart points. The A horizon over and around this roasting pit also contained these items. The co-association of these artifact classes is characteristic of the roasting pit assemblages recorded at Bird Point Island. Fire cracked rock was observed on the surface of the B horizon throughout the eastern portion of Area A, which surrounded Feature 51 and the smaller hearths or roasting pits in close proximity to this feature. The assignment of Feature 51 to the early Round Prairie phase is supported by the presence of grog/grit/bone tempered ceramics in levels 1 - 6. A single shell tempered sherd was recovered from level 8, which indicates that initial use of the feature may have occurred during the Late Archaic period. However, the bulk of activity within the pit appears to have occurred between A. D. 800 and1000. Area B appears to have been used for several functions. It contained the largest, densest cluster of lithic debris found at the site (see Chapter 19). This indicates that it was a locus of lithic reduction, even though aborted bifaces are missing from the assemblage. The presence of ceramics and two large features (Feature 101 and Feature 102) containing fire cracked rock indicates that other activities related to roasting were also conducted in Area B. Finally, the presence of two human burials within Feature 102 (B4 and B5) demonstrates that mortuary activity also occurred in Area B. Area C is another multiple use area which may have been the location of a habitation, judging from the co-occurrence of artifacts and the presence of a hearth (Feature 72). Small clusters of lithic debris, projectile points, fire cracked rock, and mussel shell occur together in Area C, which suggests that stone tool manufacture, cooking, and other maintenence activities associated with habitation were conducted in this area. However, no post holes were observed, so no firm conclusions about the presence of a structure can be drawn. Area D contained a lithic debris cluster similar in size to clusters observed over Houses 1 - 3 at Bird Point Island. This cluster is situated on the highest, flattest portion of the site, which is an ideal topographic setting for a habitation. Clusters of bifaces, unifaces, and fire cracked rock occur within the lithic debris cluster which was also characteristic of the dwellings found at Bird Point Island. Hearths which were recorded as magnetic anomalies were found when the area was mechanically scraped, but no post holes were found in this vicinity, so the presence of a habitation cannot be demonstrated. It is clear from the number of features and the quantity of debris associated with the early Round Prairie phase that substantial long term occupation occurred. The lack of house patterns indicates that the structures used during this period were fess substantial than those used later on in the Round Prairie phase at Bird Point Island. Area D contained several A horizon roasting areas in addition to the possible habitation. These areas registered as magnetic highs and as high density fire cracked rock clusters on SYMAPs, but they had no manifestation in the B horizon.

SAaResae RFaORERAG EB ORGSM RMA BS QRS SPRARHKAERE ARN TAS BARE KE SWORN Prehistoric Settlement represent the initial development of large roasting pits like Feature 51, or they may represent a different kind of processing which was conducted simultaneously with roasting in Feature 51 or at some other point in time as a substitute for large roasting pits. Although the projectile points and ceramics indicate substantial use of Area D during the early Round Prairie phase, the presence of Perdiz and Fresno points indicates that St. Elmo phase occupation was also concentrated in this area. No radiocarbon dates or clear artifact associations exist, but it is possible that the A horizon roasting areas are related to St. Elmo phase occupation. This idea is speculative, but it follows the pattern observed throughout the Project area that roasting pits get smaller through time. SUBSISTENCE The principal faunal species exploited during the early Round Prairie phase were whitetail deer and testudinid turtle. The major plant foods were hickory nuts, pecans, acorns, Psoralea tubers, and seeds. A diffuse hunting/gathering economy persisted, but the selection of species used to supplement the diet changed. Far fewer cottontail rabbit, bird, and snake elements were recovered from Zone 2 of Feature 1 than from the Late Archaic Zone 3. Instead, a higher density-of mussel and plant species, especially vetch and sumpweed seeds, was utilized. Also, prairie species such as jackrabbit, began to be exploited. Floral and faunal data suggest that the site was occupied during both the spring and the fall. The principal plant foods in the assemblage are complementary from the standpoint of harvesting; spring species, such as vetch and Psoralea sp., and fall species, like nuts and acoms, are present together in the assemblage. Turtle and mussel would have been exploited in the summer or fall, when the creeks were low. Deer could have been taken at any time during the year, since no clear indicators of seasonality were found; however, they were probably taken in the fall when deer congregate in areas with high mast yields. DURATION OF OCCUPATION The food species represented in the early Round Prairie phase assemblage could have supported a year round occupation, as they did at Bird Point Island. However, the lack of substantial structures at Adams Ranch suggests that shorter seasonal occupations occurred. Numerous separate occupations would have been required to result in the creation of so many features and the deposition of so many artifacts. At Bird Point Island, where even more debris was found, the Round Prairie phase occupation was estimated at 20 years. However, the hamlet at Bird Point Island was probably occupied on a year round basis, so its length of occupation is not directly comparable to the intermittent Round Prairie phase occupations at Adams Ranch. It seems likely that the deposit at Adams Ranch was formed over a greater length of time, with numerous short term occupations creating the observed deposit. The range of the radiocarbon dates from the lower to the upper portions of the Zone 2 deposit indicate that occupations occurred over a 200 year time span. OCCUPATION IN: ST. ELMO PHASE (POST-A.D. 1000) As with the Late Archaic occupation, very little can be stated about the nature of the St. Elmo phase occupation. The post holes observed in the outer pit (Zone 2a) of Feature 1 appear to have originated in the upper layer (Zone 1) which is attributed to this later occupation. However, no clear post hole pattern was observed that would indicate the dimensions of a structure, so little can be concluded about the nature of the architecture. These posts 263 probably represent drying racks or structures for other activities conducted within the pit, rather than the remains of dwellings. Presumably, some form of dwellings was used during the final occupation, but it must have been as insubstantial as those of previous occupations. SUBSISTENCE From the limited food remains clearly associated with the St. Elmo phase occupation, it is clear that whitetail deer was the most important source of protein, and that use of bison increased slightly. Hickory nuts, pecans, acorns, and Psoralea tubers continued to provide the bulk of the plant species in the diet, and the use of seeds declined. Unlike most other St. Elmo phase occupations in the Richland Creek area (Bird Point Island and the Little Cedar Creek site) which contained small quantities of maize, no evidence of maize horticulture was observed at Adams Ranch. This may indicate that Adams Ranch was occupied during the early St. Elmo phase, prior to the introduction of maize into the diet. DURATION OF OCCUPATION The low quantity of St. Elmo phase artifacts observed at the site suggests that occupation after A. D. 1000 was very limited and sporadic. There are no clear indicators of a terminal date for this occupation, since no radiocarbon dates and few distinctive projectile point or ceramic types were obtained. CONCLUSIONS The data recovered from Adams Ranch indicate that three major periods of occupation occurred at the site. These occupations fall within periods defined at Bird Point Island, but the two sites appear to have been used sequentially, rather than simultaneously. For instance, the lack of shell tempered ceramics coupled with the early radiocarbon dates for Zone 3 of Feature 1 at Bird Point Island indicate that it was in use sometime prior to the introduction of the shell tempered ceramics which were found in Zone 3 at Adams Ranch. Likewise, the Round Prairie phase occupation at Bird Point Island appears to have begun shortly after the major occupation at Adams Ranch ended. Finally, the greater quantity of St. Elmo phase artifacts and the discovery of maize at Bird Point Island indicate that a longer, more intensive St. Elmo phase occupation occurred there. Data from both sites indicate a shift in climate after A. D. 700, since prairie species such as jackrabbit are missing from Zone 3 and are found in Zone 2 at both sites. This indicates a drier period in which the Bottomland Forest receded and the Tall Grass Prairie advanced to within exploitable distance of Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch. The introduction of maize after A. D. 1300 at Bird Point Island and the Little Cedar Creek site suggests a response to a more dramatic shift in climate, but this was not observed at Adams Ranch. Apparently, occupation of the site was minimal during this late period. The sequence of occupation at Adams Ranch may be summarized as follows. At some point around A. D, 200, Feature 1 was excavated and used for economic and mortuary activities. Roasting and food preparation were conducted within the feature. Since the amount of labor required to excavate the feature would have required a large group of individuals, it is likely that several bands came together to excavate the pit and that ritual feasting ensued. This concept is discussed further in Part Three of this volume. Around A. D. 800, the outer pit (Zone 2a) was excavated, which enlarged the dimensions of Feature 1. Intensive short term occupations. occurred from spring to fall for the next 200 years, as

264 evidenced by the numerous features, artifacts, and floral and faunal remains found in Zone 2 of Feature 1. In addition, other features outside of Feature 1 appear to have been created during this period. Roasting, stone tool manufacture, cooking, and other Volume II, Part Two tasks associated with daily camp maintenance took place. Finally, after A. D. 1000, sporadic occupations of the site occurred, but no significant long term use of the site was made.

THE WYLIE FOCUS: CULTURAL REALITY OR ARCHAEOLOGICAL MYTH? by James E. Bruseth and William A. Martin The Wylie focus of North Central Texas has been a problem- atical concept since its formulation in 1952. It was originally defined to describe a group of Late Prehistoric sites within the Tall Grass Prairie along the East Fork of the Trinity River near Dallas which contained large, man-made depressions (Figure 21-1), These enigmatic depressions lacked easily explainable contents and form. Despite excavations inside the pits at several sites, some of which were extensive (Stephenson 1952a; Lynott 1975), the function of these features has never been completely understood. Several pit functions were proposed, but these hypotheses needed to be tested (Lynott 1975). With the discovery of similar depressions at the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch sites along Richland Creek, expectations were raised. that the hypothesized uses could be tested and new insights into the function of these features would be provided. Chapters 6 and 17 provide detailed analyses of these pits and provide descriptive data pertaining to feature use. Chapter 21 provides an evaluative discussion of the Wylie focus as a culture- historical construct and examines the function of the large depressions at sites along Richland Creek and the East Fork of the Trinity River. Specifically the first section of the chapter provides a summary of the sites that comprise the Wylie focus along the East Fork. The Richland Creek work is summarized in the next section and is used as a comparative data base for comparison with the East Fork sites. The overall concept of the Wylie focus is evaluated in the next portion of the chapter, and the usefulness of the Wylie focus concept as a culture-historical construct is discussed. Since its original definition more than three decades ago, the term has gained increasing popularity and has become entrenched in the literature, despite valid criticism that it does not have distinctive cultural and temporal meaning (cf., Ross 1966:18; Sorrow 1966:61; Story 1965:253; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968:75-77). Consequently, this chapter is a forum for critical evaluation of the Wylie focus as a culture-historical concept. The final section of this chapter addresses the issue of function of the large depressions. Previous hypotheses are examined and a new hypothesis, based in part on the hypothesis advanced by Lynott (1977), is presented and discussed. WYLIE FOCUS: DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT Although the Wylie focus was defined as a constellation of traits, the single best identifying characteristic is the presence of large, man-made depressions measuring 16 m or more in diameter and between 2 m and 4 m in depth. These features were first identified at several sites along the East Fork by members of the Dallas Archeological Society, who noted that the pits were once substantially deeper and that recent plowing had caused soil to fill the depressions (Wilson 1946). During the 1930s and 1940s, members of the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) worked on several other sites along the East Fork; many had large depressions, but others without depressions were otherwise similar to the pit sites (Housewright and Wilson 1942; Harris 1942; Hatzenbuehler 1942a; Harris and Hatzenbuehler 1948). Although the Wylie focus was not formally defined until the 1950s, this early work by the DAS was instrumental in providing the background for professional excavations that led to the definition of the focus. After survey of the proposed Lavon Reservoir (Stephenson 1949a), excavations were conducted at three sites: Hogge Bridge, Campbell Hole, and Branch. Only the Hogge Bridge site was ever reported in detail, and this site became the type locality for definition of the Wylie focus (Stephenson 1952b). Building upon the work of the DAS, Stephenson used the Midwestern Taxonomic System (McKern 1939) to propose the Wylie focus as a culture- historical construct incorporating sites situated along an 80 km stretch of the East Fork. Six characteristics were defined that, taken as a whole, distinguished the Wylie focus from other known foci: 267

268 (1) Each site (with three possible exceptions) contains a single large circular pit with a built up rim. (2) Pottery, while fairly abundant, seems to be all trade material and no indigenous types appear to be present. (3) The burials are alli flexed. (4) No complex of burial furniture occurs. (5) Burials are both single and multiple interments in poorly defined burial pits. (6) Artifacts of all types are consistently similar throughout all components, and are reasonably distinctive, in total assemblage, from those of other foci of nearby areas, through some individual types are similar to those found in known foci. (Stephenson 1952a:305). The large depression at the Hogge Bridge site was the target of Stephenson's field work, and after extensive excavations he found the pit to be ". . . 90 feet in diameter, circular in shape, with excavation spoil from the interior thrown up around the edges in a rim 8 to.10 feet high" (Stephenson 1952a:307). Although the function of the pit eluded Stephenson, several proposed uses were suggested, including water storage, defensive breastworks, dance arenas, gaming areas, and open-air council chambers. In the 1960s, combined professional and amateur investigations were conducted along a section of the East Fork that was scheduled to be inundated by Forney Reservoir (now Lake Ray Hubbard; Harris and Suhm 1963). The excavation phase of the field work concentrated on three Wylie focus sites: Glen Hill, Upper Rockwall, and Lower Rockwall. The work at these sites was important in establishing doubts about the validity of the Wylie focus as a culture-historical construct, since both Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials were found together (Ross 1966:18, 43; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968:75-77). These workers argued that the focus, as defined by Stephenson, spanned too much time, and moreover, there was no clear evidence that the Wylie focus people had even built the pits. At the Upper Rockwall and Lower Rockwall sites, work was also conducted inside the large depressions, but the function of these features was not determined. The most useful data were reported by Ross (1966), who excavated the pit at the Upper Rockwall site by stratigraphic layers and related artifact frequencies to each layer. This information showed that the lowest layer of the pit was largely devoid of artifacts and that the original use of the pit had failed to produce an appreciable accumulation of artifacts (Ross 1966:18). The next professional archaeological work along the East Fork occurred at Lake Lavon, where an enlargement of the existing reservoir was anticipated. Test excavations were conducted at several Archaic and Wylie focus sites including the McGuire and Dugger sites (Dawson and Sullivan 1973). The most notable work was conducted at the Sister Grove Creek site (Lynott 1975). Extensive excavations were undertaken inside a large depression as well as in midden deposits around this feature. This work _ represents one of the more in-depth investigations conducted at a Wylie focus site, and the results of the excavations determined directions for future work by developing new questions to be addressed (Lynott 1975:117). Specifically, the work in the large depression eliminated several of the hypothesized uses, and indicated that ritual feasting and human burial were the most likely uses of the pit (Lynott 1975:117). Lynott was able to obtain several radiocarbon dates from inside and around the pit which provided the first adequate chronology for the focus; the dates spanned the period from A. D. 950 to A. D. 1590, With the completion of the Lake Lavon enlargment, the remaining components of the Wylie focus known to contain large pits were inundated and lost to archaeological investigation. Reports of additional sites with large depressions exist (D. Granberry, personal communication 1982), but the existence of depressions at these sites has yet to be verified. It is possible, however, that other large pit sites exist along other parts of the East Fork or its tributaries. Certainly the occurrence of two such sites along Richland Creek supports this speculation and suggests Volume II, Part Three that other tributaries of the Trinity River, or the Trinity itself, should be closely examined. EAST FORK SITES It is difficult to determine the exact number of sites along the East Fork of the Trinity River that belong to the Wylie focus. Many of the sites found in the area were located by members of the DAS. Some sites have been reported in issues of the Society's journal, The Record; while others are recorded only by personal collections and are otherwise unstudied. Compounding this problem, the traits devised by Stephenson (1952a) to define the focus are indistinct enough to include virtually any Late Prehistoric site in North Texas. Aside from the presence of a large depression, which Stephenson (1952a:305) admits does not have to be present, few characteristics remain to distinguish a Wylie focus site from sites of other periods. Rather than attempting to inventory and describe all known Wylie focus sites in the upper Trinity River basin, the sites discussed in this chapter include only the East Fork sites which have published data from field excavations. This represents a sample of 11 sites (Figure 21-1), all of which are discussed in alphabetical order. The amount of published data varies considerably from site to site, ranging from the reporting of only a few features at some to complete monographs on others. This variability in reporting creates problems for comparison of the sites. For instance, the absence of an elevated rim around a large depression cannot be inferred simply because no mention of such a characteristic is made in a given report. The rim may have existed, but may not have been reported. Despite these problems, the East Fork sites provide a useful collective data base with which to examine the Wylie focus and to compare with the Richland Creek sites. The Branch site, located on a terrace of the East Fork, was excavated by Stephenson in 1951. Unfortunately, the results of this work have never been written up. In 1959, the DAS conducted test excavations at the site and subsequently published their results in The Record (Dallas Archeological Society 1965). Based on this information, the site can be described as small, occupying an area of slightly more than one ha in area. Wave action from Lake Lavon had caused considerable damage to the site at the time of investigation, and the remaining deposit consisted of a thin layer of black clay soil over a sterile clay subsoil. The remains of Stephenson's excavations were still visible and consisted of two long trenches, one through the large depression and another through nearby midden deposits. The DAS excavations were conducted outside of the large pit and recovered a wide variety of artifacts; these artifacts are listed in Table 21-1. Occupation during both the Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods can be inferred. A few features were encountered, including a hearth and a small pit, but no evidence of structures was encountered. The Butler Hole site, located south of the Branch site along the East Fork, is an important Wylie focus component in that a house pattern was uncovered. This pattern was elliptical in shape and measured 3 x 4.1 m (Housewright et al. 1947:9). The "floor" of the house was observed 46 cm below the surface, and although not described as such, it may actually have been the contact with the underlying B horizon rather than a floor. Numerous pieces of burned, shell tempered daub were found over and around the structure, suggesting that the house had burned. Although some artifacts were recovered inside the house, many came from midden deposits around the house. Ceramics, stone and bone tools, and ground stone objects are reported from the site. No large depression was located. Limited testing was conducted by Stephenson (1949a) at the Campbell Hole site, located in the floodplain immediately adjacent to the present channel of the East Fork. The site covers less than one ha and has been covered by 30 cm of recent alluvium. It was discovered where the present river channel cut into the site,

A large burned feature was encountered in the wail of the creek bank and was presumed to be a prepared floor associated with a circular house measuring 3.6 m in diameter. The floor of the house was identified by a horizontal layer of burned daub, which curved sharply upwards along the walls of the house. No post holes were encountered and no further work was conducted at the site. The artifacts from this site were later analyzed by Marmaduke (1975) and are listed in Table 21-1. The presence of both dart and arrow points suggests a multicomponent site. Although a depression was Volume II, Part Three observable on the surface of the site, this feature was not investigated to determine if it was a man-made pit. The Dugger site, one of the sites excavated prior to the Lake Lavon enlargement, is a controversial component of the Wylie focus largely because of the presence of a pithouse at the site (Dawson and Sullivan 1973:42). The pithouse is reported as semisubterranean and consisting of two compartments with a row of small, charred poles 2.5 to 4 cm in diameter along the southeastern wall. Unfortunately, inadequate reporting of this and other discoveries at the site precludes serious consideration of these features. Moreover, the vertisolic soils dominant at many East Fork sites are noted for extensive subsoil disturbances termed gilgai (Duffield 1970; Newman 1982:12-13). These disturbances form when A horizon soil is worked downward into the B horizon through soil cracks, creating basin-shaped depressions, filled with A horizon soils, which are as much as 2 m deep and 4 m in diameter. Until better documented data are produced on pithouses along the East Fork, these features from Lake Lavon should be treated skeptically and viewed as potential pilgai. The artifacts recovered from the site are summarized in Table 21-1 and characteristics on the large pit are provided in Table 21- 2. Overall, the Dugger site is most useful in demonstrating that a Wylie focus component is present along Pilot Grove Creek. A Wylie focus component was encountered at the Glen Hill site, located on a knoll in the floodplain of the East Fork (Ross 1966:19). The site covers an area of approximately one half ha. A series of backhoe trenches was excavated across the site in the hope of locating a large depression, but this effort failed. Artifacts recovered from the site are listed in Table 21-1 and include specimens indicating both Archaic and Late Prehistoric period occupations, although a case can be made for greater use of the site during the Archaic period based on the higher incidence of dart points relative to arrow points. Seven burials were located at the site during testing, all of which were flexed (Ross 1966:20-22). The Gilkey Hill site is located on a low rise in the floodplain of the East Fork and on a nearby upland area (Harris 1942). The site covers approximately 6 ha in total extent, with the portion on the floodplain rise consisting of a deep midden deposit. Several “cooking pits," measuring 1 to 2 m in diameter and 25 to 35 cm deep, are reported (Harris 1942: 48). However, the contents of the features suggest trash fill instead of artifacts associated with cooking. Overall, a wide variety of artifacts is reported, although counts are not provided and the site therefore has not been included in Table 21-1. Among the identified artifacts, there are expanding and contracting stem dart points, triangular, straight stem, and expanding stem arrow points, and several other lithic tool types such as drills, knives, and scrapers. In addition, ceramics are reported with most sherds containing shell temper (Harris 1942). Several flexed burials have also been recovered from the site, but no large depression is reported. The best known site along the East Fork is Hogge Bridge, initially excavated by members of the DAS and later by a field crew under the direction of Stephenson (1952a). The site, covering an area of 1.6 ha, is situated on a terrace projection extending into the floodplain of the East Fork. The excavations at this site consisted of hand dug trenches and block excavations in and around the large depression present on the site. Approximately 40% of the large pit was excavated, and this work was used to define the size and content of the feature (Table 21-2). The pit was described as circular with an elevated rim that at one time appeared to have encircled the entire pit. The feature measured 27 m in diameter and 3 m in depth (defined as below the normal ground surface). Within the feature, a cemetery consisting of 7 graves with 13 individual burials was located. Other features were encountered within the large depression, including two concentrations of burned limestone rocks and a cluster of snail shells. Unfortunately, the excavated artifacts were not quantified by level, so vertical comparisons cannot be made. However, Marmaduke (1975) examined the artifacts from the site and concluded that meaningful vertical differences do not occur in the

A radiocarbon date of A. D. 1000 + 70 (TX- 1928) was obtained for the site from a depth of 30 to 45 cm (Marmaduke 1975:156). The Lower Rockwall site is situated on a low rise in the floodplain of the East Fork and covers approximately one half ha. Initial work, conducted by the DAS, uncovered three burials and exposed a midden (Sollberger and Harris 1949; Blair 1960; Harris 1960). Professional excavations were conducted by SMU in the midden deposits and in a large depression on the site. The work in the midden was instrumental in recognizing that substantial debris from an Archaic period occupation existed (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968:75), while the work inside the pit was hindered by a high water table. From the available information, the pit was oval in shape and measured 24 m (NE-SW) by 16 m (Table 21-2). 2 sherds; 1 biface Unknown associated artifacts: calcite and mussel shell 274 artifacts; proveniences within pit not reported 79 artifacts recovered from pit; only 2 from lowest stratum of pit 5 hearths consisting of oxidized clay lenses and FCR; 2 pits; 1 dog burial Concentration of snail shells; numerous horizontal lenses of oxidized clay with stick impressions on one side The depth could not be determined because of the high water table, Two zones were identified in the pit: the upper layer was a black clay topsoil similar to that covering much of the site, and the lower layer was a transitional zone containing charcoal, burned rocks, faunal remains, and burned daub with stick impressions (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968:10). Two flexed burials were encountered in the pit: one in the center and the other along the slope. Unfortunately, few artifacts were collected from inside the pit, so little more can be concluded about this feature. The artifacts found outside of the pit are listed in Table 21-1. The Raglan site, investigated by members of the DAS, is located on a floodplain rise along the East Fork over an area of nearly 3 ha. Seven test pits were excavated at the site which produced faunal remains, grit and shell tempered ceramics, and dart and arrow

272 points. The artifacts indicate occupation of the site during the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. A single flexed burial was recovered from the site, and no large depression was observed. Extensive excavations were conducted at the Sister Grove Creek site by SMU during the summer of 1974 (Lynott 1975), The work was designed to determine the pit's function, to investigate midden deposits around the pit, and to evaluate the nature of occupation at the site. Concerning the latter goal, an historic Wichita settlement-subsistence model was formulated that proposed a semi-sedentary economic strategy involving agriculture, use of wild animal and plant foods during the spring through fall, and a diet of bison during the winter. According to this model, Sister Grove Creek would have been occupied only during the spring through fall. Investigations inside the large depression showed that it had been excavated into the underlying sterile yellow clay and subsequently filled with a dark brown clay (Lynott 1975 22). At the bottom of the pit, a 50 cm thick zone of transition was visible. The overall shape of the pit was oval, measuring 24 m by 14 m and 3.5 to 4 m deep. Since the majority of the pit was excavated with a backhoe, artifact frequencies by vertical levels are not available, | and thus, chronological differences in the fill sequence cannot be examined. Thirteen features, including burials (one human and one dog), hearths, and pits were found in the fill of the depression. In addition, numerous burned soil lenses were encountered, but were not systematically investigated (M. Lynott, personal communication, 1986). Radiocarbon dates from the pit range between A. D. 980 + 200 (TX2034) and A. D. 1590 + 70 (TX2033). The wide range in the dates argues for multiple fill episodes, although these apparently were not visually observable in the field. The floor of the pit was found to be very irregular (Figure 21-2), and Lynott (1975:25) suggested this to be the result of erosion along the wall of the feature. The presence of hearths inside the fill suggested that cooking, possibly associated with ritual feasting, had taken place in the pit. In addition, the occurrence of a single human burial in the pit indicated that a few high status individuals, perhaps females, were buried in the depression (Lynott 1975). Excavations in the midden outside of the pit were successful in obtaining a sample of artifacts related to habitation at the site. Several features, including hearths, pits, and post holes, were uncovered as well as several burials. Because com was not recovered, Lynott (1975:122) argued that agriculture was not practiced by the Wylie focus people. However, no flotation recovery was undertaken on feature fill, so this non-agricultural hypothesis may have been premature. Corn fragments have been found at other Wylie focus sites (Stephenson 1952a:305), and the difficulties of finding fragmented comm remains (cf., Bruseth and Pertulla 1981) suggests that careful searches for this food resource ‘are needed before proper assessment can be made. Radiocarbon dates from the midden deposits suggest that the site was occupied from A. D. 1000 to perhaps as late as A. D. 1600. Lynott (1977:236) argued that occupation during this time span belonged to the Wylie focus, with an early, non-ceramic dart point phase followed by a ceramic and arrow point phase. In 1965 major excavations were conducted at Upper Rockwall, a multicomponent site with a Wylie focus occupation and an associated large depression. The site covers approximately 5 ha along a projection of a terrace into the floodplain. Most work at the site was conducted in the large depression. This work determined that the pit was oval in shape and measured 27 m by 19 m, with the long axis oriented NW-SE. The depth of the pit was 4.2 m below the ground surface. The depression was found to have an uneven floor and to drop sharply towards center, where a secondary basin was identified (Figure 21-3). Five zones were identified in the fill of the pit (Ross 1966:5-6). The lowest zone was a grayish tan clay with caliche, shell, charcoal flecks, and faunal remains; few artifacts were found in this layer. Above this, a mass of snail shells was found in a darker tan-brown zone. The next layer consisted of numerous lenses of oxidized clay, many of which had stick impressions on one side. A radiocarbon date of A. Volume II, Part Three Figure 21-2. Cross section of the large depression excavated at the Sister Grove Creek site (after Lynott 1975). D. 1020 + 90 (TX-315) was obtained from this zone. Artifacts were more frequent in this and later levels. Overlying this zone, a layer of dark clay was observed which was similar to the floodplain soils surrounding the site. And finally, a layer of recent colluvium capped the pit fill, A metal fragment was recovered at the bottom of this zone which dated it to the historic time period. Two flexed burials were recovered inside the depression: One burial was associated with an engraved vessel and several conch shell beads, while the other burial only had conch shell beads included as grave goods. Both graves were presumed to have been excavated from the multi-colored zone, and a radiocarbon date of A. D. 1300 + 120 (TX-320) is reported for the burial associated with the vessel and beads. The artifacts recovered from work in this feature are listed in Table 21-1 and demonstrate occupation of the site by both Archaic and Late Prehistoric groups. The work inside this feature led Ross (1966:18) to conclude: Since as yet there has been no conclusive proof as to the chronological position of association of these depressions with Late’ Archaic or Neo-American materials, and since the definition of the Wylie focus rests largely on the presence of these large depressions, it may be that the Wylie focus is entirely a consiruct of the archaeologist, with no basis in reality. RICHLAND CREEK SITES Four sites from the Richland Creek drainage have been selected for discussion (Figure 21-1). Two of these, Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch, have been extensively described. in the earlier chapters of this volume. Both sites contain large pits with visible surface depressions. The other two sites are the Irvine and Strawn Creek sites which have smaller pits and are located further west along Richland Creek. The Irvine site, reported in Volume III, contains several smaller pits, all lacking visible surface manifestations. The Strawn Creek site is located in Navarro Mills Reservoir and was excavated in 1961 (Duffield 1963). A large pit lacking a visible surface depression was recorded as a midden deposit at this site. These four sites are used for comparison with the Wylie focus sites of the East Fork. The common characteristic shared by the Richland Creek sites is the presence of large pit features, although the size and shape of these features vary considerably. However, this variability in size and shape has useful explanatory potential for interpreting the function of the pits at all sites. In addition, many similarities exist between the pits from the Richland Creek sites and the features from the East Fork sites. And finally, the four Richland Creek sites provide a cross section of the archaeology along the entire drainage, forming a representative data base useful for evaluating whether or not the Wylie focus concept should also be applied to Richland Creek. A clarification in terminology needs to be made concerning the large pits present at sites along Richland Creek and the East Fork. It is useful for later discussions to distinguish those pit features with a surface manifestation from those without this characteristic.

The Wylie Focus 273 ed 0 MSV WT Figure 21-3. 0 ] 2 0 Zz Unexcavated 1 m 2 Profile of the large depression excavated at the Upper Rockwall site (after Ross 1966). Zones I and II are layers of culturally sterile subsoil; Zones III through VII represent the five zones of pit fill. Specificaly, the term depression is used in the remainder of this chapter to refer to a large pit with a visible surface depression. Most of the sites along the East Fork and the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch sites have this type of feature. Other sites have smaller pits which lack visible surface depressions; these features are termed pits. This distinction provides clarity for later discussions of feature function. ADAMS RANCH The Adams Ranch site is located along Richland Creek approximately 12 km from the confluence of Richland Creek and the Trinity River. The site is situated on a terrace projection into the floodplain of Richland Creek and covers an area of .7 ha. The most notable feature at the site is a large depression measuring 16 m X 18 m. This feature is oval in shape and oriented NE-SW along its longest dimension. The depth of the feature is 2.4 m, as measured from the normal ground surface above the center of the feature to the bottom of the feature. In cross section, the pit is basin-shaped with gently sloping walls and an irregular floor. Although the site has been occupied over a considerable period of time, primary periods of site use occurred during the Late Archaic and Round Prairie phases. During the Late Archaic period, the large depression (Feature 1) was excavated and partially filled. Four burials recovered from the fill of the feature are associated with this time period. Based on radiocarbon dates from the lower layer of the depression (Zone 3), a temporal span of A. D. 200 to 700 is estimated. Although some Late Archaic materials were recovered from around the large depression, the low quantity of material suggests limited use of the site during this period. , Zone 2 of the large depression, stratigraphically above Zone 3, has been dated to A. D. 800 - 1000. During this time, the pit was used both for trash deposition and food roasting. The deposits ’ around the large depression indicate that the site was intensively used, but the absence of permanent structures, as indicated by the lack of complete post hole patterns, suggests that occupation may have been seasonal rather than year-round. The final layer of the large depression (Zone 1) records a period of alluvial and colluvial filling with intermittent occupation by small groups belonging to the St. Elmo phase (post - A. D. 1200). Few St. Elmo phase artifacts were recovered from around the depression, which suggests that the site was minimally used by groups of this time. The few artifacts that occur within Zone 1 are probably related to activities which took place immediately around the feature and were washed inside the depression by erosion or tossed into the depression as loads of trash. Artifacts recovered from the site are listed in Table 21-3. An attempt has been made to maintain a classification similar to that used by Lynott (1975) for the East Fork sites to facilitate assemblage comparison, so not all recorded items are listed. In addition, several projectile point types have been added to provide more detailed chronological information. Other artifact classes are as comparable as possible, but some bias no doubt exists since the Richland Creek artifact tabulations have been severely condensed to provide comparable groupings. The reader is referred to the individual site descriptions in this volume and Volume III for more detailed artifact information. A final problem hindering comparison between the East Fork and the Richland Creek sites is the nature of the excavation techniques used. The materials from the East Fork sites have been collected by many different organizations and individuals over the past 40 years, and selective collecting has been a major factor in forming the present artifact sample. Nonetheless, the goal of describing and comparing the Richland Creek sites with the East Fork sites is to examine major similarities and differences between the assemblages that transcend these collection biases. Thus, a detailed type by type comparison is not needed for the present discussion. More detailed discussion of artifact type comparisons, not only with the East Fork sites but also with other surrounding sites in North Central Texas, can be found in Chapter 15 of Volume IIL. The range of artifact types from the Adams Ranch site indicates a general level of similarity with the East Fork sites. Arrow and dart points, bifaces, and retouched pieces are all dominant tool categories. Moreover, ceramics are present but in low frequency. Within the point types, Gary dart points are the most common. However, some differences also occur between these areas. For example, Steiner arrow points are common at Adams Ranch, but are absent from the East Fork sites. Conversely, Catahoula arrow points are common along the East Fork, but are rare at Adams

The ceramics also demonstrate some important differences. While the grog, grit, and bone tempered wares are the most common ceramics at Adams Ranch, shell tempered sherds occur only in the deepest levels (Zone 3) within the large depression. They are unlike the heavily shell tempered sherds from the East Fork sites in that they are thin and have moderate amounts of shell temper. Mcreover, the East Fork ceramics are classified as part of the Wylie focus trade ware (Stepenson 1952a) and date to A. D. 1000 to A. D. 1600 (Lynott 1975), whereas the Adams Ranch shell tempered sherds belong to the Transitional/ Late Archaic phase (see Chapter 15, Volume III), dating prior to A. D. 700. Consequently, these artifacts seem to represent similar types in use at different points in time. BIRD POINT ISLAND Bird Point Island is located 5 km from the confluence of Richland Creek and the Trinity River, and occupies a 4 ha knoll situated in the floodplain of Richland Creek. A significant feature at the site is a large depression measuring 13 m x 17 m with the axis oriented NE-SW. The depth of the feature as measured from the normal ground surface over the center of the pit to the bottom of the pit is 2.7 m. The floor of the pit was extremely irregular and difficult to. follow in the field. The overall form of the pit in cross section was basin-shaped with gently sloping walls. In plan view, the pit was roughly oval with an irregular outline. The site has been occupied over several millennia, with notable major episodes of occupation during the Late Archaic (170 B. C. - A. D. 130), Richland Creek phase (A. D. 580 - 860}, Round Prairie phase (A. D. 1000 - 1200), and the St. Elmo phase (A. D. 1300 - 1650). During the Late Archaic period, the large depression (Feature 1) was excavated and partially filled and occupation occurred around the feature. Seven burials were recovered from the Late Archaic layer (Zone 3). Next, the Richland Creek phase occupation created a midden that contained human cremations and occupational debris forming Zone 2. This layer has been radiocarbon dated to A. D. 580 - 860, but little evidence of use of the area around the pit was observed for this period. During the subsequent Round Praire phase, a small hamlet existed at the site which consisted of two, and possibly three, circular houses, Extensive debris associated with this occupation is found over the site and inside the large depression. The final occupation of the site was by mobile groups which repeatedly visited the site for brief periods between A. D. 1300 and 1650. Overall, a wide variety of artifacts was recovered from Bird Point Island. In comparison with the East Fork sites, similar basic classes of artifacts are observed. Both share high frequencies of Gary dart points with lesser representations by other types such as Yarbrough and Ellis. Several varieties of arrow points, such as Alba, Perdiz, and Scallorn, are also common. However, no examples of the arrow point type Harrell were found at Bird Point Island. Stone tools show additional overall similarity, indicating that a similar range of activities took place at sites in both areas. Ceramics, on the other hand, demonstrate some important differences. While the grog, grit, and bone tempered categories are similar, shell tempered sherds were rarely observed from Bird Point Island. At a broad level, the Bird Point Island artifacts show basic similarity with the Wylie focus sites, with an important exception. Traits considered diagnostic of the Henrietta Focus (Harrell points and shell tempered pottery) are rare at Bird Point Island. In an effort to factor out the multicomponent mixing of the overall artifact assemblages from Bird Point Island, the frequencies of artifacts from the zones within the large depression are listed separately in Table 21-3. These frequencies underscore the concern that overall assemblage comparisons mix the distinctiveness of individual occupations. For instance, it is apparent that ceramics most frequently occur within the upper two zones of the pit and are rare in the lowest zone. These artifacts are encountered over much of the site outside of the pit. IRVINE This site is located approximately 12 km upstream from Bird Point Island and consists of an artifact deposit located along the slope of a terrace projection into the floodplain of Richland Creek. No single large depression exists at the site; instead, there are several smailer pits (Figure 21-4). However, three of these pits are still rather large. The exact size of Feature 3 is unknown but Feature 17 is 7 x 11 m and Feature 18 is 7 x 12 m. The depths. of these pits range from slightly more than a meter (Feature 17) to less than a meter (Feature 18). Several smaller pits are located around the large pits. Two major periods of occupation are evident at the site. The first dates from A. D. 700 - 900, and most features and artifacts are thought to be from this period. Both Gary points and arrow points were in use at this time, as well as sandy paste and grog tempered ceramics. The later occupation of the site occurred sometime around A. D. 1140, based on a single radiocarbon date from Feature 21. The large pits at the site are very irregular in both plan view and cross section, and several smaller pits were intrusive into the

The Wylie Focus large pits. The presence of large quantities of fire cracked rock in these features suggests usage for roasting. In addition, other artifacts indicative of trash disposal were also encountered. Many partially disarticulated and disturbed human burials were uncovered inside the large pits, which indicates that these features were used for burial as well as for utilitarian purposes. The artifacts from the site are summarized in Table 21-3 and are listed separately for the large pits and the remainder of the site. Little difference in the two samples from the site is seen, indicating that the people who constructed the pits also left many of the artifacts around the large pits. The sample of artifacts from this site is important since it represents a collection primarily from a single component. Although materials from earlier and later occupations were recovered from the site, these items were relatively few. Consequently, the artifacts can, more or less, be assumed to be a representative sample from a Richland Creek phase occupation. Comparison with the East Fork sites shows that the overall comparability occurs, with some sites showing more similarity than others. Differences do occur in specific projectile point styles and in the types of ceramics present. Although Gary points are the dominant point style at Irvine and along the East Fork, the relative frequencies of arrow points show different style preferences. Specifically, Scallorn and Steiner points are either absent or less frequent along the East Fork. Sandy paste ceramics are also present at the Irvine site (see Chapter 12, Volume Til). STRAWN CREEK The Strawn Creek site is located at the confluence of Strawn Creek and Richland Creek, some 48 km upstream from the Irvine site (Duffield 1963). The site was excavated in 1961 by a crew from the Texas Archeological Survey Project. The principal area of cultural deposits was found to be an oval-shaped midden measuring 6 x 15 m. Upon excavation the midden was found to fill a depression dug into the subsoil to a depth of about 70 cm deep (Figure 21-5), All excavation was conducted within this feature. The large pit had no surface manifestation and is similar to the features reported for the Irvine site. This similarity is seen in the oval irregular plain view of the pit at Sawn Creek and in the highly irregular bottom. Several pits were recorded within the large pit, including pits with scattered bits of human bones, rodent burrows, and unidentified pits (Duffield 1963:7). Postmortem disturbances and poor preservation potential of the soil caused the fragmentary condition of the human remains. No concentrations of rocks, ash, or charcoal were noted, and no post holes indicating a structure were found. The artifacts from Strawn Creek are listed in Table 21-3. Although some liberty was used in condensing the original artifact classes into those on the list, less collapsing was required than for the previous Richland Creek sites. This is due to the less complex classification scheme used by Duffield (1963). The overall frequencies show similarity to the East Fork sites, but certain absences, specifically gouges, cores, and ground stone, are difficult to explain. Considering that the site was excavated more than 20 years ago, they are probably not the result of cultural behavior; but rather reflect a lack of recognition or collection of these tool types. WYLIE FOCUS: AN APPRAISAL OF THE FACTS As noted previously, the Wylie focus was established in 1952 to describe a cultural manifestation along the East Fork of the Trinity River (Stephenson 1952a). A series of traits was devised to characterize this cultural development following the Midwestern Taxonomic System (MTS). These included the presence of large, man-made depressions (although not mandatory), trade pottery from surrounding areas, flexed burials lacking grave goods, and artifacts representative of a wide variety of types. In 1952, when 277 these characteristics were devised, relatively little was known. about North Central Texas archaeology, other than the preliminary foundation established by members of the DAS (Harris 1936, 1942, 1948; Harris and Hatzenbuehler 1948; Hatzenbuehler 1942a; Housewright et al. 1947). Although Krieger's monumental Culture Complexes of Northern Texas (1946) was available, this primarily provided comparative data on sites to the east and west of the East Fork area. Therefore, it is not surprising that traits that seemed reasonable in the 1950s, when littie comparative data was available, today seem too generalized to provide a meaningful basis for culture-historical classification. The additional information collected from sites in North Central Texas since 1952 requires us to reassess the usefulness of the Wylie focus concept in terms of today's archaeological goals. Specifically, we must address two questions: (1) how well is the Wylie focus serving as a culture-historical construct, and (2) are we actually advancing our understanding of North Central Texas prehistory by assigning sites to this focus? To answer these questions, we must first examine the original definition of a focus as part of the MTS. A focus was defined as a collection ". . . of traits . . . [that] reoccur in characteristic purity and practical completeness . . . at a variety of sites" (McKern 1939:308). When adequately formulated, a focus will equate with a distinct social grouping such as a tribe. Foci were, moreover, to be timeless and spaceless (Caldwell and Henning 1978:115), and to merely connect similar archaeological manifestations for later temporal and spatial consideration. However, Stephenson's (1952a:311) definition of the Wylie focus attempted to move beyond the strict MTS and to propose chronological boundaries. The precision of these boundaries was hampered by a lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and since radiocarbon dating was in its infancy, only a rough estimate of A. D. 1300 to 1600 was made based on similar cultural developments in other areas. Stephenson (1952a:312) did note that with future radiocarbon dating, the temporal position of the focus would likely be refined, Lynott (1977), on the basis of 12 radiocarbon dates from sites of the focus, concluded that a wider time span was in order. Based on work at the Sister Grove Creek site, a time frame of A. D. 900 to perhaps as late as A. D. 1590 was suggested. _ Lynott (1977:236) further postulated the existence of a preceramic dart point phase of the Wylie focus that was coeval with the Sanders focus of East Texas, This phase developed into a ceramic and arrow producing phase that contained traits similar to the Henrietta focus to the west. As a result of Lynott’s temporally expanded estimate combined with Stephenson's broad complex of identifying traits, virtually any Late Prehistoric site in the upper Trinity River basin could be identified as belonging to the Wylie focus (cf., Smith 1969). It is clear today that the broad temporal range and vague trait characteristics of the Wylie focus limit the usefulness of the concept. This is particularly true since the inclusion of dart points as a trait within the focus means that it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate Archaic from Wylie focus components at the same site. The most distinctive quality of Archaic occupations, namely the presence of certain dart point forms, is lost. Although it may be correct that dart and arrow points were concurrently in use at the East Fork sites, this has not been demonstrated but simply assumed. The nature of this problem can be seen more clearly by comparing the Richland Creek sites to the East Fork sites. Due to the extensive investigations undertaken at the Richland Creek sites, particularly those of the RCAP, it is possible to understand the periods of occupation and to identify the asemblages associated with each period. Most of the sites represent occupations by both Archaic and Late Prehistoric groups, and the large depression at the sites are associated specifically with Late Archaic occupations. A demonstration that the Richland Creek and the East Fork sites are similar from an overall assemblage perspective (ie., the sum of all components at a site) will make a strong case for the existence of mixed components at the East Fork sites as well. On the other hand, if the East Fork sites are sufficiently different from the Richland Creek sites, and further, show interassemblage

At a very basic level, the Richland Creek sites show certain differences with the East Fork sites (Table 21-1 and 21-3). These differences are noted primarily in the absence of Late Prehistoric shell tempered ceramics, the low frequency of worked bone and shell artifacts, and the presence of Late Archaic shell tempered pottery and certain projectile point styles along Richland Creek. Aside from these differences, however, the assemblages show comparable degrees of intra- and inter-drainage variability. That is, the proportional variability of ceramics, projectile points styles, and tools is as great between sites of the East Fork as between sites along Richland Creek. A better understanding of what this observation means can be made by examining two of the Richland Creek sites, Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch, in more detail. Comparison of dart point frequencies (indicative of Archaic occupation) to arrow point frequencies (indicative of post-Archaic occupation), shows that Bird Point Island has more dart points relative to arrow points (ratio = 1.05 darts to 1 arrow) than Adams Ranch (.66 dart to 1 arrow). Although dart and arrow points were clearly used contemporaneously during some of the occupations at Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch, this difference in the ratios between the two sites is to a large extent a function of the types of components present at each site. As mentioned previously, four major components are observed at Bird Point Island: Late Archaic (170 B. C. - A. D. 130), Richland Creek phase (A. D. 580 - 860), Round Prairie phase (A. D. 1000 - 1200), and St. Elmo phase (A. D. 1300 - 1650). At Adams Ranch, on the other hand, only one major period of site use is apparent and this is during the Round Prairie phase. Thus, the differences in point ratios are due to a less intensive Archaic period occupation at Adams Ranch. If we use the Richland Creek sites as a model of assemblage composition and frequency variability, then the East Fork Wylie focus sites seem also to be mixed component assemblages. Quite definitely, artifacts assignable to the Archaic period occur at most of the East Fork sites. Take for instance the Hogge Bridge site, type site for the Wylie focus. Of the illustrated points and lithic tools, several Archaic forms are represented (e.g., Stephenson 1952b: Figure 95b). An occupation during the Middle, and even perhaps Early, through the Late Archaic is clearly represented in addition to the large numbers of Late Prehistoric artifacts. As aculture-historical construct, then, the Wylie focus seems to be hindering more than helping our understanding of North Central Texas archaeology. Moreover, little value would be gained by.classifying the Richland Creek sites as part of the Wylie

Dela The Wylie Focus focus. In fact, the Wylie focus concept along the East Fork should be replaced by a culture-historical scheme that attempts to more critically synthesize and classify the archaeological record. LARGE PITS AND NORTH CENTRAL TEXAS ARCHAEOLOGY We have concluded that the Wylie focus is a flawed culture- historical construct for describing the archaeology of the East Fork of the Trinity River. Moreover, we have suggested that the artifact assemblages from most Wylie focus sites are actually composites of multiple occupations during distinctly different periods of prehistory. However, we have not addressed the most enigmatic characteristic of the Wylie focus, namely, the function of the large depressions present at most sites. In this section the function of these feaures is examined by first reviewing existing hypotheses and then proposing a refined hypothesis that more - realistically addresses the data base and places this material into a broader behavioral perspective. PREVIOUS HYPOTHESES The hypotheses that have been proposed by various researchers to account for the large depressions along the East Fork have been discussed earlier in this volume, so only a brief review of these hypotheses is presented here. The first systematic consideration of these features was by Stephenson (1952a:307) at Hogge Bridge. He proposed that the depression at this site, as well as other sites of the focus, was likely used for one of the following purposes: dance arenas, gaming areas, ceremonial centers, open-air council chambers, or defensive breastworks. An additional possibility, that the pits were used for water storage; was discarded since ample water would likely have been available from nearby springs and creeks. Ross (1966:16), based on work at the Upper Rockwall site, reviewed several of these alternatives and added some important insights on the subject. He too agreed that water storage was unlikely, since the depression at the Upper Rockwall site penetrated a gravel substratum that would have permitted water to drain out. In fact, Ross (1966:18) suggested that excavation of the secondary basin in the center may have been designed to contact the subsurface gravels to promote drainage. Conceming the defensive hypothesis, he argued that this was unlikely since these features are consistently located along the slopes of the site landforms. Such a position would have put people inside the depressions at a disadvantage since an invading group would have been on higher ground with a strategic advantage. The most rigorous examination of the function of these features was conducted by Lynott (1975) based on excavations at the Sister Grove Creek site. He evaluated Stephenson's hypotheses and determined that they all were inadequate when viewed against the data from excavations at the Sister Grove Creek site. As an altemative, Lynott proposed a new hypothesis to more realistically address the functional problem. The new hypothesis proposed that the depressions had served as focal points for ritual feasting. The ritual aspect of this hypothesis came form the idea that the pits represented a form of community symbol and that the activities conducted in them would have had significance to the entire group who occupied the site (Lynott, personal comunication, 1985). The evidence in support of Lynott’s (1975:39) interpretation of ritual feasting was based on the numerous hearths, fire cracked rock, mussel shell, and other faunal remains from the feature at Sister Grove Creek. In addition, he proposed that high status female burials were placed into the pits. However, since only one burial was excavated at Sister Grove Creek, where approximately 90% of the pit was excavated, interment was not a primary purpose of the features. Based on a series of radiocarbon dates from the site, construction of the pit was proposed to have commenced prior to A. D. 1000. Influence from the Gibson aspect of the Caddoan 279 mound sites in East Texas was viewed as the probable source of innovation for this activity along the East Fork. Lynott's hypothesis is important because it offers an interpretation that systematically addresses the contents of the depressions. Despite this, two unsettling questions persist about this hypothesis. First, detailed stratigraphic information from pits at other sites show evidence of a bottom layer which lacks burned lenses and has little associated food debris (e.g., Upper Rockwall, Bird Point Island, and Adams Ranch). What is the relationship of this layer to the ritual feasting hypothesis? Such a layer was not recognized at the Sister Grove Creek site, but it must be noted that there the large depression was excavated mostly by a backhoe. A similar layer may have been overlooked, particularly if if was not visually distinctive and was detectable only by a change in artifact styles or frequencies. A second unsettling question is why would ceremonial feasting take place in a large depression, particularly one that is actively being filled by eroded soil, as Lynott (1975:25) indicates was the case at Sister Grove Creek? FEATURE CHARACTERISTICS By examining previous hypotheses in light of the work from Richland Creek, we now are in a position to provide a refined understanding of the function of these features. To accomplish this, we first need to examine the characteristics of the large depressions from all sites within a comparative framework to isolate characteristics that are common to all large depressions and identify those that tend to be unique to one or only a few. Characteristics shared by all features are assumed to be more indicative of their function then those common to one or a few. Including only those sites with large depressions (i.¢., only those with a surface manifestation), we find that the features have three sets of characteristics. The first set consists of traits that are the result of cultural activity and occur consistently at all depressions. They include the following: (1) An elongated outline and irregular walls, (when this information has been carefully collected), Although the Hogge Bridge site is described as nearly circular (Stephenson 1952a:307), this was determined from perpendicular trenches and limited block excava- tions; extensive horizontal scraping, the best method for outline definition, was not undertaken. (2) Surface manifestations varying from slightly less than I m to over I m in depth (as measured from the elevation of the normal ground surface). (3) Location on the slopes of site landforms. (4) One or more burials (when sufficient portions of the depressions have been sampled.) The location of the human remains is not consistent within the depressions, (5) Association of considerable quantities of both Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric artifacts. In addition to these universal traits, several characteristics were found to differ from feature to feature. These are: (1) Size and depth of the features. They vary from a minimum length of 17 m to a maximum length of 27 m, and from a minimum depth of 2.4 m to a maximum depth of 4.2 m. (2) Presence of an elevated rim. This trait was only clearly observable at the Hogge Bridge site. (3) Presence of definable stratigraphy. Unfortunately, not all workers consistently recorded this information. And finally, a non-cultural characteristic of the large depressions must be considered. This has to do with the types of soils found inside and around the features. The depressions have

280 been constructed on several different types of landforms, including floodplain knolls and terrace remnants. Consequently, the soils that make up the features also vary from clays to sandy loams. This variability in soil types has permitted various natural soil disturbance agents such as soil cracking (Newman 1982; Duffield 1970) and rodent disturbance (Eriandson 1984) to differentially affect the deposits. For example, the pocket gopher (Geomys sp.), a common agent of site disturbance in North Central Texas, prefers sandy soil habitats and causes considerable soil mixing in these locations (Schmidly 1983:143). Consequently, sites with sandy deposits will show more disturbance from this animal than sites in clay soils. What do these sets of characteristics tell us about the function of the large depressions present at many sites along the East Fork and Richland Creek? The consistently occurring cultural characteristics indicate that similar behavioral processes were responsible for the initial formation of the features. Whether this initial formation was intended for ritual feasting or some other purpose cannot yet be determined, but the evidence argues for a common original function. The fact that the features are always located on the slopes of site landforms indicates that they were located away from prime areas for habitation (i.e., the tops of knolls). This suggests that the pits functioned in an ancillary fashion to activities conducted on the prime topographic setting (e.g., human habitation). The consistent occurrence of burials within the features demonstrates that human burial was a part of the purpose for the features, but not the primary purpose. If the pits had been used solely as cemeteries, then we might expect a greater number of burials placed in the central portions of the depressions. The consistent occurrence of Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric artifacts at sites with the large depressions adds important information on the chronological placement of these features. The origins of the depressions at Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch are clearly dated to the Late Archaic period. A similar temporal placement might be posited for the pits along the East Fork. The existing radiocarbon dates from depressions on the East Fork sites post-date the initial construction of the pits. Although Lynott (1977:236) argues for a construction and initial use between A. D. 900 and 1000, there is no firm evidence for this. The earliest date from the large depression at Sister Grove Creek was A. D. 900 200 (Lynott 1977:29). However, this sample was recovered from the slope of the depression and not from the bottom. Based on excavations at the Upper Rockwall site, Ross Volume II, Part Three Red River and ultimately to some of the Ozark stone sources used for the boatstones. Conversely, access would have been provided for movement of Gulf marine shell northward. Those cultural traits that vary from depression to depression offer important additional information pertaining to pit function. The size of features varies both in terms of horizontal dimensions and depth, suggesting that the processes responsible for their construction varied in intensity. That is, the smaller pits found at Adams Ranch and Bird Point Island along Richland Creek reflect a tower level of the activities responsible for the creation of these features than occurred at sites along the East Fork, where the pits are consistently large. A Jack of a consistent elevated rim indicates that this feature either has been eroded away or that a rim was incidental to the purpose of the feature. And finally, the inconsistent occurrence of stratigraphy demonstrates that the fill episodes of the features varied after construction and initial use. We interpret this to suggest that the function of some of the features changed over time. The chronological information from Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch indicates that later groups used the depressions, but for different purposes. The lack of stratigraphy at other sites suggests that some features were abandoned after their initial period of use. And finally, the variability in soil characteristics of the features suggests that whatever cultural activities took place inside them has been differentially disturbed by natural processes. Some sites may be relatively undisturbed by natural agents while others have been heavily disturbed, Consequently, our interpretations must account for potential mixing and overall blurring of the distinctiveness of the deposits, in addition to the systemic context of deposition (cf., Schiffer 1975). FEATURE FUNCTION: A NEW HYPOTHESIS Given that the large depressions along Richland Creek and the East Fork show similarities in shape, content, and chronology, we are now in a position to examine the question of function by providing a new hypothesis. Although recent work along Richland Creek has provided pertinent data on pit formation processes, generalizations outside of this area should be considered tentative. The large depressions from the Richland Creek and East Fork sites are similar; however, the East Fork sites have been less intensively investigated and several feature characteristics are poorly (1966:18) concluded that the temporal association of the large“ understood. features was uncertain and that a Late Archaic affiliation was a distinct possibility. It is our contention that the chronological position of the large depressions has not been firmly determined and that a Late Archaic time frame for initial excavation and use of the pits along the East Fork is consistent with existing data. The occurrence of large quantities of Late Archaic artifacts on all of the East Fork sites lends support to this argument. In fact, the East Fork sites contain more exotic or elaborate Late Archaic artifacts such as boatstones, gorgets, and worked marine shell (Table 21-4) than all known sites from surrounding areas. Hall (1981:291-309) has proposed a Late Archaic, or Woodland, period import-export sphere linking southcentral and coastal Texas with other parts of the southeastern U. S. Three main items formed this exchange system: comer tanged knives, boatstones, and marine shell. Two of these three items (boatstones and marine shell artifacts) occur within the East Fork drainage and suggest that the Late Archaic inhabitants of this area were somehow participating in this import-export sphere. It is interesting to note that other drainages of the Trinity River do not show this same elaboration of Archaic culture. It is difficult to imagine what the East Fork Late Archaic could have been contributing to the import-export system to the exclusion of surrounding areas. Perhaps the location of the East Fork was important as a direct route connecting the Trinity River with the Red River. The East Fork is the only major tributary of the Trinity River oriented directly north-south; it would have permitted direct access to the "QUICK TIME" EXPECTATIONS VERSUS A SYSTEMIC CONTEXT OF EXPLANATION Before discussing this new hypothesis, the assumptions underlying an understanding of pit function must be considered. Are we looking for the evidence, frozen in time, of a once-living culture which disappeared while utilizing a large depression? This "Pompeii premise,” as it has been labeled (Ascher 1961), proposes that cultures leave a perfectly fossilized picture of their behavior in the archaeological record when they cease to exist. Seldom does this situation occur, and as Schiffer (1976:11-12) has noted: Between the time artifacts were manufactured and used in the past and the time these objects are unearthed by the archaeologist they have been subjected to a series of cultural and noncultural processes which have transformed them spatially, quantitatively, and formally and relationally .. . If we desire to reconstruct the past from archaeological remains, these processes must be taken into account, and a more generally applicable methodological principle substituted for the one that asserts that there is an equivalence between past cultural systems and its archaeological record.

Past researchers have approached the problem as if the large depressions ceased_to function immediately after use and that the artifact record reflects this sudden event. For instance, Lynott (1975:39-40) proposed that his hypothesis of ceremonial feasting will be evident through the identification of hearths, representing temporary cooking, and large mammal remains, representative of a large group. This implies that the food was cooked within the pits, consumed, and that all evidence, such as the hearths and associated food debris, was left behind and covered in place. Although the effects of ceremonial cleaning are discussed, the more probable effects of animal scavengers and natural disturbances, such as leaching of the hearths by rainfall and displacement of the artifacts by erosion, are not discussed. As an alternative, Binford (1981:197) argues that we should attempt to understand features not simply as isolated pieces of a descriptive history, but as part of the cultural systems that produced them. The archaeological record represents a massive palimpsest of many separate episodes of human behavior, and the identification of specific events is often impossible. More importantly, the identification of these unique events in prehistory is not an integral part of modern anthropological archaeology. Rather, we should attempt to understand human behavior from the diachronic perspective that only archaeology can provide (Binford 1964). This approach is useful for furthering our understanding of the function of the large depressions for two reasons. First, it offers a chance to move beyond the quick-time expectations of earlier hypotheses and to more realistically address the complex and often accretional nature of the archaeological record. Second, and more importantly, this viewpoint focuses attention on how these features 281 functioned within the societies that constructed them. That is, the relationship of the depressions to other parts of the prehistoric cultural system becomes the target of explanation. If ritual feasting is the hypothesized use, then we must explain why ritual feasting was undertaken in the first place. What advantage does feasting in a pit offer? Certainly eating can be done anywhere on the site, and to undertake this activity inside a 3 m deep depression in the ground does not, by itself, seem logical. It is only within the context of the total cultural system that the rationale for pit construction and use can be understood. COMPARISONS WITH ROASTING PITS Since the large depressions contain artifacts and floral and faunal remains indicative of economic use, an indication of their purpose can be gained by comparing them with smaller pit features that have been identified as roasting pits. At Bird Point Island, extensive experimental work demonstrated that these pits functioned as roasting ovens for a variety of foods, including hickory nuts, acorns, Psoralea tubers, and probably meat. The purpose of the roasting activity was to cook and/or preserve food resources. Hilliard (1980:16), in describing processing of hickory huts, notes that roasting stops the process of germination by removing the moisture content, makes the shells easier to remove, and kills larvae that might have infested the nuts. Beneficial effects of roasting can also be assumed for some of the other plant foods found within these features. For instance, roasting would also have been a means of drying Psoralea tubers and meat, and the use of this technique has been documented historically (Mandlebaum 1940:202). At first glance, the low incidence of artifacts suggestive of Toasting activity (fire cracked rock, hearths, concentrations of food remains) from the bottom layers of the depressions at Bird Point Island, Adams Ranch, and Upper Rockwall do not seem to correspond to what would be expected for a roasting pit. However, as noted earlier, we cannot expect these features today to contain the same proportions of artifacts that they had when in use. These features were reused many times and only the non-reusable items (charred fragments of food, fragmented small pieces of fire cracked rock, etc.) can be expected to remain. Moreover, any oxidization of the soil from heat would have been disturbed by subsequent digging. In fact, depending upon the clay content of the soil, oxidized lenses might not even form. Blurring this entire picture are the natural post-depositional processes outlined earlier in this chapter. To understand what artifacts would be expected in these features if they were used for roasting, comparison can be made to Feature 38 from Bird Point Island and Feature 51 from Adams Ranch which have been convincingly identified as roasting pits (Table 21-5). The functional assessment of these features was based on a high incidence of fire cracked rock, baked clay, a lower incidence of many other artifact classes, and the presence of many types of charred floral remains. The fire cracked rock did not appear to be abundant during excavation, and became noticeable only after the matrix had been water screened and the small pieces were observed. Similarly, the baked clay was not easily observable: and its presence seems to have been influenced by the quantity of clay in the soil available for oxidation. The raw material heated for roasting was Wilcox sandstone, and large rocks were evidently reused until they exfoliated into smaller pieces. Thus, a lack of large fire cracked rocks does not indicate that roasting did not take place. In fact, from a diachronic perspective, we would expect to find mostly the small non-reusable pieces left behind in the pit fill. The lowest layers of the depressions at both Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch contained quantities of fire cracked rock, albeit in lower frequencies than the smaller roasting pits. The mere presence of this material suggests that some degree of roasting took place. Viewing the proportional frequencies of artifacts instead of the absolute frequencies (Table 21-6), a different picture emerges concerning the occurrence of fire cracked rock. The lower levels of the depression at Bird Point Island exhibit fire

A lower percentage is observed in the lowest levels of Adams Ranch, but fire cracked rock is still the dominant member of the assemblage. Overall, however, the densities of fire cracked rock and other artifact classes are lower in the large depressions than in the roasting pits. This indicates that the intensity of use varied among these features, with Features 38 and 51 having been used more times. Fire cracked rock is not reported for most of the East Fork sites, apparently because it was not systematically collected. It would have been particularly difficult to notice if the pieces were as small as those observed at the Richland Creek sites. However, Stephenson (1952a) did report two concentrations of burned limestone rocks from inside the pit at Hogge Bridge. Since Wilcox sandstone does not occur along the East Fork, locally occurring limestone could be expected to have functioned in a similar capacity. THE SYSTEMIC CONTEXT OF LATE ARCHAIC ROASTING PITS Earlier in this chapter, the argument was made that all the large depressions may have been constructed by Late Archaic populations. It has also been argued that the large depressions functioned as roasting pits, in much the same manner that the smaller pits clearly associated with earth oven cooking. Assuming these two arguments are correct, the question now becomes, why did Late Archaic groups need such large roasting pits? The great size of these features suggests that substantial amounts of resources were being processed. This could either indicate a large resident population or, more likely, the coalescence of several regional bands at sites with depressions. Such aggregations of neighboring bands during certain times of the year is observed among modern hunting and gathering societies (Service 1962:58-59), and can be expected to have occurred prehistorically. Evidence supporting this situation is the relatively low frequency of Late Archaic materials around the large depression at Adams Ranch. The depression at this site has been dated to the Late Archaic period, and diagnostic artifacts have been recovered from the lowest layer of the feature. The paucity of Late Archaic artifacts around the pit argues for brief encampments at the site rather than a large resident population. Although it could be argued that the coalescence of a large band might produce substantial quantities of artifacts, this would not occur if each occupation was brief and the occupations were separated by several seasons. Although other sites with depressions show evidence of more intensive Late Archaic occupation, we propose that these large depressions, such as Bird Point Island and many of the East Fork sites, also reflect roasting activities associated with aggregations of local groups. Not all sites were apparently used for this activity to the same extent, and this seems to have-created the observed differential quantities of Late Archaic artifacts. Compounding this problem is the almost certain use of many of the sites as seasonal camps before or after use of the depressions. The nature of roasting activities conducted at sites with large depressions probably included: (1) large scale processing of certain plant and animal foods, and (2) cooking for ritual feasts associated with macroband aggregation. Plants such as Psoralea sp. and nuts occur in high abundance for very brief periods of the year, so their collection and processing must be conducted rapidly. Macroband aggregation for the purpose of collecting and preserving staple foods would have provided a means of increasing the harvest beyond the capabilities of individual bands. Since roasting is a well-documented means of preserving both nuts (Hilliard 1980) and Psoralea (Wedel 1978), significant roasting activity would have occurred during harvest periods. Ritual feasting, derived from Lynott's (1975) hypothesis, is viewed here as an important social activity which occurred during the gathering of bands for the purpose of food collection and processing. The variety of food species recovered from the large depressions at Adams Ranch and Bird Point Island is reminiscent of the types of foods found in association with burned rock middens of Central Texas, which are also believed to have been used for roasting (Peter 1982). In fact, the problems involved with understanding the origins and function of burned rock middens are strikingly similar to those affecting the interpretation of the large pits found in North Central Texas. Both seem to have grown from gradual accretion, and at first glance, seem too large to have been created by small bands. Perhaps both are adaptations to a — Lagu +* SE oo acs ap ee ee a a. a ae uwupmetes a a wee Oh ae

The large depressions may be the equivalent of the burned rock middens in stone poor areas, and the reason that burned rock middens are not found in North Central Texas is due to the lack of abundant stone resources. Under these conditions, a different strategy for roasting developed, namely earth-oven roasting. To understand why the large pits originated during the Late Archaic period, data related to population size, territorial extent, energy requirements, and risk management strategies must be considered within the perspective of the broader cultural system. On a rudimentary level, the depressions served as roasting pits, but they appear to have provided a far more important function on sociological and ideological levels. The following presentation examines the role of these features in light of the development-of hunter-gatherer cultural complexity during the Late Archaic period discussed in Chapter 18 of Volume III. During the Late Archaic period, human population increased in North Central Texas, as evidenced by a greater number of sites with artifacts diagnostic of this period than sites with artifacts diagnostic of the Early or Middle Archaic periods (see Chapter 18, Volume III). As population increased, territorial size decreased. This is documented by the distribution of chert types, which shows an increased use of local resources and decrease in imported cherts over time (see Chapter 16, Volume III). As a result of increased population and decreased territory, new approaches toward the management of resource stress developed. A prominent feature of the prairies of Texas is the abundance of certain key food resources (e.g., Psoralea, acorns, hickory nuts), yet these same resources are noted by marked seasonality and spatial inequity. As argued in Chapter 18 of Volume III, hunter-gatherers deal with this temporal and spatial incongruity in resources through various types of risk management strategies (Earle 1980). Given a stable environment and constant but low level population, hunter-gatherers prefer to accomplish this through mobility (Cohen 1977, 1985; Binford 1980). Binford calls this form of organization, whereby consumers move to goods, residential mobility. We argue that this economic strategy was employed by the Early and Middle Archaic populations in the Richland Creek area. Evidence in support of this argument is the high proportion of cherts in the local assemblages which are assumed to have been procured from distant sources. The higher population densities recorded for the Late Archaic period resulted in reduced exploitation territories which limited 283 mobility and made this form of risk management precarious. The reduced group territories meant that each society was more vulnerable to local fluctuation in plant and animal availability (cf., Ford 1979:236). If for instance, nut production in one area significantly decreased, which is commonly observed among many nut bearing trees (Hilliard1980), economic hardship was brought upon the group inhabiting the area. The interactive effects of a shortage of one resource upon other food sources, such as a lowering of deer populations due to the low mast yields, would have compounded this problem. A common means by which contemporary hunter-gatherers cope with this problem is through risk sharing (Wiessner 1982: 65; Gould 1982). Generalized reciprocity (Service 1979:17) is maintained with neighboring groups, and social obligations are stored through feasting, exchange, and gift-giving. Band coalescence at the sites with large depression could have served much the same purpose. During periods when local resources were scarce, band aggregation would serve to redistribute foods to those groups in need. Under conditions of better resource harvests, feasting and general socialization could serve to store social obligations for future resource shortfalls. In either case, the depressions would be the by-products of short term cooking and processing of food associated with this seasonal congregation. Assuming such a hypothesis is correct, how do we explain the spatial segregation of the sites with depressions? To date, only two clusters of sites are known: those along the East Fork and those along Richland Creek. Moreover, several sites with depressions are recorded for the East Fork, whereas only two are observed along Richland Creek. Perhaps the groups of depressions are located along “tension zones" between neighboring groups, where due to natural geography, vegetational patterns, or some other factor, local bands tended to come into contact. Not all of the depressions would have been used at the same time, but each would have served its purpose for a relatively short period. By comparing the radiocarbon dates between Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch, a strong case can be made for sequential use of the features, first at Bird Point Island and later at Adams Ranch. With refined chronological control, a similar situation might have been found at the East Fork sites. Assuming this is correct, the greater number of sites with depressions along the East Fork suggests that the social institution represented by the depressions occurred over a longer period of time. It is interesting to note the high incidence of exotic or labor intensive artifacts mentioned earlier in this chapter at sites of this drainage. The artifacts are missing at the Richland Creek sites. The presence of those artifacts was interpreted to indicate participation in a Late Archaic import- export sphere in Texas and surrounding states. This evidence combined with the overall greater number of depression sites argues for the emergence of hunter-gatherer complexity along the East Fork reminiscent of developments further north in the Midwest (Brown 1985). The ideological importance of the depressions is demonstrated by their consistent inclusion of human burials, although the mortuary role of these features appears to have been secondary to their economic role. Almost all of the depressions recorded along the East Fork and both depressions along Richland Creek contained human burials in their lowest layers. The limited excavations along the East Fork provided data that suggested the depressions were restricted to the burial of high status females, although this interpretation was based on a small sample (Lynctt 1975:118). The larger sample of burials from the Richland Creek depressions included males, females, and infants without associated grave offerings indicative of status differentation. The important point is that these features functioned in an ideological capacity in both areas. The ideological importance of established cemeteries may be directly related to the pressures of increased population and decreased territory during the Late Archaic period. Charles and Buikstra (1983) have interpreted the appearance of Archaic period cemeteries in the Central Mississippi Valley as an indicator of the emergence of corporate lineal inheritance of crucial and restricted resources. They state that "the remains of one's ancestors on the

<| — 284 land... provide a very strong argument for ownership” (Charles and Buikstra 1983:121). Thus, a major function of cemeteries, aside from providing a resting place for the dead, was to serve as territorial markers. The presence of a cemetery legitimized a group's claim to the area and hence to its crucial resources. This concept of cemeteries as territorial markers fits well with the data from North Central Texas, where increased population, concomitant restriction of territoral areas, and the use of the depressions are all first observed during the Late Archaic period. Along Richland Creek, the depressions were used for processing the abundant resources which were restricted to the Post Oak Savannah and Bottomland Forest zones, and it seems quite reasonable that the inclusion of burials served as a means of laying claim to these critical plant collecting areas and favored hunting grounds. The absence of cemeteries during the Early and Middle Archaic periods in North Central Texas lends additional support to this interpretation, since these periods were characterized by low populations with increased residential mobility, and presumably, little conflict over available resources. SUMMARY Conclusions have been presented throughout this chapter concerning the usefulness of the Wylie focus concept for under- standing the prehistory of North Central Texas, and the origin and functions of the large pit features associated with the focus. In addition, a new hypothesis regarding use of these features has been proposed which considers their role within the entire cultural system of Late Archaic hunter-gatherers. The major points of these discussions are summarized here. First of all, the concept of the Wylie focus is obsolete and should no longer be used for the classification of sites in North Central Texas. The complex of identifying traits associated with the Wylie focus, as defined by Stephenson (1952a), is very broad and mixes artifact types that are now known to represent both Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations. The Wylie focus sites were originally assigned to a temporal frame of A. D. 1300 to 1600 (Stephenson 1952a), and later were pushed back as early as A. D. 900 (Lynott 1977:236). Lynott also proposed a preceramic , phase of the Wylie focus based on work at the Sister Grove Creek” site. This expanded time frame, in combination with the broad complex of identifying traits, permits nearly any site found in North Central Texas to be included in the Wylie focus. As a result, its usefulness as a classificatory tool is dubious. In 1952, the Wylie focus concept was a welcome attempt to organize the accumulating data from two decades of investigations along the East Fork, but it has outlived its usefulness and now detracts from our under- standing of prehistory. Future research should avoid the use of this concept, The origins and purpose of the large man-made depressions observed at the sites along the East Fork have been the target of research since they were first reported. Several researchers have proposed a broad range of hypotheses regarding the nature of pit use including use as defensive structures, water storage structures, dance arenas, gaming areas, ceremonial centers, open-air council chambers, and ritual feasting areas. The gaming area hypothesis was merely a speculation based on the similarity in size and shape of these depressions to the ballcourts of the southwest and Meso- America,whereas the defensive structure hypothesis was derived from descriptions of historic period Wichita defensive structures (Wilbarger 1889). Other hypotheses, such as the ritual feasting hypothesis, were formulated on the basis of excavation data which revealed the presence of hearths and faunal remains. None of the hypotheses, however, adequately explained all of the phenomena associated with the large depressions, such as the presence of human burials along with food remains. Since little funding was Volume II, Part Three available for research at the East Fork sites, many questions were left unanswered. ‘The discovery of two similar large depressions along Richland Creek presented a new opportunity to study the origins and uses of these features. The Richland Creek excavations revealed that the artifacts, features, and stratigraphy observed in the depressions at Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch were similar to those found in the East Fork depressions. Thus, the Richland Creek sites appeared to be part of a cultural manifestation that extended up the East Fork and could therefore shed light upon the nature of the large depressions first noted along that drainage. The initial construction of these features was believed to have occurred around A. D. 900, based largely on a radiocarbon date from the Sister Grove Creek site (Lynott 1975). However, radiocarbon dates from the lowest layers in both of the Richland Creek depressions indicate that these features were first used during the Late Archaic period, perhaps as early as 170 B.C. at Bird Point Island, and by 200 A. D, at Adams Ranch. Since the radiocarbon date for the depression at the Sister Grove Creek site came from the south slope of the feature, rather than from the bottom, we believe that all of the large depressions may be much older than previously believed. Re-examining the numerous hypotheses concerning the utiliza- tion of these features was more problematical than assessing the proposed dates of their initial excavation and the chronology of fill episodes. Soils studies, artifact analysis, feature comparison, and osteological investigations were employed to examine the factors contributing to the original excavation and use of the large depressions along Richland Creek. The presence of fire cracked rock, baked clay, charred plant remains, and faunal remains in all layers of the features suggests that they had been used for the roasting of food. The presence of human burials documents the role of these features as cemeteries in addition to their economic role. At both of the Richland Creek sites with depressions, the number of interred individuals was greatest in the lowest layer of fill and decreased in the upper layers, reflecting 2 change in the importance of the mortuary function over time. The reasons for the development of the large depressions during the Late Archaic period are postulated to be tied to economic pressures associated with a population increase and a concomitant decrease in the territorial size of local bands. According to this new hypothesis, the features functioned as areas in which acoms, nuts, and Psoralea tubers were preserved by roasting during periods of seasonal macroband aggregation. Macroband aggregation would have occurred during the fall, when acorns and nuts were abundant, and again during the spring, when Psoralea tubers are harvested. In addition to cooperating in economic pusuits (e.g., food collection and processing), the people shared in religious and social rituals during these seasonal coalescences. Ritual feasting and exchange of goods served to reinforce social ties to neighboring bands; these social bonds served to reduce the potential risk associated with future resource failure. That is, bands experiencing temporary food shortages could rely on allied bands living in more productive territories to provide assitance. The inclusion of human burials within the depressions served to legitimize the band’s claim to the land, and to the important food resources produced on that land. We do not claim to have solved the enigma of the large depressions as a result of the Richland Creek work. Obviously, final solutions are rarely achieved in archaeology since many important cultural variables affecting human behavior leave few or no material traces in the archaeological record. Rather, this study has examined the facts and presented a new hypothesis which, we believe, more completely encompasses the data and attempts to explain the features within a behavioral framework. Hopefully, this hypothesis will stimulate the development of even more refined hypotheses.

UNIT NUMBERING SYSTEM FOR BIRD POINT ISLAND William A. Martin —_— This appendix presents the reader with an explanation of the numbering system for units at the Bird Point Island site. For a variety of reasons, the numbering system does not follow consecutively from 1 through 5771, as one might expect. Instead, gaps are present between biocks of unit numbers. Although this system may appear confusing to the reader, it was devised to avoid duplication in numbering and to provide a logical framework of numerical designation, The gap between the last unit excavated during testing (Unit 30) and the first unit dug during Season I (Unit 88) is the result of a change in excavation strategy during Season I. As previously mentioned, a larger block was planned prior to the initiation of field work than was actually excavated. Units 31 through 87 were laid out on paper, surrounding Feature 1, but the complexity of the excava- tion within the pit did not allow time for their excavation. Instead, only units directly inside the pit were chosen for excavation. Gaps were intentionally left in the sequence of unit numbers during Seasons IT, III, and IV to serve as mnemonic devices assisting the recall of a given unit’s size and the season in which it was dug. For example, 1X1 m units excavated during Season II began with Unit 150 and continued consecutively through Unit 315. These units were easily distinguished from units excavated during previous seasons which had only two digit designations. By the same measure, 50X50 cm units were distinguished from 1><1 m units by using four digit designations beginning with 1001 and ending with 1395. This was a useful distinction when examining computer printouts of artifact data because the specific types of units involved could be determined without referring to maps or field notes. During Season II, 1X1 m units in the block excavation over House | began with Unit 320 rather than 316. Because excavation in by House 1 and Feature 1 were conducted simultaneously, the units in Feature 1 were labeled 401-404 to avoid accidental mixing of pro- veniences from the two areas at the waterscreen or in the laboratory. Although few problems were experienced with the mixing of proveniences, it was considered wise to minimize the chances of accidental mixing of wheelbarrow loads by using 300 series and 400 series numbers. Of course, the use of these distinctive designations also aided the recognition of artifacts from each area when scanning computer printouts. Season [II 50X50 cm units began with Unit 4001 and ended with Unit 5771 which easily distinguished them from Season IT 50X50 cm units. The strict separation of unit designation according to unit size was not adhered to for Units 405-451 because the majority of these designations were assigned to the halves of features removed for processing regardless of the volume excavated. The exceptions to this procedure were Units 411-418 which were 1X1 m units dug in | Feature 45 and Units 423-434 which were 1X.5 m units dug in Feature 38. Although the numbering system is somewhat unorthodox, it actually promoted efficiency during the later stages of the Project when questions about specific units arose. On the basis of the unit number alone, the kind of unit in question and the season in which it was dug were known, which immediately narrowed the selection of notes and records to be searched for answers. Since nearly 600 pages of field notes, hundreds of pages of level forms, and dozens of maps and computer printouts were compiled over the course of four field seasons, the ability to move directly to the pertinent records servedto reduce the work load and increase efficiency. 287

MUN YQaYQQOaquy om a) A wwe ww oo wna nA n Qo Wow FROTH FLOTATION Michael Pendleton Flotation is a basic technique which facilitates the recovery of small and fragile materials from soil samples obtained from archaeo- logical sites. In order to separate such items as plant remains, small bones, fish scales, and insect parts from their soil matrix using the flotation technique, a sample must be immersed within a fluid. Compared to dry screening through quarter-inch size mesh, flotation is fifty times as effective for the recovery of plant remains in quantity (Munson, Parmalee, and Yarnell 1971:421). FROTH FLOTATION DEVICE OPERATION A froth flotation device (patent pending), similar in general opera- tion to a recovery unit described by Jarman, Legge, and Charles (1972:39), is utilized for the recovery of delicate botanical remains from soil samples taken at the Richland Project (Figure D-1). Letter designations in the following discussion refer to Figure D-1. The froth flotation method relies on the lifting action of air bubbled through a submerged soil sample within a fluid medium to facilitate the separa- tion of small plant parts from their soil matrix. Bubbles of air are formed within the fluid by the passage of compressed air through sintered bronze flange cones. The cones are fixed to a rigid network of plastic tubing (f) which directs compressed air through the cones and into the flotation fluid held within a polypropylene plastic tank (a). During flotation, this rigid tubing, or bubbler, is lowered to the bottom of the fluid filled tank and compressed air, supplied by a portable compressor, is forced through the bubbler’s flange cones. If desired, 9 mm of Aerofroth 65 (registered by the American Cyanamid Corporation) frother chemical and 2 mm of kerosene are placed into the flotation tank fluid prior to the addition of sample soil to the bubbling liquid. Additional water is constantly added to the tank fluid through the connection provided at the tank drain cap. The by upward force of water from the base of the flotation tank churns settled material back up toward the bubbling liquid. A screen, which is attached to the bubbler, covers the tank drain hole (b) during flota- tion processing and prevents material from falling below the zone of effective frothing activity within the tank. The additional fluid and materials separated from the soil sample within the tank overflow along the tank’s upper edge and are channeled into a trough. Both fluid and materials are guided by a trough (c) into a series of screens (d) to facilitate later analysis by size differentiation. A propellor agi- tator (e) is placed beneath the screen series to break up any build-up of silt which impedes the flow of water through these screens. Water directed through small holes in the agitator causes a rotation of the propellor which interrupts the water stream and effectively breaks up the silt layer on the screen series. After the flotation process is com- pleted (usually after 20 minutes per 9.5 1 of sample soil), the bubbler is raised along with the screen at the base of the tank in order to facili- tate efficient tank draining. Following the removal of the tank’s drain pipe cap, fluid flowing out of this pipe may be screened to recover materials which have settied to the bottom of the tank during flota- tion processing. Materials collected on screens are placed on news- papers to dry for analysis. Certain problems in froth flotation processing were encountered at the Richland/Chambers Project. For example, the hard water used in the flotation tank caused a deposit of minerals to form on the sintered bronze cones attached to the bubbler. As suggested by Jarman, Legge, and Charles (1972:44), a periodic immersion of the bubbler in weak acetic acid cleaned the bronze cones and allowed the unit to operate effectively. Since a gauge was attached to the pressur- ized air line from the compressor to the bubbler, an abnormally high pressure reading of this gauge indicates the need for acetic acid treat- ment of the bubbler before any mineral deposit hinders efficient frothing activity. 291

COMPARISONS OF FROTH FLOTATION TO TUB FLOTATION Prior to the processing of soil samples by froth flotation at the Richland Project, the recovery efficiencies of tub and froth flotation were compared by experiments performed at California State University, Chico. These experiments utilized over 1500 carbon- ized seeds divided into matched samples (Pendleton 1979; 1980; 1983). Ten types of seeds commonly available in any garden supply store were chosen for these experiments. Such seeds, if carbonized, Volume II, Appendix D placed into a soil matrix and processed by a flotation device, provide a standard of recovery efficiency for the device for more than one kind of seed. For the tub flotation processing in these experiments, a large washtub was utilized which has its bottom replaced by a fine screen described by Struever (1968:353). The tub, into which the soil sample is placed, is partially submerged in a river, stream, or other large body of water until its screened bottom is one inch below the water’s surface. Both silt and dirt are washed away from the sample by agitating and rotating the partially submerged tub, at which time a second operator, using a small tea strainer or screen mesh scoop, skims off material on the surface or in suspension in the fluid within the tub. The agitation and skimming processes are continued until the fluid within the tub appears clear. The recovered materials from the strainers or scoops (the light fraction) and the residue on the screen within the tub (the heavy fraction) are then placed on news- paper to dry for analysis. The results (shown in Table D-1) of experimental tests of the efficiency of recovery for tub and froth flotation (Pendleton 1979; 1980; 1983) imply that, for the light fraction (which includes only those materials which are caught in the tub flotation scoops or are channelled into the screen series during froth flotation), froth recovers a more representative non-floating seed species assemblage than does tub flotation. The two non-buoyant carbonized seed species tested are recovered in significantly greater percentages (significance levels of .01) by the froth flotation method for light fraction materials. For the eight species of buoyant carbonized seed species tested, four species are recovered in greater percentages by the tub method while the other four species are recovered in greater percentages by the froth flotation method. For the buoyant car- bonized seed species tested, the range of recovery for the tub method is 24 to 100 percent, while the recovery range is 62 to 96 percent for the froth method. The greater minimum recovery percentages noted for froth flotation imply that a more representative assemblage of carbonized seed species (especially non-buoyant types) is obtained in the light fraction by utilizing froth flotation rather than tub flotation methods. This advantage suggests that froth flotation is an appropriate method of recovery for botanical materials from soil samples taken at the Richland/Chambers Project.

ar @ IERIE BEES Eee wee ee FLOTATION METHODOLOGY FLOTATION DEVICE The flotation device substituted for the froth flotation device was a 50 gallon barrel which had been modified by adding a flotation chamber, an overflow valve and an overflow chute. The flotation chamber was a 5 gallon bucket which was attached to the top of the barrel. A 6.4 mm screen rested on the bottom of the chamber. The overflow chute was designed to carry the float material from the flotation chamber into a series of screens (Nos. 6, 10, and 12). The overflow valve is connected to the barrel and was used to control the water level within the flotation chamber. FLOTATION PROCESS The flotation samples were pre-soaked to aid the breakdown of the soil matrix. No chemicals were used for deflocculation. While in operation, the barrel was filled with water until overflowing. The flotation sample was slowly added to the running watér above the heavy fraction screen within the flotation chamber. A garden hose provided the pressure needed to churn the sample within the flotation chamber. Once the soil had been broken down by the churning water and manual stirring, the overflow valve was closed. This resulted in the gradual rise of the water level in the flotation chamber until it reached the overflow chute which directed the water and floated remains through a set of three by Duane E. Peter screens (light fraction). This process continued for 20 minutes. At the end of that time, the overflow valve was opened, the water drained off, and the heavy and light fraction screens were dumped onto newspaper for drying. FLOTATION SORTING Once the fractions dried, they were sorted by means of screening and hand picking of the materials retained by each screen size. Initially, the heavy fraction was sifted through a 6.4 mm screen and all materials remaining on the screen were sorted and bagged. The material that passed through the screen was sifted through a smaller mesh screen (2 mm), and all macrobotanical, charcoal, stone, shell, and bone remains were bagged separately. All material, except stone, less than 2 mm in diameter was bagged and sent to the macrobotanical specialist. The light fraction material was contained within three samples: 1) 3.35 mm, 2) 1.7 mm, and 3) .85 mm. The largest of the light fraction samples was initially sifted through a 6.4 mm screen to remove grass stems and roots. The material that passed through this screen was then sifted through a 2 mm screen and sorted. Everything less than 2 mm in diameter from this sample and the smaller screen samples (1.7 and .85 mm) was sent to the macrobotanical analyst for examination without any preliminary sorting.

BIRD POINT ISLAND CHARCOAL ANALYSIS Richard G. Holloway During Season I, 26 samples of charcoal were recovered from Units 89-92 in Feature 1 at Bird Point Island and sent to Texas A&M University for analysis. A few of the samples were sub- samples of those used for radiocarbon dating, but the majority were derived from either archaeological features or from the soil matrix of Feature 1 fill. In the absence of other paleo- environmental indicators only tentative correlations may be proposed. METHODS AND MATERIALS Charcoal, when immediately removed from its depositional environment, is extremely difficult to identify. The vessels and tracheids are often clogged with soil, debris which obscures identification. Thus, it is imperative to obtain clean, clear sections for identification. Thin-sectioning is often thought to be of particular value but this is usually not the case. Embedding the specimen is time- consuming and, often, the results are less than desired due to the nature of the substance (carbon). Additionally, during sectioning, the likelihood of crushing the vessel and tracheid walls is increased, thereby rendering identification more difficult, if not impossible. To avoid the problem, I have used a modification of Leney and Casteel's (1975) method in which a clean exposed transverse surface is produced with minimal damage to cellular structure. The major drawback to the utilization of this method is that the break is often not exactly even, which presents difficulties in photomicrography, especially at higher magnifications. The ease and rapidity of specimen preparation, however, offers compensation for the difficulties. Identification of charcoal or wood is based on comparisons of morphological similarities of structural elements within the by xylem. In most cases, a transverse (cross-sectional) view is all that is necessary for identification. In specific cases, however, a radial or tangential section may be required to separate genera of the same family (e.g., Salix and Populus) (Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980). While it is often possible to identify the genus level, species identifications are tenuous, if not impossible, especially using light microscopy. Some groups interbreed and hybridize so readily that it is only with extreme caution that identifications below the genus level should be attempted. The variation between species is usually so slight that these differences can more readily be explained by edaphic and climatic factors than by actual species differences. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Results of the charcoal identifications are presented in Table F- 1. For ease of comparison these samples have been arranged by their stratigraphic position within soil zones and secondarily by units. Salix remains were recovered only once, from a sample located in the plow zone. Given the proximity of Bird Point Island to a watercourse (Richland Creek), the presence of this taxon is quite understandable. Salix was probably located within the riparian vegetational community close to the water source. The distribution of Ulmus charcoal is extremely interesting. Ulmus charcoal was identified only from samples recovered in Zones 1. Zone 1 material was radiocarbon dated between A.D. 1280 + 110 and A.D. 1510+ 60 with a mean date of A.D. 1380. On the basis of the limited charcoal samples which have been analyzed and the distribution of Ulmus remains, I suspect that somewhat more mesic conditions were present, at least locally, Starting some time within the last 600 years. Ulmus presently grows within the area (Fowells 1965) and in the more southerly 295

Its presence so near to a watercourse is not Volume II, Appendix F surprising, but rather expected. However, its absence from the lower zones may indicate its local absence earlier than A.D. 1380 Thus, its absence from these earlier zones may suggest somewhat more arid conditions prior to A.D. 1380. This interpretation is very tentative for the moment. Comparisons with regional and local pollen sequences and additional charcoal analyses are required to solidify this interpretation. Comparisons with palynological records is sometimes tenuous because of the differences between data bases. However, particular attention should be paid to the upper segments of pollen columns which might indicate mesic conditions to test this initial interpretation. The types of charcoal recovered from Zones 2 and 3 are all types which can be found locally at the present. For the most part these are Quercus (oak) and Carya (hickory), and in lesser amounts Juniperus (juniper). As explained elsewhere, identification of Quercus charcoal as well as that of the other taxa beyond the generic level is extremely tenuous. The size of the sample and the fragmentary nature of many of these specimens preclude the possibility of finer division. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of 26 charcoal specimens from Bird Point Island revealed charcoal of taxa currently found growing in the immediate area. There are some preliminary indications of a shift _ to more mesic conditions occurring sometime after A.D. 1380 These preliminary indications are only tentative and must await subsequent additional data for their substantiation.
