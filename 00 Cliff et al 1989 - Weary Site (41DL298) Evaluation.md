MANAGEMENT SUMMARY A cultural resources survey of the proposed 33-acre Weary Site was conducted for the County of Dallas in order to locate any cultural resource properties which might be affected by the development of the site as a park. Such an assessment is required of Dallas County under the Texas Antiquities Code. The survey was conducted on August 4, 1989, by Dr. Maynard Cliff and Mr. Steven Hunt of Geo- Marine, Inc. (GMI). The ground cover was generally open except in wooded areas, which had a denser vegeeaiion. Shovel testing was conducted in perceived areas of high probability for site occurrence. This intensive survey of the proposed park area resulted in the location of one cultural resources site and one prehistoric nonsite locality. The recorded site, 41DL298, while moderately extensive, is a low density prehistoric site which has suffered greatly through soil deflation. As a result, the site is considered to have no research potential and to be ineligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, it is felt that site 41DL298 should not be regarded as having any potential for becoming a State Archeological Landmark. As a result of these determinations, it is felt that site 41DL298 should not interfere with the plans for development of the Weary Site. iii

INTRODUCTION The Weary Site is the location for a proposed park development by the County of Dallas. The site is located in northeast Dallas County, northwest of the City of Garland. The project area is on the west bank of Spring Creek which is a tributary of Rowlett Creek within the East Fork of the Trinity River drainage (Figure 1). The intensive survey of the proposed project area, as required by the Texas Antiquities Code, was designed to locate cultural resource properties . which might be impacted by the project. The survey of the proposed park site was conducted by personnel of GMI. Duane Peter, Senior Archeologist of GMI, served as Principal Investigator. A literature and archival search was initially conducted to determine whether any recorded sites were present within the project area. Site records of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Southern Methodist University, and the Dallas Archeological Society were consulted. The records of this project are curated at the Institute of Applied Sciences, University of North Texas, Denton. The following report presents the environmental and archeological context of the project area, the survey methodology, and the results of the investigations.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND The Weary Site is located in northwestern Dallas County, on the south side of Spring Creek. Physiographically, the project area lies within the Blackland Prairie, an area bounded by the White Rock escarpment on the west and the East Texas Timber Belt on the east (Fenneman 1938:103). Geologically, the project area is underlain by the Cretaceous-age Austin Chalk formation which is made up of soft, white limestone which erodes to form a gently rolling topography in this area. In the eastern, westeum, and central portion of the project area eroded ridges or knobs of Austin Chalk have formed rises or hillocks overlooking the floodplain of Spring Creek. Surface soil in the project area falls within the Eddy-Stephen-Austin association, consisting of relatively thin, moderately alkaline soils on limestone bedrock. These soils generally support a woody vegetation, but are limited to sparse grass cover on the steeper slopes (Coffee et al. 1980:4). Dallas County is within the Texan biotic province as defined by Blair (1950). This is an intermediate zone between the forest of the Austoriparian and Carolinian provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits of their range in the Texan province. The vegetation within the project area is predominantly grassland, with scattered clusters and patches of trees. The largest area of trees is along Spring Creek and up a small, unnamed tributary on the western side of the project area. Grasses expected within this area include little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass, hairgrama switchgrass, Virginia wildrye, Torrey silver bluestem,

meadow dropseed, and buffalograss. Additionally, vine-mesquite, eastern gramagrass, plains lovegrass, Canada wildrye, cane bluestem, and southwestern bristlegrass are on the Spring Creek floodplain (Coffee 1980:88-90). The faunal community in this region has undergone changes due to the expansion of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. However, the species of wildlife which previously inhabited the area include bobwhite quail, pheasant, meadowlark, field sparrow, sage grouse, lark bunting, cottontail, red fox, antelope, and deer (Coffee 1980:50).

CULTURAL SETTING Three recent, major reports concerning the archeology of the Upper Trinity River Basin: An Assessment of the Cultural Resources in the Trinity River Basin: Dallas, Tarrant, and Denton Counties, Texas (Yates and Ferring 1986), Late Holocene Prehistory of the Mountain Creek Basin (Peter and McGregor 1988), and A Synthesis of Prehistory of the Lower Elm Fork of the Trinity River (Prikryl 1987); aptly summarize the history of archeological investigations within the Upper Trinity River dvaitiape and the culture-historical framework for the area, Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational archeologists have resulted in the recording of numerous sites, it is apparent that much research remains to be done. As noted by McGregor (1988:27-29), much of the excavation efforts within the Upper Trinity River Basin have focused on reservoir development, especially along the Elm Fork (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Skinner et al. 1982; Skinner and Baird 1985) and the East Fork (Ross 1966; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lynott 1975). Field school excavations by the University of .Texas at Arlington at the Northlake site on Grapevine Creek were also reported in the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975). More recent investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988; Jurney et al. 1988) and the test excavations of the River Bend site, 41TR68, (Peter et al. 1987) have provided the initial assemblage data necessary for an understanding of the adaptations along the West Fork of the Trinity River. The reservoir-related projects of the last three decades have not been the only sources of archeological data. The Dallas Archeological Society, and especially R.K. Harris, conducted numerous archeological investigations in the vicinity of

Dallas-Fort Worth. The East Fork of the Trinity River (Figure 2) was a primary focus for the early investigations of the DAS (Blair 1960; DAS 1965; Hanna 1940, 1941; Hanna and Harris 1948; Harris 1942, 1947, 1948a, 1948b, 1948c, 1948d, 1949, 1960; Harris et al. 1957; Hatzenbuehler 1942, 1948; Housewright and Wilson 1942; Housewright et al. 1947, 1948; Sollberger and Harris 1949; Wilson 1941, 1946, 1952). The DAS also conducted test excavations at two East Fork sites: the Raglan or Ragland site, 41KF4 (Hatzenbuehler 1942), and the Butler Hole site, 41COL2 (Housewright et al. 1947). As a result of this work, a house pattern was identified at the Butler Hole site, consisting of a series of postholes forming an elliptical-shaped outline, measuring about 4.1 mby 3.1m. A hearth feature was identified near the center of the structure and fragments of burned and shell-tempered daub was found along where the walls would have been. The structure has been associated with a Late Prehistoric occupation of the site although only Gary points were found in direct association. At about this same time, Wilson (1946) published an article first describing the large, circular depressions found at many of the larger sites along the East Fork, which were later to become known as "Wylie focus pits". Reservoir studies along the East Fork has included work at Lake Lavon and Lake Ray Hubbard (see Figure 2). Lake Lavon was surveyed in 1949 with test excavations being conducted at the Campbell Hole (41COL10) and Hogge Bridge (41COL1) sites (Stephenson 1949). Additional excavations conducted at the Hogge Bridge site resulted in the formal definition of the Wylie focus--a Late Prehistoric manifestation believed to be characterized by arrow points, flexed burials, large pits (often), and trade pottery from cultures to both the east

and west (Stephenson 1952). Additional excavations were carried out by SMU as a result of the planned enlargement of Lake Lavon (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lynott 1975). Lake Ray Hubbard was surveyed with the help of DAS members in 1963 (Harris and Suhm 1963) with excavations being carried out subsequently at the Glen Hill, 41RW4, and Upper Rockwall, 41RW2, sites (Ross 1966); and the Lower Rockwall site, 41RW1 (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968). Much of this work was concentrated on excavations at "Wylie focus pit" sites in an effort to better understand the function of these large depressions. Several small cultural resource management surveys have been conducted in recent years in Dallas County. In 1985, a cultural resources survey was conducted of a proposed 300-acre waste disposal site on Muddy Creek, northwest of Garland (Lee 1985). Four historic sites were discovered during this work, including two housesites and two abandoned roadways, but none were considered eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. In 1986, a survey of the Ten Mile Creek Preserve, a 46- acre tract near Lancaster, yielded no sites (Westbury 1986). Later in 1987, a survey of the Lancaster Municipal Golf Course resulted in the recording of six prehistoric and two historic sites (Sullivan 1987). In 1988, a survey prompted by road construction through the Little Bethel Cemetery in Duncanville yielded no sites (Westbury 1988). Survey of several sections of Ten Mile Creek in southeast Dallas County was conducted in 1988 in response to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans for channelization (Martin 1988; Peter 1989). A single tenant farmer's homesite (41DL280) was the only site recorded. The relatively low number of sites found within these survey areas probably reflects both the lack of abundant resources within the upland prairie environment which would attract

human habitation, especially during the prehistoric period, and the impact of modern development. West of the East Fork of the Trinity River, R.K. Harris located and recorded seven prehistoric sites within a radius of about six miles of the project area (Harris n.d.). One was located on Spring Creek, two on Rowlett Creek, and four on Duck Creek to the south (see Figure 2). Site 27A-3-17 was recorded by Harris as a surface site with pottery about one-half mile downstream from the project area. The two sites on Rowlett Creek (27A-3-3 and 41DL203) were recorded on either side of the creek, about 1.25 mi downstream from its confluence with Spring Creek. One (27A-3-3) was recorded as a surface pottery site, while the other (41DL203) was a nonpottery site, possibly dating to the Archaic period. To the south of the project area, along Duck Creek, Harris recorded three nonpottery sites (27A-3-5, 27A-3-8, and 27A-3-13) and one quarry site (27A-3- 4). As a result of this, the project area was felt to have a good potential for containing prehistoric archeological material. Several human burials were reported by an informant to have been uncovered south of Spring Creek at the time that Holford Road was built in the 1930s (James Caldwell, personal communication: September 26, 1989). These remains are reported to have consisted of two individuals, extended in rectangular graves, with no burial furniture present. The graves were reported to be about halfway between Spring Creek and the present fire station to the southwest along Holford Road - a distance of about 400 m. This would put the graves about 200 m from the creek and about 100 m southwest of the Weary Site. The shape of the grave

pits and the lack of any aboriginal material at all suggests that these were historic graves - probably of Anglo- or Afro-American affiliation. Prehistoric Chronological Framework Although the chronological framework for the Upper Trinity River Basin is not well developed, the available data allow the delineation of a generalized chronology (Table 1). Recent investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have provided evidence for a refinement of the chronology for the Late Prehistoric period, but the overall regional applicability of the phases recognized at Joe Pool Lake remains to be demonstrated. Prikryl (1987) has presented a chronological construct which recognizes a sequence of six periods. Unfortunately, his sequence relies almost totally on diagnostic artifacts from surface contexts and comparisons to dated contexts distant from the Upper Trinity River Basin. The generalized chronology presented here reflects the present state of knowledge as interpreted from the Joe Pool Lake investigations. A brief summary of the adaptations associated with these periods is presented below. a Table 1. Chronological Framework for the Upper Trinity River Basin (after Peter and McGregor 1988) i Paleo-Indian ca. 11,000 - 6,000 B.C.

The Paleo-Indian occupation of the Upper Trinity River Basin is known primarily through diagnostic projectile points from surface collections orf stratigraphically mixed contexts. The Field Ranch site (Jensen 1968), along the upper Elm Fork, is a primary example of typical site contexts. Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear Creeks in the Cross Timbers. The Lewisville Lake site (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961) is the best known Paleo-Indian site within the region. While the original radiocarbon dates (ca. 37,000 B.P.) contributed to the significance of the site, more recent work (Stanford 1981) has resolved the controversy concerning the date of the occupation. It appears that the presence of naturally occurring lignite as either a fuel in these hearths or an inadvertent inclusion contaminated the radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually accepted date of 12,000-10,000 B.P. for Clovis-period occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human occupation of North Central Texas. However, our knowledge of the settlement-subsistence strategies used by these early occupants is extremely limited. Whether these people focused on the hunting of now extinct, big game species or had adopted a more generalized foraging subsistence system remains to be documented. Our knowledge of the Archaic period in the Upper Trinity River drainage is limited by the lack of data from major excavations. This is particularly true for the Early and Middle Archaic periods. Recent investigations along the West Fork (Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986) indicate that primary contexts for Early and Middle Archaic sites will be found deeply buried within floodplain alluvium. Artifacts from these periods are found on terrace surfaces, but they are frequently mixed with later materials. In fact, the initial 11

treatment of the Archaic period (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the Carrollton and Elam foci, was based upon materials from such terrace contexts. Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer recognized as being acceptable for North Central Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987; Yates and Ferring 1986). Recent investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and the continuing work at Lake Ray Roberts indicate that the Late Archaic period is characterized by assemblages left by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a locality for a limited time period and then moved to another locality. These sites were apparently reoccupied numerous times on a seasonal basis. Deer and numerous small mammals were the primary food resources. The documentation of large pits associated with Late Archaic period sites in the Richland/Chambers Creek drainage (Bruseth and Martin 1987) suggests that important sociopolitical changes may have been occurring during this time period. Unfortunately, the significance of these pits remains an enigma despite their excellent documentation. The beginnings of the Late Prehistoric period in the Upper Trinity River Basin is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points. The date of A.D. 700 for this period is based upon dated contexts to the west in the Brazos River drainage. Lynott (1977) suggests that the Late Prehistoric period may be divided into an early and late phase. The early phase is characterized by sand and grog tempered ceramics, Scallorn and Alba arrow points, and a continuation of the foraging subsistence system of the Late Archaic period. The late phase reflects a Southern Plains influence with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the 12

Henrietta focus, various unstemmed triangular points (e.g., Fresno, Harrell, Washita), and the Perdiz point. Evidence of horticulture and the procurement of bison also appears in sites of this period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). Prikryl's (1987) recent assessment of the Late Prehistoric period largely follows that of Lynott (1977). Recent investigations of the Cobb-Pool site at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have resulted in a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb- Pool site has yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late twelfth or early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time. Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive change remains to be documented. Historical documentation and archeological evidence are very sparse for the Protohistoric period in the Upper Trinity River Basin, Tonkawa, Wichita, Caddo, and Comanche all are likely to have traversed the area. However, exact locations of their sites and detailed ethnohistoric data are almost nonexistent. Although European trade items (Sollberger 1953) appear on a limited number of sites, no protohistoric site has been thoroughly investigated and characterizations of the Native American adaptations during this time period are conjectural at best. 13

A lack of documentary evidence, together with a lack of interest among ethnologists and archeologists, have contributed to this situation. Historic Occupation/Utilization The pressure of the westward movement of Anglo-American settlers displaced numerous Native Americans from their homelands to the north and east of North Central Texas. Delaware, Chickasaw, Waco, Cherokee, Shawnee, Caddo, and Kichai sought refuge in North Central Texas. Skirmishes and raids were frequent in the 1830s and it was not until 1843 that Sam Houston, President of the Republic of Texas, met with the Indian tribes at the abandoned Bird's Fort in nearby Tarrant County and signed a peace treaty. Captain Jonathan Bird and a small group of settlers had attempted to establish the first Anglo-American settlement in the area in 1840; however, the fort was abandoned by the spring of 1842. Apparently the lack of supplies and difficulty of communicating with the settlements in Northeast Texas contributed to this abandonment. However, by 1845 the influx of settlers, enticed by commercial land development enterprises such as the Peters’ Colony, resulted in the movement of the frontier farther west. By 1850 the city of Dallas had become the county seat of Dallas County and had developed into a mercantile center because of its position on the Trinity River. Population and commercial growth continued into the 1860s when the Civil War had a dramatic effect on both the population and their business enterprises. By the mid-1870s, however, the area had become a major distribution center for buffalo hides and a marketing center for cotton (Reese et al. 1986:164). Cotton farming became the major agricultural activity within the rich Blackland Prairie 14

surrounding the project area. The tenant farming system which developed following the Civil War is clearly evident in this area, for most of the structures on the Sam Street's Map of 1900 are tenant homes rather than those of owners. The economy of the area was largely dependent upon agriculture until the turn-of-the-century when the railroad and the discovery of oil significantly affected the economy and market accessibility of the area. Although the immediate area surrounding the project area remained rural in character until after World War II, urban expansion is rapidly changing both the landscape and the way of life of local residents. 15

SURVEY METHODOLOGY A literature and archival search was initially conducted to determine whether any sites were known to exist within the project area. The site files at the Texas Archeology Research Laboratory, University of Texas at Austin and the Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University were consulted, as well as a map of sites recorded by R.K. Harris and the DAS within Dallas County (Harris n.d.). No sites were found to occur within the project area. The intensive on-the-ground survey was conducted by traversing the project area (Figure 3) using transects at 20-meter intervals in open grassy areas and 10- meter intervals in denser wooded areas. Shovel testing was conducted in areas of perceived high probability for site occurrence, Finally, all cut bank areas along Spring Creek on the northern edge of the project area were examined. All project area boundaries were well delineated. 16

SURVEY RESULTS One archeological site was located in the project area. Site 41DL298 is a prehistoric site of unknown age. In addition to this, one prehistoric locality was located. Site 41DL298 Site 41DL298 is roughly in the center of the project area on top of a small rise on a bedrock ridge which projects into the Spring Creek floodplain (Figure 4). This rise overlooks both Spring Creek and a small intermittent drainage to the west. Site elevation is between 5 and 10 ft (1.5-3 m) above the floodplain and at an elevation of 524 ft (159.7 m) amsl. The site is covered predominantly by sparse grasses and occasional stands of trees. The stratigraphy on the site ranges from a thin but present A-horizon with underlaying decayed limestone bedrock to highly deflated areas where the A-horizon has been completely removed. The site is located on Eddy clay loam, 3 to 8% slopes: a very shallow to shallow, well drained, gently sloping to sloping soil overlying the Austin Chalk geological formation (Coffee et al. 1980:20). The site was originally reported to the field crew by the present landowner, Ms. Ann Weary, who has collected on the site. Investigation of this area revealed a very small number of quartzite flakes and fire cracked rock visible on the surface. A large quantity of recent historic material, including glass, ceramics, and tin cans was also visible on the surface. Four shovel tests were excavated at the site. Unit depths varied between 7 and 20 cm, and generally 18

revealed highly deflated soils. The sole exception to this was Shovel Test 4, at the eastern edge of the site. This was on a small bench which had not suffered from deflation. A small dirt farm road cuts through the western edge of the site. In view of the massive deflation present elsewhere at the site, this road has had little impact upon the site’s integrity. Artifact Assemblage A total of four flakes, one piece of fire-cracked rock, and several sandstone cobbles were observed on the surface of the site. No artifacts were recovered from any of the shovel tests. In view of the minuscule number of artifacts remaining at site 41DL298 and their debatable context, none of these artifacts were collected. Locality 1 Locality 1 is another area reported to the field crew by Ms. Weary. This area is on a small knoll immediately north of Holford Road. Two artifacts, a chert core fragment and a possible quartzite flake, were located in the dirt road (see Figure 3). No artifacts were observed outside this road although ground surface visibility was good and three shovel tests were excavated in the area. This area has apparently suffered less deflation than site 41DL298 and two of the three shovel tests showed a thin but intact A-horizon. The area nearest Holford Road appears to have had gravel dumped on it at some point, and this is believed to be the origin of the core fragment at Locality 1. 20

RECOMMENDATIONS The intensive survey of the proposed 33-acre Weary Site development project resulted in the location of one culture resource property. This property, prehistoric site 41DL298, is not regarded as eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, nor is it considered to have any potential as a State Archeological Landmark. As such, site 41DL298 will not prevent the proposed development of the Weary Site. It is currently our understanding that the Weary Site development project will not involve any subsurface disturbance of intact deposits. Current park development plans call for the majority of the park to consist of meadow areas - to be used for free play (see Figure 3). Facilities planned for construction consist only of: (1) a soft surface (i.e., pea gravel or wood pulp) hiker’s trail, located on the floodplain of Spring Creek, following the creek around the eastern and northern edge of the park; and, (2) approximately three to four picnic tables placed on 10 x 10 foot concrete pads on the high ground west of the site 41DL298 area (see Figure 3). Current plans call for neither the hiker’s trail nor the picnic tables to be placed on either the area of site 41DL298 or Locality 1, and representatives of both the Dallas County Parks and Open Space Administration and the City of Garland Parks Department have given assurances that no other developments are 21

currently planned for the park area, and what is planned will not disturb any subsurface materials (Mary Phinney, personal communication: September 1, 1989; Jim Stone, personal communication: September 11, 1989). In the future, should plans be developed for more extensive construction involving subsurface disturbance, it is recommended that the possibility for buried cultural resources be investigated with a program of backhoe testing. Projects elsewhere in the upper Trinity River Basin have demonstrated the presence of recent slinyaiom up to 1.0 m thick covering cultural resource sites (Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986), and the alluvial stratigraphy along Spring Creek shows 4 to 4.5 m of alluvial deposits in which earlier cultural resources may be buried. 22

CULTURAL MANIFESTATIONS Site Size (estimate if necessary) At Present ca. 120 m NE-SW x 30 m NW-SE At Original Occupation unknown Basis for Determination limits of land- Artifactual Materials Present (kinds of materials, distribution across site, relationship to features, etc.) flakes, possible FCR, split quartzite pebble, historic ceramics, glass (clear form and surface artifacts brown and blue bottle glass); flake found at Circumstances of Observation hot, sunny afternoon erest of hill and along two-track road, Depth of Cultural Deposit surface only Basis for Determination no artifacts found by shovel testing Time Periods of Occupation (e.g., Prehistoric- Early Archaic; may be multiple) Prehistoric/Historic historic materials scattered throughout area with variable density, highest density also near crest of hill Discussion of Site (comments, observations, impressions) Site is situated on top of a rise jutting south toward Spring Creek. Components (refers to discreet occupations) Multiple (Yes) (No) (Yes) (No) Single (Yes) (No) Unknown Basis for Determination artifacts Intermittant drainage to west, Spring Creek floodplain to east. Top of rise heavily deflated, where soil is still present it is shallow and full of eroded bedrock. Top of rise has light scatter of prehistoric observed Site Type (e.g., open campsite, military post, rockshelter) possible open campsite/dump or recent activity area Cultural Features (If present, describe; e.g., burned rock midden, hearth, structural remains; how do they relate to components, time periods, how many are there, physiography ; spatial distribution, size, contents, etc. N/A $$$ artifacts-formerly much greater but Additional Comments collectors have removed most of remains. Site may have been temporary camp or logistical site. There is also a dense scatter of historic materials including bottle glass (clear, brown and cobalt blue flattened tin cans and a few historic ceramics. These artifacts appear to have been dumped in the site area. Based on the very small prehistoric materials observed, the very deflated condition of the site and the lack of any further research potential, the site is considered not significant for inclusion on the National Register
