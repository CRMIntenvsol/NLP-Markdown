Prehistoric Land Use at Amistad National Recreation Area, Val Verde County, Texas: Report on the Texas Archeological Society 1999 Field School Jack G. Johnson and Angel Stuewe Johnson ABSTRACT Low water levels in the Amistad reservoir during the summer of 1999 allowed access to many sites that are typically inundated. The National Park Service and the Texas Archeological Society teamed up, taking advantage of this situation, to document and record as many new sites within the park as possible and to relocate and assess impacts to known sites. Work performed included surface survey and collection, exca- vation at selected sites, and rock art recording. Of the sites examined, 41VV661 with its Late Prehistoric ceramics, and the expansive hearth fi eld of 41VV1207, proved most signifi cant and accordingly receive the most attention in this article. We report on the procedures and fi ndings of the 1999 Field School investiga- tions and integrate that information into a broader look at land use patterns across the area now encompassed by Amistad National Recreation Area. PROJECT OVERVIEW at ANRA, a variety of research goals could be pursued simultaneously. Thus, not only was new Amistad National Recreation Area (ANRA) information generated about the area’s prehistory, is located at the heart of the Lower Pecos archeo- helping the NPS to better manage its archeological logical region, encompassing the lower parts of sites and cultural resources, but fi eld school par- the Pecos and Devils rivers where they fl ow into ticipants received experience in a range of different the Rio Grande west of Del Rio in Val Verde kinds of investigations in a diversity of settings.

2 Texas Archeological Society waterholes are not uncommon. Trees such as oaks, mesquite, little leaf walnuts, and native pecans (Dering 2005:247) live in the shelter of towering canyon walls. The rolling uplands above are covered with acacias, Texas persimmon, desert hackberry, prickly pear cactus, yucca, sotol, and lechugilla (Dering 2005: 247). While the brush that now cover this part of the landscape has been present in the area for millennia, their dominance today may be due primarily to historic and modern land use.

Johnson and Johnson—Prehistoric Land Use at Amistad National Recreation Area 15 Operation 3 Operation 3 covered the Cow Creek valley from lake level up to the NPS park boundary at the 1144.3 ft. amsl elevation. This area was reached by boat. The survey area included eight previously known sites: 41VV178, 41VV179, 41VV1656, 41VV1836-1838, 41VV1840, and 41VV1853.

The site form was updated, and seven units were laid out. Of the seven, fi ve were excavated: Unit 2 and Units 4-7. A feature (FX1) was identifi ed by an arc of rocks in Unit 4 and was found to extend into Units 5 and 7. FX1 had a basin shape with a diameter of approximately 1.2 m.

The site consists of two over- hangs. Overhang A contains well preserved feline and other motifs, including the large “Curly-tailed Panther,” other smaller panthers, and an anthropomorphic (human- shaped) fi gure. A grinding facet is present at the downstream end of the overhang. Overhang B contains several bold-line geo- metric motifs, including zigzags and pennants, one of the latter enclosed in a rectangular outline. Other designs present may be classifi ed with the Red Mono- chrome and Red Linear rock art styles. Figure 11. Curly-tailed Panther site, photo by Joe Labadie.

There is a mound of fl ood deposits, limestone, and burned rock at the entrance, which is 11 m across. Burned rock is eroding out of the dirt at the base of the shelter, and there is a possible hearth at the entrance to the shelter. Charcoal may be eroding from the earth wall at the back of the shelter, and several sharpening grooves are present on walls and boulders. A possible serpent-shaped petroglyph is also present here. Lithic debitage is present on the fl oor of the shelter, but no diagnostic artifacts were found. There is a hearth about 30 m to the southeast of the shelter. 41VV1887 This is an extensive FCR and lithic scatter measuring 50 (east-west) x 20 m (north-south), located on a ridgeline about 70 m from 41VV1886.

The following questions and objec- tives for excavations were established: (a) are the rocks on the surface a cultural feature? A hearth? Students concluded that for features 1, 2, and 3 the surface information was not enough to make an identification. In Feature 4, students could see burned rock in a loose circle, as well as a can, a metal fragment, and a burned lime fruit, sug- gesting a modern hearth used fairly recently; (b) has the area been disturbed? Students observed that the area had been mowed and that all around Figure 16. Excavation at 41VV1743 (San Pedro the area there were broken rocks, possibly from Campground).

The 1977 Texas Archeological Society Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site, 41EP4, El Paso County, Texas David G. Robinson, with contributions from John E. Dockall and William L. McClure ABSTRACT The 1977 Texas Archeological Society Field School investigated the Sabina Mountain Number Two site (41EP4), an El Paso phase village in far West Texas. Led by William J. Mayer-Oakes and staff of the Cultural Resources Institute of Texas Tech University, the fi eld school was designed as an educational fi eld course rather than a strict research enterprise. The approach to the site employed surface sampling strategies and subsurface remote sensing. Excavation was limited to sample unit excavations and clearing of discovered features. The off-site survey also took a sampling approach for purposes of site-settlement analysis. These methodologies constrained any fi ne-grained analyses of artifacts and features, but the broader patterns so identifi ed offer support for current models of prehistoric El Paso phase community and settlement patterns, arid lands agricultural strategies, and regional participation in social and economic networks. INTRODUCTION The 1977 fi eld school of the Texas Archeologi- cal Society (TAS) excavated the Sabina Mountain Number Two site (41EP4) in El Paso County, Texas. A regional sample survey accompanied the site excavations. The site is a small village of the El Paso phase of the Jornada Mogollon tradition. Conducted chiefl y as an educational project rather than a research investigation, the fi eld school was directed by the Cultural Resources Institute (CRI) of Texas Tech University (TTU), headed by Profes- sor William J.

Outside the rooms, surface collections were made with ref- erence to a 200 x 10 ft. site grid system placed over the heaviest surface concentrations of the site (Brook 1980:20). In addition to this large grid system, two smaller localized metric grid systems were emplaced over a trash pit feature and a rock circle for pur- poses of excavation. Excavation within these metric grids was by 10 cm levels (Brook 1980:42). Figure 2. Aerial view of the site during preparations for the 1977 fi eld school.

The fi rst was the surveying, recording, and collecting of defi ned travel corridors within the site (Figure 3). This effort mitigated the surface disturbance caused by the intensive foot-traffi c of the large crew of site researchers. The second on-site sur- vey category was non-corridor surface recording and collecting. Society members collected open surfaces by 1 m square collection units in addition to the corridor samples.

Other excavators reported were Room 2 (Brook 1980:26-27) and Room 3 removing backfi ll; therefore, the room deposit (Brook 1980:28-29). The investigators observed situation remains uncertain. The room’s general and recorded additional fragmentary architectural location was given as 120N 27E. Room 2 was remains and constructed features in the numer- off-square in plan (Brook 1980:26-27), forming a ous surface collection units at the site.

This situation was offered in excavation The material of the walls was not described, but notes to explain the lack of any prepared fl oor when puddled adobe or adobe blocks are ubiquitous on the site. It is probable that fi eld note takers assumed that this material was used, as wall materials were never described in any excavation notes. Photographs show adobe to be the common building material. The walls lacked any features such as niches for storage or seating of roofi ng elements. A hearth or fi ring area was identifi ed along the center of the south wall; this fi nd was made within a few hours of the end of the fi eld school. Understandably, efforts focused on clearing the feature, but a description of the hearth/fi ring area and its composition is lacking, and it was not drawn on the room plan. Its location along the center of the south wall is in common with the hearth in Room 3 and with other regional Puebloan dwellings (Brook 1980:27). Room 3 Room 3 was located at the 135N 27E grid point, and the structure retained much of its back- fi ll. Excavators uncovered the wall lines readily but failed to describe them. Puddled adobe and limestone blocks are the presumed building materi- als, based on their presence elsewhere on the site.

The doorways sit slightly west of the center point of their respective walls, but they are offset with respect to each other. The south doorway was hard to discern in the wall, but this effort was aided by the presence of a low step northward into the room. The north wall doorway also had a northward step, out of Room 3 or into a former contiguous room north of Room 3. A series of post holes along the west side of the room may have been part of an internal con- struction such as a jacal screen or turkey pen (Brook [1980:42] reported more than 300 pieces of eggshell from the excavated extramural pit feature. These may have been from turkey eggs). Two small post holes between the hearth and the south doorway may indicate supports for a wind- screen. The four larger post holes formed an approximate square in the middle of the room, indicat- ing they are the remains of the roof supports, perhaps implying a roof pattern of primary beams laid perpendicularly and parallel to the wall lines.

The 1991 and 1992 Texas Archeological Society Field School Excavations at the Fasken Site (41RR14), Red River County, Texas Daniel J. Prikryl, with contributions by Timothy K. Perttula and Nancy G. Reese ABSTRACT The 1991 and 1992 Texas Archeological Society Field School excavations at the Fasken Site (41RR14) in Red River County, Texas, provided signifi cant archeological data on the site’s chronological history and on two of its three Caddo mounds. A total of 52 features were recorded and 6,769 artifacts were recovered. The excavations also supplied materials for two radiocarbon and four Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR) dates. Excavations at Area A, on the terrace edge on the western periphery of the site, had the most intensive evi- dence of residential occupation. There, the largest numbers of lithic and ceramic artifacts were found along with daub and fi re-cracked rocks. The lithic assemblage from this locale includes some evidence of Late Archaic and Woodland period occupations. However, most of the cultural remains at Area A appear to date to the Formative Caddo period and the Middle Caddo Mound Prairie phase. Work at Area B was primarily focused on determining the construction sequence of Mound B, the second largest mound at the site. It appears that construction at the north end of the mound involved three separate events. The earliest construction episode raised the mound to almost 90 cm in height. Importantly, two OCR dates place this event after A.D. 939. A prepared yellowish-red clay cap appears to have been placed over sections of the northern and southern parts of the mound following the construction of this fi rst episode. A second construction episode at the north end of Mound B added another 35 cm to its height. An OCR age of approximately A.D. 1142 dates this construction to the early part of the Mound Prairie phase. There is good evidence that the surface of the second construction episode was again covered with a thin yellowish-red clay. A third construction episode is hypothesized to account for the remaining 35 cm thick deposit above this surface. It is in the upper 60 cm of deposits that the only appreciable numbers of artifacts were found. Diagnostics from this assemblage are primarily shell-tempered sherds of Late Caddo age and a few mid-19th century historic artifacts. Even later, the mound was the location of a late 19th century cotton gin. At Area C, the excavations showed that a slight 25 cm rise is a third Caddo mound (Mound C). Use of this mound apparently began with the erection of a number of structures with non-residential functions since almost no artifacts were found in the levels representing their surfaces. Numerous post holes were uncovered, including 11 that form the southeastern part of a sub-rectangular structure. Two calibrated radiocarbon dates from the living surfaces associated with the various post holes have age range from AD 1122-1242 and AD 1043-1188. These dates place the structures within the early part of the Mound Prairie phase. Following the use of the structures at Mound C, the area was purposely capped with a 7 to 10 cm thick red and orange clay. A 20 cm thick topsoil deposit that gradually accumulated above the clay cap was the living surface for other Mound Prairie phase peoples who left broken sherds of Sanders Engraved and Sanders Plain pottery and several arrow points of the Bonham type. Mixed in the with the Mound Prairie phase artifacts are some shell-tempered sherds suggesting a subsequent Late Caddo occupation. Texas Archeological Society Special Publication No. 5 (2008)

Prikryl—The 1991 and 1992 Field School Excavations at the Fasken Site 129 EXCAVATION METHODOLOGY While the above-mentioned research design issues constituted the ideal for excavations at the Fasken site, the fi eld work was planned with the realistic expectations of how much could be accomplished in two one- week field school sessions. For example, because of the enormous size of Mound A and the limited amount of time and effort that could be expended by the TAS Field School, no work Figure 2. The east side of Mound A. was undertaken on this mound. Instead, excavation of mound features focused on Mounds B and C, which are called Areas B and C, respectively. Limited excavations were also conducted at two other portions of the site, labeled as Areas A and D (see Figure 1). Additionally, a shovel testing program consisting of 50 x 50 cm units was undertaken to better define the boundaries of the site. Prior to the beginning of the 1991 field season an arbitrary grid system was established at the site based on a datum placed southwest of the site in the Red River fl oodplain. The datum was Figure 3. Mound C. labeled 0/0. All excavations were undertaken in areas north and east of this datum.

The third prepared clay fl oor, Feature 1, is a dis- continuous 2 cm thick yellowish-red clay lens that is FEATURE #50 visible in several units at the west end of Trench #2 at a depth of approximately 30 cm bs in Mound B. This clay lens probably represents a clay cap placed on the mound following the second construction episode. The poor preservation of this clay lens, in comparison to Features 3 and 16, is probably due to damage from plowing and land clearing. Extended Entranceway or Wall Trench Feature 35 is a 10 to 30 cm wide depression 50 cm in the N517/E501 and N518/E501 units that may represent the entryway to a structure associated with Feature 3.

No individual post hole stains were Structure post holes visible in the depression. Interestingly, these excava- tion units are part of a 2 x 2 m unit excavated for the purpose of locating post holes along the north edge of Feature 3. It was expected that if post holes were found, they would form an east-west alignment for a portion of the north wall of a structure. The fact that the depression has a north-south alignment sug- gests that it may be the entryway associated with the hypothesized structure. Aboriginal Artifacts Figure 15.

CONCLUSIONS Based on the results of two Texas Archeologi- cal Society (TAS) Field School excavation seasons at the Fasken site in 1991 and 1992, it appears that the site was principally utilized between ca. A.D. 900-1300, during the Formative Caddo and Middle Caddo (Mound Prairie phase) periods. 0 1 2 3 4 5 This assessment is based on the preponderance of ceramic sherds with grog and grit tempering (or CM these two temper agents in combination) and the Figure 19. 19th Century Artifacts from the Fasken Site: predominance of arrow point types such as Alba, top, decorated refi ned earthenwares and stoneware sherds; Bonham, Scallorn, and other mostly rectangular bottom: gunfl int, beads, and buttons. stemmed untyped fragments.

Prikryl—The 1991 and 1992 Field School Excavations at the Fasken Site 169 APPENDIX 2, LIST OF FEATURES Feature # Description 1 This feature was distinguished by scattered bits of yellowish-red clay lumps at depths ranging from 20 to 32 cm below ground surface (bs) in the N512/E500 and E501 units at Area B. These clay lumps probably represent a prepared clay fl oor that marked the top of the second construction episode on the north lobe of Mound B. In units further east and down slope, it is hypothesized that the clay fl oor has been more thoroughly disrupted by plowing so that the clay lumps are smaller and less evident. 2 Trash/storage pit at Area A in the N328/E425 and N329/E425 units. The pit is evident in levels 3 through 5 as darker fi ll in a 1.6 m diameter area. Pit fi ll in levels 1 and 2 has been disrupted by plowing. The feature fi ll contained a large volume of ceramics, lithic debitage, and daub. 3 A yellowish-red prepared clay fl oor that ranges from 12 cm thickness at the west end of north wall profi le of Trench #2 at the N512/E501 line at Mound B to only 4 cm thickness at the N513/ E501 line. Augering showed that the clay fl oor covers at 6.5 x 6.5 m area that extends from ap- proximately the N511 line to about the N517.5 line and from the E499 line to the E505.5 line. The yellowish-red clay appears to cap the fi rst construction episode on the north lobe of Mound B. 4 This post hole is in the west wall of the N695/E451 unit and extends from the Zone 1 topsoil down through the Zone 3 artifi cial clay cap into Zone 4B. The maximum recorded length of this post hole is 45 cm and its diameter is 15 cm. It may be associated with the aboriginal cultural remains in Zones 1and 2 or it could be a recent historic post hole dug for a fence. 5 This post hole is located in the N695/E451 unit and was recognizable from 45 to 65 cm bs. It had a diameter of 23 cm. 6 This post hole is located in the N695/E451 unit and was recognizable from 57 to 85 cm bs. It had a top diameter of 15 cm. 7-10 These post holes were plotted on the fl oor plan at the completion of level 7 in unit N500/E504. All appeared to be pockets of darker soil. The defi nition of these four post holes is suspect. 11 This post hole was found in the N695/E451 unit and was recognizable from 58-74 cm bs. It had a diameter of 19 cm at its top. 12 This post hole was found in the N694/E451 and N694/E452 units and was recognizable from 40 to 100 cm bs. It had a diameter of 23 cm at its top. 13 This post hole was found in the N694/E451 and N694/E452 units and extended from 57 to 101 cm bs. It had a diameter of 12 cm. 14 The approximate center of this post hole was the N695/E452 stake. It extends into all four sur- rounding 1 x 1m units. It was recognizable from 53 to 101 cm bs and had a diameter of 16 cm. 15 This small 10 cm diameter pit was found from 30 to 40 cm bs in the N695/ E459 unit. It contained a few small rocks and several pottery sherds which lay on edge vertically. It was not determined if this was a cultural feature or a rodent burrow. 16 This prepared yellowish-red clay fl oor was discovered by augering the south lobe of Mound B. It lay at the same approximate elevation as Feature 3 and it extended on a north-south line from N478 to N493.80. Augering was not undertaken to determine the east-west dimension of the feature.

170 Texas Archeological Society Feature # Description 17 This possible post hole was found in the N518/E500 unit in the fl oor of level 6. It was later determined to most likely be a rodent burrow. It had a diameter of 35 cm. 18 This post hole was found in the N335/E426 unit at Area A. It extended from 30 to 35 cm bs. 19 This post hole was found in the N688/E452 unit and extended from 55 to 65 cm bs. It had a diameter of 17 cm. 20 This post hole was found in the N690/E451 unit at 37 to 60 cm bs. It had a diameter of 8 cm. 21 This post hole was found in the N693/E451 unit. It extended from 57 to 66 cm bs, and had a diameter of 25 cm. 22 This post hole was found in the N692/E451 unit from 70 to 92 cm bs. It had a diameter of 20 cm. 23 This post hole was found in the N692/E451 unit at 70 to 83 cm bs. It had a diameter of 12 cm. 24 This post hole was located in the N692/E452 unit. It extended from 62 to 109 cm bs and had a diameter of 19 cm. 26 This post hole was found in the N692/E451 unit from 70 to 82 cm bs. It had a diameter of 17 cm. 27 This possible post hole was located in the N691/E451 unit. It was found at about 60 cm bs and ex- tended only to 65 cm bs. Its small 5 cm diameter suggests that it was probably a rodent burrow. 28 This possible post hole was located in the N691/E451 unit in the fl oor of level 7. It had a diameter of 13 cm but a depth of only 1 cm in profi le, which suggested that it was a rodent burrow. 29 This feature is another probable rodent burrow in N691/E451 and is similar to Features 27 and 28. 30 This post hole is located in the N691/E451 unit and extended from 59 to 70 cm bs. It had a diameter of 14 cm. 31 This possible post hole was visible in the north wall profi le of the N335/E426 unit at Area A. It had a diameter of about 12 cm and a depth of 5 cm. 32 This post hole was found in the N691/E451 unit in fl oor of level 7. Cross-sectioning showed that it extended down only to 72 cm bs. It had a diameter of only 7 cm. It is possible that this may represent the very bottom of a post hole whose upper portion may have been equivalent to that of Feature 33. 33 This post hole was found in the N691/E451 unit. It was fi rst recognized at 36 cm bs and extended down to 72 cm bs.

It also extended into the adjacent N695/E453, N693/E452, and N694/E452 units and should have its south edge in the unexcavated N693/E453 unit. The feature has a diameter of roughly 130 cm and shows in the uneven bottoms of the excavations at 60 and 70 cm bs. Post holes defi ned as Features 42, 45, and 51 lie within and penetrate into Feature 50. 51 This post hole is located in the N693/E452 unit. It was noted during the recording of Feature 50 in the fl oor of level 7. It was not cross-sectioned to determine how far downward it continued. 52 This post hole was noted during the fi nal profi ling of the north wall of the N695/E451 and the N695/E452 units. It appeared to extend from about 60 cm bs to the bottom of the profi le at 72 cm bs. The diameter of the post hole cross-section exposed in the wall was about 14 cm.

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 173 Archeological Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991 and 1992 Texas Archeological Society Field School, Red River County, Texas Timothy K. Perttula with contributions by Gayle Fritz, Bo Nelson, LeeAnna Schniebs, and Mike Turner ABSTRACT During the 1991 and 1992 Texas Archeological Society Field Schools, about 2500 acres of land in Red River County, Texas, were surveyed, and a total of 109 new or previously recorded archeological sites were vis- ited during the course of the survey work. Most of the sites were prehistoric in age, documenting two peak periods in settlement: from the Late Archaic through the Woodland period (ca. 2000 B.C. to A.D. 900) and then during the Late Caddo McCurtain phase (ca. A.D. 1300-1700). Historic sites found during the survey were occupied principally between 1860-1950, and were the remnants of farmsteads and tenant farms in several abandoned communities.

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 201 The SMU work documented Archaic (probably Late Archaic) and Caddo period occupations (see Table 3). The former consisted of a dart point tip and a few bifacial tools, a hammerstone, 20 fi re- cracked rocks, and a sandstone mano and pitted stone. The lithic debris is exclusively of local cherts and quartzites (which is characteristic of Late Archaic occupations), while 88 percent of the 17 edge-modifi ed fl ake tools are also on local raw materials. Both pre- (81 grog and grog-bone tempered ceramics, including several with red slips, incisions, and punctated decorations on them) and post-A.D. 1300 Caddo settlements and habitation areas (16 plain shell-tempered pottery body sherds, including two with red slips) are represented by a large sherd sample (n=97). Only one of the two shovel tests we excavated at 41RR100 contained artifacts, and these consisted of one piece of lithic debris and four fi re-cracked rocks between 30-55 cm bs. The low density of surface and subsurface cultural materials documented in the TAS work is quite different from the SMU results. Several explanations may account for the differences, including: (a) the SMU and TAS sites may not be the Figure 28.

202 Texas Archeological Society tion with a habitation site. Clearly, the 1991 work demonstrated that site 41RR101 has considerable potential to answer research questions concerning Woodland period settlement in the Middle Red River and Mound Prairie region. In 1992, TAS survey crews returned to the site to excavate 3 1 x 1 m units at the site to acquire more specifi c information about the subsurface character of the archeological deposits. Although the intent was to place the test units in the area where shovel testing had determined that ceramics, bone, and daub were concentrated, the units were actually placed at the far northern tip of the terrace (see Figure 29). Moderate quantities of lithic debris (n=221) and fi re-cracked rock (n=21), as well as a dart point fragment, were recovered in shallow (≤ 40 cm) sandy loam deposits over a red clay B-horizon. An Archaic period com- ponent may be preserved here, although its integrity is questionable because of the shallow, presumably eroded, nature of the soils at the tip of the landform. Eleven sherds and nine pieces of daub in the three test units are apparently indicative of the Woodland period component better preserved upslope on the rise; three shell-tempered sherds in unit N20E0, level Figure 29.

This is also the same area where plain prehistoric ceramics were found in the shovel testing. A surface collection of prehistoric artifacts from eroded areas of the site recovered 45 items. This includes lithic debris (n=42), cores (n=2), and one fi re-cracked rock. Similar kinds of prehistoric materials were found in the shovel tests at 41RR211, along with daub (n=14), plain grog-tempered sherds (n=3), three shell-tempered sherds (from Shovel Test #7), a straight- stemmed dart point, one mano, and a quartzite bifacial preform fragment. With the exception of the Late Caddo shell-tempered sherds, the assemblage of prehistoric lithic and ceramic arti- facts is most consistent with a Wood- land period occupation of the site. This site certainly warrants further consideration on a number of grounds. First, it contains well-preserved and in- tact prehistoric archeological deposits, and thus it should receive long-term protection. Second, the archeological deposits appear to principally pertain to a Woodland period occupation, which is a period of time that is poorly Figure 39. Site Map of 41RR211.

Two shovel tests on the pimple mound recovered no prehistoric artifacts. The eroded sandy loam soil is only about 5 cm in thickness over a hard B-horizon red clay, indicating that almost all of the archeological deposit has been eroded away, probably by historic timbering, plowing, and grazing activities. A small surface collection from 41RR212 recovered a battered quartzite cobble, and the location of a plain grog-tempered pottery sherd was plotted on the site map drawn in the fi eld; it was not collected.

Based on the recovery of archeological materials from each of the shovel tests, the known extent of the site is about 8000 m2 (Figure 42); since it is likely the site covers the area of the pimple mounds as well as the alluvial terrace itself, the site limits are estimated at 19,000 m2.

The low numbers of prehistoric artifacts recovered from 41RR234 prohibits any defi nitive conclusions concerning the age or function of the site occupation(s), although the recovery of a single non-shell tempered pottery sherd implies an occupation predating ca. A.D. 1300. The fact that up to 50 cm of archeological deposits are present at the site, and that there is no evidence that the deposits have been disturbed, suggests that indeed intact archeological deposits may be preserved there. What the research signifi cance of these archeological deposits is unclear, but can be addressed with further archeological investigations. 41RR235 Site 41RR235 is an historic cemetery nestled in a strip of dense hardwoods some 50 m west of Salt Well Slough, and about 350 m downstream from the Davenport bridge over the slough. The cemetery, which covers about 2800 m2, sits on a narrow alluvial rise (Figure 45). This site was reported to one of the TAS survey teams by Mr. Bob Williams of Clarksville, Texas. Although the area was thickly overgrown (with Figure 45. General Site Map of 41RR235.

238 Texas Archeological Society A limited random surface collection of artifacts was conducted at the site to obtain a representative sample of the prehistoric and historic archeologi- cal materials present on the levee. A mid- to late 19th century occupation, probably a farmstead, is represented by historic ceramics and bottle glass (n=22). Among the historic artifacts are a mid-19th century hand-painted whiteware sherd and a pos- sible mocha whiteware sherd (see Rickard 1993), a brown lead-glazed stoneware, and aqua and brown bottle glass. A possible Woodland period compo- nent is also present at 41RR242, as indicated by Figure 52. Site Map of 41RR240. Although this site has an apparently low den- sity of artifacts in subsurface contexts, insuffi cient evidence was obtained during the shovel testing to ascertain whether the archeological deposits pos- sess integrity or have the potential to contain cul- tural features. It is possible, based on the available information, to suggest that a short-term habitation area is present at 41RR240. Additional shovel tests should be excavated to make these determinations, particularly between the main site area and the small northern pimple mound, and on the northern pimple mound itself. 41RR242 A multi-component prehistoric and historic 19th century farmstead, site 41RR242 is situated on an alluvial ridge or natural levee of the Red River. Salt Well Slough runs in an old channel of the river at this point in its course. The site itself covers approximately 9400 m2 of the plowed natural levee, with the highest concentration of archeological materials visible on the site at the crest of the levee (the southwestern part of the site proper) (Figure 53).

The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16), an Early to Historic Caddo Period Village on the Red River in Northeast Texas Edited by Timothy K. Perttula, with contributions by James E. Bruseth, James W. Cogswell, Gail M. Colby, Sharon M. Derrick, Gayle J. Fritz, Michael D. Glascock, S. Eileen Goldborer, William A. Martin, Hector Neff, Timothy K. Perttula, D. Gentry Steele, Bonnie C. Yates, ABSTRACT The 1991 and 1992 Texas Archeological Society Field Schools held along the Red River and tributaries in Northeast Texas were designed to obtain new and important information on the Caddo prehistory and early history of the middle reaches of the Red River, and they were a considerable success. Archeological investiga- tions at the Roitsch (or Sam Kaufman) site (41RR16) recovered signifi cant archeological evidence of Caddo structures and features, mound construction, and burial practices during the Early to Late Caddo periods, as well as a substantial faunal and fl oral data base on subsistence practices (particularly the use of maize), and from bioarcheological studies, a new appreciation of the health conditions and dietary adaptations of generations of Late Caddo (ca. A.D. 1300-1700) farmers who lived on Mound Prairie. This article presents the results of the archeological investigations at the Roitsch site. It includes detailed discussions on the archeological, bioarcheological, paleobotanical, and faunal remains found in Early, Middle, Late, and possible Historic Caddo period contexts in the village, and considers the fi ndings in light of the re- search goals developed during the course of the 1991 and 1992 TAS Field Schools.

The Feature 405 pit with the broken ceramic jar resembles two features in Block III (Features 302 and 304) where a post hole was identifi ed imme- diately underlying ceramic sherd/ vessel concentrations. From this, it appears to be the case that the broken ceramics were stuffed in the top of the post hole after the poles had been pulled and the hole fi lled with sediments. a The more defi nite post holes (Features 404 and 405, and pos- sible post hole 5) ranged from 19-20 cm in diameter, consistent with wall support posts. They were exposed between 25-30 cm bs, and were anchored by digging the holes solidly into the B-horizon clay. The occurrence of most of the post holes in Block IV in proxim- ity to the basin hearth (probably a central hearth) suggests that a portion of a Late Caddo McCur- tain phase structure was present in the northern part of the block (see Figure 20). The posts and possible post holes are ca. 2-4 m b distance from the hearth, hinting at a structure that may have been Figure 17.

Two different burials (Burials 28 and 32) had Emory Punctated-Incised vessel sections (Figure 51). The Burial 28 vessel had a single row of deep punctations under the lip. There were also the reconstructed base and lower body of two plain shell-tempered jars in Burial 34 (see Table 9). Al- though not readily reconstructed, some 33 sherds from a Keno Trailed bottle were part of the grave goods in Burial 30 (Figure 52); three other burials also had sherds of Keno Trailed. Burials 28 and 34 had vessel sections of shell- tempered Taylor Engraved deep bowls (cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962: Plate 75d, g). The Burial 28 ves- sel (represented by 61 sherds) had a short, plain rim and a broad scroll element on the upper body (Figure 53). There was a red ochre-rich clay pig- ment smeared in the engraved lines, and there are two pot hunter probe holes visible on the vessel. The large Burial 34 Taylor Engraved vessel (30 cm orifi ce diameter) is red-slipped on both interior and exterior surfaces, and has a decorative motif of scrolls and hatched triangles pendant from the upper and lower rim. Similar decorative elements were noted on Taylor Engraved vessels from the Figure 48. Nash Neck Banded jar in Feature 706. Rowland Clark site (Perino 1994: Figure 12e).

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 383 sex, and seven subadults (Table 11) (Derrick et al. 1994, see Derrick et al., below). Adults ranged in height from 153.22 cm (young adult female) to 163.32 cm (a male in his late 40s to mid-50s), in- dicating these Caddo were short in height. Most of the individuals at the Roitsch site died before they were 40 years of age, although some of the adults lived to old age (between 55 and 60 years of age at death). A number of medical disorders were identifi ed by Derrick et al. (see below), with degenerative joint diseases, osteoarthritis, and vertebral osteo- phytosis being particularly common among both adult males and females at Roitsch (see Table 11). Bone infections were also prevalent in the Roitsch human remains, especially healed supra-inion depressions on the occipital bones which Derrick et al. attribute to infections associated with the practice of cranial modeling among the Caddo populations at the site. As Derrick et al. note, cra- nial modeling is a common practice among Caddo groups on the Red River (see also Loveland and a Bass 1983; Loveland 1987; Derrick and Wilson 1997), and Burials 24, 27b, 28 (it is not clear which of the four individuals [Burial 28a-d] had cranial modeling because of the erosional commingling of individuals in the burial deposit), 31, 33, 35, and 36 exhibit the shaping of the frontal and occipital areas of the head. Pathologies indicative of nutritional and developmental disorders are present only in low frequencies in the Roitsch burials (see Table 11). However, there is a high incidence of local traumas in a number of the individuals—both male and female—including healed skull and postcranial b fractures, a damaged tooth, and trauma damage to a shoulder joint and patella. All of the adult individuals from the Roitsch site had dental caries, and the dental caries rate is substantial per person (Derrick et al., below). There is less tooth wear among the Caddo popula- tions living at Roitsch compared to other aborigi- nal populations living in Texas (cf. Colby 1997), which may relate to the “use of wooden mortars and pestles when grinding corn” (Derrick et al. 1994:13).

Noded bowl. et al., all are clear evidence that the Caddo groups a at Roitsch were agriculturists who consumed large quantities of maize (see also Fritz and Goldborer, this article). Interestingly, there were no real dif- ferences between males and females in the stable carbon isotope values, suggesting that the Caddo population at Roitsch had a relatively homogenous diet, regardless of status or sex. Stable carbon iso- tope results from other Caddo populations in the Middle Red River (e.g., from the Roden, Holde- man, and Rowland Clark sites; data on fi le at the Texas Historical Commission, see also Appendix X, this article) further suggest that the intensive consumption of maize by the Caddo occurred only after ca. A.D. 1200 (cf. Perttula 2008). b ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN MIDDLE CADDO CONTEXTS IN THE VILLAGE AREAS, BLOCK VI by Timothy K. Perttula The vast majority of the archeological depos- its at the Roitsch site are part of the Late Caddo McCurtain phase community along the Red River, and most of the work completed during the Texas Archeological Society (TAS) Field School was in this extensive archeological component. However, during the course of the fi eld work, pre-A.D. 1300 archeological deposits were encountered in several areas of the site, including the 1991 Youth Area (see below) and Block VI. c Block VI is a small excavation (4.25 m2) cen- Figure 58.

A radiocarbon sample the Mound Prairie phase use of the feature in that horizontal engraved (n=1), plain grog-tempered and non-slipped bowls, and a Pennington Punctated Incised rim from a large bowl were identifi ed in this sherd assemblage (Figure 63b). Six of the 19 Mound Prairie phase rim and dec- orated sherds are plain rims, suggesting that plain vessels were relatively common in the ceramic assemblage. By comparison, only 7 percent of the shell-tempered rim and decorated sherds are plain rim fragments. These rims have direct or standing profi les (see Figure 63e), with fl at lips. One is also interior thickened, another possible diagnostic attribute of Mound Prairie phase ceramics. The majority of the decorated sherds are incised (n=8), followed by punctated (n=2), punctated-incised (n=2), and engraved (n=1). The incised sherds have horizontal, parallel (orientation of the sherds is indeterminate), curvilinear (see Figure 63h), and diagonal incised elements. The horizontal and parallel elements comprise 63 percent of the non-shell-tempered incised sherds from Block VI. Both of the punctated sherds have at least one row of tool punctations (see Figure 63c). The fi rst punctated-incised sherd is a rim with a row of fi ngernail punctates below the lip, and Figure 60.
