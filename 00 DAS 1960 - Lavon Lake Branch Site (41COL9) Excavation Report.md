'. ~. EXCAVATION OF THE SRANCH SITE (If/Col.-C}) For many years local. co l1ector~ and amateurs have hunted the BRANCH'SITE No. 4l-18C9-Z, recovering many ar tifacts. 'In 1951, prior to the construction of the Lavon Reservoir,'the Smithsonian Institution, under Robert L. Stephenson, tested the site, but todate no report on the work at Branch has become available. Since 1951, the Dallas ArcheOlogical Society became interested in fu~ther excavation, but upon checking with the Federal Agency in charge of the area, it was learned that a farmer had the site under lease and would not give permission to excavate. As the site is located on Fed~rally owned land and within the pool level of Lavon Reservoir, it was nec~ssary to obtain permis~ion from the National Park Service after the private lease had expired. Accordingly in 1959, the president of the Dallas Archeo lOgical Society initiated corresponde!1ce with the National Park Service office in Austin, Texas. With the very kind eoo,~ratlon of that office and the Regional Office at Santa Fe, New MeXico, the Dalla& Archeological Society was grant ed permission to proceed with excavation. The Branch Site, which belongs to the Wylie Focus, has a large pit located in the west side ot the site (See Figure Z). Mr. Herschel Cobb was selected as Field Foreman, belnl held responsJble tor submitting quarterly reports to the Regional Office. The project was to be completed within one year from starting date. Letter of permission was presented to ~. Russel McGinnis, Resident Engineer of the Lavon Resevoir at the U. S. Corps of Engineers Office, and we were allowed to be gin work. The starting date'deadline was met by t~oweling one five-foot square in June, 1959. When cooler weather came in October, a grid of five-foot squares was staked off and excavation began in the main area of the site. As ex cavation proceeded, six more squares were staked and two short trenches and one test square added to the'proJect. Excavation was terminated In the spring of 1960, and the Permit expired JUly 1, 1960. The following Dallas Archeological Society members and interested friends c~rric~ on the project in their spare time, which was usually the wee~ ~nds: Mr. and Mrs. Lester Wilson, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Lorrain, Mr. R. It. Harris, Frank Sloan, Bill Blair, Mr. and Mrs. Herschel Cobb, Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Troup, Mrs. Chas. G. Nemec, Jr., Charles Nemec, Mr. and Mrs. 4.

· " John Perkins, The Reverend Don Koelling, Mr. Sims, Mr. Woodward and Dr. Mark Huff. The Dallas Archeological Society wishes to express its thanks to the FeG~ral agency which saw fit to entrust us with the pr~Jectl and to all those members who contri buted their t~mc and effort in quest for more information on the Wylie Focus. We were ably'assisted by our most ex perienced mem~er, Mr. R. K. Harris, who was our valuable consultant and co-worker. Figure I shows the general location of the Branch Site. Env,ronmenl The Branch Site is located on the East Fork of the Trinity River in Collin County Texas, approximately eight miles above the Junction with Pilot Grove Creek. The general terrain is low and rolling with shallow valleys formed by the strea:Js. This.area is included in the eastern Cross Timbers region of the Costal Plains physiographic province (1). The annual rainfall and mean temperature or" the area today is 39.95 inches and 65°F. respectively (Z)' At one time this area was partially timbered with pecan; cottonwood, walnut,'elm, live oak, post oak, hack~ berry, persimmon, mesquite, bois-d1arc and black locust. The natural occurring trees are now found along the streams with the usual type and amount of underbrush. Large pastures and actively cultivated fields"are found in the area tOday. The staple crops are: 'cotton, wheat, grain sorghum, corn, onions, alfalfa, clover, beans and potatoes (Z). The E~st Fork of the Trinity River prOVides a supply of water and an abundant source of freshwater mussel artd flsh~ Natural occurring game include squIrrel, rabbit, deer, dove, quail, 0ppossum, racoon and skunk. During the winter months, the area Is abundant with migrato~y birds such as duck, geese, etc. Therefore,·the natural environ ment supplied a good source for water, food and an easily survivable hcbitat for man.

Excavation Methods On June 7, 1959, one five· foot test square was dug down to the sterile yellow clay, which underli~s this site, This square was located thirty-five feet east of the cent~r line of the River Basin Survey's main trench. On June 13, 1959, two adjacent five toot test squares were excavated. On October 10, 1959, a datum point was established at the cast edge of the River Basin Survey's trench, at the point where the trench reached the foot of the south slope of the Trinity River terrace. (See Map, Figure Z). An area extending north sixty feet and east fifteen feet from this point was seledted for excavation. This area was staked off into five foot squares. Thirteen of these squares were SUbsequently excavated to sterile clay. A further five foot sq uare was dug at a point one hundred and eighty-five feet north of the datum point. The ground sloped upward to north from the datum point and this square was at the highest elevation. The occupation zone consisted of a thin layer of black waxy soil. Over almost all th~ area ot excavation, it was very shallow, from six to twelve inches in'depth, and below was sterile yellow clay. In square B-1, the black mantle extended below the seventeen inch depth"of excavation and in two squares near the south end of Area A of excavation (squares 33 and 35), it extended below the thirteen inch depth of excavation. There was·no visible stratification thrn.ughout the occupation zon~. In most cases," ,1t hardly went deeper than six 'inches, 'and had been mixed ,by plowIng; this area was ~fl-r the .;north end ~"of Area A. ,-~J;'.:.~'f;~.".-".~ .-.__ .The-- (1"f99'111g was done by troweling 'in arbitrary thre-e inch levels. Very little screening was attempted because" the soil was either gummy if damp, or rock hard when dry. The careful hand troweling made it unlikely that any artl-. facts were overlooked however. The only indications of house structures found were a few fragments of clay wattle. 8.

A.....r...t..i..f..a...c...t..s... Found in Excavation -~--- A total of 18 artifacts were found during the $lte excavation. Below these artifacts will be discussed, by area and square. Pit X 1. This pit locetcd on the high part of the ridge east or the la rge pit, was exc'.vnted by Mr. and Mrs~ Herschel Cobb, Mr. and Mrs. Lester Viilson and Bill Blair. The square was dug by 5" levels. One artifact was found in the 1st level (0_5"). It was a flaking tool of deer ulna and Is shown on Fiaure 5 A. In this area the soil became sterile at about 18". Area A In area A of the excavation squares 3, 14, 15, 21, 23, 27, 33 and 35 produced artifacts. Square 3 dug by Don Koelling produced a Scallorn Point In the first level (0_3"). The soil became sterile in the third level (6-9"). This spe.cimen is shown on Figure 5 H. Square 14 dug by R. K. Harris produced 3 artifacts in level 2 (3-6"). They are os follows: a clay tempered pottery sherd of the type MOnkstown, a bone need1e, and"a Seallorn point. They are shown on Figure 5 R, D. and G. The soil became sterile at 14".

Not enough artifacts of the archaic are present to identify the focus. Evidence for Gibson Aspect would be the pottery types Pennington Punctate (Figure 6, R) and Holly Fine Engraved (Figure 6, Q). These two types belong to the Alto Focus. Figure 5, R is a sherd of Monkstown from the Sanders Focus. Arrow point types for Gibson Aspect would be the Alba, Seallorn and Bonham points. 16.

Evidence for the Fulton Aspect times would be the pottery type' Nocona Plain (Figure 6, V), and arrow point types Perdiz, Harrell and Fresno. These artifacts' seem to be related to the Henrietta Focus to the northwest. The Branch Site is very similar to other Wylie Focus Pit Sites on East Fork of the Trinity River; in artifact types. It is hoped that the results of the River Basin Surveys excavation at Branch Site will be published sooner or later. For identification of artifact types in this report, refer to Suhm and Jelks, 1962. " Members of the Dallas Archeological Society Dallas; Texas June 4, 1965 Analys is .2L Shell !.!:2!!
