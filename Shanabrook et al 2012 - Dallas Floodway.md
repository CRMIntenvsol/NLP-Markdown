ABSTRACT This report provides an overview of the previous archaeological and geoarchaeological investigations within the Dallas Floodway System and an assessment of the potential for the presence of significant archaeological properties within the Floodway System. This study was conducted in support of the effort of the City of Dallas to assess the potential impact of the proposed 100-year flood event remediation measures for the Dallas Floodway System as required by the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. The Dallas Floodway System is defined as the system of four separate federally-authorized levee systems along the Trinity River consisting of the East Levee, the West Levee, the Rochester Park Levee, and the Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWWTP) Levee. Under the regulatory control of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the City of Dallas plans, operates, and maintains the Dallas Floodway System. The synthesis effort involved the review of previous background research and literature, examination of the Texas Historical Commission Archeological Sites Atlas, examination of the files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, and examination of the Dallas Floodway Project EIS, Draft Existing Conditions. All available geological and geomorphological data pertinent to the project area were reviewed also. Available boring data sets from the floodway were analyzed in relation to previously existing data sets to generate a reliable model of buried topographic features or landforms and associated soil suites (paleosols). The objective was to identify areas within the floodway that likely contain surfaces and matrices of former landforms that may contain the remains of prehistoric occupations. The near surface geology in the project area is relatively complex. A wide variation exists in the depth of the alluvial fill, and this variation indicates that the downcutting of the ancestral Trinity River and its tributaries has not been uniform across the valley. Almost everywhere on the floodplain, the surface unit consists of the Pilot Point Alluvium but this unit has been heavily impacted by a variety of historic activities and buried in a few areas by more recent deposits especially near the rectified and natural Trinity River channel. Portions of the older Carrollton, Aubrey, and Sanger alluvia are also preserved in portions of the valley, particularly those where the fill is thicker or remote from the Late Holocene river channels. A strong possibility exists that buried, stratified sites dating to the Late Holocene could be preserved in the project area, particularly near the former channel of the West Fork and the channel of the Trinity River southeast of the Forest Avenue Bridge. It is also possible that cultural materials predating the iii

Late Holocene could be preserved in the earlier sediments. The highest probability areas for these materials would be near the valley margins or along the edges of the buried bedrock ridges and knolls, the fluvial terrace west of the CWWTP, and under the current Trinity floodplain west of the Westmoreland Avenue bridge. However, these deposits would be very deeply buried, very difficult to predict and locate, and very few in number given their potential exposure to repeated cycles of fluvial cut and fill. Based on these assessments, further cultural resources monitoring should be conducted in specified areas when there is construction along the Dallas Floodway. Areas near old channels of the Trinity River or at depths greater than two to three meters should be given particular attention. Testing should be conducted before construction is performed on or near the terrace around the CWWTP plant, with subsequent monitoring during construction. Monitoring should especially be conducted during any deep coring, particularly for larger bridge piers that would yield larger samples for both cultural materials and sediment. In addition, when construction is conducted three meters below the surface or more (i.e., borrow pits, wells, sumps, etc.), it is paramount that monitoring occur to ensure that significant archaeological deposits of the Late Pleistocene to Middle Holocene periods are not inadvertently destroyed. The presence of the Aubrey Clovis site at a depth of 8 meters below the flood plain surface within the upper reaches of the Elm Fork clearly demonstrates that the potential for deeply buried sites exists. Twenty-three known archaeological sites are within the Dallas Floodway System and are located in areas that could be potentially impacted directly or indirectly by the proposed remediation measures for correcting the deficiencies of the Dallas Floodway System. Of these 23, sites, 16 have been recommended ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark, six (41DL67, 41DL222, 41DL224, 41DL225, 41DL323, and 41DL414) are of unknown eligibility, and one (41DL371) has been recommended eligible for designation as a State Archeological Landmark but has not been actually designated. Of these properties, only those of unknown eligibility or those that have been recommended eligible are of concern in relation to the potential impacts of the proposed remediation measures. If these sites would be impacted by the remediation measures, evaluation measures and, if necessary, mitigation measures should be planned and implemented in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office. iv

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION The City of Dallas is sponsoring a project to assess the potential impact of the implementation of remediation measures designed to rectify deficiencies within the Dallas Floodway System (Figure 1). The Dallas Floodway System is defined as the system of four separate federally-authorized levee systems along the Trinity River consisting of the East Levee, the West Levee, the Rochester Park Levee, and the Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWWTP) Levee. Under the regulatory control of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the City of Dallas plans, operates, and maintains the Dallas Floodway System. The East and West levees protect approximately 8,104 acres of essential infrastructure, commercial, industrial, and residential interests including a portion of downtown Dallas; the Rochester Park Levee protects approximately 354 acres of infrastructure, commercial, and residential interests southeast of downtown Dallas; and the CWWTP Levee protects an area of approximately 230 acres of critical municipal wastewater treatment infrastructure. The City of Dallas and the USACE propose three levee remediation measures to the Dallas Floodway System. The Proposed Action includes the installation of cut-off walls and land side drains to address seepage/underseepage and levee fattening to address stability concerns within the Dallas Floodway System. Seepage/underseepage occurs when earthen sand layers underneath the levees link the Trinity River channel to the land side of the levees or if water flows along utility line crossings underneath the levees. Levee fattening is a measure that increases the horizontal to vertical slope of the side of a levee to strengthen its stability against potential slides. Slope stability refers to the ability for the side slopes of the levees to remain intact when presented with various internal and/or external pressures. These proposed remediation measures would involve ground disturbance and therefore could potentially impact buried archaeological properties within the Dallas Floodway. Therefore, the City of Dallas and the USACE are required to assess the potential impact of the proposed project on historic properties as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [P.L. 90-190] and the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended [16 USC 470 et seq.; PL 89-665; 80 Stat. 915]. The City of Dallas contracted HNTB Corporation to conduct an Environmental Assessment of the proposed implementation of levee remediation measures. HNTB Corporation in turn subcontracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI project # 30007.16.01), to conduct background research and a literature review of relevant archaeological and 1

geoarchaeological work previously conducted within the Dallas Floodway and to provide a synthetic overview of the potential for significant archaeological properties within the proposed Area of Potential Effects (APE). This work was undertaken by Mr. Duane Peter (Principal Investigator), Ms. Janet Niessner (Archaeologist), and Mr. David Shanabrook (Geoarchaeologist) in July of 2010. The Scope-of-Work issued for the archaeological and geoarchaeological synthesis by HNTB Corporation identified two primary tasks: 1. Following a literature review, all archaeological sites that have been evaluated within the APE will be summarized. The assessment will include the review of previous background research and literature, examination of the Texas Historical Commission Archeological Sites Atlas, the files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, and the Dallas Floodway Project EIS Draft Existing Conditions document. 2. Review all available geological and geomorphological data pertinent to the project area. Primary consideration should be given to core and boring data. The objective of this task will be to gather enough data to generate a reliable model of buried topographic features or landforms and associated soil suites (paleosols). The surfaces and matrices of these relict and fossil deposits may contain the remains of prehistoric occupations. This report is divided into six chapters. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the cultural history of the project area as well as previous research in the project area. Chapter 3 presents the known archaeological sites within one mile of the proposed APE. Factors that influence the integrity of potential cultural deposits within the Dallas Floodway are discussed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 presents the synthesis of the geoarcheological investigations within the Upper Trinity River Basin, and more specifically the Dallas Floodway, and the model developed from the existing data. Finally, Chapter 6 presents recommendations concerning the potential locations for buried surfaces with archaeological deposits with good contextual integrity. A list of references follows the main body of the report. 3

CHAPTER 2 CULTURAL SETTING AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS CULTURAL BACKGROUND Prehistoric Cultural Periods Current conceptions of the prehistoric cultural chronology of northcentral Texas (especially for the upper Trinity River basin) are largely based on four major reports by Peter and McGregor (1988), Prikryl (1987, 1990), and Yates and Ferring (1986) (Table 1). Table 1 Cultural Chronological Time Periods for Northcentral Texas (Years Before Present [BP]) Paleo-Indian Pre 8,500 BP Early Archaic 8,500- 6,000 BP Middle Archaic 6,000- 3,500 BP Late Archaic 3,500- 1,250 BP Late Prehistoric I 1,250- 750 BP Late Prehistoric II 750- 250 BP Historic Native American 250- 150 BP Historic European 150 BP - Present After Peter and McGregor (1988), Prikryl (1987, 1990), and Yates and Ferring (1986) Paleo-Indian Point types found in northcentral Texas that can be associated with the early to late parts of the Paleo-Indian period include Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Plainview, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff. Based on a sample of projectile points from surface sites, Prikryl (1990) has concluded that among the most common Paleo-Indian point types in this area are Plainview and Dalton. Ferring 5

and Yates (1997) suggest that these types date to about 10,000–9,500 years ago, based on cross- dating with other regions. The suggested age for these types may correspond with the onset of early Holocene alluviation in the local river valleys, including the Trinity and Sabine. The majority of the recorded Paleo-Indian sites cluster in the upper Trinity drainage, where the most intensive archaeological investigations have taken place, though often these sites consist of no more than one or two projectile points. The generally low density of Paleo-Indian artifacts and sites and the tendency for projectile points to be made from nonlocal lithics have led investigators to characterize these populations as highly mobile, with low regional densities (Lynott 1981:100– 101). The Paleo-Indian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or from stratigraphically mixed contexts (Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995). The Field Ranch site (41CO10), along the upper Elm Fork of the Trinity River, is a prime example of typical site contexts (Jensen 1968). Interestingly, the only two investigated sites in northcentral Texas with apparently discrete Paleo- Indian components, the Lewisville Lake and Aubrey sites, are early, both producing Clovis projectile points. The Lewisville Lake site (41DN72) contained 27 hearth features with an associated Clovis point and other sparse lithics (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958; Story 1990a:182– 184). Although the original radiocarbon dates on the hearths suggested an anomalously early age for Clovis points (ca. 37,000 years ago) (Crook and Harris 1956), later work by the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford 1981) appears to have resolved the controversy concerning the date of the occupation there. Apparently, the presence of naturally occurring lignite in these hearths, either as a fuel or as an inadvertent inclusion, contaminated the radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually accepted age of 10,000–12,000 years ago for Clovis period occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human inhabitants of northcentral Texas. The deeply buried Aubrey site (41DN479), located on the Elm Fork north of Dallas, yielded lithic debitage and Clovis points buried beneath 8 m (26 ft) of Holocene alluvium on the Elm Fork flood plain (Ferring 1989, 2001). The discovery of this site suggests that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in northcentral Texas will only be found by examining deeply stratified Holocene alluvium in modern flood plain situations. The Lewisville Lake and Aubrey sites contained a variety of faunal remains, both large and small. The largest, white-tailed deer, can be associated comfortably with the Clovis occupation at the Lewisville Lake site. The preponderance of small game at the Aubrey site could be interpreted as representing a more generalized pattern of foraging than the reliance on mammoth and bison apparently demonstrated at Clovis sites on the Southern Plains (Hofman 1989a:31–32). Such a divergence in subsistence patterns may reflect an inherent adaptability of Clovis technology to changing environmental conditions encountered as early populations spread southeastward into Texas (Ferring and Yates 1997). There are no excavated and reported Paleo-Indian stratified components on the central Blackland Prairie itself. Nonetheless, a variety of early points has been found, largely in surface contexts, and it is clear that this part of Texas was used throughout the period from ca. 9,500 to 7,000 B.C. Presumably, this use was by hunter-gatherer groups with low population densities and high residential mobility. An analysis of materials collected by C. K. Chandler and other avocational archaeologists from sites chiefly in Ellis County during the Superconducting Super Collider project identified a handful of Paleo-Indian projectile points typed as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Golondrina, and San Patrice, along with several untyped lanceolate specimens (Yedlowski et al. 1998). Other early materials from the area include a few San Patrice points from the Richland- Chambers Reservoir (McGregor and Bruseth 1987) and a cache of 23 prismatic blades from a site in Navarro County (Young and Collins 1989). 6

Archaic For northcentral Texas, the Archaic is tentatively dated between ca. 7000 B.C. and A.D. 700, with segments of approximately 2,500 years often considered as early, middle, and late divisions of the period (Prikryl 1993:199). Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from 7000 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to 2000 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 2000 B.C. to A.D. 700. Relatively recent overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of Texas include Hofman (1989a), Prikryl (1990), and Story (1985, 1990a, 1990b). Diagnostic artifacts for the period are similar to those of adjacent regions, although developing a sound chronological sequence of diagnostic tool types has proven difficult because many of the investigations have focused on surface manifestations. Prikryl (1990) suggests that Early Archaic projectile points include early split-stemmed varieties and possibly Angostura, and Middle Archaic points include basal-notched forms such as Andice, Bell, and Calf Creek along with Bulverde, Carrollton, Dawson, and Wells. Late Archaic point types reportedly include Castroville, Dallas, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, Gary, Godley, Marshall, Palmillas, Trinity, and Yarbrough (Prikryl 1990). At one time, the Carrollton and Elam foci were used to define the Middle and Late Archaic, respectively (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954). Reevaluation of the type-site artifacts, however, showed that the materials were so mixed that perpetuation of these foci provides little interpretive value (Hofman et al. 1989; Prikryl 1990). Some of this mixing and the generally low numbers of Early and Middle Archaic sites may be due to extensive erosion of mid-Holocene deposits, as has been documented for the Brazos River drainage west of the Dallas area in Young, Stephens, and Throckmorton counties (Ensor et al. 1992). Though few isolable components have been analyzed for the various divisions of the Archaic period in northcentral Texas, slowly increasing populations responding to warmer and drier environmental conditions have been postulated to explain the overall archeological record of the period (Lynott 1981; Story 1990a). It is thought that these factors may have led Archaic populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of northcentral Texas to develop a diversified hunting and gathering pattern based on bottomland resources of the rivers and major creeks, whereas populations on the Rolling Plains maintained a focus on bison hunting (Hofman 1989a). Projectile points of the period were fashioned from local lithic materials, suggesting that populations were less mobile than were their Paleo-Indian predecessors. Less mobility also may suggest refinement of the diversified subsistence pattern to include scheduling of resource use within more restricted areas. Evidence from Late Archaic sites at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997) indicates repeated site occupation by small groups, which could support the resource-scheduling hypothesis. Still, even with refinement of resource utilization, evidence of dietary stress has been found on Late Archaic human skeletal materials (Ferring and Yates 1997; Gill-King 1987). Mixing of components also has hampered interpretations regarding downstream Trinity River use by prehistoric peoples during the lengthy Archaic period. Because few pure Archaic components have been excavated, particularly ones dating to the first two-thirds of the period, it is difficult to say much about artifact chronologies, subsistence practices, or settlement strategies. A variety of projectile point styles traditionally associated with the Early and Middle Archaic period in Central Texas—for example, Andice, Angostura, Bell, Gower, Hoxie, Martindale, Nolan, Travis, and Uvalde (Yedlowski et al. 1998)—was identified during analyses for the Superconducting Super Collider project (although a host of other types perhaps dating to this time and later were identified as well, their chronologies are less certain), but these points are few in number and do not appear to represent major occupation of this part of the Blackland Prairie. Demonstrably 7

early points were even scarcer at the nearby Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir and the Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills Reservoir, with a Hoxie point from Pecan Springs being the clearest example (Duffield 1963; Sorrow et al. 1966). The relatively intensive work at Richland- Chambers Reservoir suggests a similar conclusion for the western edge of the Oak Woodlands, although it has been noted that data pertaining to the Early to Middle Archaic may be scarce in part because sites dating to this interval lie deeply buried or were removed by extensive erosion during the mid-Holocene (Fields 1995; McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Only a few radiocarbon assays predating 4,000 years ago were obtained, but points dated to this interval in Central Texas (for example, Bell/Andice/Calf Creek and Hoxie) occur at the Richland-Chambers Reservoir in only very small numbers. A much different picture is presented for the late portion of the Archaic period, after about 2000 B.C. All areas of the central Blackland Prairie that have been studied archaeologically contain sites dating to this period, and the Late Archaic represents the earliest time for which much is known about indigenous prehistoric lifeways. Both the Pecan Springs and Strawn Creek sites on the Blackland Prairie proper yielded such Late Archaic point types as Gary, Dawson, and Yarbrough, although they tend to be mixed with materials from later occupations (Duffield 1963; Sorrow et al. 1966). The surface collections analyzed during the Superconducting Super Collider project also contained these types, as well as a number of Late Archaic types common in Central Texas—such as Bulverde, Darl, Ensor, Marcos, Marshall, Montell, and Pedernales—and a variety of probable Late Archaic forms more characteristic of the northern and eastern parts of the state such as Carrollton, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, and Kent (Yedlowski et al. 1998). Noting the relatively high frequency of Late Archaic projectile points, Yedlowski et al. (1998) suggest an increased regional use by hunter-gatherers as a result of moister climatic conditions than before, presumably associated with greater productivity in subsistence resources. They also note that, although the projectile point evidence indicates interaction with groups living in Central Texas proper, larger proportions of points indicate affinities with eastern Texas than during the Early and Middle Archaic. Brown (1987:44-22 through 44-26) presents similar conclusions concerning an increase in occupational intensity and increased interaction for those project areas at the eastern edge of the region (i.e., Cedar Creek Reservoir in southeastern Kaufman County and Richland-Chambers Reservoir in southeastern Navarro County). Two of the three excavated sites at Cedar Creek Reservoir have strong Late Archaic components represented by numerous Gary points and a variety of other lithic tools (Story 1965), and at least 15 sites at Richland-Chambers Reservoir have identifiable components of this age. In addition to constellations of projectile point styles (e.g., Dawson, Gary, Godley, Kent, and Yarbrough) that indicate ties more to the north and east than to the south and west, each of these areas has yielded information suggesting that ceramics may have been introduced into the material culture of local groups during the latest part of the Late Archaic, as they were across most of Texas to the east (where this interval usually is called the Early Ceramic period, and sometimes the Woodland period). At Cedar Creek Reservoir, there are hints in the distributional data from the Lacy and Gossett Bottoms sites that the initial use of ceramic containers preceded introduction of the bow and arrow, although it is difficult to be certain because the sites were not well stratified and the sherds could not be related to known early types such as Williams Plain (Story 1965). At Richland- Chambers Reservoir, distinctive shell-tempered sherds were recovered from contexts dated between A.D. 200 and 700 at the Adams Ranch site (Bruseth and Martin 1987), apparently representing the earliest ceramic industry in this part of the Trinity River basin. 8

The most complete picture of the archaeology of the Late Archaic for this region comes from the Oak Woodlands at the eastern margin of the Blackland Prairie. Along Richland and Chambers creeks, Late Archaic groups appear to have been hunter-gatherers whose subsistence pursuits focused on wild plant foods such as hickory nuts and prairie turnips, and faunal taxa such as deer, turtles, small mammals, birds, and fish (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Although presumably not sedentary, these groups clearly used the area in an intensive fashion for residential purposes, and it appears that populations increased while territory sizes decreased. A conspicuous component of the record are the so-called “Wylie pits,” which are large man-made depressions measuring approximately 16 m (52.5 ft) in diameter and 0.61 m (2 ft) in depth, excavated at the Bird Point Island and Adams Ranch sites. These were large features that appear to have been used for communal processing of vegetal resources (and later as cemeteries), perhaps in the context of band aggregation in “tension zones” as territories decreased in size (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Human burials are common in the archaeological record of the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods of at least the eastern part of northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1993). Some of these burials are associated with Wylie pit features. These features were first identified at a series of sites along the East Fork of the Trinity River and were considered an important trait of the Wylie focus (Harris and Suhm 1963; Stephenson 1952; Wilson 1946). Radiocarbon assays from pits at the Upper Rockwall and Sister Grove Creek sites in the Lavon Lake area suggest that the pits and the Wylie focus were associated with the Late Prehistoric period (Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Lynott (1977) widened the temporal span by incorporating a Late Archaic phase into the focus definition. Subsequent work on Wylie pits at Richland-Chambers Reservoir to the south confirmed their Late Archaic age (Bruseth and Martin 1987). Nonetheless, the wide range of associated artifact types and the long time span represented by the pits made it clear that the Wylie focus was not a useful construct. Bruseth and Martin (1987), while discarding the focus as unusable, further supported Lynott’s (1975) original interpretation of the pits as being associated with large-scale food processing. Their interpretation equates the pits to the burned rock middens of Central Texas, with both representing group aggregations. Late Prehistoric The Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 700–1600) is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the start of this period is based upon dated contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage to the west. Group aggregation and large-scale manipulation of subsistence resources, as represented by the Wylie pits and the human burials they contain, may be indicative of societal changes that continued through the Late Prehistoric period. Habitation structures indicating increased sedentism, at least in certain places and at certain times, have been found in some Late Prehistoric sites along with cultigens, such as corn, and arrow points and ceramics indicating important technological changes. Also, there may be evidence (e.g., the distinction between burials placed inside and outside Wylie pits) of differential mortuary practices that could reflect a shift toward a hierarchical social structure, although this evidence is nowhere near as strong as that for the Caddo area of northeast Texas. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period be divided into an early and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of the foraging subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting Southern Plains influences. Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). 9

Prikryl’s (1990, 1993) Late Prehistoric I period (A.D. 700-1200) is marked by the Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Scallorn, and Steiner arrow point types. Ceramic vessels are mostly grog-tempered and undecorated, but some evidence indicates influences from other regions in some locally manufactured wares displaying designs similar to those associated with East Texas Caddoan ceramic types. Evidence for corn and structures has been found at sites at Joe Pool Lake in western Dallas County as well as to the north at Hubert Moss Lake near the Red River (Lorrain 1969; Martin 1994; Peter and McGregor 1988). Farther west, cultural changes also were taking place on the Rolling Plains, though this area held onto its Archaic lifestyle even after technological innovations such as the bow and arrow were accepted (Lynott 1981). As a result of intensive excavations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake, Peter and McGregor (1988) proposed a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late twelfth or early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred, in at least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time. Concerning the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates (1997:305) summarize the results of that research as follows: Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic sites which lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only ones in the project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500–650 yr. bp. No evidence of horticulture was recovered, and the [Late Prehistoric II] fauna indicate a foraging strategy that emphasized deer procurement and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation of chert raw materials was about as frequent as in the [Late Archaic], and long-distance raw material acquisition (e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated by locally produced shell-tempered wares, which by this time were being produced in the Southern Plains region generally. As recorded by previous synthesis (Story 1990) little if any interaction with the Caddoan area is indicated. Thus, the Ray Roberts prehistoric data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of the [Late Prehistoric] period largely independent of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands. More recently, McGregor (personal communication 1999) has argued strongly for a “middle subperiod” of the Late Prehistoric that he dates between A.D. 1000 and 1350. He believes that arrow points with straight or rectangular stems are most diagnostic of this period and identifies three sites or site areas with relatively clean (or minimally mixed) components of this middle subperiod—the Cobb-Pool site, Area B at the McDonald site (41HI105) on Hackberry Creek on the middle Brazos River drainage, and Area F at the Haley’s Point site (34MA15) on the Red River (Brown et al. 1987; Peter and McGregor 1988; Rohn 1998). McGregor also notes that maize is common at Haley’s Point, as it is at Cobb-Pool, and suggests that these sites are representative of a relatively short-lived, region-wide subsistence pattern involving a partial dependence on agriculture during this middle subperiod (McGregor, personal communication 1999). Sites dating to the Late Prehistoric period broadly defined, in other words after ca. A.D. 700, also are common downstream on the Trinity area of the Blackland Prairie. The collections studied during the Superconducting Super Collider project contain substantial numbers of both early (e.g., Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Colbert, Scallorn, and Steiner) and late (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz) 10

arrow points, but Yedlowski et al. (1998) note that early arrow points are more frequent, perhaps reflecting high population densities continuing from the Late Archaic period. Other than the Perdiz and Scallorn types, which have such widespread distributions, the arrow styles point to the east and north. The limited ceramic samples, containing sherds reminiscent of types such as Weches Fingernail Impressed, Killough Pinched, Maydelle Incised, and Poyner Engraved, also support interaction with Caddoan groups to the east (Yedlowski et al. 1998). The Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills Reservoir presents a similar picture, with most of the typed arrow points dating to the first half of the Late Prehistoric period and the more distinctive ceramics in the small collection relating to the early Caddoan types, Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Weches Fingernail Impressed (Duffield 1963). The Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir also yielded numerous early arrow points, as well as a respectable number of Perdiz points, along with a small collection of highly fragmented sherds (Sorrow et al. 1966). Three sites excavated at Cedar Creek Reservoir contained Late Prehistoric components, although materials of this age were common only at the Gossett Bottoms and Lacy sites (Story 1965). Early arrow point forms (e.g., Alba, Catahoula, Friley, Granbury, Scallorn, and Steiner) are better represented than late ones (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz), but not by much. Not surprisingly, ceramics are more frequent in this area than to the west and clearly are related to the Caddoan tradition to the east and northeast; some of the more distinctive decorated sherds were considered reminiscent of types such as Canton Incised, Killough Pinched, and Ripley or Wilder Engraved (Story 1965). The faunal remains from the Gossett Bottoms and Lacy sites, many of which probably relate to Late Prehistoric occupations, consist predominantly of deer, turtle, and small mammals, with bison occurring only in small numbers. Based on the feature evidence (or lack thereof), it appears that this part of the Trinity basin was occupied by mobile hunter-gatherers rather than sedentary groups during the Late Prehistoric period. Some of the best data concerning Native American use of the region during the Late Prehistoric period is from Richland-Chambers Reservoir. Sites dating to this interval are common at the reservoir, especially for the early half of the period, and it appears that there was a significant decline in population densities after about A.D. 1300 (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). The data suggest that most of the excavated sites with Late Prehistoric components were used for residential purposes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987), although there are some sites, for example the stream-side concentrations of mussel shells and artifacts at 41FT193 and 41NV139, which probably were used in a more limited fashion. The house patterns at the Bird Point Island site point to intensive use by sedentary hunter-gatherers during the first half of the period, and other components that are contemporaneous, slightly earlier, or later (e.g., at Bird Point Island, Adams Ranch, Irvine, and Little Cedar Creek) have middens and numerous features suggesting intensive use but no houses. These components may represent occupations that were seasonal in length. Macrobotanical remains point to use primarily of wild plant foods such as hardwood nuts, a variety of seeds, and tubers/rhizomes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). The only tropical cultigen is maize, and it occurs in very small quantities only in contexts dating to the last half of the period. Hence, groups who lived in this area were predominantly hunters and gatherers. The arrow points that characterize the early and late parts of the period—Alba, Scallorn, and Steiner vs. Perdiz and Cliffton—are the same styles as found elsewhere across the area, and it appears that Gary dart points may have continued to be used through the early Late Prehistoric (McGregor and Bruseth 1987:183). Ceramics are moderately common and clearly relate to Caddoan wares, with most of the identified types (e.g., Maydelle Incised, Poyner Engraved, and Weches Fingernail Impressed) indicating contact with groups in the Neches River drainage, east of the Trinity. 11

During the Late Prehistoric II period (A.D. 1200-1600), influences from the Southern Plains became pronounced in the Cross Timbers and prairie areas. These influences coincided with an increase in bison herd size in northcentral Texas (Lynott 1981; Prikryl 1990). Bison was important to subsistence, but shrinking procurement territory sizes due to population increases continued the trend toward horticulture and settled village life (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). In terms of technology, a Plains Indian tool assemblage was common (Prikryl 1990). Items associated with this assemblage include calcareous-tempered ceramic vessels, some of which fit the description for the type Nocona Plain (shell-tempered), and unstemmed triangular arrow points such as Fresno, Harrell, Maud, Perdiz, and Washita points. Tools specific to bison processing include snub-nosed or thumbnail scrapers and edge-beveled Harahey knives. Bison scapula hoes, which also are common in Plains Indian sites, have been recovered from sites in the Lewisville Lake and Lavon Lake areas of Denton and Collin counties (Barber 1969; Harris 1945). The Plains Indian influences associated with settled village life were used to define the Henrietta complex of northcentral Texas. This complex, based on Krieger’s (1946) more expansive Henrietta focus, extends from the Red River south along the headwaters of the Trinity and Brazos rivers. The type-site, M. D. Harrell, is located along the Brazos River in Young County just northwest of Palo Pinto County in the drainage basin for Possum Kingdom Reservoir (Krieger 1946). The Harrell site and other associated sites contain middens, house structures, rock hearths, storage pits, and burials, and they most often are located on sandy knolls or terraces overlooking river valleys (Brooks 1989; Forrester 1994). Excavated sites attributed to the Henrietta complex include the Coyote and Glass sites located on the Red River in Montague County (Lorrain 1967; Woodall 1967a), and it is clear that sites such as Dillard in Cooke County are related as well (Martin 1994). The Henrietta complex as an investigative tool can be limiting since its loose definition tends to obscure local differences. More recent investigations in the upper Trinity River drainage have tended to highlight the local differences. At Ray Roberts Reservoir, for instance, Ferring and Yates (1997) see local trends emerging independent of extraregional influences. They cite the lack of evidence for extensive maize horticulture and the preponderance of short-term logistical camps as the basis of their hypothesis. Similarly, Peter and McGregor (1988) demonstrated that occupation of the Mountain Creek drainage was less intensive in the Late Prehistoric II period than before and that maize horticulture, if practiced at all, was limited. The adaptation developing in northcentral Texas after A.D. 1200 was truly distinctive from the Plains adaptations revealed to the northwest in Foard County (Peter et al. 1997). Protohistoric/Historic Native American The cultural divergences between northcentral and northeast Texas that began in the Archaic period continued into the Protohistoric and Historic periods. Various sociological factors, not the least of which was the colonization of New Mexico by the Spanish, caused drastic changes in the cultural makeup of northcentral Texas, as groups from elsewhere migrated into the area and existing groups were forced to adapt to their presence. Meanwhile, Caddoan groups continued to dominate the Northeastern portion of the state, although significant changes were occurring there also. 12

Prior to Spanish settlement of New Mexico in 1598, European presence in Texas was sporadic at best. After 1598, however, Spanish influence was never absent from the Southern Plains, although actual contact with Europeans continued to be limited and only brief records of journeys into or through the North Texas area exist (Hofman et al. 1989; John 1975). By the eighteenth century, immigrant Plains Indian groups had moved into and beyond North Texas, and their documentation by traders and explorers marks the start of the Historic period (A.D. 1600 to 1860; Prikryl 1993). Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River basin during the early historic era, it is not clear which specific aboriginal groups were residing in the present-day region at the beginning of this period. What is clear is that the early historic era in North Texas was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and amalgamation (see Newcomb 1993). Documentary sources suggest that the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai, Yojaune, Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo traversed the region at various times during the period (Campbell 1983; Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell 1982). Prior to about A.D. 1725– 1750, Apachean groups appear to have dominated the western portion of the Southern Plains, known as the High Plains. After that time, the area was increasingly controlled by the Comanche and Kiowa. On the eastern portion of the Southern Plains, within the area now known as the Lower Plains and northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes became dominant (Bell et al. 1967; Hofman 1989b:91). Available data suggest that many of the aboriginal occupants of the eastern margin of the Great Plains, including North Texas, were Caddoan language speakers, from the Arikara in the north to the Wichita and Kichai in the south. In this light, it is worth noting that it has also been suggested that the Socoatino, encountered by the survivors of the Hernando de Soto expedition in the sixteenth century, were Caddoan speakers and were the same as the Canohatino, identified by the French in the latter part of the seventeenth century, apparently located at that time “on the Blackland Prairies between the Guadalupe and Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin, and Waco” (Newcomb 1993:24). However, if the prehistoric occupants of the eastern margin of the plains in Texas were indeed Caddoan speakers, it would explain how they were absorbed very early by other Caddoan-speaking groups (such as the Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni, Taovayas, Iscani, and Wichita proper) who arrived in northcentral Texas in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Most of these groups, in turn, amalgamated to form the historic Wichita Tribe. Some, however, were probably absorbed by the united Caddo Tribes, and some may even have joined amalgamations of a variety of groups, such as the Tonkawa, during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The term Wichita is commonly used to refer to a group of linguistically related tribes, including the Wichita, Taovaya, Tawakoni, Iscani, Waco, and Kichai. Many of these groups apparently entered the Southern Plains in the seventeenth century, probably from Kansas and southern Nebraska, to escape the hostilities of the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita were true Plains Villagers, with an economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and bison hunting. They occupied permanent villages of beehive-shaped, grass houses, from which they conducted semi-nomadic bison hunts. In 1719, their villages were located along the Arkansas River in northern Oklahoma (Hofman 1989b:95). By 1750, they had moved some of their villages to southern Oklahoma, along the Red River. Others were located on the upper end of the Sabine and Neches rivers in Texas and subsequently on the middle Trinity and upper Brazos rivers. In 1759, the Taovaya village on the Red River was attacked by Diego Ortiz Parrilla, but was successfully defended. In 1772, the year they concluded a nominal peace with 13

the Spanish, one of their villages was on the Salt Fork of the Brazos, on the Lower Plains west of present-day Dallas/Fort Worth (John 1975:Map 3; Webb and Carroll 1952:2:705). Wichita groups were included in treaties made with the Republic of Texas in 1843 and with the United States in 1837 and 1856 (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:709). In Texas, they continued to live between the upper Brazos and Trinity rivers until 1855. In that year, the Tawakoni and Waco were placed on the Brazos Indian Reservation, south of Fort Belknap, in company with a number of other Native American remnant groups (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:212; 2:905). Subsequently, as a result of increasing animosity from white settlers, they were removed to Indian Territory in 1859 (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:210). The remnants of the Wichita moved to Kansas during the Civil War, but returned to Oklahoma after the war to settle permanently near present-day Anadarko (Hofman 1989b:95). Although archaeological sites that can be associated definitely with various historic-age groups are few, sites attributable to the historic Wichita have been identified at the edges of northcentral Texas. Among these is the Stansbury site (located in Hill County), but now inundated by Lake Whitney (Stephenson 1970). Excavations at the site produced burials, house structures, storage pits, and a variety of aboriginal artifacts along with European ceramics, glass beads, metal arrow points, and flintlock musket parts. A cluster of Wichita sites also occurs to the north along the Red River in Montague County. These sites are known collectively as “Spanish Fort” and occur on both the Oklahoma and Texas sides of the river. Woodall (1967b) excavated one of these sites, named the Upper Tucker site. The site produced artifacts and features similar to those discovered at the Stansbury site. Wichita sites on both the Brazos and Red rivers were located atop high terraces overlooking the rivers. Within the upper Trinity River basin, little evidence of these historic-age Indian groups has been found, with the exception of a few Native American sites with European items (Sollberger 1953). At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern Plains became commonplace. This was the result of increasingly peaceful relations between the Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the north, and the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory by the United States in 1803. HISTORIC BACKGROUND The first presence of Europeans in North Central Texas may have occurred in 1542, when the remnants of the de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered modern Texas in an effort to find a land route to New Spain. Some researchers believe that the expedition crossed North Central Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990:61), although others place the route much farther to the east and south (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Chipman 1992; Hudson 1986; Schambach 1989; Weber 1992). A consistent presence in the region did not occur until the early 1700s, when French traders from Louisiana began to move west along the Red River. The Spanish considered this French incursion to be a threat to the security of New Spain, and they responded by redoubling efforts to counterbalance the French influence with the Native Americans in East and North Central Texas. These efforts continued until 1763, when France ceded Louisiana to Spain under the Treaty of Paris. This reduced the perceived threat to the security of New Spain and resulted in a reduction in Spanish investment in eastern and northern Texas. More important from the Native American viewpoint, was the severe military defeat inflicted on the Spanish by Wichita and allied tribes at Spanish Fort on the Red River in 1758. It has been argued that this defeat put an end to Spanish military and missionary expansion to the north (Weddle 1964, 1965). 14

The first Euro-Americans to settle in the region were primarily from Arkansas Territory. The first permanent settlement in the Dallas area was Bird’s Fort in present-day Tarrant County, established in 1840. Also in 1840, John Neely Bryan reconnoitered the Dallas area to determine its suitability for a trading post. By the time Bryan returned in 1842, troops of the Republic of Texas had removed the Native American groups with whom he had intended trading. As a result, Bryan determined to found a settlement, along with five families from Bird’s Fort, in the same area where downtown Dallas is today. Prior to this, in 1841, the Republic of Texas had contracted with the Texan Emigration Land Company to establish 600 families on a land grant encompassing portions of the modern Dallas, Denton, Cooke, Collin, Grayson, Ellis, and Wise counties. This land grant became known as the Peter’s Colony. The majority of the Peter’s Colony settlers held property north of Dallas. The Peter’s Colony continued until 1852, when disputes about land title between the Texan Emigration Land Company and the settlers came to a head and some of the settlers rose up in arms to defend their title to the land they had settled. Dallas County was organized from Roberson County in 1846, with Dallas serving as the county seat (Works Projects Administration [WPA] 1992:38-50). Texas was annexed by the United States in 1846 and some Dallas area residents joined the American army facing the Mexicans. The California gold rush in 1849 affected Dallas in two ways. First, it was near a major trail for the “49ers” that utilized a ford across the Trinity River about seven miles north of Dallas. Second, many Dallas area residents were struck with gold fever. Some, including John Neely, trekked to California, while others explored the nearby Wichita Mountains for gold (WPA 1992:46-47). In 1855, another major colonizing venture was begun in the Dallas area when 200 French, Belgian, and Swiss immigrants arrived to found the utopian settlement of La Reunion, about three miles west of Dallas along the West Fork of the Trinity River. La Reunion was well funded, with initial capital of $600,000, but the residents did not adapt well to frontier conditions and the colony never really prospered. Gradually the members of the colony drifted away, with many becoming residents of Dallas. The colony officially dissolved in 1867 (WPA 1992:286-290). Although present, slavery did not loom as large in the economy of the Dallas area as it did farther to the east. In 1846, there were 45 slaves in Dallas County, a number that grew to 207 by 1850 (Prince 1993:10). In the 1860 census, Dallas County had a total population of 8,655 people, of whom 1,074 were slaves (Prince 1993:16). Most of the white residents of the county were southerners by birth and supported the pro-slavery side of the abolition question. As passions grew during the election of 1860, a fire swept through the Dallas business district, destroying all but one building. This was immediately assumed to be an abolitionist plot, resulting in the hanging of three African-Americans, the flogging of the remaining African-Americans in the county, and the whipping and banishment of two white preachers from Iowa (WPA 1992:53-54). Following the presidential election of 1860, Texas, in common with the rest of the South, began to consider secession. In a February 23, 1861, referendum on the issue, Dallas County voted 741 to 237 in favor of secession. Many county residents joined Confederate military units and, after a 516 to 3 vote on the issue, Dallas County donated $5,000 in gold to the Confederate cause. The Dallas area provided foodstuffs to the Confederate army, and in 1862 a small arms and ammunition factory opened in Lancaster, south of Dallas. Although the fighting never reached North Central Texas, the region became gradually impoverished by the war. Many of the commodities that were imported to the region became difficult to obtain and expensive, while the price of food had risen between two and four times its 1861 levels by September 1863. The 15

Dallas Herald was forced to cease publication between September 30, 1863, and July 2, 1864, due to a lack of newsprint. Following Lee’s surrender, the Federal Army occupied Texas and announced the emancipation of Texas’ slaves on June 19, 1865 (WPA 1992:55-58). Although the Dallas area suffered economically in the aftermath of the Civil War, it was not as badly affected as other areas of the former Confederacy. This greater economic vitality was fueled in part by streams of immigrants from the rest of the country, who were hoping to make a fresh start in the as yet unsettled West. Other elements in the economy included Dallas’ location near one of the cattle trails to Kansas and its role as a center of the buffalo hide market. In 1872, the Dallas economy received a major boost when the Houston & Texas Central Railroad reached the city from the south, while, in 1873, the Texas & Pacific Railway provided important access to points east. After the arrival of the railroads, Dallas began to acquire many of the trappings of a major city, including the beginning of a water distribution system (1873), gas lighting (1874), a private telegraph company (1875), the telephone (1880), and electricity (1882) (WPA 1992: 60- 70). An early dream of the Dallas business community was to gain water transport along the Trinity River. Efforts to make water transportation possible in the area began with various construction projects in the 1860s from Galveston to Dallas. After the railroads arrived in Dallas, interest in river navigation began to wane, although several small steamers continued to ply the Trinity, some of which are thought to have made the trip from Galveston to Dallas. In 1881, the state government was asked for $75,000 to remove obstructions from the river. During the 1890s interest in Trinity River navigation revived, and the Trinity River Navigation Company was formed in 1891. A dam was built at McCommas Bluff to provide sufficient water for the company’s steamer The Harvey, and it spent the next few years carrying cargo between Dallas and the dam. In 1898, the Harvey made a four-month voyage downriver to Galveston. In 1899, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers submitted a plan to construct 37 locks and dams between Dallas and the Gulf of Mexico, permitting navigation of the Trinity River for eight months of each year. The plan went on to suggest that if a series of artesian wells were to be dug along the river channel, adding to the water flow, year-round navigation would be possible. In 1902, Congress appropriated $750,000 to improve the Trinity River, with another $500,000 being appropriated in 1904-1905. In addition, the citizens of Dallas contributed $66,000 for the construction of a dam at Parson’s Slough, 26 miles below the city. Nine locks were built before the beginning of World War I. In 1916 the project was reevaluated, with a new estimate of another $13 million and 15 years being required to complete the project. Finally, in 1921, the Corps of Engineers recommended that any efforts to make the Trinity navigable above Liberty were impractical and should be abandoned. In 1930, renewed interest in river navigation led to the creation of the Trinity River Canal Association, which in turn sponsored the creation of the Trinity Watershed Soil Conservation and Flood Control Association in 1936. These two organizations later merged to become the Trinity Improvement Authority (TIA). In 1955, the State of Texas created the Trinity River Authority (TRA). Lobbying on the part of the TIA and TRA led to passage of the Trinity River Basin Bill in 1963; however, the bill merely authorized the project and contained no funding. Due to the huge backlog of river and harbor improvement projects approved by congress, no funding was ever appropriated for the project. The dream of a navigable Trinity River once again died in 1979, when the Corps of Engineers again determined that navigation of the Trinity River upstream of Liberty was not economically feasible (Jadrosich 1996; McElhaney 1995; Saunders 1991). 16

The history of Dallas is punctuated with several severe floods, with the floods of 1844, 1858, 1866, 1871, 1890, 1908, and 1913 being particularly memorable. Following the 1908 flood, the City of Dallas determined to try to reduce the impact of Trinity River flooding. This led to the construction of the Houston Street Viaduct, a 5,106-foot long concrete bridge constructed to ensure communication between Dallas and Oak Cliff even in the event of a major flood. A series of severe floods in the early 1920s led to renewed interest in flood control projects on the part of the local government. In 1926, the Dallas County Commissioners created the City and County of Dallas Levee Improvement District, which formulated the Ulrickson Plan for flood control. This plan called for the construction of levees, straightening and moving the river channel, additional viaducts, storm water drainage, and other improvements. Funds in excess of $15,000,000 dollars were provided for the project by the Levee Improvement District, The City and County of Dallas, and affected utilities and railroads. Among these improvements were the Cadiz Street Viaduct (completed in 1932), the Corinth Street Viaduct (completed in 1933), and the Lamar-McKinney Viaduct (completed in 1934) (Skinner, Whorton, and Trask 1996:18; WPA 1992:85, 94-96, 154- 156). By 1900, Dallas had become a major commercial and manufacturing center and, with a population of 42,638, was the third largest city in Texas. In 1908, a devastating flood occurred along the Trinity River, with the river cresting at 51.3 feet. The flood caused tremendous property loss, estimated at $2,500,000, and left 4,000 people homeless. The flood shut down the Dallas and Oak Cliff water systems and caused the collapse of the Texas and Pacific Railroad trestle across the Trinity, as well as threatening several other bridges. During World War I, Dallas served as a training base for aviators, with Love Field and Camp Dick (at the State Fairground) being used for training. During the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan became a factor in local politics, achieving particular importance between 1921 and 1924. Dallas’ first radio station, WRR, was established in 1921, originally as a means of broadcasting emergency messages to the fire department. By 1927, WRR had become a commercial station. Beginning in 1930, Dallas began to be severely impacted by the Great Depression (WPA 1992:80-97, 266-267). The economy of Dallas, and of the nation as a whole, did not begin to recover from the Depression until the mobilization for World War II began. After the war, the Dallas economy continued to grow along with the rest of the nation. Dallas’ image was shattered by the Kennedy assassination on November 22, 1963, and it took many years to recover from this blow. A major economic downturn occurred in the late 1980s, when a drop in oil prices and the collapse of the real estate market dealt a severe blow to the Texas economy. This forced the Dallas region to diversify economically, investing heavily in the modern high-tech industries. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS The history of archaeological investigations within the upper Trinity River drainage and the culture-historical framework for the area are aptly summarized in three major reports concerning the archaeology of the upper Trinity River basin (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational archeologists have resulted in the documentation of numerous sites, much research remains to be done. As noted by McGregor (1988:27-29), much of the excavation efforts within the upper Trinity River basin have focused on reservoir development, especially along the Elm Fork (Brown and Lebo 1991; Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Ferring and Yates 1997, 1998; Lebo 1995a, 1995b; Lebo and Brown 1990; Skinner 1982a, 1982b; Skinner and Baird 1985) and the East Fork 17

(Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Jurney, Lebo, and Green 1988; Peter and McGregor 1988) and test excavations at the River Bend site, 41TR68 (Peter et al. 1987), have provided the initial data assemblage necessary for understanding prehistoric adaptations along the West Fork of the Trinity River. Reservoir studies along the East Fork have included work at Lake Ray Hubbard and Lake Lavon, east and northeast of Dallas, respectively. Lake Lavon was surveyed in 1949 with test excavations conducted at the Campbell Hole (41COL10) and Hogge Bridge (41COL1) sites (Stephenson 1949a). Additional excavations at the Hogge Bridge site resulted in the formal definition of the Wylie focusa Late Prehistoric manifestation believed to be characterized by arrow points, flexed burials, large pits, and trade pottery from cultures to both the east and west (Stephenson 1952). Later excavations were undertaken by Southern Methodist University (SMU) as a result of the planned enlargement of Lake Lavon (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lynott 1975). Lake Ray Hubbard was surveyed with the help of members of the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) in 1963 (Harris and Suhm 1963). Subsequent excavations were conducted at the Glen Hill (41RW4) and Upper Rockwall (41RW2) sites (Ross 1966), and the Lower Rockwall site (41RW1; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968). Much of this work concentrated on excavations at sites with “Wylie focus pits” in an effort to better comprehend the function of these large features. A low level of professional work continues within the East Fork basin, most of which is in compliance with the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act (Austin 1993a; Cliff et al. 1989, 1996; Hunt 1993; Hunt and Cliff 1998; Hunt and Peter 1996a, 1996b, 1998a; Hunt, Peter, and Allday 1991; Hunt et al. 1992; Peter et al. 1990; Skinner 1990a, 1990b, 1993). In addition, a Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric occupation site (41DL203) adjacent to Rowlett Creek was tested and mitigated by Geo-Marine and provided significant data on prehistoric subsistence patterns (Tinsley and Dayton 2009). These investigations revealed a sequence of occupations within two meters of Late Holocene sediments dating between 3,000 and 750 B.P. The presence of contracting-stemmed Gary points within the Late Archaic period deposits indicates connections with populations to the east rather than to Central Texas or the Rolling Plains. Research on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River, west of Dallas, has largely centered on Lewisville Lake and Lake Ray Roberts, farther north. As with Lake Lavon, R. L. Stephenson (1949b, 1950) surveyed the area of Lewisville Lake (then known as Garza-Little Elm Reservoir) in 1948. At least three sites (41DN5, 41DN6, and 41DN12) were tested by Stephenson, but the results were never published (Prikryl 1990). Subsequently, local avocational archeologists found and excavated the Lewisville site (41DN72). This is an apparent Paleo-Indian occupation site that yielded a Clovis point in association with extinct fauna and apparent hearths with radiocarbon dates of greater than 37,000 years ago (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961). Further work at the site in 1979 and 1980, while unpublished, indicated that the site is indeed of Clovis-age and that the early dates were derived from lignite coal (Prikryl 1990). More recent work at Lake Lewisville has included a shoreline survey by the Richland Archeological Society (Nunley 1973), a survey of the lake peripheries by the University of North Texas (UNT; Lebo and Brown 1990), test excavations of 23 prehistoric and 16 historic sites by UNT (Brown and Lebo 1991), and data recovery excavations at three historic and five prehistoric sites (Ferring and Yates 1998; Lebo 1995a). 18

Farther north along the Elm Fork, research at Lake Ray Roberts began in 1972 with a reconnaissance survey (Bousman and Verrett 1973). Several intensive surveys of the lake area (Skinner 1982a), site testing (Prikryl and Yates 1987; Skinner 1982b), as well as data recovery excavations at 26 historic and 12 prehistoric sites (Ferring and Yates 1997; Lebo 1995b; Skinner and Baird 1985) followed. Work within the Elm Fork valley unconnected with either of these two reservoirs includes field school excavations by the University of Texas, Arlington, at the Northlake site, 41DL234, on Grapevine Creek, in the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975); a summary of Elm Fork prehistory based on excavated data and surface collections (Prikryl 1990); data recovery excavations at site 41DL270, along Denton Creek (Anthony and Brown 1994); and several smaller survey and evaluation projects (Hunt and Peter 1997a; Hunt, Shanabrook, and Peter 1991; Hunt, White, and Gaither 1996; Hunt et al. 1995; Skinner and Kent 1998). Phase II archaeological investigations conducted by Geo-Marine along the President George Bush Turnpike resulted in the discovey of site 41DL391, which yielded important information concerning the nature of subsistence patterns during this portion of the Late Prehistoric period for the site produced the first evidence of the use of knotweed seeds and onions within northcentral Texas (Peter et al. 2002). Research along the West Fork of the Trinity River got a late start with investigations at Joe Pool Lake. Located on Mountain Creek in southwest Dallas County, Joe Pool Lake was originally known as Lakeview Reservoir. Field work began in 1977 with a survey that recorded 42 sites within the project area, including Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic sites (Skinner and Connors 1979). Test excavations were then undertaken at 15 prehistoric and eight historic sites (Ferring and Reese 1980; Raab et al. 1980, 1982). North Texas State University investigated an area on the West Fork of the Trinity River and recorded two prehistoric sites (41DL224, 41DL225) (Yates and Ferring 1986). Finally, data recovery excavations were conducted from 1984 to 1986 at six prehistoric and 13 historic sites (Jurney, Lebo, and Green 1988; Peter and McGregor 1988). More recent excavations along the West Fork include limited excavations conducted at the River Bend site, 41TR68 (Peter et al. 1987); sites 41TR119 (Edwards and Peter 1991); 41TR138 in Fort Worth (Largent et al. 1994; Peter et al. 1998); the Fountain site (41TR136) in Arlington (Hanson and Kvernes 1997). In addition, numerous small cultural resource surveys and site evaluations have been conducted within the West Fork basin (Austin 1993b; Brown 1988; Burson and Cliff 1999; Edwards 1991; Hunt 1991, 1997; Hunt and Krapf 1996; Hunt and Peter 1993a, 1993b, 1995, 1996c, 1997b, 1997c, 1998b; Hunt, Peter, and Morrell 1996; Hunt, Peter, and Wright 1996; Hunt et al. 1993, 1994; Krapf and Hunt 1996; Peter and Cliff 1988; Peter and Gaither 1990; Peter et al. 1994). In addition to these large projects, many smaller cultural resources investigations have been conducted within or near the current project area. During 1974 and 1975, North Texas State University (NTSU; now known as the University of North Texas) conducted an archaeological reconnaissance within the flood plain of Fivemile Creek where six sites were investigated (McCormick 1976). In 1981, ECI undertook a survey for the Dallas Floodway Extension in which 22 sites were investigated (Bennett et al. 1981). Sites 41DL69 and 41DL70 were tested in 1990 by AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC; Skinner et al. 1990), in relation to the Rochester Park Levee, and then were reassessed in 1997 by Geo-Marine (Cliff et al. 1998). Also in 1990, ARC began a cultural resources survey of a proposed new levee and associated borrow pits at the CWWTP (Skinner et al. 1991; Skinner and Whorton 1995), after which Geo-Marine reassessed the sites found (41DL318, 41DL319, 41DL337, 41DL338, 41DL355, 41DL356, and 41DL357; Buysse 2000; Cliff et al. 1998). ARC again visited the area in 1993 for an archaeological survey around Little Lemmon Lake and recorded sites 41DL350 and 41DL351 (Skinner and Whorton 19

1993). ARC also conducted testing beginning in 1992 for the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) commuter light rail system and recorded two sites (41DL362, 41DL363) (Skinner et al. 1995; Skinner et al. 1996). Then between 1995 and 1997, two historic sites (41DL370, 41DL371) were found when ARC monitored several construction projects within the Dallas Floodway (Skinner, Whorton, and Trask 1996; Trask et al. 2008). In 1997, Geo-Marine conducted an archaeological, architectural, and geoarchaeological evaluation of the area of the proposed Dallas Floodway Extension, which ran from the existing Dallas Floodway south to Interstate 20 (Cliff et al. 1998). In the Downtown Dallas district, small loci were given significant attention, including the Old Dallas County Courthouse (41DL259; Westbury 1985), the Pioneer Cemetery (41DL390; Cooper et al. 2000), the John F. Kennedy Exhibit (41DL279; Jurney and Andrews 1994) and the Pegasus Project (Green and Peter 2003). 20

CHAPTER 3 KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES WITHIN AND ADJACENT TO THE DALLAS FLOODWAY Results of archaeological investigations of prehistoric and historic sites within the proposed Dallas Floodway area are presented in this chapter (Figure 2, Tables 2 and 3). The sites are described in numerical order (lowest to highest. Site descriptions consist of brief summaries of the results of previous work conducted at these sites. It should be noted that two of the previously designated prehistoric sites (41DL319 and 41DL357) were determined to be one site; therefore, both will be discussed as one site. Archaeological survey and evaluation efforts within the Dallas Floodway have spanned a period of over seven decades. Given that time span and changing archaeological methods and approaches, not all available data are equal in value. Furthermore, many of the landforms on which sites have been found have been altered significantly, resulting in the total destruction of some archaeological sites and the concealment of others. SITES 41DL21, 41DL22, 41DL23, 41DL52, 41DL53, 41DL54, 41DL59, 41DL63 AND 41DL64 Sites 41DL21, 41DL22, 41DL23, 41DL52, 41DL53, 41DL54, 41DL59, 41DL63 and 41DL64 were recorded in the early days of the Dallas Archaeological Society (DAS) in 1940 and 1941. All of these sites were recorded and mapped in 1940 and 1941 by Forrest Kirkland, R. King Harris, and L.P. McElroy when there was very little urbanization in this area. Each was described as being Caddoan surface camps containing sparse materials such as scrapers, flakes, blades, arrowheads, a notched ax, mussel shells, manos, but no ceramic sherds. SITE 41DL67 This site was originally recorded between the spring and winter of 1940 by Forrest Kirkland with the DAS. It is adjacent to the original Dallas Sewer Plant (Skinner and Whorton 1995:5-6). This prehistoric site was estimated to encompass an area of 18,823 square meters located on the edge of the Sewer plant. At that time, the area was almost fully destroyed by a sand and gravel operation. The surveys yielded mussel shells, arrow points, a lithic scraper, and numerous flint flakes.

returned to the area in 1975 only to find it completely disturbed from gravel and sand mining (Kirby 1975). No archaeological materials were observed. The present status of site 41DL67 is unknown. SITE 41DL68 Forrest Kirkland recorded yet another site in November of 1940, site 41DL68, which was investigated under the direction of Perry Overton. The site was located on a sand-covered clay terrace along Honey Grove Spring that stretched to the edge of the Trinity River bottom and encompassed an approximate area of 460 by 460 m. Also considered a Late Prehistoric Caddoan campsite, it contained a polished stone axe, two celts, two discoidals, a large muller (sic), and many arrowheads. The area had been built over, as the Overton homestead stood in the center of the site. Perry Overton grew up in the area, so his detailed contributions were valuable to the original assessment. Archival evaluation by Geo-Marine resulted in the conclusion that site 41DL68 be considered potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Cliff et al. 1998:105). SITE 41DL69 Site 41DL69 was originally discovered by Forrest Kirkland on March 19, 1936, with the site form being completed on December 22, 1940. The site was described as containing arrowheads, scrapers, flint flakes, one steatite pipe fragment, and potsherds. In 1978, the site was summarized as an example of a large surface scatter (Skinner et al. 1978:36-40). Diagnostic materials described for the site include Plainview points, Carrollton points and gouges, Waco sinkers, “Neo-American” arrowheads, a drilled stone gorget, a steatite pipe, and pottery, suggesting that the site was occupied during the Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. Many artifacts collected from the site by Bill Young were illustrated in the 1978 report; and in 1988, Young published an article illustrating even more of the artifacts collected from the site (Young 1988). Between 1940 and 1978, extensive gravel pits were dug in the site area. These appear to have destroyed much of the site context. Human bones have been collected from the site, but not as in situ burials, suggesting that the gravel mining may have destroyed an unknown number of mortuary features. The site was again investigated for the proposed Rochester Park Levee in 1990 (Skinner et al. 1990), at which time two test units were excavated at the site. Although site boundaries were not marked on the site map resulting from these investigations, it does illustrate the extent to which the gravel mining has disturbed the site area. Then in 1998, Geo-Marine revisited and tested site 41DL69 with six shovel tests, which yielded three flakes and a tested pebble (Cliff et al. 1998). The area containing the shallow prehistoric deposits covered only about 25 by 25 m. A small amount of recent historic material was observed in two shovel tests. As this part of the Trinity River bottoms appear to have served as an informal dump, the historic artifacts were considered to be materials dumped there within the last 50 years. In view of the multiple occupations present at this site, the high level of disturbance, and the shallow nature of the prehistoric deposits still present, the investigators of Geo-Marine recommended the site as ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP; Cliff et al. 1998:105). 28

SITE 41DL70 Site 41DL70 was originally recorded by Forrest Kirkland in December of 1940 and was found adjacent to site 41DL69. In 1990, the site was scheduled to be destroyed by the proposed Rochester Park Levee, which has since been constructed. Excavations were undertaken at the site by ARC of Dallas, Texas, prior to construction (Skinner et al. 1990). Approximately 75 percent of the sample recovered from the site consisted of lithic debris, with five cores and core fragments, a hammerstone, and a Clear Fork gouge. Historic artifacts were encountered during these investigations as well. The location of these artifacts is not described except to note that they “were found scattered through much of the deposit” (Skinner et al. 1990:55). The presence of the historic artifacts was attributed to natural movement in the soil and to rodent activity. The backhoe investigations found that the elevated areas originally assumed to be terrace remnants were in fact the result of recent land-filling activities. As a result of this work, the investigators concluded that “the majority of the site received significant disturbance due to past land use and is no longer in primary context” (Skinner et al. 1990:55). The site was revisited in 1997 by Geo- Marine where they found that levee construction had indeed destroyed or covered the site. A small area at the edge of the site area appeared as though it might still be intact. Two shovel tests were dug in this area, both of which showed evidence of disturbance. No prehistoric materials were recovered from the shovel tests, although a considerable quantity of historic material was found in the westernmost shovel test. Given the level of disturbance observed there, the material was believed to be the result of dumping or filling. It was apparent that site 41DL70 had been buried or destroyed by the construction of the Rochester Park Levee. The site was considered to be of poor integrity and was recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Cliff et al. 1998: 105). SITE 41DL71 Site 41DL71 was originally investigated by Perry Overton and Henry Hanna, and recorded by Forrest Kirkland on December 23, 1940. Kirkland described this site as a Late Prehistoric Caddoan site from a surface survey and test excavation units. The site lies at the south end of the Holmes St. Bridge on the Trinity River, on a sandy ridge at the edge of the river bottom, and encompassed an area of approximately 183 by 365 m. A unit dug by Overton contained six almost complete vessels and fragments of three effigy vessels. A cache of over 70 large lithic blades were found at another time about 10 m from the pit. Other materials observed included arrowheads and flakes. A burial was also found, but there is no description associated with this. The site was considered to be of good integrity and was recommended for eligibility in the NRHP by Geo-Marine in 1998 (Cliff et al. 1998: 105). SITE 41DL220 Site 41DL220 was first recorded by Tom Jamison and Maria Campbell of ECI, on May 7, 1981. The site was reported to consist of a limestone well, about 1 m in diameter, whose walls were collapsing toward the interior. The well had been filled to within 1.2 m of the surface and a hackberry tree grew out of the interior. Although the well was surrounded by a packed clay surface, this was interpreted as the result of bulldozing, rather than being a packed earthen floor. No artifacts were associated with the site, which was estimated to cover only 4 square meters. Site 41DL220 was revisited on August 5, 1997 (Cliff et al. 1998). The site area is now part of a 29

power line right-of-way that has removed all trees from the area. The power line right-of-way forms a small hollow, indicating that an estimated 40 cm of soil has been removed from it. In addition, two sewer pipelines were excavated through this area. The site area was scoured for any sign of the well, but no evidence of it was found, indicating that the site has been destroyed by all of the recent disturbances in this area. On this basis, it was recommended that site 41DL220 be considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Cliff et al. 1998:105). SITE 41DL221 In 1981, ECI was contracted to perform a cultural resources survey of the architectural, historical, and archaeological resources in the Dallas Floodway in portions of White Rock Creek and Fivemile Creek (Bennett et al. 1981). One of the sites, historic site 41DL221, was described briefly as a “non-datable concrete slab foundation” (Bennett et al. 1981:52). It is considered a historic standing structure with dimensions of 18 by 25 meters. The concrete slab lies 200 m southwest of the intersection of Overton Road and Sargent Road, about one kilometer west of US Route 75, and 75 m south of the Missouri Kansas Texas RR. The site was recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Bennett et al. 1981). SITE 41DL222 Site 41DL222 was recorded in 1982 by Archaeological Survey Associates during an electric transmission line survey when three flakes were observed in a bulldozed back dirt pile. No other materials were observed but the site was recommended for further testing should subsurface work in the future impact it. It was suggested that the site might provide information about what effects periodic alluviation from flooding might have on thin scatters of artifacts. To date no other work has been conducted at this site. SITES 41DL224 AND 41DL225 According to Yates and Ferring (1986:180) who attempted to relocate and reevaluate sites 41DL224 and 41DL225, these two sites are the ruins of historic bridges. Located on the West Fork, site 41DL224 has two cement piers and dates to sometime between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In contrast, neighboring site 41DL225 is a concrete bridge that dates to the 1930s. However, the investigators found that the sites were originally incorrectly plotted on the topographical maps in 1983. Their crew was able to relocate the sites and correctly map them. No further work was recommended (Yates and Ferring 1986). These two sites were recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. SITE 41DL250 In March of 1985, a report was submitted to Dallas County Public Works Department under a Texas Antiquities Committee permit by William Westbury who spent four days performing surface survey and excavation on the property surrounding the Old Dallas County Courthouse (Westbury 1985). Modern and historic debris was found during the testing. Westbury recommended that the site be considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (1985). 30

SITE 41DL279 Site 41DL279 is located at the site of the Dallas County Administration Building in the Central Business District of the city of Dallas, tested before construction of the John F. Kennedy Exhibit addition. The site was tested in 1987 by Freese and Nichols, Inc., and excavated in 1988 by the Archeology Research Program of Southern Methodist University (Jurney and Andrews 1994; Moir and Jurney 1987). Further investigation was recorded by David H. Jurney and Susan L. Andrews in 1994 due to an interest in modification of the northern face of the building for an elevator. Because this block was one of the first settled in this area, it consisted of the six discrete backyards of several early Dallas sites from 1850 to 1880. Buried remains found at 41DL279 included a hand-dug, brick-lined, bell-shaped well; the ash and fire pit created by a local washer woman; a make-shift fence of large bone and wood posts; privy pits; foundations and chimney bases; and plow scars from the earliest occupations. The excavations for this site have illustrated some of Dallas’ earliest history. SITE 41DL317 Site 41DL317 was originally recorded by Bill Young, Ray Hubbard, III, and Brenda Whorton, on December 13, 1990. It consists of the remains of the Millers Crossing Bridge across the Trinity River. The site is located upstream from the old Central Expressway Bridge over the Trinity River, approximately 180 m east of the I-45 Bridge, 380 m north of Overton Road, and 170 m downstream from the outflow channel from the Sargent Road and City of Dallas Sewage Plant. The bridge may date between the 1850s and 1930s; however we know the bridge was installed sometime after an 1898 flood washed away a ferry operation. In 1990, the site consisted of two, concrete-filled steel columns standing in the Trinity River channel (one complete and one broken), with fragments of the broken column lying along the southwest bank of the river. The complete column was described as standing about 13.7 m tall, while the broken column stood only about 1.2 m above water level. An evaluation of the site in August of 1997 by Geo-Marine resulted in the recommendation that the site be considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Cliff et al. 1998). SITE 41DL318 Paul Lorrain, Brenda Whorton, and Bill Young recorded site 41DL318 on June 19, 1991, while working for ARC on the Central Wastewater Levee Project (Skinner et al. 1991). The site measures approximately 75 m northwest-southeast by 50 m northeast-southwest and covers an area of approximately 3,750 sq. m. The area of the site was restricted by the cutbank along the Trinity River to the north, by Honey Springs Creek to the south and east, and by the disturbances related to the construction of the I-45 overpass on the west. The site was identified on the basis of five pieces of bone (probably deer), several mussel shells, and several small pieces of burned rock exposed in the southwest bank of the Trinity River. In addition, the cultural deposits were described as very thin, which suggested a short-term occupation. No diagnostic artifacts were identified. The site area was revisited by Geo-Marine personnel during the survey conducted in May and August of 1997 (Cliff et al. 1998). Three areas that contained shell were identified within a 25 m long area along the southwest bank of the Trinity River. In two of these areas, shell fragments 31

## Page 44

were observed in the slump along the river bank, but scraping of the bank itself failed to reveal the source of the shell. In the central area, in situ shell was found beginning approximately 1 m below the ground surface, with the lens about 20 cm thick. No other cultural remains were observed in association with the shell. Trackhoe trenches and test units excavated between the winter of 1998 and the spring of 1999 at 41DL318 produced varying amounts of shell, bone, burned clay, burned rock, as well as one feature (Buysse 2000). The site was utilized at least twice by prehistoric hunter-gatherers residing in the Dallas area—the first time probably during the latter part of the Late Archaic period or the early part of the Late Prehistoric period, and the second time during the Late Prehistoric period (i.e., sometime subsequent to A.D. 1000) (Buysse 2000). Radiocarbon dates suggest the upper cultural zone dates to the latter part of the Late Prehistoric I period, or later. No evidence was found to indicate more than a very short occupation on either occasion. No evidence of botanical resource-use was recovered. Only the later occupation yielded any evidence of lithic reduction, and this indicated only tool maintenance activities. The paucity of cultural material present suggested that this site will not yield additional information important to an understanding of prehistoric settlement-subsistence in the region. Therefore, it was recommended that 41DL318 be considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Buysse 2000). SITE 41DL319/357 Site 41DL319 was recorded by Paul Lorrain, Brenda Whorton, and Bill Young, on June 19, 1991, while working for ARC on the Central Wastewater Levee Project (Skinner et al. 1991). Site 41DL357 was recorded during a second survey of the area by S. Alan Skinner of ARC on September 8, 1993, as part of another investigation at the CWWTP (Skinner and Whorton 1995:16). Site 41DL319 was found in the southwest bank of the Trinity River, 30 m east of the former site of the Miller’s Crossing Bridge (41DL317), with site 41DL357 found 35 m east from the Miller’s Crossing Bridge. Both sites yielded bone, burned and unburned mussel shells, burned rock, flakes, bifaces, and points (Skinner et al. 1991, 1995). Both sites (41DL319, 41DL357) were revisited by Geo-Marine personnel in May and August of 1997 (Cliff et al. 1998). At that time, a low density scatter of shell fragments and rock was found in an eroded context along the southwest bank of the river in the area identified as 41DL319 and 41DL357. Unfortunately, the origin for this material could not be identified. In view of the apparent overlap of sites 41DL319 and 41DL357, the possibility was acknowledged that material exposed at the latter site had been redeposited from site 41DL319. A previously unidentified low density scatter of shell fragments was found west of the remnants of the Miller’s Crossing Bridge (41DL317), but once again the field crew was unable to determine the source for this material. Although it was considered possible that these shell scatters represented the remains of a shell lens largely destroyed by erosion; it was decided that significant cultural remains could still be present in this area. Then between the winter of 1998 and the spring of 1999, Geo-Marine revisited the sites, where they placed trackhoe trenches and hand excavated test units that proved sites 41DL319 and 41DL357 to be a single site (Buysse 2000). The excavations revealed concentrations of materials that consisted of mussel shell, animal bone, burned clay, and a few lithic artifacts, including two dart points. In addition, two burned clay features were discovered: one associated with a flake. Interpretation of the site deposits was severely hindered by the significant bioturbation 32

## Page 45

represented by the presence of modern refuse at depths of 250 cm below surface. Although the two diagnostic dart points date to the Late Archaic period as defined by the radiocarbon dates, the potential for significant bioturbation raised serious questions concerning the validity of the humate dates and the context of the charcoal dates. Radiocarbon dates of the West Fork soil profile at site 41DL319/357 indicated a range of 1,510 to 1,750 years for the paleosol. Faunal analysis suggested the possibility that the site inhabitants consumed raw as well as cooked clams. Overall, materials of unequivocal cultural origin were sparse, and cutbank erosion, bioturbation, and borrow pit activities from the early 1990s compromised the site’s integrity. Therefore, it was recommended that site 41DL319/357 be considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Buysse 2000). SITE 41DL320 Site 41DL320 is the old Forest Avenue Dump that was recorded by Bill Young, Ray Hubbard, and Brenda Whorton, on December 13, 1990. At that time, the site was estimated to cover 105,000 square m (350 by 300 m) and appeared to contain three separate areas. One area was dated to ca. 1900, while the remaining two areas were dated to the 1930s. Artifacts observed at the site included bottles, metal, ceramics, and glassware that were interpreted as representing primarily residential, as opposed to industrial, debris. A revisit in 1999 to site 41DL320 by the project Principal Investigator, a CESWF Technical Representative, and the staff Historic Archeologist of Geo-Marine indicated that little has changed since the August 1997 visit with the exception of a few more bottle collector excavations (Buysse 2000). The main part of the site appeared to consist of two large areas of landfill deposited in the 1930s. Here, the landfill rises approximately 2 to 3 m above the level of the flood plain. Thousands of whole bottles, bottle fragments, ceramic sherds, and metal fragments were observed on the surface of the landfill, despite the thick vegetation covering this area. The reconnaissance visit of site 41DL320 revealed that the majority of the material was commercial bottles and a thicker variety of ceramics known vernacularly as “hotelware.” The 1900s dump area appears to have been severely impacted by bottle collecting and possibly by erosion. Although the dump contains a significant body of data, it would be extremely difficult to link those data to a particular context. No additional archaeological investigations are warranted. The investigators at Geo-Marine recommended that site 41DL320 be considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Buysse 2000). SITES 41DL323, 41DL328, AND 41DL414 Two sites (41DL323, 41DL328) were originally recorded by Jan and Paul Lorrain in 1991. Site 41DL323 is the Proctor Street Bridge that spans the Elm fork about 150 m southwest of Highway 183. The style of the bridge suggests it was built in the 1890s, but archival research suggests it was probably built in the 1930s. This steel truss bridge is still intact, although it is closed to traffic. Site 41DL328 is the Claiborne Street bridge south of the West Fork, east of Loop 12, on Claiborne St about 50 m northwest of its intersection with Singleton Blvd. The bridge is approximately 60 by 60 m, possibly constructed by the Works Progress Administration. It is also across the river from 41DL225, which appears to be of identical construction. Their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP is unknown. 33

Site 41DL414 was originally recorded by the Lorrains in 2000. This is the site of another historic concrete bridge, the Santa Fe Bridge. It is a railroad bridge that runs parallel with and near the DART corridor. The bridge spans approximately 60 m with a suggested date of construction between 1903 and 1931. At the time of its last investigation, it was abandoned and closed to traffic. The eligibility of site 41DL414 for inclusion in the NRHP is unknown. SITE 41DL337 Site 41DL337 was recorded by S. Alan Skinner of ARC on September 8, 1992, during construction of an effluent outflow channel on the northeast side of the CWWTP (Skinner and Whorton 1995:15). The site was identified along the cutbank on the west side of the outflow channel that was under construction in 1991 and south of the small east-west drainage channel that empties into the outflow channel. The site is reported to have contained bison and deer bone, burned mussel shells, and one chert flake. The deposit appeared to be relatively thin, approximately 10 cm in depth at 3 m below surface. The site was identified when a cluster of mussel shells approximately 2 m square was “exposed and removed” by a machine scraper during construction of the outflow channel. The cluster was the thickness of a single layer of mussel shells and exhibited evidence of burning. No other artifacts were noted in association with the shell lens. After monitoring of the site for over a year, Skinner determined that the artifacts at site 41DL337 were not in situ, but rather disturbed by channel or earlier construction. Although no diagnostic artifacts were identified, occupation was placed in the Late Prehistoric period. This conclusion was probably based on the presence of faunal material identified as bison bone. The site was revisited on August 5, 1997 by Geo-Marine, but it was reported that no cultural material could be observed due to dense vegetation (Cliff et al. 1998). Therefore Geo-Marine returned to the site between the winter of 1998 and the spring of 1999 to conduct Phase II testing (Buysse 2000). Site 41DL337 was relocated on a slightly elevated ridge that was approximately 2 m above the existing water level. The testing identified a scattered deposit of fragmented mussel shell and small burned clay granules in the upper levels of the West Fork paleosol. No artifacts or features were identified. Heat alteration of several of the mussel shells indicated human activity. Nevertheless, the sparse amount of cultural material recovered did not promise to add new information to the current understanding of the prehistoric inhabitants of the upper Trinity River basin. Trenching at site 41DL337 determined the area to be heavily impacted from past activities relating to the CWWTP, including the construction of the settling pond immediately south of the area identified as the site, as well as the outflow channel to the north of the site. Due to the lack of cultural features, cultural artifacts, and the sparse nature of the shell remains, combined with the extensive disturbances that have been documented, site 41DL337 was recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Buysse 2000). SITE 41DL338 Site 41DL338 was also recorded by S. Alan Skinner of ARC on September 9, 1992, in conjunction with the construction of the effluent outflow channel on the northeast side of the CWWTP (Skinner and Whorton 1995:15). The site was discovered along the cutbank on the west side of the outflow channel then under construction and directly north of the small east-west drainage channel that empties into the outflow channel. It was reported to contain a shell lens approximately 3 m below ground surface that extended for about 3 m along the bank. Monitoring 34

of the site for more than a year revealed only mussel shell and, ultimately, no cultural material was exposed in the bank. Skinner concluded that the site was in a derived context (Skinner and Whorton 1995:15). The site was revisited on August 5, 1997 by Geo-Marine, but it was reported that little cultural material could be observed due to dense vegetation (Cliff et al. 1998). Therefore Geo-Marine returned to the site between the winter of 1998 and the spring of 1999 to conduct Phase II testing (Buysse 2000). Trackhoe testing indicated a significantly large accumulation of bivalve shells, small amounts of charcoal, bone, and burned clay. At least three vertically sequential concentrations of shell, including one shell feature, were observable and suggest fairly intense, though short-term, occupation of the site over a long period of time. Several heat-altered molluscan specimens were identified and indicate human activity. Smaller amounts of other faunal, particularly aquatic, remains were recovered and may also be by-products of human subsistence activity. Radiocarbon analysis of charcoal from the upper level of the paleosol correlated to the Late Prehistoric II period. However, destruction of the site from settling pond excavations by the CWWTP compromised the site’s integrity. Therefore, it was recommended that site 41DL338 be considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. SITE 41DL347 Site 41DL347 was identified during the investigations conducted for the DART commuter light rail system by ARC during the South Oak Cliff DART line investigations in 1992 (Skinner et al. 1995). Site 41DL347 is a trash dump dating between the late 1890s and 1930. SITE 41DL355 Site 41DL355 was recorded by S. Alan Skinner of ARC on September 8, 1993, during the construction of the effluent outflow channel on the northeast side of the CWWTP (Skinner and Whorton 1995:16). The site was located 3 m below ground surface on the west bank of the 1992 outflow channel, between the original effluent outflow channel and the outflow box of the more recent channel. Cultural material observed included mussel shell, some mammal bone fragments (probably deer), and fire-cracked limestone. The material was discovered in a deposit approximately 25 cm thick that extended approximately 11 m along the water’s edge. Skinner identified the occupation as Late Archaic or Late Prehistoric, although no diagnostic artifacts were observed. The site was revisited on August 5, 1997 by Geo-Marine, but it was reported that no cultural material could be observed due to dense vegetation (Cliff et al. 1998). Therefore Geo-Marine returned to the site between the winter of 1998 and the spring of 1999 to conduct Phase II testing (Buysse 2000). Trackhoe trenches revealed that site 41DL355 was heavily impacted from past activities related to the CWWTP. These activities included the construction of a settling pond immediately west of the area identified as the site, as well as the outflow channel immediately to the east. Although mussel shell remains were identified in the trenches, these remains were present only in zones identified as heavily disturbed and/or fill material. Investigations also indicated that the activities associated with the CWWTP completely destroyed the West Fork paleosol in the area identified as site 41DL355, and that the shell remains present in this area were in redeposited soils. Due to the lack of an intact cultural horizon, it was recommended that site 41DL355 be considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Buysse 2000). 35

SITE 41DL356 Site 41DL356 was recorded by S. Alan Skinner of ARC on September 8, 1992, during the construction of the effluent outflow channel on the northeast side of the CWWTP (Skinner and Whorton 1995:16). The site was located on the east bank of the outflow channel then under construction and across the channel from site 41DL355. Site 41DL356 was reported to consist of two shell lenses exposed approximately 3 m below ground surface and separated by approximately 50 cm of black clay. The shell lenses were exposed for approximately 20 m along the bank of the outflow channel. The presence of mammal bones (probably deer) was also noted. Skinner identified the occupation as Late Archaic or Late Prehistoric, although no diagnostic artifacts were observed. The site was revisited on August 5, 1997 by Geo-Marine, but it was reported that little cultural material could be observed due to dense vegetation (Cliff et al. 1998). An in situ shell lens was identified approximately 160 cm below surface, and several large shells were visible beneath the water surface in the channel below the site. The shells observed under water appeared to be larger than those observed along the channel bank. Due to this previous lack of accessibility, Geo-Marine returned to the site between the winter of 1998 and the spring of 1999 to conduct Phase II testing (Buysse 2000). Trackhoe trenches and excavation units revealed large quantities of mussel shell, small amounts of charcoal, burned clay, bone, and four possible features. Four features were identified: two small scatters of burned clay that may not have been cultural; a concentration of mussel shells; and a concentration of burned clay directly above the mussel shells. Deep deposits of bivalve shell, including several specimens that indicated heat alteration or charring, suggested human processing/consumption of freshwater bivalves and utilization of the site over a long period of time. Additional faunal remains indicated likely dietary supplementation with fish, turtle, and terrestrial mammals. Radiocarbon dates of the West Fork paleosol corresponded to the Late Archaic Period in the region. Disturbances from activities related to the CWWTP compromised the site’s integrity, and the site’s potential to yield new knowledge about the prehistory of the upper Trinity River basin was doubtful. Therefore, it was recommended that site 41DL356 be considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Buysse 2000). SITE 41DL362 Site 41DL362 was identified during the investigations conducted for the DART commuter light rail system by ARC during the South Oak Cliff DART line investigations in 1992 (Skinner et al. 1995). Site 41DL362 was the remains of a house site on the bluff above the flood plain dating from the 1850s to 1880s when it was concealed by railroad fill. Removal of an asphalt parking lot prior to excavation revealed a layer of fill material. Some of this fill material was related to the placement of the parking lot, but it was underlain by historic fill material put in place in the early 1880s for the construction and placement of new railroad spurs. This fill material sealed the probable early remains of the J. W. Swindells family home. The Swindell family arrived in Dallas in 1851, and J.W. Swindell soon afterward became the first editor of the Dallas Herald. Archival investigations indicated that the fill material was likely placed between 1885 and 1892, sealing the house remains. Due to the fragmentary condition of the property, it was not recommended for further work, nor as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Skinner et al. 1995). 36

SITE 41DL363 Site 41DL363 was yet another site discovered during the investigations conducted for the DART commuter light rail system by ARC during the South Oak Cliff DART line investigations in 1992 (Skinner et al. 1995). Site 41DL363 is a short-term historic dump that was used between 1900 and 1916. The limited size and types of materials indicate that the dump was likely from a single residence rather than a large-scale commercial dump. The site was exposed during excavation and construction of tunnels from Union Station to Reunion Tower. Materials were located approximately 80 cm below the present surface under a gravel fill layer and sloped toward the north along the original contour of the ground surface, and extended about another meter in depth. ARC recommended that the site be considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Skinner et al. 1995). SITES 41DL370 AND 41DL371 Sites 41DL370 and 41DL371 were recorded by ARC in 1995 during the Trinity River Expansion investigations (Skinner, Whorton, and Trask 1996). Site 41DL370 consists of two features: a hand-dug well located about 525 m from the Corinth Street Bridge and a dump at about 233 m west of the well. The well from site 41DL370 was composed of bricks, some stamped with “STANDARD” (Skinner, Whorton, and Trak 1996:22). Materials found within the dump of 41DL370 included bottle tops, screw top bottle fragments, brick fragments, metal, and glass. Because ARC considered site 41DL370 to have little integrity, they recommended it as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Skinner, Whorton, and Trask 1996:28). Site 41DL371 consists of a dump from the 1880s to 1920s, located about 856 m from the Corinth Street Bridge. The exposure measured about 0.2 to 1 m thick and extended for 35 m east/west. Materials noted from this dump included faunal bones, oyster shells, historic ceramics, glass bottle fragments, and identifiable glass medicine bottle fragments (see Skinner, Whorton, and Trask 1996:27). Based on the maker’s marks of these fragments, the dump was dated to the early 1900s. Because site 41DL371 appeared to be older than 50 years and in a primary context, the site was recommended as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Skinner, Whorton, and Trask 1996:28). SITE 41DL389 Site 41DL389 was recorded by Elizabeth Burson and Maynard Cliff in August and September of 1999, as part of an investigation at the Old West Fork of the Trinity River in Dallas County (Burson and Cliff 1999). The site is located at the intersection of Bickers and Furey in southwest Dallas; more specifically at the intersection of the Bickers extension and the channelized drainage. The excavation of a backhoe trench revealed a prehistoric deposit at 1 m below surface. The deposit included a minimally utilized flake, several medium to large mammal bone fragments, and several other bone fragments. Other trenches exposed undisturbed West Fork paleosol. The authors found that site 41DL389 possibly dated to the Late Prehistoric period due to correlations with similar deposits from other sites (Burson et al. 2000; Ellis 1998; Ferring 1994). The investigators at Geo-Marine recommended further archaeological investigation at this site in order to determine eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP (Burson and Cliff 1999). 37

SITE 41DL390 The Dallas Pioneer Cemetery, site 41DL390, is one of the oldest cemeteries in Dallas and is made up of the remaining portions of the Masons, Oddfellows, Jewish, and Old Dallas cemeteries that occupied that hilltop during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Much of that hilltop is now covered with the Dallas Convention Center. The cemetery was recorded as an archaeological site during the 1999 excavation and reinterment of burials from an area of the hilltop where a new driveway for the convention center was being constructed (Cooper et al. 2000). The Pioneer Cemetery (41DL390) is listed on the NRHP (Cooper et al. 2000). SITE 41DL410 Site 41DL410, investigated by Lopez Garcia Group in 2002, consisted of two structures: a concrete wall that was possibly part of an old gas meter house; and a brick wall possibly associated with an 1885 pumphouse. These features were found during trenching at approximately 65 cm below surface and extended to a depth of nearly 1.7 m below surface. According to the state site form, an auxiliary water pumping station at this location was denoted on an 1885 Sanborn map, but is a vacant lot on the 1888 Sanborn. The location of this site is very near that of 41DL362 and, therefore, was cleared and filled at approximately the same time. Both of these structures were left in place and are currently under a parking lot. SITES 41DL440 AND 41DL441 Sites 41DL440 and 41DL441 were recorded by Charles Frederick, Lance K. Trask, and Alan S. Skinner from ARC in 2006 for the archaeological testing project of the Trinity Parkway in Dallas, Texas (Frederick et al. 2006). During backhoe trenching along this area, a deposit of an early twentieth century trash dump, site 41DL440, as well as a hearth, site 41DL441, were discovered. The trash deposit (41DL440) was found underneath a fill layer of limestone rubble, building demolition debris, dirt, and gravel at 170-190 cm below surface. The artifact assemblage included intact clear glass bottles, whiteware ceramic sherds, unidentifiable metal fragments, a gas burner, and two railroad spikes. Some of the glass bottles were known to date around 1900, although their design standard dated to around 1919 (Lief 1965:27). The whiteware ceramics seem discolored and thus suggested exposure to fire. The perched water table and the instability of the trench walls prevented further investigation of the extent of the trash dump. The area had been disturbed due to borrowing, and also had a mixture of various soil types and vegetation. Land fill was exhibited in some areas through slight elevation changes. Vegetation was also sparser, less mature, and browner in areas with fill. It was observed that crayfish burrows were characteristic in areas with land fill (Frederick et al. 2006:16). The site was recommended as ineligible. Site 41DL441 was a Protohistoric hearth based on radiocarbon dates of the charcoal. Because further testing was recommended, ARC returned in 2006 to excavate further (Trask et al. 2008). Backhoe trenches were excavated in this site, only to yield a sherd of a historic glass bottle within an ash lens. This single artifact led ARC to conclude that the hearth is evidence of a single campfire on the West Fork and that it was younger than originally thought. The site was not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP. 38

SITE 41DL494 This site was recorded by A. Tiné of C Dimensions in November of 2009 as part of their Fiji HUD survey. It is located approximately 30 m west of the intersection of South Corinth St. and 11th St. in Oak Cliff. The site is approximately 35 by 50 m and is bounded by 11th St on the north, Avenue A on the east, Avenue C on the south, and fenced vacant property to the west. Cedar Creek lies about 199 m to the north of the site. Tiné conducted reconnaissance survey and shovel testing which yielded three whiteware fragments, four wire nails, three types of bottle glass, and coal fragments. Disturbance at the northern end of the site resulted from the presence of a concrete storm sewer to the west. Site 41DL494 was recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. 39

CHAPTER 4 CONTEXTUAL INTEGRITY WITHIN THE DALLAS FLOODWAY This chapter is organized into three sections describing factors that influence the contextual integrity of archaeological deposits within the Dallas Floodway. The first section is an assessment of fluvial depositional systems and their relationship to site preservation. The second describes the pedoturbation of the soil as it affects cultural deposits. The third is a discussion of historical land use within the Dallas Floodway and its effect on contextual integrity of archaeological deposits. FLUVIAL DEPOSITIONAL SYSTEMS AND SITE PRESERVATION Active floodplains of fluvial systems are often viewed as poor sites for the formation and preservation of cultural deposits. In fact, given the stability of many portions of active floodplains and the availability of fresh sediment to bury and preserve, this is not the case in many instances. The characteristics of a local fluvial depositional system can have a significant impact on the formation and preservation of buried, stratified cultural deposits. These characteristics include factors such as the width of the river’s meander belt compared to the width of its active floodplain and the width of its valley, depth to bedrock, the type and amount of sediment carried, whether it is a meandering or braided stream, whether the river is aggrading its floodplain or entrenching in it, and the variation between peak and average water flow. First, only in the river’s active meander belt is significant erosion taking place. Everywhere else on the floodplain, deposition is taking place albeit at differing rates. Even in the active meander belt, there are areas of active deposition such as point bars, levees, and crevasse splays. If the river’s valley and active floodplain are wide in comparison to the meander belt, then the chance of formation and preservation is greater since there are likely to be relic terraces at the margins of the valley and large areas of the active floodplain outside of the meander belt (i.e., the flood basin or back swamp) that remain undisturbed for long periods of time. Depth to bedrock also has a role since deep valleys allow for the accumulation of large amounts of sediment if the river is aggrading (that is, the level of the floodplain is rising over time) as well as providing protection for pre-existing deposits if the river begins to entrench or down-cut its channel since it must cut through and remove a vast amount of sediment. Conversely, narrow, shallow valleys would be hostile to the preservation of cultural sites, particularly older ones. 41

Similarly, sediment type and variations in water flow can affect site preservation. Sand-rich streams with wide variation in peak and average water flow tend to produce braided, low sinuosity, or anastomosing channels which in turn cover more of the active floodplain and move more rapidly from side to side, removing or reworking earlier deposits. On the other hand, clay- rich streams with less variation will often produce very sinuous, meandering channels with relatively narrow active meander belts limiting the area of potential erosion. Further, since this type of meandering river often changes its position on its floodplain by means of avulsion or jumping from one spot to another, old meander belts, often a prime spot for cultural deposits, will be preserved and slowly buried under clay-rich back swamp deposits. Lastly, the clay-rich nature of the sediments may also retard erosion and the movement of the active channel again aiding in the preservation of earlier deposits. Applying this general discussion to the Trinity River within the Dallas Floodway, it will be noted that the Trinity is a highly sinuous stream which carries clay and silt-rich sediments. The active meander belt in many areas is relatively narrow compared to the width of its floodplain and valley and the depth to bedrock in many areas (15 to 20 m) is several times the thickness of the deposits of its active meander belt (5 to 10 m). There are a few areas such as the area near the present Corinth Street Bridge where the valley is very narrow and only 2.5 to 4 m deep, but this is the exception rather than the rule (Cliff et al. 1999). There is clear evidence that the Trinity’s active channel has shifted by the process of avulsion allowing for the preservation of earlier deposits. The clay-rich sediments have also greatly retarded the speed with which the active channel has moved within its meander belt as can be seen from radiocarbon dates from deposits of the Late Holocene period in the area west of Hampton Road bridge showing them to be 2000 to 3000 years old (Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 12). Taken together, all of this strongly indicates that buried, stratified cultural deposits of a considerable age could be preserved in the Trinity River floodplain near Dallas. PEDOGENIC DEVELOPMENT One of the many factors impacting the archaeological contextual integrity of the region, as well as the Dallas Floodway, is the argilliturbation of the soils native to northcentral Texas. According to James T. Abbott (2001:84), argilliturbation “refers to soil mixing resulting from the expansion and contraction of clays in the solum and subsoil with repeated wetting and drying.” In view that the soils of the Dallas Floodway are high in clay content (Ferring 1999; Cliff et al. 1999; Frederick et al. 2006), argilliturbation occurs within the Dallas Floodway. More specifically, this area is also considered to contain vertisols, or rather, soils that are inclined to vertisolic pedoturbation. “Vertic pedoturbation is itself a function of two related processes, upward movement of large objects by incremental heave processes, and infilling of cracks by loose soil material during dry seasons” (Abbott 2001:85). Debris found on the ground surface can fall into the cracks of dry, contracting clay, which then expands again with the added hydration. Over a period of repeated contraction and expansion, the debris will fall deeper. This process and its repercussions can affect archaeological interpretation. Vertisolic pedoturbation can also develop soil features, such as gilgai (Abbott 2001:85; Frederick et al. 2006:36). According to Abbott (2001:85), “Gilgai consist of a form of patterned ground associated with, and usually attributed to, the cumulative effect of long-term shrink-swell processes… …Gilgai are characterized by a pronounced surface topography of regular, small-scale humps and depressions.” These can be seen in Frederick et al.’s (2006:37) Figure 18 on the floodplain between Westmoreland and Inwood roads. Vertisolic pedoturbation and gilgai are just two complexities among natural processes that impact the contextual integrity of archaeological deposits. 42

LANDUSE ACTIVITIES In order to assess the potential of the Dallas Floodway to contain buried archaeological properties with contextual integrity, it is necessary to determine the location and degree of disturbed areas along the Floodway. Previous investigations within the Dallas Floodway have all recognized a certain degree of disturbance, but it is only in the past two decades that investigators have looked to historical documentation as a means of documenting areas of disturbance. The primary sources for such research are historical maps and aerial photographs. The earliest map we consulted was Sam Street’s 1900 map of Dallas County, Texas (Figure 3). The map illustrates the forested area of the Elm and West forks of the Trinity River as well as the cleared zones further downstream and into the downtown area. The cleared zones were for agricultural and farming functions, except for the downtown area. As a result of intensive farming along the Elm and West forks, the land became leveled and the floodplain was flattened (Frederick et al. 2006:23). A later 1917 map of the area (see Frederick et al. 2006:Figure 3) exhibited little change to the landscape. Although there is no gravel mining activity at this time, farming is still apparent from the short dirt roads and fenced tracts. According to a 1920 Bureau of Soils map from Frederick et al. (2006:Figure 4), features that appear include two gravel mining areas, roads, railroad development, and the Dallas City Water Reservoir (Frederick et al. 2006:20). By the late 1920s, aerial photos became available and were used for this review. Frederick et al. (2006:Figure 5) provide an undated aerial photo of Dallas County before levee construction. By this time, the larger, fenced tracts included low vegetation and reforestation (Frederick et al. 2006:20). When levee construction and river channelization began by 1929, the floodplain was partially cleared for agricultural use and five gravel mining areas appear in the West Area, according to Frederick et al. (2006:21, Figure 6). In contrast, the downtown Dallas area had no levee construction or channelization and the areas southeast of this remained farmland. According to a 1930s aerial photo, the levee construction had progressed and river channelization was finished in the West Area (Figure 4; Frederick et al. 2006: 21). A 1953 aerial photo (Figures 5, 5a, 5b) exhibits increased levee construction, river channelization along the East and West levees, and road and bridge construction. The Floodway southeast along Rochester Park and the CWWTP appears to have retained some agricultural function, as well as reforestation in places. By 1970, the Dallas Floodway exhibited filled and leveled areas, rechannelization, road and bridge construction, and increased vegetation and foliage in areas (Figures 6, 6a, 6b). According to Frederick et al. (2006:Figure 9), increased mining activity is evident from spoil piles and mining scars in the 1970s. Close examination and comparison of the 1970 and 2008 aerial photos (Figures 7, 7a, and 7b) revealed that many changes to the Dallas Floodway have occurred since 1970. It should be noted that changes which appear in 2010 aerial imagery (i.e., Google Earth) are noted in the 2008 aerial photo. Much of the development included construction of roads, bridges, wetland cells, channelization, and the CWWTP. The section of the Dallas Floodway near Rochester Park and the CWWTP and surrounding IH-45 was greatly modified. River meanders were straightened, channels were filled and leveled, and wetland cells were created (see Figure 7b). Many areas that were previously developed were leveled and reforested. In addition, increased vegetation is visible along the banks of the Trinity River and in other areas (see Figures 7, 7a, 7b). 43

Historic landfills (Figure 8; Table 4) also make up approximately 13 percent of the known archaeological sites described above (41DL320, 41DL347, 41DL363, 41DL370, 41DL371, and 41DL440). The predominance of commercial and industrial refuse likely reflects the early growth and industrialization of Dallas from the late 1890s to the 1930s; yet it also influences site integrity. Although many dumps have been designated as rich in archaeological data, such as the old Forrest Avenue Dump (41DL320), the potential for hazardous waste contamination is significant. Gravel and sand operations within the floodway also encouraged the dumping of materials in the abandoned pits. Consequently, numerous pits within the Dallas Floodway are filled with rubble and debris from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Frederick et al. 2006:Figure 1). In summary, the potential for the Dallas Floodway to contain sites with contextual integrity has been impacted by two important forces: nature and man. The cut and fill actions of a stream have the power to either preserve or totally destroy site contexts, depending on the position of the site in relation to the active channel. Equally important within the Dallas Floodway has been the impact of development and resource extraction. Sand and gravel operations have impacted large sections of the Floodway while construction (channelization, levees, roads, city infrastructure) have impacted a variety of locations. However, such disturbances do not mean that preserved site contexts do not exist within the Dallas Floodway. With knowledge of these disturbances and appropriate geological information, those areas which are most likely to contain preserved site contexts can be delineated. 44

CHAPTER 5 GEOMORPHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT The present study area consists of the floodplain channelized portions of the Trinity River and its main tributaries, the West Fork and Elm Fork, along with the adjacent fluvial terraces. This area is shaped roughly like a capital “T” with the top portion of the “T” running mainly southwest from Bachman Lake along the channelized Elm Fork west of Dallas to a point just beyond the confluence of Mountain Creek and the channelized West Fork, and the stem of the “T” horizontal portion extending roughly east-southeast along the main stem of the channelized Trinity River from the junction of the Elm and West forks of the Trinity River to a point just southeast of the I- 45 bridge over the Trinity River. Portions of this area are covered in thick forest but much of it consists of open grassy areas. Its surface is relatively flat although there are noticeable terraces, old meander channels and sloughs, natural levees and other relic fluvial features in some areas as well as signs of recent human modification in others. The near-surface geology of the study area consists of Quaternary-age clays, silts, sands, and gravels of alluvial origin resting unconformably on Cretaceous bedrock. The Cretaceous bedrock in this region consists of the chalks and marls of the Austin Chalk overlying the dark blue-gray- green marine shales and claystones of the Eagle Ford Shale. The Austin Chalk ranges in thickness from 100 to 150 m; the Eagle Ford Shale in this area ranges from 60 to 90 m in thickness (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). Both of these formations dip gently to the southeast into the East Texas Embayment. Because of this dip, the Eagle Ford Shale outcrops or subcrops beneath the Quaternary in the northern, western, and central portions of the study area while the Austin Chalk underlies the Quaternary-age deposits only in the eastern part of area from just west of the Corinth Street Viaduct. The Quaternary deposits vary in thickness from a few m to over 20 m in thickness and range in age from the late Pleistocene to the present. Large portions of the Trinity’s floodplain and adjacent fluvial terraces in the project area have been heavily modified over the past 150 years by dredging, modifications to the Trinity River’s channel, borrow pit operations, highway and bridge construction, excavation of stormwater runoff channels, operation of landfills and trash dumps, digging and filling of sludge pits and ponds, and similar activities. Because of this, in some areas little is preserved of any surface fluvial structures related to earlier river channels that are present in other areas or which are well documented in historic maps and photographs of these portions of the Trinity River flood plain (Frederick et al. 2006 provides an excellent discussion). Such absent structures include cut-off 69

meanders (i.e., oxbow lakes), levee ridges, scroll bar or lateral accretion features, and abandoned river channels that predate the current Trinity River channel. West and north of the study area, above where the channelized West and Elm forks join to form the main stem of the Trinity River, the river is deeply entrenched and very sinuous. The river valley is 3 km or more in width and there is considerable evidence that the river has avulsed repeatedly in the recent past (this is particularly true of the West Fork). Below the confluence of the West and Elm forks, the Trinity’s flood plain grows progressively narrower until just west of the Corinth Street Viaduct. East of the Corinth Street Viaduct, the floodplain widens slightly although the depth to bedrock remains much less than west of that point. This narrowing is undoubtedly caused by changes in the underlying bedrock from the easily eroded shales of the Eagle Ford to the west and north to the more resistant chalks of the Austin Chalk to the south and east. In the immediate vicinity of the CWWTP and the I-45 bridge over the Trinity River, the current flood plain of the Trinity is just under 1 km in width and is bordered by prominent fluvial terraces of late Pleistocene to middle Holocene age (Cliff et al. 1998:Figure 8). This would indicate that for at least the past several thousand years the main stem of the Trinity south and east of the Corinth Street Viaduct has been confined to a very narrow belt. The narrowness of the flood plain in this area may also help account for the lack of preservation of earlier fluvial features. The confinement of the Trinity within a belt this narrow would also have an extremely negative impact on the preservation of earlier deposits in the upper 5 to 10 m of valley fill in this area compared to areas where the floodplain is wider and the fluvial deposits are thicker. The alluvial stratigraphy, soils stratigraphy, and geomorphology of the upper Trinity River have been investigated in a variety of studies. Ferring (1990) summarizes the history of geomorphic investigations and provides a working stratigraphic framework that can be applied to the Dallas Floodway and vicinity. At least seven recent studies have examined all or portions of the project area making use of data from cores, Geoprobe, and trenches (Cliff et al. 1998; Cliff et al. 1999; Ferring 1999; Buysse 2000; Shanabrook et al. 2002; Frederick et al. 2006; Shanabrook and Green 2009). Details of alluvial stratigraphic units and paleosol stratigraphy can vary within the Trinity River valley; however, lithostratigraphic properties, cross-cutting relationships, and superposition of stratigraphic units allow for a general correlation to Ferring’s (1990) stratigraphic model. General elements of the Ferring (1990) Trinity River model are summarized below. Ferring (1990) recognized three terraced Pleistocene stratigraphic units and five flood plain stratigraphic units of Late Pleistocene to modern age in the upper Trinity River basin. Terraced units are, in order of decreasing age, Irving, Coppell, and Tioga alluvium. Geomorphic position, horizontal distribution, lithologic properties, and upper bounding paleosols are included as criteria for unit differentiation. Units beneath the flood plain include, also in order of decreasing age, Carrollton, Aubrey, Sanger, Pilot Point, and Recent alluvium. General stratigraphic properties of these units in their type areas are summarized in Table 5. In comparing the Ferring (1990) model to the data from the Dallas Floodway, technical and logistical considerations must first be addressed. The correlation of the alluvial stratigraphic units by lithostratigraphic properties and relative stratigraphic positions allows for the development of a general correlation scheme. The paleosols at the top of each alluvial unit are implicit in Ferring’s (1990) model; however, it does not require that paleosols exist at all localities or that they possess all properties described in their type areas where they do exist. First, there is inherent variability in an individual paleosol, and second, there are possible upstream to downstream variations in properties over the distances involved from the type areas to the Dallas Floodway. 70

Table 5 Lithologic Properties, Depositional Environments, and Inferred Ages of Alluvial Stratigraphic Units in the Upper Trinity River (based on Ferring 1990, 1995; Humphrey and Ferring 1994) Depositional Alluvium Lithology Environments Inferred Age Recent Silt and clay grading to Meander belt alluvium, Alluviation < 200 years sand and gravel abandoned channel fill Pilot Point Silt and clay grading to Meander belt alluvium, Alluviation and soil formation sand and gravel overbank veneer over from 4,500 years to present older alluvium Sanger Calcareous silt and clay; Meander belt alluvium Alluviation from 11,000 to grades to sand and 7,500 years, gravel soil formation from 7,500 to 4,500 years Aubrey Bedded sand and gravel, Channel, abandoned Alluviation > 15,000 years finer-grained alluvial channel fill, lake plain (25,000? to 15,000 years), marls and lacustrine soil formation from 15,000 to sediment 11,000 years Carrollton Loamy sediment grading Meander belt alluvium > 15,000 years to sand and gravel (ca. 25,000 years?) Coppell, Loamy sediment to sand Channel belt alluvium > 30,000 years Tioga, and gravel Irving That is to say, these alluvial units are not time stratigraphic or lithostratigraphic units in the true geologic sense. Each alluvial unit was not deposited at precisely the same time or under the same conditions everywhere it is present. The Pilot Point alluvium provides an excellent example of this. The Pilot Point is the name given to all the fluvial alluvium along the upper Trinity River younger than 4,500 years old (see Table 5). In many areas, it is a clay-rich deposit capped in the dark, cumulic West Fork paleosol (the flood basin facies of Ferring 1990). In others, it contains deposits with a significant amount of coarser clastics (silt, sand, and gravel) which often exhibit fining-upward sequences typical of fluvial point bar deposits (the meander belt facies of Ferring 1990). This complex picture is made even more complicated by the fact that the West Fork “paleosol” forms the surface unit in some areas and is continuing to accumulate in those localities while it is buried by up to 2 to 3 m of more recent Holocene alluvium in others (Cliff et al. 1999:Figures A-20 and A-21; Buysse 2000; Shanabrook et al. 2002:Figure 8, 45-47). Since in most cases, the deposits covering the West Fork contain historic-age artifacts and debris, it is tempting to subdivide the Pilot Point into a historic and a prehistoric component. Further, there are often cross-cutting relationships between the two main “facies” of the Pilot Point (see Cliff et al. 1999:Figures 12 and 16). Frederick et al. (2006) attempted to break the Pilot Point and more recent alluvial units into further discrete time units with modest success in the area near the old West Fork channel west of Hampton Road. However, despite the significant amounts of data collected there, Frederick et al. found “this area to be surprisingly complex” due to the potential presence of up to three late Holocene-age deposits modified by more recent historic earth moving 71

activities (2006:43). This same problem is probably ubiquitous in the project area making it very difficult to sub-divide the Pilot Point in more than a very general way except within very small areas. Stratigraphic data collected for the Dallas Floodway Extension project have provided information on the lithologic, pedologic, and geometric properties of flood plain sediments immediately downstream of the Dallas Floodway (Figure 9; Cliff et al. 1998, 1999). A similar situation is certain to exist upstream of this area. Sediments associated with the various flood plain depositional environments recognized within the Dallas Floodway Extension project area were found to have distinctive lithologic and pedologic properties that allowed for their differentiation. A conceptual cross section (Figure 10) illustrates the geometric relationships between alluvial units identified in the Dallas Floodway Extension area as well as the Dallas Floodway proper further to the north and west. Pilot Point alluvium is typically the first mappable unit encountered below the flood plain surface in the Trinity Floodway Extension area, the Dallas Floodway proper, the floodplains of Mountain and Delaware creeks, and the floodplains of the Elm and West forks of the Trinity (Cliff et al. 1998; Cliff et al. 1999; Ferring 1999; Shanabrook et al. 2002). Recent alluvium locally covers this unit near the present Trinity River channel, and recent overbank deposits may be locally included in Pilot Point overbank veneer deposits. Pilot Point alluvium is characterized as a black to dark gray (10YR 3/1 to 5/2) silty clay loam to silt loam. In channel belt areas, it grades downward to loamy or sandy textures; whereas, outside of channel belts, it veneers older alluvial units. The unit commonly has either an A-Bt-C or A-Bw-C horizon sequence. Plant root activity and other bioturbation are the most common pedogenic processes. Pedogenic properties and stratigraphic position correlate to the West Fork paleosol identified by Ferring (1990). In channel belt areas, the soil profile grades to stratified alluvium; however, outside channel areas, the base of the soil can be mixed with underlying alluvium. Sanger alluvium occurs beneath the Pilot Point alluvium in many locations in this area, except where it has been eroded by Pilot Point alluvium (Cliff et al. 1998 and 1999). This unit is characterized as a brownish (10YR 6/4) calcareous silt loam with yellowish (10YR 6/6) mottles that commonly grades downward to channel belt sand or sand and gravel. The base of the Sanger alluvium rests either on older Aubrey/Carrollton alluvium or on Cretaceous bedrock. The unit commonly has a buried Btk-Ck or Bwk-Ck horizon sequence. Carbonate accumulations on ped surfaces, in root channels, and as concretions along with dark iron-manganese concretions are the most common pedogenic processes. Pedogenic properties and stratigraphic position correlate to the Arlington paleosol of Ferring (1990). Aubrey/Carrollton alluvium occurs in areas beneath younger Pilot Point and/or Sanger alluvium in portions of the Dallas Floodway Extension area (Cliff et al. 1998) and the Dallas Floodway and adjacent areas to the north and west (Cliff et al. 1999; Ferring 1999). This unit is characterized as a dark grayish (10YR 5/1) to yellowish brown (10YR 7/6) silty clay loam to clay loam that is interbedded with sandy loam to sand. Plant roots, root traces filled with carbonate and/or iron oxide, carbonate concretions, and gastropod shells characterize the unit. Soil development at the top of the unit is commonly weak, and C or Cg horizons were noted in most samples from this area. 72

Coppell/Tioga alluvium was identified at a single location beneath the Pleistocene terraces in the Dallas Floodway Extension area (Cliff et al. 1998) but is probably present in the Pleistocene terraces north and west of the present confluence of the Elm and West forks (Ferring 1999). At this location, a reddish (5YR 6/8) sandy clay loam Bt horizon with grayish (10YR 7/2) mottles was identified. Paleosol characteristics include moderate development of soil structure, clay accumulations on peds and in root traces, and manganese stains and concretions. The paleosol grades downward into bedded sand and gravel. The data collected in the Dallas Floodway Extension (Cliff et al. 1998; Shanabrook et al. 2002) and the Dallas Floodway (Cliff et al. 1999; Ferring 1999; Frederick et al. 2006), in association with that from previous investigations in the Trinity River Valley were used to develop a general landscape evolution summary for the project area. Geomorphological map units and alluvial deposits within the Dallas Floodway Extension were correlated with Ferring’s (1990) model for the purpose of inferring regional events in the Trinity River basin (Table 6). Although Frederick et al. (2006) correctly points out that there are limits to this framework because of the high variability of fluvial systems and environments (2000:44), this general landscape evolution summary can be used as a base with which to interpret the data collected from the Dallas Floodway pending the addition of more data. A refined landscape evolution summary can, in turn, be used as a model to further infer general paleo-environmental evolution, assess archaeological site distribution data, and provide cultural resources management recommendations for areas to be impacted by future projects.

This unit reflects a period of slow valley alluviation at a base level higher than present. Stream channels were relatively shallow, bedload-dominated meander belts; climatic conditions were probably comparable to the present. The unit formed in middle Wisconsin time, probably before 30,000 years ago (Ferring 1990). 75

The onset of continental glaciation produced widespread and rapid valley incision throughout much of Central Texas (Blum et al. 1994; Ferring 1990). Climatic instability and associated increases in effective precipitation not only induced incision of the Trinity River into its present flood plain, but also resulted in alluviation of the Aubrey/Carrollton sequence in a low relief, wetland-dominated flood plain. The lithologic and stratigraphic attributes of this unit suggest that the Trinity River flood plain was a mosaic of swamps, marshes, and lakes with interspersed scattered stream channels. Sediment delivered to the flood plain was derived from erosion of the upland residuum, triggered by vegetational instability associated with full glacial climate changes (Blum et al. 1994). Rapid alluviation in the Trinity River ensued with early Holocene meander belt development and deposition of the Sanger alluvium (Ferring 1990). A return to increased climatic stability and seasonality occurred at that time (Blum et al. 1994). The lithology of the Sanger alluvium may in part be a result of the widespread exposure of Cretaceous bedrock in the Trinity River basin following the Late Pleistocene stripping of residuum. The middle Holocene is characterized by a transition toward modern climatic conditions. The Trinity River flood plain exhibited a slowing of the rate of alluviation and a concurrent increase in the rate of alluvial pedogenesis (Ferring 1990). The Late Holocene is typified by varying rates of alluviation and pedogenesis, as well as deposition of channel belt alluvium and overbank veneers draping older flood plain surfaces. Soil formation was concurrent with sedimentation to produce the thick, cumulative West Fork paleosol at the top of the Pilot Point alluvium (Ferring 1990). The most significant disruption in the cumulative aggradation of the Pilot Point sequence is an inferred period of drier climate about 1,000 years ago (Hall 1990). Hall cites widespread occurrence of an alluvial discontinuity in the Southern Great Plains. However, investigations in the project area generated no data to either support or refute this idea although there is strong evidence that the rate of migration of the Trinity’s channel slowed dramatically after roughly 1700 years B.P. (Ferring 1990:48 and Ferring and Yates 1997: 44 give 1800 to 1400 years B.P.; Cliff et al. 1999 observed 1600 to 1700 years B. P. with reduced sedimentation rates for portions of the West Fork in the project area). Since channel migration can be strongly influenced by water flow and sediment supply, this reduction in migration could be due in part to the event Hall was describing although at an earlier date. Recent alluviation occurs near the modern channel of the Trinity River. Recent overbank veneers probably drape the entire Trinity River flood plain. In some areas, these recent clayey deposits can be distinguished from the older Pilot Point sediments capped by the West Fork paleosol by a difference in color, level of soil development, or the presence of cultural materials of historic age. As noted above, Frederick had some success in doing this in a portion of the project area although his success may have been due in part to his test area being both in or immediately adjacent to an old meander belt of the West Fork and adjacent to the channelized Trinity in a very narrow part of the Dallas Floodway (Frederick et al. 2006:32-33). In other areas, these mud drapes cannot be confidently separated from upper Pilot Point alluvium based on the available data (e.g., see Cliff et al. 1999). Ferring (1990) indicates that the recent alluvium is young, but he does not specifically correlate this unit to the onset of European settlement in the region. It has been suggested that similar alluviation associated with Euro-American land use alteration occurred throughout the Mississippi River drainage basin (Autin 1992; Bettis and Autin 1997; Grissinger et al. 1982; Knox 1972). 76

To summarize, the bedrock in the area is Cretaceous in age and consists of the shales of the Eagle Ford to the north and west, and the chalks of the Austin Chalk to the south and east. The modern and ancestral Trinity River and its tributaries have incised a valley ranging in width from 1 to 3 km and depth from 2.3 m to over 21 m into these bedrock units. This valley has undergone a complex depositional history since the late Pleistocene as the Trinity has alternatively aggraded and widened its floodplain, and then entrenched into its floodplain removing earlier deposits, narrowing the active floodplain, and leaving terraces composed of older alluvium standing above the active floodplain particularly along the valley margins. This sequence of cut and fill has produced a complex pattern of deposits much of which is masked and hidden under the most recent units. The difficulty in unraveling this complexity has been increased by human actions in historic times, such as quarrying of sand and gravel, levee and channel construction, farming, and timber removal among others, which have served to modify or remove the often subtle clues left to the age and nature of the underlying fluvial deposits. The succeeding section will attempt to characterize the near-surface geology of portions of the project area and reach conclusions about the likelihood of their containing preserved, buried, and stratified cultural deposits. DISCUSSION OF THE PROJECT AREA To increase clarity and avoid oversimplification, for purposes of discussion, the project area will be broken into four main pieces: (1) the floodplain of the channelized Elm Fork north of its current confluence with the West Fork, (2) the floodplain of the channelized West Fork and areas south and west of its current confluence with the Elm Fork, (3) the floodplain of the main stem of the Trinity River from the confluence of the West and Elm forks to just west of the Corinth Street Bridge, and (4) the floodplain of the main stem of the Trinity River south and east of the Corinth Street Bridge. Since no new fieldwork was done in connection with this report, the principal sources of information in discussing each of these areas will be the previous reports noted above with the addition of information from core data mainly from the Levee Rehabilitation Study. The intent here is to summarize the data and discussion presented in these earlier reports, annotating and modifying them in light of the new core data. Boring holes that are specifically mentioned in this text are illustrated on Figure 11. Channelized Elm Fork Floodplain In addition to the work done by Ferring (1999) and Cliff et al. (1999), the logs of an additional ten borings taken and described during the Levee Rehabilitation Project were examined. Ferring’s work was connected to the placement and burial of a pipeline roughly 10 m below the ground surface near the western edge of the channelized Elm Fork’s floodplain and so was focused on a very narrow strip (Ferring 1999:Figure 2). Despite this, the data from Ferring’s work is very useful in helping to determine the geometry of the Elm Fork/Trinity River Valley and the thickness of the fluvial deposits. The principal source of information on this area, however, is the work done by Cliff et al. in 1999 summarized on pages 48-57, and Figures 11, 17, and 19-21 of that report augmented by the ten new borings located along the eastern side of the floodplain. Cliff et al. noted a large variation in the depth to bedrock and the very strong possibility that there are pre-Late Holocene sediments present in this area (1999:51 and Figure 11). The Quaternary fill appears thinnest at the northeast end of the area with much greater amounts of valley fill to the south. Ferring also saw evidence of a bedrock ridge composed of Cretaceous Eagle Ford Shale 77

buried at a depth of approximately 2.5 m under Pilot Point Alluvium at the northern end of this area with much thicker deposits to the south (1999:7). However, Ferring also observed another buried bedrock ridge just west of the present confluence of the Elm and West forks (1999:9) indicating that the valley geometry may be fairly complex. This is supported by the data from the ten borings which reveal a deeply incised portion of the valley just north of John Carpenter Freeway (SH 183) with the alluvial fill being 19 to 20 m thick above the Eagle Ford bedrock (Cores FER-11-34-WBP and FER-11-33-WB). Immediately south of these bore holes the depth to bedrock is only 6 m at the east end of the SH 183 bridge over the Elm Fork. Geoprobe data from Cliff et al. (1999) indicate that just to the west of the of the bore holes the bedrock is 5.8 m (Probe Hole EF-3) and just to the north of them it is only 4.7 m deep (Probe Hole BL-1). Interestingly, Sheet 3 prepared for the Levee Rehabilitation Project shows that a significant old meander loop opening to the east was located in this area with the bore holes being on the point bar side and the other three data points on the outside or cut-bank side of the loop. Early deposits would have been removed and replaced, and the valley deepened on the inside of the loop while the cut-bank side would have remained basically unchanged. Ferring’s study plus several other bore holes and probe holes indicate that the valley fill is 18 to 19 m thick south of the SH 183 bridge with the thick fill (over 23 m) being under the central and western portions of the bridge itself which would mean that the eastern end of the bridge is located atop a buried bedrock knoll. This in turn points to there being other unrecognized buried abandoned channels and meander loops hidden under the relatively featureless surface of this portion of the Elm Fork’s floodplain south from the SH 183 bridge to near the present confluence of the Elm and West forks. Ferring noted thick alluvial deposits with multiple soil horizons along the western side of the floodplain north of the CRI & G Railroad Bridge (1999: 8-9), and the valley fill is 15 to 18 m thick in the area between the current Elm Fork channel and the levee to the east of it based on bore hole and probe hole data. Geoprobe holes EF-1 and EF-4 both strongly suggest that Carrollton Alluvium (Late Pleistocene), Aubrey/Sanger Alluvium (Terminal Pleistocene and Holocene) and Pilot Point Alluvium (Late Holocene) are present in this area (Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 11) supporting Ferring’s observations just to the west. This situation changes somewhat as the present confluence of the Elm and West forks is approached. Although the valley fill is still 12 to 16 m thick with indications of alluvium of multiple ages on the eastern side of the Elm Fork (Cliff et al. 1999:Figures 9 and 11), west and north of the confluence Ferring detected another buried bedrock ridge where the Quaternary alluvium is only 4.5 to 5.5 m thick (1999: 9). These data and the sharp scarp present easily seen on the topographic map just to the north of this point strongly suggest that this is a bedrock “finger” that juts southeast into the floodplain marking the divide between the ancestral floodplain of the Elm Fork to the north and the ancestral floodplain of the West Fork and its tributaries, Mountain and Delaware creeks, to the south. Ferring believes that this bedrock ridge was covered by Pleistocene terrace deposits most of which have been quarried for sand and gravel (Ferring 1999:5, 9) indicating that this feature has been present for an extended period of time. Although the deeper portions of the deposits present on this portion of the floodplain have suffered little or no impact from historic human activities, the same cannot be said of the near surface portions of the deposits. Information from the bore and probe holes indicate that in almost every case the upper 1 to 3 m of the current floodplain deposits have been impacted particularly in the area directly adjacent to the levees, bridges, and other man-made features. This is of note because the West Fork Paleosol of the Pilot Point Alluvium, a unit known to contain prehistoric cultural materials throughout this region, forms or formed the surface unit in virtually all of this part of the project area based on the trenches examined by Ferring and the Geoprobe data collected by Cliff et al. in 1999 (see Figure 17). Since no samples were taken by Cliff et al. during the 1999 study and the bore hole descriptions simply note the disturbed intervals as “fill”, 79

it is not clear exactly what the nature of the disturbances are nor precisely how deep they may have affected the sediments. Three of the bore holes appear to have penetrated undisturbed Pilot Point Alluvium capped by the West Fork Paleosol underneath the zone of disturbance (FER-11- 04-WB, FER-11-18-WB, and FER-11-27-WB), but the other seven, much of this Late Holocene age material may have been removed or altered beyond easy recognition. This may indicate that the zone of disturbance has been underestimated or that near the levees, much of this unit was removed for levee construction or other activities connected with the Dallas Floodway. To summarize, in this area only Late Holocene deposits appear to be present as far south as just north of the SH-183 bridge. Beginning at that point and stretching to and beyond the current confluence of the Elm and West forks, the ancestral Elm Fork has incised deeply into the Cretaceous Eagle Ford Shale and the alluvial valley fill is fairly thick. Despite considerable disturbance of the upper few meters of these sediments, there is strong evidence that alluvial units of a variety of ages from the Late Pleistocene to the Late Holocene remain intact below the present floodplain surface. The presence of buried channels and cut-off meander loops coupled with evidence of nearby bedrock supported knolls, fluvial terraces, and upland margins would have made the central portion of this area a very attractive habitation site for a considerable period. Channelized West Fork Floodplain As for the Elm Fork portion of the project area, the work done by Ferring (1999) and Cliff et al. (1999) provide the bulk of the detailed investigations in this area. In addition, the logs from eleven bore holes from the Levee Rehabilitation, Trinity-Portland Pump Station, and the West Dallas Lake portion of the Trinity Parkway Projects were examined. As before, Ferring’s work focused on the western and northern fringes of the project area but still provides very useful data. The principal source of information on this area, however, is the work done by Cliff et al. in 1999 (summarized on pages 44-52, and Figures 9, 13, 16, 17, and 19-21 of that report) and augmented by the eleven new borings located along the eastern side of the floodplains of the West Fork and Mountain Creek. Just as along the Elm Fork, Cliff et al. and Ferring observed a wide variation in the depth to Cretaceous bedrock in this area (Cliff et al. 1999:Figures 9 and 11; Ferring 1999: 9 and Figure 6). The buried bedrock ridge north and west of the present confluence of the Elm and West forks was noted previously. Moving east from this ridge, Geoprobe data and borings show that the valley deepens rapidly from roughly 5 m to approximately 15 m near Geoprobe holes DC-2 and DC-3 (Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 9) and boring FWR-08-21-WB. The same happens moving west and south where Ferring observed 18 m-thick alluvial deposits just west of the buried ridge (Ferring 1999: 9), and borings B-3 and B-10 located south-southwest of the ridge encountered roughly 12 m and over 15.4 m of Quaternary valley fill. All this seems to indicate that the confluence of the ancestral Elm and West forks has tended to be farther east than at present leaving a bedrock ridge separating the deepest parts of their valleys. This also means that the deeper parts of the West Fork’s valley in this immediate area lies south of its present channel and is probably south of the present levee. However, as one moves even further south and west, another prominent bedrock ridge is encountered on the south side of the present West Fork that stretches eastward from just west of Walton Walker Boulevard (Loop 12) where bedrock was penetrated at a depth of 9.6 m in Geoprobe hole MC-2 (Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 13) through boring FWR-10-07-WB which found the Eagle Ford Shale at a depth of 2.7 m to boring FWR-10-04-WBP which encountered bedrock 80

at a depth of 5.5 m. It is unknown whether this ridge is an isolated rise surrounded in every direction by deeper portions of the valley or whether this is a prominent ridge that extends back to the uplands immediately to the east of the river. The local topography and position of the former channels of the West Fork looping around this area would seem to suggest that the second view is correct. It is known that Ferring observed over 10 m of alluvium just to the north and west across the current West Fork channel from this point (Ferring 1999:9-10). Further, recent borings near the levee to the west of Geoprobe hole MC-2 consistently penetrated over 17 m of valley fill above bedrock. This is supported by Ferring’s work where a boring near the TRA plant encountered 18.5 m of alluvium (1999:9) and Geoprobe hole MC-1 located just north of Singleton Boulevard Bridge which found 18.6 m of valley fill above Eagle Ford Shale bedrock (Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 13). In short, the bedrock surface is far from smooth in this area with at least two bedrock ridges projecting out underneath the floodplain: one that forms a ridge separating the valleys of the Elm and West forks and another that juts out in a westerly direction from the uplands north of Singleton Boulevard and east of Loop 12. The great thickness of alluvium observed in portions of this area make it very likely that pre-Late Holocene age sediments are present in this portion of the river valley. Ferring observed at least one buried soil in the valley fill on the north side of the West Fork channel between Bear Slough and the Loop 12 Bridge which he believed to be of Middle Holocene or Sanger Alluvium age (1999:9). This would match the profile observed in Geoprobe hole MC-1 which encountered Carrollton (Late Pleistocene) and Sanger/Aubrey (Early to Middle Holocene) Alluvia underneath near-surface deposits of Late Holocene age Pilot Point Alluvium (Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 13). Further, this Geoprobe hole encountered a well developed West Fork soil capping the Pilot Point immediately under the floodplain surface. A radiocarbon date from a sample of this soil approximately 70 cm below the current floodplain surface yielded a date of 2,070 ± 40 years B.P. (Cliff et al. 1999:Table 6) indicating that this portion of the West Fork floodplain has been very stable for an extended period. A radiocarbon date of 1,630 ± 40 years B.P. from Pilot Point meander belt sediments approximately 2.2 m below the current surface in Geoprobe hole MC-2 just west of the Loop 12 Bridge adjacent to the former West Fork channel indicates that: (1) the West Fork had occupied its historic channel for an extended period during the Late Holocene, (2) the rate of sedimentation was relatively low during the Late Holocene even in areas in proximity to the active channel, and (3) much of the Late Holocene meander belt in this area lies south and east of the current levee. It is also interesting to note the great thickness, roughly 9.6 m, of these meander belt deposits. Although the active meander belt deposits are thinner in other areas, it does mean that a substantial amount of earlier, pre-existing sediment would be removed and, in areas where the depth to bedrock is limited, it is very likely that they will have been removed entirely leaving only Late Holocene deposits. This is probably the case in the area of the bedrock ridge detected north of Singleton Boulevard and east of Loop 12. On the other hand, the thickness of sediments on either side of this buried bedrock ridge and the fact that the river channel remained fixed within a fairly narrow belt for several thousand years or more make it very likely that older sediments will be preserved at depth in this area as noted above. Further, data from Geoprobe holes DC-2 and DC-3 coupled with information from nearby borings show that there is considerable thickness of pre-late Holocene sediment east of the buried bedrock ridge just beyond the current confluence of the Elm and West forks (Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 9). In fact, Geoprobe hole DC-1 shows that older sediments can be preserved in portions of the current floodplain with shallow depths to bedrock some distance from the active meander belt. 81

Although there is strong evidence that older deposits are present and remain relatively undisturbed in those portions of this area with deeper alluvial fill, just as in the area of the channelized Elm Fork, the near surface portions of the deposits have suffered considerable impact from historic human activities. Information from the bore and probe holes indicate that in almost every case the upper 1 to 3 m of the current floodplain deposits have been impacted particularly in the area directly adjacent to the levees, bridges, and other ma-made features. Since the alluvial fill over the bedrock ridge in the central portion of this area is only 3 to 5 m, this means that little undisturbed sediment remains. This is of note because the Pilot Point Alluvium, a unit known to contain prehistoric cultural materials throughout this region, forms or formed the surface unit in virtually all of this part of the project area based on the trenches done by Ferring and the Geoprobe holes done by Cliff et al. in 1999 (see Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 17). Since only limited samples were taken during by Cliff et al. during the 1999 study and none of these were from areas considered disturbed, and the bore hole descriptions simply note the disturbed intervals as “fill”, it is not clear exactly what the nature of the disturbances are nor precisely how deep they may have affected the sediments. One of the borings, B-3, appears to have penetrated undisturbed Pilot Point Alluvium capped by the West Fork Paleosol underneath the zone of disturbance, but in the others near the levee, much of the Late Holocene age material may have been removed or altered beyond easy recognition. This may indicate that the zone of disturbance has been underestimated or that near the levees, much of the Late Holocene units were removed for levee construction or other activities connected with the Dallas Floodway. To summarize, in this area only Late Holocene deposits appear to be present between just west of the Loop 12 Bridge and just south of the large bend in the channelized West Fork where it changes direction from flowing north to east due to the presence of a large, buried bedrock ridge jutting out from the uplands east of the river. On either side of this area, the ancestral West Fork and its tributaries, Mountain and Delaware creeks and Bear Slough, have incised deeply into the Cretaceous Eagle Ford Shale and the alluvial valley fill is fairly thick. Since the West Fork’s tributaries in this area often appear to occupy abandoned channels or loops of the main river, this portion of the floodplain would have offered a wide variety of environmental settings and resources. Despite considerable disturbance of the upper few m of these sediments, there is strong evidence that alluvial units of a variety of ages from the Late Pleistocene to the Late Holocene remain intact below the present floodplain surface in the areas outside of the central bedrock ridge. The presence of multiple tributaries joining the West Fork in this area coupled with evidence of nearby bedrock supported ridges, fluvial terraces, and upland margins would have made this area, particularly on the western end where the tributaries are largest and more numerous, a very attractive habitation site for a considerable period. Trinity River South of Corinth Street Bridge This portion of the Trinity River floodplain has been much more heavily investigated than either of the previous two. Beginning in 1998, this area has been examined by Cliff et al. (1998), Cliff et al. (1999), Buysse (2000), and Shanabrook et al. (2002). In addition to these earlier reports, the logs of an additional 15 borings taken and described during the Levee Rehabilitation, Rochester Levee, Trinity River Utilities, and Trinity Parkway Projects were examined. The work done by Cliff et al. in 1999 only extended as far east as the Corinth Street Bridge while that of Cliff et al. in 1998 covered a large portion of the Trinity River valley to the south from Forest Avenue including areas outside the present project area. Buysse’s work in 2000 focused primarily on a series of archaeological sites just north and east of the CWWTP overlapping areas examined by 82

Cliff et al. in 1998. Later in 2002, Shanabrook et al. examined a small portion of the floodplain just north of these archaeological sites integrating the results of Buysse et al.’s and Cliff et al.’s work. The discussion that follows will focus on three specific areas within this portion of the Trinity River’s floodplain: (1) the area around the Corinth Street Bridge, (2) the area near the CWWTP, and (3) the area around Rochester Park and its surrounding levee. The report of Cliff et al. done in 1999 will serve as the principal source of data for the Corinth Street bridge area while Cliff et al. (1998) and Shanabrook et al. (2002) will be the mainstays for the other two areas. Figure 12 gives a good overview of the near surface geology of this area. In each case, the earlier work will be supplemented by the information from the available borings. It should also be noted that it appears that the channelized portion of the Trinity River ends just northwest of the Forest Avenue bridge and that south and east of that point, the Trinity follows a much more natural looking, meandering course. Further, the active floodplain is wider southeast of that point and is not as tightly constricted by levees. There is less variation in the depth to bedrock in this portion of the study area and even the deepest parts are considerably less than those farther to the west along the valley. The thinnest alluvial fill is found near the southern end of the Corinth Street bridge where bedrock is encountered only 2.3 to 4.6 m below the current floodplain surface (Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 8; borings UB-25, FWR-01-09-WB, FWR-01-07-DB, and FWR-01-07-WB). Similar thicknesses ranging from 4.5 to 5.7 m are found along the MKT Railroad right-of-way located on the large fluvial terrace north and west of the CWWTP (Cliff et al. 1998:Appendix A). All of these points are considerably south and west of the either the current channel southeast of Forest Avenue or the pre-1932 channel in the area around the south end of the Corinth Street bridge. On the eastern and southern side of the Rochester Park Levee, bedrock is noticeably deeper ranging from 6.4 to over 7.6 m (borings B-5, B-6, B-10, B-13, B-14; Geoprobe Hole DF-6 of Cliff et al. 1998) although there are shallower points such as near Geoprobe Hole DF-5 were the alluvial deposits are only 4.5 m thick (Cliff et al. 1998) indicating that there are bedrock rises or ridges hidden beneath the floodplain surface. This greater thickness most likely indicates that either the channel of the ancestral Trinity River was further north in the past or that the channel of White Rock Creek, a large tributary that currently joins the Trinity just to the east, was located further west in the past or some combination of these. This same type of thickness (7.5 m) was observed in Geoprobe Hole DF-7 south of the current Trinity channel near the south wall of the river valley (Cliff et al. 1998; Shanabrook et al. 2002:Figure 8). However, the most deeply incised portions of this part of the Trinity’s valley are found in or directly adjacent to the pre-1932 channel at the north end of the Corinth Street bridge where borings UB-22, UB-23, and UB-24 penetrated 13.4 to 13.6 m of alluvium above Cretaceous bedrock. This type of deep incision is mimicked in the area near the current channel east of the CWWTP where Geoprobe hole DF-15 encountered roughly 10.6 m of alluvium above bedrock, and Geoprobe holes DF-4, DF-16, and DF-17 penetrated 9.7, 8.1, and 10.6 m of sediment respectively without reaching bedrock (Cliff et al. 1998). Since the bedrock from just west of the Corinth Street bridge is composed of the much more resistant limes and chalks of the Austin Chalk rather than the more easily eroded Eagle Ford Shales, a doubling or tripling of the valley depth would have required an extended period of down cutting, indicating that, even though the Trinity’s valley is much narrower in this area, the location of its channel has remained fairly stable for long periods of time at least during the Late Holocene. Considering the short distance between boring UB-24 (13.4 m of alluvium) and boring UB-25 (4.4 m of sediment) or Geoprobe hole C-3 (4.2 m of sediment) to the south, or going in the other direction, the limited distance from boring UB-22 (13.6 m of alluvium) and the north margin of the valley, it may be that the channel’s location has been very stable for an even more extended period of time. Again, the more resistant rocks of Austin Chalk may be responsible for this since the ancestral Trinity may have had a much more difficult time widening and deepening its valley in this area trapping the river in a fairly narrow band. 83

Despite the relatively thin nature of the valley fill in much of this area, there is strong evidence that considerable pre-Late Holocene sediment remains in this portion of the project area. Based on sediment samples, Cliff et al. believe that Geoprobe hole DF-6 penetrated Pleistocene-age deposits underneath 2 m of Late Holocene Pilot Point alluvium at the toe of the large Pleistocene terrace near Rochester Park (1998:88, Table 12). This view would be supported by the very sandy and in some cases red-colored sediment encountered by the borings located near the eastern side of the Rochester levee. Both these pieces of data strongly indicate that the Pleistocene age deposits that make up the terrace extend, perhaps in a truncated form, for some distance underneath the adjacent modern floodplain particularly to the east. However, data from Geoprobe holes DF-4 and DF-5 indicate that these older deposits have been completely removed a very short distance to the south and replaced by Pilot Point Alluvium including the West Fork Paleosol in the case of DF-5 and nearly 10 m of Pilot Point meander belt facies in the case of DF- 4 (Shanabrook et al. 2002:Appendix B). On the opposite side of the current Trinity channel there is a prominent fluvial terrace between the active meander belt and the edge of the upland which has clearly been sculpted by fluvial action at some point in the past. Sediment samples taken from roughly 2.35 m beneath the surface in Trench 1 and from 5.2 m beneath the surface in Geoprobe hole DF-8 located on this terrace yield radiocarbon dates of 5,360 ± 50 years B.P. for the shallow sample and 9,570 ± 60 years B.P. for the deeper one (Cliff et al. 1998:Table 15). Both of these Middle to Early Holocene age dates would be consistent with the age range expected for the Sanger Alluvium (see Table 2). Data from the adjacent Geoprobe holes indicate that much of this fluvial terrace may be comprised of Sanger Alluvium hidden beneath a thin veneer of Late Holocene deposits, and that the Sanger-age deposits extend for some distance under the current Trinity floodplain (Cliff et al. 1998:Appendix A; Shanabrook et al. 2002: Figure 8 and Appendix B). Again, these earlier deposits have probably been removed within much of the limits of the current active meander belt but may survive in a truncated form in the deeper parts of the Trinity valley. Analysis of the Geoprobe profiles strongly indicate that deposits of Aubrey (Very Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene) or Carrollton Alluvium (Late Pleistocene) may be present under some portions of this fluvial terrace or the adjoining portions of the current floodplain (Cliff et al. 1998:Appendix A) near the CWWTP and the south end of the MKT Railroad bridge. Similarly, the prominent floodplain rise just west of the Forest Avenue bridge and just west of the MKT Railroad bridge could be older fluvial terrace remnants containing older sediments or might be bedrock supported features capped in older deposits. It is clear that in the area around Corinth Street bridge that only Late Holocene age sediments survive between the levees. However, based on the depth of the Trinity valley northeast of the levee, it is very likely that pre-Late Holocene sediments remain there. Just as in the previous two areas, although there are large areas in which deeper sedimentary deposits have remained undisturbed, the near surface fluvial deposits in much of this area have been highly impacted by historic human activity. The sediments located at the toe of the levees on both sides of the Dallas Floodway in the area of the Corinth Street Bridge have been disturbed to at least a depth of several m. Further, the narrow nature of the floodplain here coupled with the shallow depth to bedrock undoubtedly means that pre-existing deposits are constantly being eroded and reworked (see Cliff et al. 1999:44 and Figure 8 for a fuller discussion), although this situation may ease somewhat in the broader floodplain south of the AT & SF Railroad bridge. Although the Geoprobe holes south of the Rochester Levee do not appear to show any disturbance, many of the borings east of the levee show impact from recent activities to a depth of 1 to 2.7 m. Since the near surface sediments appear to be Late Pleistocene in age and any cultural materials would be located on or very near the top of these sediments, it is almost certain that any cultural deposits in this area would have been severely impacted if not destroyed. Similarly, the 85

near surface deposits of the fluvial terrace on which the CWWTP sits and of the active floodplain that adjoins it to the east and north have been severely impacted and it is likely that several cultural deposits have already been severely damaged by highway construction as well as a host of activities connected with the treatment plant (settling ponds, sludge pits, and buried lines and culverts to name a few). However, even in areas where there have been very high levels of historic impact, there are still areas which are relatively undisturbed. Further, this area is close enough to the Trinity’s active meander belt that it continues to receive considerable sediment. This high level of sedimentation has tended in many areas to bury the West Fork Paleosol, which contains most of the cultural deposits, below the level of the historic disturbance. This can be seen in Figure 8 of Shanabrook et al. (2002) and is more fully discussed there and in Buysse et al. report of 2000. The West Fork Paleosol in this area appears to have accumulated between roughly 530 years B.P. to perhaps 4,500 years B.P. based on radiocarbon dates and so could contain stratified, in situ cultural deposits over most of the latter half of the Holocene. To summarize, in this portion of the project area, the alluvial valley fill is thinner and the river valley is narrower than in the first two that were discussed due to the fact that the underlying bedrock is the Austin Chalk rather than the softer Eagle Ford Shale. Further, although the northwestern end of this area consists of a channelized river as in the previous two areas, in the southeastern end, the Trinity appears to be a moderately deeply entrenched, sinuous river whose channel has been little modified from its natural state. Despite this thinner sedimentary column, there are considerable areas of moderately thick pre-Late Holocene deposits mostly in the form of two large fluvial terraces, one in the area of Rochester Park and the other located south and west of the CWWTP. Although, the near surface sediments have been heavily impacted in many areas, others have escaped damage. Further, high sedimentation rates in some areas have tended to mitigate the worst effects of the historic activities. The presence of large fluvial terraces, floodplain rises, and the nearby edge of the uplands directly adjacent to the active meander belt of the Trinity River would have made this area, particularly on the southern end where several modest tributaries join the Trinity, a very attractive habitation site for a considerable period. This view is supported by the presence of numerous cultural sites of a variety of ages in this area (see Cliff et al. 1998 and Buysse 2000 for a more complete discussion). The Channelized Trinity River from the Confluence of the Elm and West Forks to the Corinth Street Bridge This portion of the Trinity River floodplain has also been heavily investigated. Beginning in 1999, this area has been examined by Cliff et al. (1999), Frederick et al. (2006), and Shanabrook et al. (2009). In addition to these earlier reports, the logs of an additional fifty borings taken and described during the Levee Rehabilitation and Trinity Parkway Projects were examined. The work done by Cliff et al. in 1999 covered this entire portion of the project area while that of Frederick et al. in 2006 focused on the area between the Houston Street Viaduct on the east and areas just to the west of the Westmoreland Avenue Bridge. Frederick et al.’s work made excellent use of historic maps and photos in an attempt to discern the location of undisturbed fluvial features, but was not always able to confirm this information due to the limited depths that can be tested with trenching and the complexity of the near surface floodplain deposits. Shanabrook et al.’s work in 2009 examined the area near the Sylvan Avenue Bridge in great detail overlapping an area examined by Cliff et al. in 1999. The discussion that follows will make use of the reports of Cliff et al. (1999) and Frederick et al. (2006) as the principal sources of data. Particular attention is focused on the area of the pre-1932 channel of the West Fork just 86

west of the Hampton Road bridge and the areas to the west of this point which appear to have been less impacted by historic activities. It should also be noted that, other than the small portion of the former West Fork channel near the Hampton Road bridge, the late Holocene channels of the Elm and West forks of the Trinity River lie exclusively outside of the levees. Thus, instead of a sinuous channel located in an active meander belt with all of the associated fluvial features such as cut banks, point bars, natural levees, crevasse splays, and the like, the current Trinity River channel is nearly a straight line tightly confined by levees. Although, as will be discussed below, the ancestral Trinity River and its tributaries may have occupied this area at times prior to the Late Holocene, much of this portion of the project area would have been located at some distance from the active meander belts of the Elm and West forks, and the main stem of the Trinity in the recent past. Further, the river valley of the Trinity and its tributaries narrows considerably from west to east in this area. This constriction is probably due to the change from soft Eagle Ford Shale bedrock in the western portion to the harder rocks of the Austin Chalk to the east making it more difficult for the river to widen its floodplain. Just as in other portions of the project area, Cliff et al. and Shanabrook observed a wide variation in the depth to Cretaceous bedrock and this was supported by the data from the many borings taken in this area (Cliff et al. 1999:Figures 10 and 12; Shanabrook and Green 2009:Figure 5; Trinity Parkway and Levee Rehabilitation borings). This is surprising in light of the fact that the bedrock here is the easily eroded Eagle Ford Shale so it is likely that the varying depth to bedrock reflects the amount of time that the Trinity and its two branches have spent in the differing portions of the river valley. The most deeply incised portions of the valley have a depth in the 16 to 21 meter range and are located west of the Hampton Road bridge, at the north end of the Continental Avenue bridge, and from east of the Commerce Street bridge to just east of the I-35E bridge. As noted previously, it is known that the pre-1932 meander belt of the West Fork was located just west of the Hampton Road bridge and that this same channel was located just south of the present levee so it is logical that this portion of the valley is fairly deep and the area of thick alluvium is fairly extensive. Similarly, the very deeply incised areas east of the Commerce Street bridge extending to the I-35E bridge probably reflect not only the softer bedrock but the fact that the narrower width of the floodplain has forced the ancestral Trinity to re-occupy the same portion of its valley over and over. Between these very deep portions of the valley are a number of bedrock ridges or knolls as well as areas that reflect more moderate valley incision. The transition from deep to shallow alluvial fill can be quite sudden and is generally not well reflected in the current surface topography. The Hampton Road bridge, located just east of a deep portion of the valley, rests entirely on a bedrock ridge covered by only 4.3 to 6 m of alluvium. This ridge is the width of the floodplain between the levees and stretches to just west of the Sylvan Avenue bridge. Near the Sylvan Avenue bridge, the alluvium is only slightly deeper with the fill at the northern end being 10 to 11 meter thick and 4 to 7 m thick at the southern end (Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 10; Shanabrook and Green 2009:Figure 5). This trend of the valley fill being thicker to the north and thinner to the south continues just west of the Continental Avenue bridge were the alluvium is 18.9 m thick at the north end (boring UP-8) and only 7 m thick at the south (boring FWR-05-01-WB). The large bedrock ridge from the Hampton Road bridge to the Sylvan Avenue bridge would strongly indicate that it has been some time since the Trinity or its tributaries occupied this area despite the scalloped shape of the upland south of that point which is almost certainly a product of fluvial action. This view is reinforced by the northward or northeastward thickening of the valley filled just noted which seems to indicate that the main channel of the Trinity stayed north and east of the area between the levees north and west of the Commerce Street bridge while the West Fork stayed to the west of it. Just as interesting is the considerable topography present on the bedrock surface and the rapidity with which it changes. 87

Figures 5 and 6 from Shanabrook et al. (2002) shows just how irregular the surface can be with the corresponding impact on sediment preservation and difficulty in trying to determine the location of previous fluvial channels from just surface topography. The borings taken just east of the Continental Avenue bridge paint an even more dramatic picture. Boring UP-8 near the northern end of the bridge encountered 18.9 m of alluvium, boring UP-2 located approximately 150 m farther south near the current Trinity River channel penetrated 9.8 m of sediment above bedrock, while FWR-05-01-WB located at the levee toe just west of the bridge roughly another 150 m to the south found only 7 m of valley fill. All of this indicates that the bedrock surface is highly irregular and is a product of several factors including the length of time the river has spent in a given location, the number of times the river has returned to that area, and the point in time (i.e., Late Holocene, Late Pleistocene, Early Holocene, etc) that the river was actually active at that spot. This variation also clearly shows that the ancestral Trinity changed its position by the process of avulsion leaving ridges and knolls of bedrock and earlier deposits between its active meander belts. That is, it has “jumped” from one point to another on its floodplain rather than sweeping continuously from one side of its valley to another. Needless to say, the thick valley fill means that it is almost certain that pre-Late Holocene deposits remain intact and undisturbed beneath the current floodplain surface in this part of the project area. Indeed, radiocarbon data from Geoprobe holes in the area west of the Hampton Road bridge conclusively show that Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene age units still remain there underneath the Late Holocene Pilot Point Alluvium (Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 12). Boring FER-09-01-WB in this same area encountered red-colored sediments typical of Pleistocene units buried under younger deposits. Geoprobe work in other areas strongly suggests that pre-Late Holocene sediments exist in other areas within this portion of the project area as well (Cliff et al. 1999:Figures 19-21). What is interesting is that these deposits often remain in areas where the alluvial fill is much thinner. Detailed examination of borings near the Sylvan Avenue Bridge indicate that a considerable thickness of Carrollton or Aubrey Alluvium (Terminal Pleistocene to Early Holocene) remains intact underneath Pilot Point Alluvium even though the depth to bedrock is only 5 to 8 m (Shanabrook and Green 2009:Figures 5 and 6). Since the recent meander belt deposits of the Late Holocene Pilot Point are often 9 to 11 m thick and have removed all pre-existing deposits to that depth (Cliff et al. 1999:41-44), this is another strong indicator that many areas near the current channelized Trinity River were located well away from its active channel in the Late Holocene. In this regard, it is interesting to note that here, as in the areas discussed previously, the Late Holocene channel of the West Fork was very stable for an extended period of time. Radiocarbon dates from point bar and cut bank deposits adjacent to the pre-1932 channel show that that meander belt was established and the point bar began to accumulate prior to 2,800 years B.P., remaining active into historic times while flood basin clays and later natural levee deposits were accumulating on the cut bank side of the channel. If this channel stability which has been observed here, near the Loop 12 bridge, and east of the CWWTP is typical, then large areas of the pre-Late Holocene floodplain could be preserved under a relatively thin veneer of Late Holocene deposits. As Frederick et al. noted, the near surface geology of this area near this old West Fork channel is much more complex than described here, but the stability of the channel over time which is the key point does not seem to be in doubt (2006:38-43). This channel stability and preservation of previous floodplain deposits can be seen in other ways. Frederick et al. noted what appears to be former fluvial channels with scroll bar or lateral accretion topography preserved on the point bars within the channels’ meander belt in a portion of the current floodplain west of the Westmoreland Avenue (or West Mockingbird Lane) bridge (Frederick et al. 2006:39-40, Figures 18 and 19). Five trenches excavated to a depth of roughly three m encountered only dark clays of the Pilot Point Alluvium and failed to reach point 88

bar or scroll bar deposits which are typically sandy or silty. On the one hand, this indicates that several pre-Late Holocene meander belts, in this case probably Early to Middle Holocene age (Frederick et al. 2006:40 postulate a Sanger Alluvium age which seems reasonable) are indeed preserved even in areas near active Late Holocene channels. On the other, Frederick et al. note that the scale and style of the buried channel belt is very different than the Trinity River channels of the Late Holocene since they appear to be over 250 m wide and show signs of significant and potentially rapid channel migration (2006:40 and Figure 19). This contrasts sharply with what is known about Late Holocene channels which appear to shift very slowly, are only one-third to one-half as wide, and appear to change their location on the floodplain by avulsion (Cliff et al. 1999: 52-57, Figure 18; Ferring and Yates 1997:35). Taking all of this together, there is strong potential for finding pre-Pilot Point age alluvial deposits in portions of this area where either the valley fill is thick or the area is located away from the former Late Holocene meander belts of the Elm and West forks and the main stem of the Trinity. All of the work done in this portion of the project area indicate that virtually all of the current floodplain is blanketed by Late Holocene age Pilot Point Alluvium in some cases covered by a small amount of more recent sediment (Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 17; Frederick et al. 2006). Further, numerous cultural deposits ranging in age from Archaic to Proto-Historic have been discovered in Pilot Point Alluvium at a variety of depths throughout the Trinity River drainage basin, some of them within or adjacent to the project area making these deposits of high interest. As noted above, there are some areas where these sediments remain undisturbed and hence, any cultural materials would remain intact. However, just as in all of the previous areas, those portions of the floodplain near the levees, bridges, and other historic structures have been disturbed, often quite severely. Borings along the levee toe both north and south of the present channel consistently show a zone of disturbance 1 to 3 m thick. Again, since the bore hole descriptions simply note the disturbed intervals as “fill”, it is not clear exactly what the nature of the disturbances are nor precisely how deep they may have affected the sediments. Along the length of the Sylvan Avenue bridge, the thickness of the disturbed zone is extremely irregular and ranges from just a few centimeters to well over 2 m (Shanabrook and Green 2009) indicating that it is difficult to predict exactly where and how much of the floodplain has been altered. Frederick et al. made a concerted effort to use historic maps, documents, and photos to delineate the areas that had been disturbed. He found that the area from west of the Continental Boulevard bridge to east of the I-30 bridge had been highly impacted by historic activities particularly borrow pits and other earth moving work as had to a lesser extent other areas further west. Even trying to avoid these areas, Frederick et al. still encountered areas that had been heavily modified but had not been recognized in the historic materials (2006:25-43). From this it is clear that the near surface deposits have been impacted in much of the area between the levees and that in some cases the modification has been subtle enough to go undetected. To summarize, the present and ancestral West Fork and main stem of the Trinity have deeply incised portions of this part of the project area. However, there is a large area of shallow alluvial fill stretching from west of the Hampton Road bridge to east of the Sylvan Avenue bridge indicating that the West Fork and main stem of the Trinity have remained north and west of the central part of this area for a long period. Just as in other areas, there is very strong evidence that pre-Late Holocene deposits remain intact under much of this area, mainly either in the areas of thicker alluvium or areas that were outside of the Late Holocene meander belts. Significantly, there appears to be a large area west of the Westmoreland Avenue bridge where pre-Late Holocene meander belt sediments may be preserved intact. Late Holocene sediments are ubiquitous in this portion of the current Trinity floodplain and have potential for containing 89

cultural deposits. However, this potential is limited first by the fact that much of this area would have been in the fluvial back swamp or flood basin portion of either the West Fork or main stem of the Trinity during much of this period and hence would have been an unattractive habitation site, and second by the high level of historic disturbance which has significantly altered or removed these sediments. 90

CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSION AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS Bearing in mind that this report is based primarily on data and conclusions from earlier reports augmented by information from a small portion of the many borings that have been collected in the project area, it is felt that the basic conclusions reached by Cliff et al. (1999:77-84) still apply and can be extended with minor modification to the entire project area. Updated and expanded versions of Figures 17 and 19-21 from Cliff et al. (1999) are attached as Figures 13, 14, 15, and 16. Despite the flat, relatively featureless nature of the floodplain surface in the project area, the bedrock surface under the river valley itself actually is fairly irregular and has considerable topography even over very short distances. Several large bedrock supported ridges exist as described above, one extending east from the Loop 12 bridge, another north of Carpenter Freeway (SH-183), a third between Hampton Road and Sylvan Avenue, and a fourth near Corinth Street. In addition, there are smaller bedrock supported knolls such as the ones near the east end of the Carpenter Freeway bridge and near the Sylvan Avenue bridge that are hidden beneath the alluvial valley fill. In addition to these changes in the thickness of the valley fill, the valley also grows narrower and the alluvial fill thinner as the underlying bedrock changes from the softer Eagle Ford Shale to the west to the more erosionally resistant Austin Chalk to the east. The more deeply incised portions of the valley may reflect a longer occupation by a river channel of that point, the time in the past that the river was present at that locale, the number of times that the channel occupied a given point, and the nature of the underlying bedrock. In most of the project area, the Late Holocene age Pilot Point Alluvium forms the surface of the current floodplain. In some cases, this alluvium is capped by the thick, cumulic clay-rich West Fork Paleosol while in others, the coarser sediments of the Pilot Point’s meander belt facies are present. The exceptions to this are first, those areas where the surface has been disturbed and the original surface deposits have been removed, buried, or otherwise altered, and second those places where the older floodplain surface has been covered by very recent alluvium derived from the channelized Trinity River and its tributaries. The Pilot Point’s meander belt deposits are often quite thick (9 to 11 m) and present a fining-upward of sedimentary grain size that is typical of fluvial point bars. The clay-rich deposits of the Pilot Point resemble the type of sediments found in a fluvial flood basin or back-swamp environment where rates of deposition are low. These deposits are generally in the range of 3 to 5.5 m in thickness and, as mention before, often 91

culminate in the dark, organic rich West Fork Paleosol. As noted previously, the Late Holocene river channels in the project area appear to be remarkably stable over the period of the past 2000 to 3000 years allowing for slow accumulation of sediment and soil formation in the flood basin and limiting both the amount and variation in location of the near-channel, meander belt environments available. This stability appears to be dramatically different from the fluvial style of the ancestral Trinity and tributaries and may have been caused by a number of factors including climatic change, variations in the type of sediment available, or fluctuations in sediment or water supply (Cliff et al. 1999:77-78). Buried beneath the Late Holocene in many areas of the current floodplain are several sets of earlier alluvial deposits. Although Pleistocene age Coppell/Tioga sediments appear to exist under the Late Holocene units adjacent to the large fluvial terrace that underlies Rochester Park, all the other pre-Late Holocene deposits appear to belong to the younger Carrollton, Aubrey, and Sanger alluviums. The Carrollton and Aubrey alluvia appear to be quite widespread in the project area. They are absent only over the bedrock highs noted above, although they are present near the Sylvan Avenue bridge where the valley begins to deepen to the east and north (Cliff et al. 1998; Cliff et al. 1999:Figures 19 and 20; Shanabrook and Green 2009). In fact, where these units seem to be present the alluvial fill is greater than 7 or 8 m and the action of the Late Holocene active meander belt has not removed them. The distribution of the Early to Middle Holocene age Sanger Alluvium appears to be somewhat more restricted based on current data. It is likely that it is present in the northern and western portions of the project area and intact deposits may extend as far as the Westmoreland Avenue bridge (Cliff et al. 1999:Figure 21; Frederick et al. 2006). It also appears to be present under the large fluvial terrace west of the CWWTP and in the thick alluvial fill north and east of it (Cliff et al. 1998; Shanabrook et al. 2002). However, the Sanger Alluvium appears to be missing or as yet undetected over the central portion of the project area. With the exceptions of the potential intact Sanger Alluvium located west of the Westmoreland Avenue bridge and the Sanger Alluvium found in the terrace near the CWWTP, most of these buried pre-Late Holocene deposits appear to have been truncated and any soils or evidence of stable surfaces removed. In the areas where they have been sampled and examined, these earlier deposits have tended to be fairly coarse grained, and the contact between each of these units and the overlying sediments is very sharp and erosional in nature. In the borings near the Sylvan Avenue bridge, the Carrollton/Aubrey deposits display a fining-upward grain size as is common in point bar deposits. However, the samples available were too incomplete to reach any firm conclusion, and this is too small a sample to characterize the nature of the pre-Late Holocene deposits over the whole of the project area (Shanabrook and Green 2009:Figure 5). The results of the present and previous research and the observed nature of the alluvium and its stratigraphy within the project area have two significant implications for prehistoric cultural deposits and archaeology. First, if, as it appears from the current data, the active meander belts of the West Fork and the main stem of the Trinity have been relatively stable over most of the Late Holocene, then the highest probability areas for buried, stratified cultural deposits dating to this period would be located in a relatively narrow band centered on the pre-1932 channels in the central and western portion of the project area and on the recent natural channels in the southern portion since these would have been the most attractive habitation sites. In areas where these meander belts were in close proximity to the edges of fluvial terraces or upland edges, the probability of cultural deposits would be even greater since these would be even more attractive locales. This combination of factors helps explain the dense concentration of sites near the CWWTP (Buysse 2000). Taking this approach would reduce the sites with the highest potential within the project area to a relative handful: the area near the Loop 12 bridge, the area west of 96

the Hampton Road bridge, the area north of the Carpenter Freeway bridge, and the area bracketing the current Trinity River channel south of the Forest Avenue bridge. Although the Pilot Point Alluvium is present in a much wider area, these areas would have been located in the fluvial back swamp environment at the time of deposition and would have been a relatively unattractive habitation site. Further, a large portion of the upper parts of these deposits in the vicinity of the levees, bridges, and areas of other historic impacts have often been highly disturbed to a depth of several meters and in some cases, appears to have been removed entirely. This factor reduces the possibility of finding intact cultural deposits in these areas even further. Second, the presence of buried alluvial deposits which pre-date the start of the Late Holocene offers the possibility for there being buried materials from very early cultural periods located in the project area. It is certain that there are Carrollton-, Aubrey-, and Sanger-age alluvial units present within the project area. This is particularly true in areas where the valley fill is the thickest (7 to 8 m is normally sufficient) or in areas remote or protected from active Late Holocene meander belts. However, it should be remembered that the upper portions of many of these older units appear to have been severely eroded and truncated, and the majority of those examined do not seem to indicate the presence of any widespread stable surfaces. The two exceptions to this within the project area appear to be the large fluvial terrace of Sanger-age alluvium near the CWWTP and the area of possible preserved scroll bar topography and abandoned channels west of the Westmoreland Avenue bridge. There may be other areas where stable surfaces were preserved within these earlier deposits such as along the margins of bedrock highs or the valley margins where they would have escaped destruction by the Trinity’s repeated cycles of valley filling followed by a period of channel incision, floodplain widening, and removal of earlier deposits. This thinking is supported by the buried soils observed by Ferring in areas near the valley margin west of the channelized Elm Fork (1999). However, the limited available data, the great depth to which the bulk of these deposits are buried, and the erosion to which they have be subjected, would make any cultural deposits they contain very difficult to find and almost impossible to predict. To conclude, the near surface geology in the project area is relatively complex. A wide variation exists in the depth of the alluvial fill, and this variation indicates that the downcutting of the ancestral Trinity River and its tributaries has not been uniform across the valley. Almost everywhere on the floodplain, the surface unit consists of the Pilot Point Alluvium but this unit has been heavily impacted by a variety of historic activities and buried in a few areas by more recent deposits especially near the rectified and natural Trinity River channel. Portions of the older Carrollton, Aubrey, and Sanger alluvia are also preserved in portions of the valley, particularly those where the fill is thicker or remote from the Late Holocene river channels. A strong possibility exists that buried, stratified sites dating to the Late Holocene could be preserved in the project area, particularly near the former channel of the West Fork and the channel of the Trinity River southeast of the Forest Avenue Bridge. It is also possible that cultural materials predating the Late Holocene could be preserved in the earlier sediments. The highest probability areas for these materials would be near the valley margins or along the edges of the buried bedrock ridges and knolls, the fluvial terrace west of the CWWTP, and under the current Trinity floodplain west of the Westmoreland Avenue bridge. However, these deposits would be very deeply buried, very difficult to predict and locate, and very few in number given their potential exposure to repeated cycles of fluvial cut and fill. 97

Based on these assessments, further cultural resources monitoring should be conducted in specified areas when there is construction along the Dallas Floodway. Areas near old channels of the Trinity River or at depths greater than two to three meters should be given particular attention. Testing should be conducted before construction is performed on or near the terrace around the sewer plant, with subsequent monitoring during construction. Monitoring should especially be conducted during any deep coring, particularly for larger bridge piers that would yield larger samples for both cultural materials and sediment. In addition, when construction is conducted three meters below the surface or more (i.e., borrow pits, wells, sumps, etc.), it is paramount that monitoring occur to ensure that significant archaeological deposits of the Late Pleistocene to Middle Holocene periods are not inadvertently destroyed. The presence of the Aubrey Clovis site at a depth of 8 meters below the flood plain surface within the upper reaches of the Elm Fork clearly demonstrates that the potential for deeply buried sites exists. Twenty-three known archaeological sites (Figure 17; Table 7) are within the Dallas Floodway System and are located in areas that could be potentially impacted directly or indirectly by the proposed remediation measures for correcting the deficiencies of the Dallas Floodway System. Of these 23, sites, 16 (see Table 7) have been recommended ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark, six (41DL67, 41DL222, 41DL224, 41DL225, 41DL323, and 41DL414) are of unknown eligibility, and one (41DL371) has been recommended eligible for designation as a State Archeological Landmark but has not been actually designated. Of these properties, only those of unknown eligibility or those that have been recommended eligible are of concern in relation to the potential impacts of the proposed remediation measures. If these sites would be impacted by the remediation measures, evaluation measures and, if necessary, mitigation measures should be planned and implemented in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office. 98
