Archeological Investigations at the Dalbey Site (41DL350), Dallas, Texas S. Alan Skinner, C. Britt Bousman, and Jesse Todd ABSTRACT The Dalbey site (41DL350) is a prehistoric archeological site exposed in the west bank of the Trinity River in Dallas, Texas. The 6+ m thick floodplain deposit contains four buried paleosols and burned clay surfaces. Previously a human burial was found eroding out of the base of the bank near the south end of the site and was radiocarbon-dated to cal A.D. 970-1040. Trenching and testing were carried out by AR Consultants in 2003 and 2005 at the north end of the site prior to construction of the Loop 12 Boat Ramp. A geoarcheological profile in the middle of the site was recorded in order to define the geological context of the site and compare the north and the south portions. Trenching the riverbank along the ramp centerline confirmed the presence of burned clay surfaces reported by Tim Dalbey, who called the site to the attention of the Texas Historical Com- mission. Testing of 7 m3 of sediment from between 4-6 m below the surface failed to define living surfaces adjacent to hearth stains. The small artifact assemblage recovered included lithic debris, fire-cracked rock, bone fragments, mussel and snail shells, and a single Gary dart point. Radiocarbon dating documented occupation from cal. A.D. 460 to A.D. 1340 with underlying sediments dating older than cal. 135 B.C. The site represents repeated occupation during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods for the purpose of acquiring riverine and floodplain foods. INTRODUCTION construction.

One unit (TU 11) was continued to 120 cm below datum. Because soil was shovel scraped and then bagged and removed for subsequent fine screening, our in-field impression was that artifact densities were low and varied little per level, except that it was apparent that a distinct occupation surface occurred between 5.70-5.80 m bd in each of the six units. The scraped surfaces were regularly inspected for features or obvious artifact concentrations but none were found. Despite generally clear, hot, and humid weather, the block was inundated twice; once due to an upstream water release and the second time due to an intense localized rainstorm. Within an hour after finishing excavation, the block was inundated completely as the result of several hours of intense rain. As shown in Figure 11, only a single zone containing artifacts was encountered. The matrix in the entire block was described by Bousman as an olive brown (2.5Y4/4) clay loam with fine moderate to strong angular blocky structure, and common bluish-gray (10B5/1) gleyed redox features (mottles).

Skinner et al.—Archeological Investigations at the Dalbey Site (41DL350), Dallas, Texas 81 based on sediment deposition rates, faunal and charcoal remains, and the few artifacts and occu- pation surfaces found appear to have been roughly unchanged over time and floodplain adaptations remained constant. Occupation in the boat ramp area spanned the period from approximately A.D. 570 to A.D. 650. Based on the testing results, it is predicted that sediments containing scattered cul- tural materials may continue below the water line. The radiocarbon dates present an interesting set of questions with regard to the placement of the burial in the geologic context of the Dalbey site. The burial appears to have been in or on the same matrix uncovered in the 2005 block and it was at ap- proximately the same elevation as the bench surface adjacent to the block. Consequently, it is logical to expect that the date of the rock-filled hearth, which Figure 13. Gary dart point recovered in 2005. Illustrated is more than 1 m above the adjacent bench surface, by Lance K. Trask. would be younger than A.D. 930, the burial date, and possibly younger than the higher pit date of A.D. 1340. Likewise, if the burial date is associ- possibly due to the shifting of gravel bars, because ated with the matrix that is lower than Zone 9 (see Quadrula nodulata was found only in the 5.70-5.80 Table 1), it is also logical to expect that the block m bd level in TU 8. sediments might date in the A.D. 900s. However, the The sediments found in the 2003/2005 excava- four calibrated dates from the block range A.D. 570- tions are below Zone 9 and represent a very heavily 650.
