The Late Prehistoric of the East Fork of the Trinity River Wilson W. Crook, III and Mark Hughston Houston Archeological Society and Brazos Gas Company Email: dubcrook@kingwoodcable.com Overthelast42years,theauthorshavestudiedindetailthesitesandarcheological remains ascribed to the Late Prehistoric period of the East Fork of the Trinity River and its tributaries. This includes 20 major sites and a larger number of smaller campsites that occur within a 75 km by 15 km north-south corridor from Collin County in the north to northwestern Kaufman County in the south. As part of this study, we have accessed and examined all known extant collections from previous investigations with a combined artifact assemblage of nearly 32,000 specimens. In addition, we obtained access to the unpublished field notes and maps from many previous researchers and combined them with our own field and laboratory observations. The results of this study confirms the conclusion of both Bruseth and Martin and Prikryl that the Wylie Focus, as originally proposed by Stephenson, is an outdated concept. A new chronological sequence consisting of a Woodland period followed by two Late Prehistoric period phases is proposed. In detailing the proposed new sequences, extensive information on each major site, site features such as the distinctive rim-and-pit structures, burials, hearths and caches, and the diagnostic artifacts that characterize each cultural phase are provided. We also detail how the Late Prehistoric of the East Fork is a unique culture, similar but yet distinctly different from the surrounding sites including Bird Point Island (41FT201) and Adams Ranch (41NV177) in Freestone and Navarro counties.

The Late Prehistoric of the East Fork of the Trinity River south along the main branch of the Trinity (Figure 2). Sites along the Elm Fork have a significantly higher percentage of triangular arrow points (Fresno, Harrell, Washita) and a larger percentage of shell-tempered ceramics, both of which are more characteristic of the Henrietta phase of the southern Great Plains [23, 5]. SiteseastoftheEastForkarecharacterizedbyahigher percentage of Caddo traits [24]. Likewise, sites to the south along Richland Creek, such as Bird Point Island (41FT201) and Adams Ranch (41NV177), are characterized by a number of traits which differ from thosewhichcharacterizetheEastForkLatePrehistoric. Chief among these are (1) different shaped house structures; (2) extensive use of Psoralea, the Prairie Turnip, completely absent along the East Fork; (3) the virtual absence of any shell-tempered ceramics which makes up nearly 50 percent of East Fork ceramics; (4) the occurrence of Hayes and Cuney points and the lack of Catahoula and Fresno points; (5) the occurrence of different utilitarian tools such as the Bristol biface and thecompleteabsenceofsub-triangularscraperssuchas the East Fork Biface [25]; and (6) the absence of tools made from worked mussel shell. Moreover, while both FIGURE1. DistributionoftheLatePrehistoricsitesalong the Richland Creek and the larger East Fork sites have theEastForkoftheTrinityanditstributaries.

Crook and Hughston as such, stated that the Wylie Focus was an outdated construct and should be abandoned [4]. No detailed study of the East Fork material was included in this analysis and no new construct was offered for the East Fork as a replacement to the Wylie Focus. Prikryl [5] studied the prehistory of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River and as part of this work, tangentially looked at the East Fork. He proposed a Late Archaic phase followed by Late Prehistoric I and Late PrehistoricIIperiodsforallofNorthCentralTexas[5]. AnapproximateageofA.D.750-1250wasproposedfor theLatePrehistoricIperiodandca.

Nospecific cultural construct was proposed for the East Fork. We have now concluded the most extensive review of the Late Prehistoric period of the East Fork. This included the excavation and analysis of eight major FIGURE 2.

With the exception of the lack of double-bitted axes, this is precisely what is present belowtheLatePrehistoricperioddepositsinsitesalong the East Fork and its tributaries. Two radiocarbon dates from the East Fork are available from this period; one from a burial at Lower Rockwall (Beta-393414), and the other from a burial at Glen Hill (Beta-393415). Both date to around the sametimeframe,A.D.710+/-30andA.D.730+/-30, respectively. The Glen Hill date is significant because a small sherd of typical Williams Plain pottery was found associated with the skeletal remains and was ascertained to have been part of the original burial fill (Lester L. Wilson, personal communication, 1973). As such, it denotes that ceramics were present along the East Fork as early as ca. A.D. 700. FIGURE 5.

This occupation, which marks the true beginning of the Late Prehistoric period, appears to have developed in place as there is a continuous progression from the Late Woodland occupation into this phase. However, the exact mechanism that spurred the emergence of a Late Prehistoric culture along the East Fork remains uncertain. Regardless, the beginning of the Late Prehistoric period along the East Fork marks the beginning of an expansion in population with larger, more permanently occupied sites.
