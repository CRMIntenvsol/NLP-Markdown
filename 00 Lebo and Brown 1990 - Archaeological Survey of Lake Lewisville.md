vi ABSTRACT A redestrian survey of 14,000 acres encompassing the periphery of Lewisville Lake, a multipurpose reservoir in Northcentral Texas, resulted in the documentation of 151 historic and prehistoric components of which 39 have been recommended for further testing to determine eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places. The prehistoric sites include Archaic and Late Prehistoric camps of short- and long-term occupations, exhibiting strong potential for contributing to regional research issues such as the relationships between critical resources and settlement locations, past environments, and adaptive strategies. Sites occupied during the historical period date from circa 1870 to 1950, offering data necessary to the investigation of changing patterns of adaptation by settlers over a century of rapid technological development. nANAatENT SUMMflAy This report describes the results of an archaeological survey of the Lewisville Lake shoreline. This work was conducted by the Institute of Applied Sciences, University of North Texas, as part of Contract No. DACW63-86-C- 0098 with the Fort Worth District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The survey area was defined by the existing shoreline and the 532-foot MSL contour; a total of 14,000 acres were covered by pedestrian crews. Extensive shovel testing and augering were used in areas with high site potential and low surface visibility. Maps and archival records were used to help locate historic sites. A total of 66 prehistoric and 85 historic components were recorded or relocated in the survey area; additionally, 13 historic sites in Wynnwood Park were reviewed, and one site in Hickory Creek Park was recorded in a later survey. Prehistoric sites were most common along Little Elm Creek and Hickory Creek; historic sites were most common along the eastern portions of the lake. Extensive deposits of recent alluvium on the upper parts of the Elm Fork Trinity and Hickory Creek flood piains prevented site discovery in these areas. Among the sites located during this survey, 23 prehistoric and 16 historic sites are recommended for further evaluation. Testing, limited testing, backhoe trenching, magnetometer survey, and archival research are the different methods of further investigation recommended here. The rationale for the recommendations is derived from (a) the research problems outlined in the Ray Roberts-Lewisville research design and (b) the character, content, and condition of the individual sites.

As for other early reservoirs in this area, neither is imperative to consider its geographic position, its legal nor fiscal provisions existed for intensive cultural ecological character and the role of paleo- resources investigations associated with Federal land environmental change with respect to local adaptive use programs. At Lewisville, for example, most strategies and contacts with neighboring culture archaeological data were collected by avocational groups. These broad issues are considered in the Ray archaeologists prior to construction (Crook and Harris Roberts-Lewisville research design. 1957; Prikryl 1987).

4 Chapter 1 part of the western shore. The alluvial fill of the terrace, named the Coppell Alluvium was formerly described asthe "Hill, Shuler and Richards formations" (Slaughter et al 1962). Rancholabrean faunas from this alluvium are poorly dated, with estimated ages from Sangamon to middle Wisconsin (Ferring 1986d, in press). Fill from this terrace was reported to be the context of the Lewisville Clovis site (Crook and Harris 1957) yet the alluvium is much too old for this claim. Inset below the Hickory Creek Terrace are younger Late Pleistocene terraces, informally named the Denton Creek terraces. These have sandier fill than the Coppell Alluvium, and these terraces are not as continuous as the Hickory Creek. The Denton Creek terraces formed during a period of valley incision, and all are Pleistocene in age. All of the latest Pleistocene and Holocene alluvium Is below the floodplain. Thus archaeological sites that are in situ in alluvium are all below the floodplain of the Trinity and its major tributaries. Alluvial fan and colluvial deposits are common along the Woodbine escarpment in the northern part of the study area. These accumulated during the late Quaternary and apparently during as least part of the Holocene. Although these depositional environments and sediments are not well known, they appear to be good settings for archaeological site preservation.

8 Chapter 2 define significance, while for the research model, the research questions define the values for significance. The research model is also arbitrary in the sense that no criteria are made for who asks the research questions and what constitutes valid research questions. In summary, "the qualty of significance in archaeology is a relationship between the physical characteristics of sites and the state of knowledge about sites" (Stuart and Gauthler 1981:353). The articulation of the resource model and research model for determining significance allows for a comprehensive treatment of all cultural resources. Because both models address management and research Issues, a modification of these models has been used in formulating recommendations for sites in the Lewisville Lake project area. Summary A large body of archaeological literature has been written concerning the determination of significance as it relates to cultural resources. This is due to the fact that if a site is determined not to be significant, it is excluded from further Federally funded research and does not receive protective management consideration. We believe the most promising approach to determination of significance for cultural resource management is use of the dual model proposed by Stuart and Gauthier (1981). The resource model is simplistic and concerns site frequency within a defined project boundary, while the research model has a point of reference the current knowledge of a region and current research questions that are proposed by archaeologists conducting research. We believe this dual model for defining site significance, which takes into consideration isolated occurrences as well as complex sites, is the most effective approach in cultural resource management and Is adopted for determination of potential site significance In the present study.

We will consider site site formation approaches to historical sites. Previously locations relative to landforms, soils, and vegetation, this has not been addressed, despite the increasing These are critical factors in potential agricultural or emphasis on sheet refuse as an indicator of site-use livestock productivity. Soil types, for example, are patterns (Moir 1982). We will explicitly consider site related to rates of fertility decline. Vegetation is related construction and site modification at historic localities in to grazing potentials and also land clearing costs. order to assess the different processes that have Within sites, we will focus on evidence for the duration shaped the resulting archaeological records at these and character of occupations as measured by artifact sites. For example, historical sites are subject to the assemblages, architectural evidence for stability and same constructional processes as prehistoric sites with change, and other evidence for the character and respect to duration and character of occupations. Sites intrasite distribution of activities (cf. Moir 1982). occupied over long intervals should exhibit less clear spatial patterning and greater degrees of mixing than sites occupied only briefly. Site Formation Processes How do these patterns relate to landscape positioning? For example, we will contrast site A guiding perspective for both prehistoric and formation on shallow clay soils with those on deeper historic investigations on this project will be site sandy soils, where bioturbation and mixing potentials formation processes (Schiffer 1976,1983; Butzer are different.

We will focus excavation and Essentially, the approach involves identifying the testing strategies to evaluate these differences; these cultural and natural processes that shaped the strategies will include an evaluation of sheet-refuse resulting archaeological record. The intensity and testing methods as opposed to small block or trench repetitive aspects of site use are related to potential excavations. Similarly, we will evaluate the record of disturbance or mixture of artifacts and features, sites in which structures have deteriorated over a long Erosion, weathering, bioturbation, pedoturbation, and interval as opposed to those which burned. other natural agents modify the character of the We will also evaluate sampling strategies designed archaeological materials and features.

Our emphasis will not be strictly occupational site modification. For example, structure on site modification (cf.

These samples will be evaluated (including cultural activities within a given site formation relative to sheet-refuse excavation results as well as environment) and the subsequent modification or limited block and/or feature excavation. alteration of that primary record. This approach has already been used in the Ray Roberts project to investigate 41C0141 (Ferring Field Survey Methods 1986b), with promising results.

The absence of well-documented historic Sharpening Flake Native American sites is, therefore, a major gap in the archaeological record for the Lewisville Lake area as Two types of sharpening flakes are recognized: (1) elsewhere in the state. sharpening flakes from bifacially flaked tools and (2) sharpening flakes from unifacially flaked tools. Sharpening flakes are characterized by having a well- Artifact Typology defined working edge along their proximal end.

It is imperative to develop a procedure to platforms, or systematic alignment of cleavage scars on group specimens based upon empirical observations the various faces (Binford and Ouimby 1963). in order to comprehend variability within and between the artifacts. In order to achieve the above goal, a set of Core classes are constructed by means of which the specimens can be defined. The following are This is any piece of raw material that has a descriptions of classes of artifacts recovered during recognizable striking platform and has well-defined field investigations at Lewisville Lake. The classes of flake scars (negative bulbs of force) and systematic artifacts are based on general morphological alignment of cleavage scars on the various faces. characteristics. Cores can be further divided into block cores and blade cores. Block cores are used in the production of Flake irregularly shaped flakes while blade cores are used in the production of regularly shaped blades or flakes. A flake is any piece of chert, flint or raw material that have been removed from a larger mass by the Knife application of force and that have at least one of several distinguishing characteristics present: (1) a This is a tool that has marginal and/or invasive striking platform remnant; (2) point of percussion or retouch on one or both faces.

Current survey work included a surface grab collection of all observed cultural material from eroded areas of the beach and uplands. No STPs were dug because of the site being located in Lewisville Lake Park and the absence of topsoil. The site was recorded by Jay R. Newman. Site Integrity: An unknown portion of the site has been eroded and inundated by Lewisville Lake. Since the site is in Lewisville Lake Park, it has been subjected to extensive recreational activities that have partially destroyed its integrity. There is very low potential for subsurface cultural materials and features. Adverse Impacts: The remaining portion of the site will be inundated and/or eroded away by the planned water level rise of Lewisville Lake. Itw ill continue to be subjected to recreational activities. Potential Significance: Site 41DN473 has been extensively eroded and disturbed by Lewisville Lake and recreational activities. The site is assigned a low potential for providing significant information about the prehistory of the region. Recommendations: No further work is recommended for the site due to inundation, erosion, and disturbance by pedestrian traffic.
