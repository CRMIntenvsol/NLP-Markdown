MANAGEMENT SUMMARY This report relates to the archeological evaluation of a disturbed prehistoric site, the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369), carried out for Pulte Homes of Irving, Texas, in the area of their Harbor Pointe Development, Rowlett, Texas. The work consisted of surface inspection, hand excavation and scraping, mechanical scraping, and backhoe trenching undertaken in the vicinity of reported human remains, on a terrace east of Rowlett Creek in northeastern Dallas County. As a result of the accidental discovery of these disturbed human remains, the area required evaluation in order to ensure that no additional in situ material would be disturbed by scheduled construction in this area of Pulte Homes’ Harbor Pointe Development. This evaluation failed to reveal any remaining in situ archeological or osteological remains and it was concluded that the Harbor Pointe Development could continue without any danger to additional archeological remains. iii

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION The Harbor Pointe site (41DL369) is a prehistoric burial site located in northeastern Dallas County, between the City of Rowlett and the City of Garland. The site is east of what is today the confluence of Rowlett Creek and Lake Ray Hubbard, within the East Fork of the Trinity River drainage (Figure 1). The site was originally identified when fragmentary human remains were discovered on the site by several private citizens. By the time the remains had been reported to the authorities, most of them had been removed from the find spot. In addition to human remains, shell beads and a marine shell gorget were also removed, and unsubstantiated reports of an extensive Native American cemetery were soon widespread in the popular press. As a result of its desire to see the site, and the proper treatment of any associated human remains, Pulte Homes, the owner of record, contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), of Plano, Texas, to evaluate the site; to determine what, if any, archeological deposits remained intact on the site; to make recommendations regarding any possible future research to be conducted at the site; and to coordinate with all interested Native American groups for the proper treatment and ultimate reburial of the human remains already collected from the site. The evaluation of the Harbor Pointe site was conducted by personnel of GMI from June 1 to June 6, 1995. The field crew for most of the time consisted of two persons, Mr. Steven Hunt and Mr. Steve Duncan, under the supervision of Dr. Maynard Cliff. Mr. Duane Peter, Vice President for Cultural Resources, and Dr. Cliff, Senior Archeologist for GMI, served as Principal Investigators. The records of this project are curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas, Austin. The following report presents the environmental and archeological context of the study area, the project methodology, and the results of the investigations.

CHAPTER 2 ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND The Harbor Pointe site is located in northeastern Dallas County, east of the confluence of Rowlett Creek with Lake Ray Hubbard. Prior to the construction of the lake, the site would have been approximately 600 m northeast of the channel of Rowlett Creek. Physiographically, the Harbor Pointe site lies within the Blackland Prairie, an area bounded by the White Rock escarpment on the west and the East Texas Timber Belt on the east (Fenneman 1938:103). Geologically, the study area is underlain by the Cretaceous-age Ozan formation, made up of medium gray calcareous clay, with silt and sand decreasing with depth (Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG] 1988). The Ozan formation is over 150 m thick and is commonly covered by deposits of thick, old terrace alluvium. Surface soil on the site itself is mapped as being Altoga silty clay, 5 to 12 percent slopes, eroded; with Lewisville silty clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes, to the north and south. Altoga series soils are Inceptisols (specifically, Typic Ustochrepts) and consist of deep, well-drained, clayey soils formed in old alluvium on ridges and side slopes. A typical pedon of Altoga silty clay consists of an approximately 10-cm-thick Ap horizon of light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silty clay which is underlain by a 53-cm-thick B21 zone of very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay, a 38-cm-thick B22 zone of mottled yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay, a 64-cm-thick B3ca zone of light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay, and a 38-cm-thick IIC zone of brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) clay loam (Coffee et al. 1980:54). Lewisville series soils are Mollisols (specifically, Typic Calciustolls) and consist of deep, well-drained clayey soils on old alluvium on stream terraces. A typical pedon of Lewisville silty clay consists of a 23-cm-thick All zone and a 15-cm-thick A12 zone, and underlain by a B21ca zone, a B22ca zone, a B3 zone, and a C horizon (Coffee et al. 1980:62). Dallas County is within the Texan biotic province as defined by Blair (1950). This is an intermediate zone between the forest of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits of their range in the Texan province. Prior to earthmoving, the vegetation within the study area was predominantly grassland, with scattered clusters and patches of trees. The largest area of trees was on top of the hill, north of the Harbor Pointe site, and along a small, unnamed tributary of Rowlett Creek (now flowing into Lake Ray Hubbard) to the south. Grasses within this area may have included little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, Texas needlegrass, Florida paspalum, Virginia wildrye, Torrey silver bluestem, meadow dropseed, buffalograss, and sideoats grama (Coffee et al. 1980:87-90). The faunal community in this region has undergone changes due to the expansion of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. However, the species of wildlife which previously inhabited the area include bobwhite quail, pheasant, meadowlark, field sparrow, sage grouse, lark bunting, cottontail, red fox, antelope, and deer (Coffee et al. 1980:50).

CHAPTER 3 ARCHEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Within the last decade, three major reports concerning the archeology of the Upper Trinity River basin have aptly summarized the history of archeological investigations and the cultural-historical framework for this area. These reports are An Assessment of the Cultural Resources in the Trinity River Basin: Dallas, Tarrant, and Denton Counties, Texas (Yates and Ferring 1986), Late Holocene Prehistory of the Mountain Creek Basin (Peter and McGregor 1988), and A Synthesis of Prehistory of the Lower Elm Fork of the Trinity River (Prikryl 1990). In addition, a discussion of the prehistory of the East Fork area is included in the introduction to the regional preservation plan for North Central Texas, designated the Prairie-Savanna Study Region of the Eastern Planning Region of Texas (Prikryl 1993). For more information on the archeology of the Upper Trinity River basin, the reader is referred to these sources. PREVIOUS RESEARCH As noted by McGregor (1988:27-29), much of the excavation efforts within the Upper Trinity River basin has focused on reservoir development, especially along the Elm Fork (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Skinner and Baird 1985; Skinner et al. 1982) and the East Fork (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Field school excavations by the University of Texas at Arlington at the Northlake site on Grapevine Creek were also reported in the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975). More recent investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Jurney et al. 1988; Peter and McGregor 1988) and the test excavations of the River Bend site, 41TR68 (Peter et al. 1987), have provided the initial assemblage data necessary for an understanding of the adaptations along the West Fork of the Trinity River. Reservoir studies along the East Fork have included work at Lake Lavon and Lake Ray Hubbard. Lake Lavon was surveyed in 1949, with test excavations being conducted at the Campbell Hole (41COL10) and Hogge Bridge (41COL1) sites (Stephenson 1949). Additional excavations conducted at the Hogge Bridge site resulted in the formal definition of the Wylie focus--a Late Prehistoric manifestation believed to be characterized by arrow points, flexed burials, large pits (often), and trade pottery from cultures to both the east and west (Stephenson 1952). Additional excavations were carried out by Southern Methodist University (SMU) as a result of the planned enlargement of Lake Lavon (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lynott 1975). Lake Ray Hubbard was surveyed with the help of Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) members in 1963 (Harris and Suhm 1963), with excavations being carried out subsequently at the Glen Hill (41RW4) and Upper Rockwall (41RW2) sites (Ross 1966), and the Lower Rockwall site (41RW1; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968). Much of this work was concentrated on excavations at “Wylie focus pit” sites in an effort to better understand the function of these large depressions.

Our knowledge of the Archaic period in the Upper Trinity River drainage is limited by the lack of data from major excavations. This is particularly true for the Early and Middle Archaic periods. Recent investigations in the West Fork drainage (Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986) indicate that primary contexts for Early and Middle Archaic sites will be found deeply buried within floodplain alluvium. Artifacts from these periods are found on terrace surfaces, but they are frequently mixed with later materials. In fact, the initial treatment of the Archaic period (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the Carrollton and Elam foci, was based upon materials from such mixed terrace contexts. Consequently, these concepts are no longer recognized as being acceptable for North Central Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and at Lake Ray Roberts indicate that the Late Archaic period is characterized by assemblages left by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a locality for a limited time period and then moved on to another locality. These sites were apparently reoccupied numerous times on a seasonal basis. Deer and numerous small mammals were the primary food resources. The documentation of large pits associated with Late Archaic period sites in the Richland/Chambers Creek drainage by SMU (Bruseth and Martin 1987) and along the upper Elm Fork by the University of North Texas (UNT) suggests that important sociopolitical changes may have been occurring during this time period. Unfortunately, the significance of these pits remains an enigma despite their excellent documentation. The beginnings of the Late Prehistoric period in the Upper Trinity River basin is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points and ceramics. The date of A.D. 700 for the beginning of this period is based upon dated contexts to the west in the Brazos River drainage. Lynott (1977) suggests that the Late Prehistoric period may be divided into an early and late phase. The early phase is characterized by sand- tempered and grog-tempered ceramics, Scallorn and Alba arrow points, and an apparent continuation of the foraging subsistence system of the Late Archaic period. The late phase reflects a Southern Plains influence with the appearance of Nocona Plain shell-tempered ceramics, various unstemmed triangular arrow points (e.g., Fresno, Harrell, and Washita), and the Perdiz arrow point. Evidence of horticulture and the procurement of bison also appears in sites of this period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). Prikryl’s (1990) assessment of the Late Prehistoric period largely follows that of Lynott (1977). Investigations of the Cobb-Pool site at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have resulted in a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site has yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba arrow points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late twelfth or early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive Caddoan occupation from the east; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive change remains to be documented. Historical documentation and archeological evidence are very sparse for the Protohistoric period in the Upper Trinity River basin. Native American groups affiliated with the Tonkawa, Wichita, Caddo, and Comanche are all likely to have traversed the area. However, exact locations of their sites and detailed ethnohistoric data are almost nonexistent. Although European trade items (Sollberger 1953) appear on a limited number of sites and bison kills of this period have been examined (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970), no protohistoric site has been thoroughly investigated yet and characterizations of the Native American adaptations during this time period are conjectural at best. A lack of documentary evidence, together with a lack of interest among ethnologists and archeologists, has contributed to this situation.

CHAPTER 4 METHODOLOGY AND CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS The purpose of the evaluation of the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369) was to determine what, if any, archeological deposits remained intact on the site and to make recommendations regarding any possible future research to be conducted there. If in situ cultural remains could be located on the site, the determination of their research potential would depend upon an assessment of the site’s integrity, the types of data present, and the applicability of those data to important regional research questions. The evaluation procedures outlined below were designed to accomplish these goals. PROJECT BACKGROUND The Harbor Pointe site (41DL369) was originally identified when human remains were discovered by several private citizens. The area of the site in which the remains were discovered had been graded and prepared for construction of domestic units on terraced pads approximately six months previous to the find, and the human remains were reportedly found eroding from the downslope edge of one of these pads, within a relatively small area, on or about May 24, 1995. By the time the remains had been reported to the authorities, on or about May 29, most of them had been removed from the find spot. In addition to human remains, shell beads and a marine shell gorget were also removed, and unsubstantiated reports of an extensive Native American cemetery were soon widespread in the popular press. The human remains were turned over to the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office and identified as being Native American by Dr. Gill King. The shell artifacts were turned over to the Dallas Intertribal Center for safekeeping. On May 31, 1995, Mr. Duane Peter, Dr. Maynard Cliff, and Ms. Victoria Green of Geo-Marine, Inc. (GM)), visited the reported burial area. They were the first professional archeologists to visit the site. Also on hand at this time was Mr. Alex Barker, archeologist with the Dallas Museum of Natural History. By this time, none of the originally identified human remains remained in the original find spot, although numerous small splinters of eroded bone, possibly of human origin, were noted on the surface of the adjacent downslope building pad. At this time a small amount of human bone and several shell beads collected by Mr. Mark Hibbs, an avocational archeologist and member of the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS), and Mr. Doug Sager were turned over to the GMI personnel. A more extensive scatter of eroded bone, which was responsible for the initial reports of a widespread cemetery, was identified as consisting of fossil animal bone hypothesized to originate from within the apparently Pleistocene-age terrace deposits into which the later human remains had been deposited. All of the original ground surface of the terrace in the reported vicinity of the archeological remains was found to be disturbed with the exception of a small area surrounding a large tree to the west. Mr. Hibbs and Mr. Sager had also found bone in the vicinity of this undisturbed il

Backhoe Trench 7 was located about 60 m to the southeast of Area B and about 50 m to the southwest of Area A, in the southeast corner of Pad 9, where original ground surface was reported to be buried beneath approximately 50 cm of fill; and, Backhoe Trench 8 was located about 50 m to the south of Area B and about 60 m to the west of Area A, in the southwest corner of Pad 9, where original ground surface was reported to be buried beneath approximately 70 cm of fill. All of the backhoe trenches examined (i.e., Trenches 1-8) were approximately 3 to 4 m long and 60 cm wide, while their depth varied from 155 to 200 cm. A sample of each backhoe bucket load of dirt was screened through 6.35 mm hardware cloth (it is estimated that approximately 3-5 percent of the dirt removed from each trench was screened in this way). Portions of the trench walls were scraped and cleaned, then examined for cultural materials or features. The sediments encountered in each trench were described and the depth and thickness of each zone was measured. The color of each zone was determined in the field using fresh sediment samples and Munsell soil color charts. No cultural remains, fossil remains, or human bone were recovered in any of these backhoe trenches. Similarly, several road cuts and large construction trenches and ditches were examined and described (Profiles 1 to 3). All profiles were first cleaned with shovels, pickax, and trowels to provide a fresh face, and then the sediments encountered were described, measured, and their colors determined using a fresh soil sample and a Munsell chart. Elevations and locations for the trenches and profiles were determined by a transit survey of the study area. OSTEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS Osteological observations on the human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site were made by a GMI physical anthropologist. Skeletal observations consisted of determining the minimum number of individuals represented, the skeletal and dental elements present, sex, age, and hereditary association, if possible, through gross examination of the remains. In addition, any pathological process relating to activity, morbidity, communal strife, and accidental trauma was documented when observable. Furthermore, quality of preservation and taphonomic agents were recorded when possible. All observations were documented using the procedures and forms presented in Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994). The information was then entered into the Standard Osteological Database (SOD), a free-standing relational database application that was developed using Microsoft FoxPro software and the Buikstra and Ubelaker book as a guide. Because the burials were disturbed and the skeletal remains fragmentary, the separation of all the skeletal material into distinct individuals was not possible. A minimum of four individuals was distinguished: one infant, one adult (exact age range not known), one probable male middle adult, and one probable male old adult. This determination was achieved through the separation of dentition and examination of mandibular fragments associated with the dentition. Observations of this material were recorded on single-individual inventory forms. In addition to dental remains, postcranial and cranial skeletal fragments were also observed. All of the nondental remains were recorded as commingled, since separation into distinct individuals was not possible. Like the dental remains, observation of the nondental remains also yielded an estimated minimum of four individuals. The skeletal remains represented three adults: two males and one female. The fourth individual was a subadult under the age of 12 years. Age determination for the four single-inventoried individuals was based on dental wear and eruption. Sex determination was assigned according to the robusticity of the mandibular torus. The sex of the commingled cranial fragments was determined according to the size of the mastoids. A total of three mastoids was examined: two mastoids were male and one was either female or adolescent. Postcranial remains were assigned sex on the basis of robusticity and size of the long bones. The majority of the long bones were observed and recorded as representing three gracile individuals. It is possible that the two males, as identified by the cranial fragments, were not very robust postcranially; this condition could be the result of age-related activity decline. 15

CHAPTER 5 GEOARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL GEOLOGY The study area is located on a slope at the southern end of a narrow tidge which plunges gently southward into the floodplain of Rowlett Creek. This ridge is a small spur of a much larger, steep-sided, flat-topped ridge that separates Rowlett Creek to the west from Muddy Creek and the East Fork of the Trinity River to the east. The crest of the small spur is approximately 16 m above the normal pool level of Lake Ray Hubbard which currently covers the Rowlett Creek floodplain to the south and west of the study area. The upland surface in the vicinity of the study area is underlain by Upper Cretaceous units of the Ozan formation. The Ozan formation is approximately 160 m thick and consists of calcareous claystones, siltstones, and sandstones which contain hematite, pyrite, and phosphate nodules. This formation contains minor amounts of limestone in its lower portions and becomes increasingly silty and sandy towards its top, where it grades into the Wolf City Sandstone which overlies it. The Ozan formation was probably deposited in muddy, open marine to near-shore marine environments in which the supply of coarser clastics (i.e., silt and sand) increased over time as either water depth decreased, or depositional energy levels increased, or both. The Ozan dips very gently to the east-southeast into the East Texas Basin (BEG 1988). The Cretaceous deposits observed in the study area ranged from dense, pale brown, well-bedded sandstones with fossil molds, black-brown partings, and claystone clasts to deeply weathered, limey claystone with conchoidal fractures and considerable black iron and manganese staining (Figure 4). The Upper Cretaceous Ozan formation is unconformably overlain in the study area by Quaternary clays, silts, sands, and gravels. As can be seen from Figure 4, the unconformable surface between the Cretaceous and Quaternary units is quite rugged and seems to exhibit considerable topography. Part of this topography appears to be due to fluvial erosion at the margin of the uplands during the Pleistocene or earlier in the Quaternary (see area near Construction Pad 13); some appears to be due to differential weathering and soil formation within the exposed Cretaceous units; and it is probable that some is due to gullying and other erosional processes along the margin of the Cretaceous bedrock supported upland since the Tertiary. The Quaternary deposits in this area seem to fall into two distinct groups: those generated by fluvial activities along the margin of the uplands and those produced by in situ weathering, erosion, and pedogenesis of the underlying Cretaceous bedrock. The latter type of deposit may have covered much of the study area prior to the extensive terracing, road grading, and other activities associated with the preparation of this area for construction, but the original extent of these sediments is currently impossible to determine. It appears that these deposits were not extremely thick, ranging from approximately 1 m in Backhoe Trench 4 to slightly over 2 m in Backhoe Trench 5, although, as noted previously, the recent earth moving could have altered 17

A soil horizon. Lastly, the thickness of the A soil horizon (25 to 50 cm) would tend to argue for a greater age since accumulating a relatively thick, organically enriched soil on a steep slope which was probably subjected to periodic sheetwash and other erosional activities would require some time. In short, these deposits could date to a wide time period as new material continues to be added to the base by the continued breakdown of the underlying bedrock while the surface gains new material from organic activities and may either gain new alluvium as sediment moving downslope is trapped and retained or loses older material as erosional processes move it further downslope. It is felt that these deposits are probably of Holocene age but that they probably span that entire period with some being of very recent origin while other portions may date to the early Holocene or terminal Pleistocene. As noted above, the Quaternary fluvial terrace deposits in Profile 2 are thought to be Pleistocene or older in age, but since the contact between these two units was not exposed or had been removed by earlier erosion or construction activities, the exact relationship of these two units is unknown. Based on what is presently known about the study area, its geologic history can best be summarized as follows. (1) The claystones, siltstones, and sandstones of the Upper Cretaceous Ozan formation were deposited in open marine to near-shore marine environments. (2) Other Cretaceous and possibly Tertiary units were deposited and were removed by later erosion as the area was gently tilted structurally to dip gently east into the East Texas Basin. (3) Erosional sculpting continued and produced a flat-topped ridge overlooking the floodplain of Rowlett Creek to the west; soil probably began to form on this ridge as the exposed bedrock began to weather and erode. (4) As climatic and other variations in the Quaternary caused the floodplain of Rowlett Creek to widen and aggrade or deepen and erode, the margins of the upland ridge would have been periodically eroded and sediment removed from it onto the adjacent floodplain; one of these periods of aggradation and valley widening produced an inset fluvial terrace composed of series of coarse-grained fluvial deposits which appear to be typical of mid-channel bars found in braided streams. (5 Continued soil formation coupled with downslope erosion produced a steep-sided, bedrock-supported upland spur covered with a relatively thin (from less than 1 to just over 2 m) of Holocene-age soil; this surface has been significantly altered by recent construction activities. This proposed geologic history has important archeological implications. The study area is principally comprised of the steep flank of an ancient upland surface which is mantled with a relatively thin cover of late Quaternary-age soils. This slope probably undergoes, and has undergone, periodic erosional episodes. This would mean that the chance for finding naturally buried, stratified cultural materials on this slope is relatively slim. That is, although the soil deposits are likely to be of Holocene age, their topographic position would tend to dictate that any cultural materials located there would at best be found in surface sites subject to periodic erosion and quite possibly might be mixed with materials from other time periods by erosional activities even if they were buried. Although this ridge spur might have made an attractive habitation site at various times in the past, particularly if Rowlett Creek was closer than it currently is to this side of its valley, it does not appear to have been more attractive than portions of the upland edge in this area. All of this indicates that any sites located here are likely to have been small and not deeply buried. Given the recent construction activities and use of heavy equipment in this area, it is very likely that the location and stratigraphic integrity of any surface or near surface sites in this area would have been virtually destroyed, if it ever existed. However, given the very small amount of cultural material located during intense examination of the study area, it seems unlikely that this area was ever more than lightly used or inhabited. 21

CHAPTER 6 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS This final chapter presents the results of the investigations carried out in connection with the evaluation of the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369). Following the completion of the field evaluation of the site area, during which it was confirmed that no further archeological materials remained intact at the site, osteological analysis was undertaken of the human remains recovered from the site, the shell artifacts collected with the human remains were analyzed, and a sample of the remains was radiocarbon dated. The results of these studies are presented below, followed by a comparative discussion and a summary of what is now known about the Harbor Pointe site. Osteological Analysis The condition of the human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369), as a result of both the original discovery and the Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), surface collection of the site, can be described as moderate to poor. The majority of the material is incomplete, with sections of long bone shafts and cranial fragments present. The outer surface of the bone (the cortex) was intact, which allowed for observation of any bone remodeling caused by pathological processes. In addition, the tooth enamel was well preserved for documentation of dental pathology. Other taphonomic changes included discoloration of the bone exterior caused by ultraviolet (UV) exposure. Bleaching of some of the fragments resulting from direct sunlight is undoubtedly due to the remains having been disturbed and exposed. At least four individuals are represented in the remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site. Most nonmetric genetic observations were not possible because of the condition of the skeletal material, and no pattern was observed in the traits that were recorded. Therefore, conclusions regarding the hereditary relationship between the individuals or with a greater group could not be made. The first individual recorded in the single inventory was an infant, which was represented by six primary teeth and two permanent teeth, and possibly by a right unfused hand proximal phalanx; 33 cranial pieces; and a left humerus midshaft fragment. No dental or skeletal pathology was observed in this individual’s remains. The second individual was a young adult between the ages of 25 and 30, whose remains consisted of mandibular fragments, all of the right mandibular dentition, portions of the left mandibular and maxillary teeth, and possibly a barrel-shaped maxillary canine. Two teeth, the canine and second incisor, exhibited 23

Shell artifacts have been recovered from only a limited number of burials along the East Fork in North Central Texas. Lynott (1975: Table 27) notes four burials reported from the Upper Rockwall site with shell artifacts, including 208 conch shell beads reported with one cremation burial (Harris 1948d), 13 conch shell beads reported with a bundle burial (Harris et al. 1957), 181 small shell beads and a Sanders Engraved (?) vessel reported with a flexed burial (Ross 1966), and 328 small shell beads and two conch shell beads reported with a semiflexed burial (Ross 1966). Prikryl (1990:90) notes an apparent Late Prehistoric I burial with conch shell beads excavated either from site 41DL20 or site 41DL34 on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River in northwestern Dallas County. Nothing resembling the marine shell gorget recovered from the Harbor Pointe site has ever been reported from the East Fork. Further afield, at the Dillard site (4100174), north of Gainesville on the Red River, 13 individuals were recovered in close proximity to each other (five were interred in the same burial pit). Burial furniture recovered with three of the individual graves and the mass grave included 991 marine shell beads and one engraved marine shell effigy gorget in the shape of a human hand (Martin 1994:167, Table 8). These include 473 small disk beads, 473 Olivella shell beads, 28 large beads possibly made from the columella of a Busycon shell, and 17 small beads also possibly made from a Busycon columella. These latter bear the greatest resemblance to the beads from the Harbor Pointe site. Two charcoal samples submitted for radiocarbon analysis from the Dillard site (one from between the stratigraphically superimposed Burials 1 and 2) yielded corrected dates of 680 + 110 B.P. and 622 + 58 B.P., calibrated to cal A.D. 1260 (1290) 1407 and cal A.D. 1293 (1330, 1350, 1360, 1370, 1390) 1408, respectively (Martin 1994: Table 12). These results indicate that the Dillard site dates 200 to 300 years later than the Harbor Pointe site, despite the similarity in burial furniture. Finally, the data from the Harbor Pointe site are important for the light they shed on the introduction of maize agriculture into this area. Corn agriculture is known to have been present at prehistoric sites along the East Fork, based on the recovery of corn from the Hogge Bridge, Butler Hole, and Campbell’s Hole sites earlier during this century (Stephenson 1952:305), but dating of these remains has always been uncertain (Prikryl 1990:77). Corn has been recovered from the Cobb-Pool site in southwestern Dallas County and is dated to about A.D. 1250 (Peter and McGregor 1988:165). Fritz (1993:241) has noted that, apart from Cobb-Pool, Late Prehistoric sites in North Central Texas seem to show a generalized adaptation in which the most important plant foods were nuts, wild seeds, fruits, and the problematic, possible tuber that might be a species of Psoralea. Although maize was available in North Central Texas by the early second millennium A.D., it was rarely deposited in quantities enabling archeologists to register its presence. The carbon isotope data from the Harbor Pointe site indicate that possibly as late as A.D. 1150 or even 1200, maize in any quantity at all was still absent from the diet of at least some of the Late Prehistoric occupants of North Central Texas. Sociocultural Affiliation Assignment of sociocultural (i.e., “tribal”) affiliation to the burial remains from the Harbor Pointe site is, unfortunately, largely a matter of informed guesswork and educated opinion. Who the prehistoric occupants of the Dallas area were is not clear, but what is clear is that the historic period in North Central Texas was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and amalgamation (Newcomb 1993). Available data suggest that many, if not all, of the aboriginal occupants of the eastern margin of the Great Plains were Caddoan language speakers, from the Arikara in the north to the Wichita and Kichai in the south. In this light, it is worth noting that it has also been suggested that the Socoatino, encountered by the survivors of the de Soto expedition in the sixteenth century, were Caddoan speakers and were the same group as the Canohatino, identified by the French in the latter part of the seventeenth century, apparently located at that time “on the Blackland Prairies between the Guadalupe and Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin, and Waco” (Newcomb 1993:24). If the prehistoric occupants of the eastern margin of the plains in Texas were indeed Caddoan speakers, it would explain how they were absorbed very early by other Caddoan- speaking groups (such as the Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni, Taovaya, Iscani, and Wichita proper) which arrived in North Central Texas in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Most of these groups, 29

includes slight impressions on the inner an outer surface of the mandible from tiny roots. Only 3 maxillary teeth still in alveolar bone- the rest are loose. The roots of the right max. Ml and M2 are bleached white (these roots are also broken off). Maxillary hypoplasias were difficult to observe due to the presence of calculus. Dental measurements were not taken because wear exceded half the crown in the molars. Canines represent the only dentition that could be measured. Most dental morphology was unobservable due to dental wear. 93/12/96 Page

COMMENTS: The inventory also includes- 3 misc. teeth (complete roots only) which are heavily worn and 5 lower root fragments (some of which probably belong with individuals 1-4). A peg shaped canine (right mandibular) was present with the crown and root curved on the interior of the mouth. Maxillary teeth were also present- see the dental inventory (they look as if they belong to an old adult- these teeth may belong to individual 4). An additional unsidable temporal fragment was present and an unsidable petrous portion, 2 humeri proximal epiphyses, 2 humeri midshafts, and one radius proximal epiphysis- all unsided. )3/12/96 Page 14

DATE REPORTED: July 17, 1995 Sample Data Measured C13/C12 Conventional C14 Age Ratio C14 Age (*) Bet a-83331 910 +/- 60 BP -21.6 o/foo 970 +/- 60 BP SAMPLE #: 41 DL 369/1 ANALYSIS: AMS (Lawrence Livermore) MATERIAL/PRETREATMENT: (bone collagen): collagen extraction with alkali NOTE: It is important to read the calendar calibration information and to use the calendar calibrated results (reported separately) when interpreting these results es — Dates are reported as RCYBP (radiocarbon years before present, “present” = 1950A.D.). By International convention, the modern reference standard was 95% of the C14 content of the National Bureau of Standards’ Oxalic Acid & calculated using the Libby C14 half life (5568 years). Quoted errors represent 1 standard deviation statistics (68% probability) & are based on combined measurements of the sample, background, and modern reference standards. in AD/BC terms. Measured C13/C12 ratios were calculated relative to the PDB-1 international standard-and the RCYBP ages were normalized to -25 per mil. If the ratio and age are accompanied by an (*), then the C13/C12 value was estimated, based on values typical of the material type. The quoted results are NOT calibrated to calendar years. Calibration to calendar years should be calculated using the Conventional C14 age.
