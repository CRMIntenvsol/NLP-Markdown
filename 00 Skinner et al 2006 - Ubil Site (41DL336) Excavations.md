THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM ABSTRACT The Ubil site (41DL336) was discovered by Kent Ubil during the course of Boy Scout activities at Camp Wisdom in Dallas County. He noted the outline of a flower pot-shaped pit filled with a black organic-stained matrix exposed in the bank of Artesian Creek. The creek originates on the upland divide of the White Rock Escarpment and flows west in a narrow valley in the limestone bedrock before crossing the much flatter Mountain Creek valley. The Dallas Archeological Society undertook to excavate the pit in the summer of 1992 with the assistance of the Tarrant County Archeological Society and the support of the Circle 10 Council of the Boy Scouts of America. A block of test units was placed above the pit and excavation revealed the top of the pit at 90 cm below the surface. Charcoal from the midden above the pit was dated 950+60 BP (Beta 200411). The pit fill was then excavated and a charcoal date from near the base of the pit was 980+110 BP (Beta 200412). These dates coincide with date ranges of Alba arrow points and Nocona Plain pottery that were recovered. The site is similar to the nearby Baggett Branch and Hollings Branch sites and to other small Late Prehistoric sites recorded upstream on Hollings Branch. It was also contemporaneous with the Cobb-Pool site. Based on the artifact assemblage, it is concluded that Ubil was occupied in the fall during the Early Late Prehistoric period and that mammals were hunted and thoroughly processed and nuts were harvested for subsequent consumption. The Ubil, Baggett Branch, and Hollings Branch sites are referred to as Escarpment Valley sites. ii

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 1 INTRODUCTION The prehistoric archaeology of Artesian Creek in southwest Dallas County has been recorded and monitored by a variety of avocational archaeologists since at least as early as 1928 when the late R. King Harris was directed to the location of a prehistoric site that is now designated 41DL61 at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). When first recorded, the site was numbered 27A-4-11 and was described as a prehistoric village located within the Camp Wisdom Boy Scout camp (Figure 1). Harris noted that several artifacts in his collection were from the site and that evidence of food consisted of mussel shells. Over the years, Harris no doubt continued to monitor the site as he was involved in Boy Scout activities at Camp Wisdom. Some time in the late 1980s/early 1990s, Kent Ubil of Garland rediscovered the site during one of his activities as a Boy Scout leader at Camp Wisdom. In fact, Ubil noted two other site areas and referred to them as sites 41DL61 B and C. Ubil recognized that the site recorded by Harris was unusual due to the large number of fresh-water mussels in the site midden deposits but the potential for the sites being present was not unusual due to the perennial flow of Artesian Creek and the presence of sites on nearby Baggett Branch also having mussel shells, even though Baggett Branch is mapped as an intermittent tributary of Mountain Creek. As a member of the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS), Ubil reported the discovery of a flower pot- shaped pit in the bank of Artesian Creek at his site 41DL61C. He found two pieces of a human femur in the creek bed and on the creek bank at the level of the pit and believed that they had come out of the pit. The later site area was subsequently renumbered 41DL336 at TARL and is referred to herein as the Ubil site. With the help and approval of the Circle 10 Council of the Boy Scouts of America and the involvement of the DAS and members of the Tarrant County Archeological Society, it was decided to excavate the remainder of the pit which was in danger of being washed away and to do limited testing at the site area. The senior author agreed to direct the investigation, particularly since at the same time he was trying to convince the National Office of the Boy Scouts of America that they should develop an archaeology merit badge. The badge was ultimately developed and adopted (BSA1995; Skinner 1995; Skinner et al. 1998). Fieldwork was conducted at the Ubil site in the hot summer of 1992 and this report has been delayed as the result of a variety of scheduling conflicts.

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 3 NATURAL ENVIRONMENT The Mountain Creek Watershed presents a unique setting in north central Texas where the exposed western edge of the White Rock Formation forms the steep rocky scarp east of the creek channel with the rolling Grand Prairie and Eastern Cross Timbers to the west. The White Rock Escarpment, as it is known, has been deeply incised by the upper end of Mountain Creek and by Artesian Creek and other intermittent creeks on the east side of the valley. Of these, Mountain Creek, Baggett Branch, John Penn Branch, and Artesian Creek are apparently spring-fed and would have provided a reliable year-round water source that supported habitats where freshwater mussels including Potamilus, Tritogonio, Plectomerus, and others grew prehistorically along with fish, turtles, and other aquatic animals. Artesian Creek is 5.85 km long and cuts into the White Rock Escarpment a distance of 2.75 km. The valley has a relatively narrow floodplain that is underlain by limestone bedrock which also created the steep walled valley. Quaternary terraces and alluvium are not mapped upstream on Artesian Creek from the toe of the Escarpment. The closest knappable lithic resources are mapped in the upland to the south a distance of more than twenty kilometers (McGregor 1995:Figure 4). Soils in the narrow valley are mapped as Austin-Lewisville complex with 5 to 8 percent eroded slopes (Coffee, Hill, and Ressell 1980:Sheet 51, pp. 12-13). According to the Soil Conservation Service, erosion has removed the original surface layer on about 40 percent of the acreage of these soils, so it is reasonable to expect that this is the case at the Ubil site. This conclusion is further strengthened by the observation that the entire valley width is occasionally inundated after heavy rainfall. Flooding would also have restricted occupation to a seasonal basis and might also have deposited sand and silt on top of occupation surfaces which were not scoured clean by flooding. Historically, the Escarpment was covered with cedars, junipers actually, while the top of the Escarpment to the east was Blackland Prairie and the rolling prairie to the west was backed by the Eastern Cross Timbers. Mountain Creek was a major floodplain forest (Martin 1988). So within a distance of five km of the Ubil site, a wide variety of plants and aquatic resources were present and they could have provided an equally wide variety of terrestrial, avian, and aquatic plant and animal food sources.

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 4 ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE MOUNTAIN CREEK WATERSHED Cultural historical investigations in the Mountain Creek Basin upstream from the junction of the West Fork of the Trinity river began more than fifty years ago with the survey and recording of numerous prehistoric archaeological sites by members of the Dallas Archeological Society (Harris 1936). More recent work was done in conjunction with construction of the Joe Pool Lake which was originally termed Lakeview Lake. The work was done under the direction of the Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University, except for some Historic Architectural Buildings Survey (HABS) work at the Penn site that was done by Environment Consultants (1984) and completed by AR Consultants. This work is briefly summarized below, but the reader is referred to the original reports for additional information. The initial lake site survey was done in 1977-78 and resulted in the locating and recording of 17 prehistoric archaeological sites and 25 historic archaeological/ standing structure sites (Skinner and Connors 1979). Many of these sites had previously been recorded by DAS members who surveyed the Mountain Creek area in the 1940s. Based on the survey findings, it was hypothesized that prehistoric settlement in the area was of a seasonal nature and was limited by water availability. Moreover, based on the apparent abundance of chert lithics, rather than quartzite lithics more commonly found at sites along the main stem of the Trinity River, it was concluded that the residents were from the Brazos River Basin rather than from the closer Trinity River area. In 1979 and 1980, SMU and a team from North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) tested for buried sites at Joe Pool Lake. They also tested the already recorded sites in order to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, as well as to assess the impact that construction would have on the various sites, and to offer a series of resource management recommendations (Raab 1982:1). Prehistoric testing focused on the Cobb-Pool site which appeared to contain a possible pithouse and associated features and refuse deposits dating to the period A.D. 800-1200. Work at the site suggested that Cobb-Pool was part of a settlement pattern based on exploitation of a range of resources provided by greater effective moisture than in the project area today. This is in marked contrast to the model offered by the survey team (Raab and Woosley 1982). Mitigation activities at the Joe Pool Lake were carried out by SMU between 1984-1986 and are reported in two monographs (Peter and McGregor editors 1988; Jurney, Lebo and Green 1988). Excavation was done at six prehistoric sites including the Late Prehistoric period Cobb-Pool and Baggett Branch sites, and three sites with primarily Late Archaic occupations. Cobb-Pool was shown to represent a horticultural community occupied in the first half of the 13th century. Baggett Branch had a late occupation characterized by the presence of bison, Plains-style artifacts, and shell-tempered pottery similar to the type

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 5 Nocona Plain. The authors concluded that the Late Archaic and Early Late Prehistoric occupation of the area was on a seasonal basis, primarily during the summer (Peter and McGregor 1988b:363-364). The Cobb-Pool site is the only evidence of Middle Late Prehistoric occupation and may indicate year-round occupation. The Late Late Prehistoric period occupation was probably seasonal. During the 1980s, SMU personnel and the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) conducted studies in the area. Survey of a sanitary sewer route along Baggett Branch was done for the Lake Ridge Development Company (Peter and McGregor 1987). One previously recorded prehistoric site (41DL135) was relocated and a separate prehistoric artifact locality was noted. Both deposits were shallow and small. It was recommended that the route avoid site 41DL135 as it was considered to be an example of a short-term foraging camp. The DAS and SMU personnel had previously tested two other sites (41DL137 and 41EL33) located along the upland drainages of the White Rock Escarpment (Peter and McGregor 1988b:367; Hartig 1988). The Lester Lorch site (41DL137) is situated adjacent to a known spring where an unnamed tributary issues forth from the White Rock Escarpment. Artifacts from the site included Middle and Late Archaic dart points, snub-nosed end scrapers, bone tools and beads, at least one incised sherd, drilled mussel shells, and arrow points. Many of the chipped stone tools, particularly the dart points and snub-nosed end scrapers, are made on fine grain quartzite which characterizes the Late Archaic assemblages from Joe Pool Lake and the Trinity River. The Hollings Branch site (41EL33) is situated approximately five meters above the creek channel on a level bench and covers an area estimated to be 85 m by 25-30 m. The deposit is confined to the upper 20-30 cm below the present ground surface. The site is different from Lester Lorch in that only a few arrow points were recovered along with a few pieces of mussel shell, fire-cracked rock, and lithic debris. Hundreds of pieces of animal bone are the most common artifact class. Peter (1998) suspected that these sites may have been occupied during the summer when the tree cover would have provided protection from the direct sun. More recently, AR Consultants conducted several surveys in the Mountain Creek basin. The Pleasant Valley Golf Course survey (Skinner, Lindsay, and Young 1992) located no prehistoric sites. The second investigation was the survey of 560 acres included at the site of the Veterans Administration National Cemetery of North Texas located east of Mountain Creek Lake at the base of the White Rock Escarpment (Skinner, Whorton, and Dillon 1995). No prehistoric sites were located. Survey of the Grand Prairie Business Park at the junction of Mountain Creek and the West Fork of the Trinity did not locate any sites on the surface or in the levee along the West Fork (Skinner, Kent, and Trask 1998). Survey of the Cedar Mountain Preserve for the City of Cedar Hill located no prehistoric sites in the valley or on the slopes and top of the Escarpment (Kent and Skinner 1998). Survey of the proposed Sunset Ranch development (Skinner 1998) located four prehistoric site deposits (41EL233-235) on the benches above Hollings Creek downstream from the Hollings Branch site. Broken large mammal bones were the most common artifacts found in the midden deposits which ranged from 15 to 30 m in diameter. Additional artifacts included chert lithic debris and fire-cracked rock. None of these sites were dated but the presence of charcoal and animal bone should allow for

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 6 dating and environmental reconstruction. Recently, a buried ash lens was discovered in the bank of Baggett Branch a meter below the present ground surface and several hundred meters downstream from the Baggett Branch site. No artifacts were recovered but an ash/charcoal sample and a fractured large mammal long bone were submitted for radiocarbon dating (Skinner 2007). Culture History The following prehistoric culture history is derived largely from the Joe Pool Lake monograph. Protohistoric A.D. 1600-A.D. 1800 [ Historic Native American] Late A.D. 1400-A.D. 1600 Middle A.D. 1000-A.D. 1400 Early A.D. 700-A.D. 1000 Late Prehistoric A.D. 700-A.D. 1600 Archaic 6,000 B.C.-A.D. 700 Paleo-Indian ca. 11,000 B.C.-6,000 B.C. Using the above temporal framework, the following paragraphs present a_ brief description of the culture history of the area. The Paleo-Indian period is distinguished by projectile point styles attributed to this period. Many of the points are made of cherts that are not native to North-Central Texas. The Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site in Denton County are the only excavated Paleo-Indian sites in the region (Crook and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001), and both are on the Elm Fork to the north. Surface artifacts generally come from deposits on stream terraces above the level of the active floodplain. This is a period when large mammals became extinct, and their extinction is attributed in part to a general environmental drying. During the Early Archaic, the general drying continued, and sites are found on stream terraces. There is a hint of population increase, and Lynott (1981:103) suggests that there was increased emphasis on the use of bottomland food resources. Middle Archaic sites are predominantly found on the first terrace above stream floodplains. As earlier, sites tend to be along the Elm Fork rather than along the smaller tributaries. The population density continued to be low. Late Archaic sites increase in number over the previous period, and sites are located both along the Elm Fork and its tributaries. There appears to be a strong shift in site location to tributary streams, and a pronounced population explosion. Within the Elm Fork basin, local Ogallala quartzite was being used prominently at this time, and this observation is taken by some authors (Skinner 1981; Prewitt 1983) as evidence of increased territorial constriction. On Mountain Creek, it appears that the earliest occupation was during the Late Archaic, and that occupation was only on a seasonal, not year-round basis. Moreover, unlike the Elm Fork and most of Dallas County, lithics are predominantly cherts which may have been secured to the southwest near Alvarado (McGregor 1995).

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 7 During the Late Prehistoric period, the bow and arrow and pottery appear in artifact assemblages (Shafer 1977). Houses and evidence of agriculture first appear during this period, as shown at the Cobb-Pool site. Early Late Prehistoric site locations mirror those of the Late Archaic, and chert continued as the common material for chipped stone projectiles and tools within the Mountain Creek basin. The West Fork Paleosol is tentatively dated to this period, although it has been dated earlier that A.D. 800 in some places (Ferring 1990). Drying continued into the subsequent period. Buffalo bones are common in Late Late Prehistoric sites (Dillehay 1974; Lynott 1979; Peter and McGregor 1988:241), along with tools normally expected to occur at sites on the High Plains. Protohistoric Native American occupation in the Dallas County is reported by numerous regional history authors. Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been found in the area (Peter, Cliff, and Green 1996:2). This pattern of finding virtually no physical evidence of historic Native American in the form of artifacts [beads, gun-flints, cooking utensils, etc.] is seen throughout much of North-Central Texas (Skinner 1988), and has been related to the abandonment of the region in the 1500/1600s caused by a major regional drought RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY The initial purpose of this excavation was to recover the contents of a flower pot-shaped pit that was eroding out of the creek bank. The pit is part of a prehistoric campsite that appeared to cover an area no more than 50 meters east-west by 20 meters north-south. The dark brown, charcoal-stained site midden contains animal bones, freshwater mussel shells, discarded lithic debris, chipped stone tools, and burned rocks used in fires for heating water and for cooking. On first inspection, the midden deposit appeared to be 20- 30 cm thick. The pit had been excavated from the base of the midden into the underlying clay. The base of the pit is approximately two meters below the present ground surface. It was believed that the pit contained or had contained a prehistoric human burial since human long bones had been collected from the adjacent creek bank. The surface of the site was cleared of brush and weeds using hand tools including a weedeater. The site area was then mapped and a 50 cm contour map was prepared and a grid system established. Excavation of 1x1 meter pits was focused on the pit exposed in the creek wall and 50 cm square units were used to define the limits of the pit walls and floor after the top of the pit was defined at 90 cm below the surface in Test Units 1-4. One meter square units were used elsewhere to explore the site limits. Excavation was done in 10 cm levels and fill was screened through 4” hardware cloth screens. A sample of fill was also washed through window screen in order to recover plant and animal remains as well as smaller artifacts. Subsequently, the artifacts were washed and prepared for cataloguing.

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 8 RESULTS Excavation began by the establishment of four units, test units 1-4, hereafter TU, centered near the generally level edge of the bank adjacent to the exposed pit profile (Figure 2). Due to the availability of additional field crew members, TUs 5-8 were established to determine the extent of the buried site deposit to the east, west, and south. After TUs 1-4 had been excavated to a depth of 90 cm, they were discontinued and TUs 9-11 were established to collect samples from inside the pit which the upper units had shown was smaller than the four units would have allowed (Figure 3). In addition, it was realized that complete pit excavation was not possible due to the diminishing crew size, the excessive heat, and the time available to explore the pit. In the following discussion, TUs 1-4 and TUs 9-11 are described collectively. The remaining four test units are described individually. Ubil Site 41DL336 “~o \ Artesian Creek." ~ 669 Figure 2. Plan map of the Ubil site showing numbered test unit locations. The matrix in TUs 1-4 remained essentially the same dark brown (10YR3/3) clay loam from the surface to the base of the units at 90 cm. Artifacts were few in the upper 30 cm but increased with depth until reaching the subsoil at about 70+ cm when the top of the pit outline became visible in the unit floors. Then only the pit fill was removed and at this point the upper units were abandoned and TUs 9-11 were started. The excavators were struck by the dry and compact nature of the upper blocky calcareous clay loam in the four units until after we had a summer shower and water penetrated the matrix and made it decidedly wet. The dry compact soil extended to a depth of 40 cm in TUs 1-4. Artifacts

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 9 were found in both the dark brown to very dark brown (10YR3/1) dry and moist soils but numbers appeared to decrease with depth below 70 cm. Snails shells were abundant throughout the matrix and represented the most common artifact type. Sand increased in the matrix from 50 cm downward. Subsoil was a yellowish brown color (LOYR5/6). A charcoal sample (Beta 200411) from level 4 (hereafter L4) in TU 4 dated 950+60 BP and gave a calibrated date of AD 1000 to 1250. Figure 3. TUs 1-4 coincide with Duane Peter in the center of the picture. The creek bank is being cleared by Brenda Whorton. View is to the west. TUs 9-11 were 50 cm square and also were excavated in 10 cm levels. The interior silty clay matrix was very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) and was compact and blocky. The clay subsoil matrix outside the pit was a brown (10YR4/3) color. The pit is essentially flower pot-shape in profile (Figure 4). The top of the pit was recognized at the base of TUs 1-4 and TUs 9-11 were centered over and outside the rim at the top of the pit in order to sample the inside the pit. All of TU 9 is contained within the pit while only the western half of TU 10 and the southern third of TU 11 are within the pit (Figure 5). The top of the pit was just less than 130 cm wide at the top and the sides sloped smoothly to the base at a depth of 80 cm below the rim. The width of the pit at the base was 70 cm. The pit floor extended into the bank a distance of 70 cm. A charcoal sample collected from the 70-80 cm level in TU 9 inside the pit and close to the floor dated 980+110 BP (Beta 200412) and it has a calibrated date of AD 880 to 1280. If the pit was circular in plan, it appears that slightly less than fifty percent had been eroded away. Based on the shape, it seems likely that this was a storage pit or a pit that might have been leather-lined for cooking with hot rocks (Lorrain 1973).

— THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 10 Figure 4. Pit exposed in the creek bank. View is to the north. However, if it served as a pit for a flexed burial as suggested by Ubil, the pit might have been oval in plan shape and thus only a third or a quarter of the pit remained. No human bones were found in the pit fill or on the pit floor although a single well-worn human incisor, a finger bone, and a hand bone were recovered from the overlying units and could have been from a burial that had eroded away.

The point from TU 4 L3 is an Alba point with the tip broken off. The point was made on a slightly arched flake. Alba points are widespread through eastern Texas and range in age from approximately A.D. 800-1200 (Turner and Hester 1999:200). The second point is an untyped, corner-notched point that was also made on a flake. It is missing half the body including the tip, part of one edge and more than half the base. Both points were made of brown chert. Two bifaces were recovered. A broken biface tip was recovered from TU 2 L7. It is missing the base and could be from a dart point or a bifacial knife. It is a gray chert. The other biface is from TU 4 L7 (Figure 6c). It is made of brown chert. Both faces and all edges have been worked but it was never fully thinned. It weighs 9.7 gm. A single core (Figure 6d) was recovered from TU 2 L4. The core was bifacially worked in order to remove the cortex but it snapped in half. The edge of the snap was worked as an unfaceted platform in the removal of several small flakes from one face. However thinning was apparently ineffective and the core was discarded.

A total of fifty three pieces of lithic debris was collected during excavation. The chert flakes were primarily primary and secondary cortex pieces that were the result of removing cortex from cobbles. Only six flakes with no cortex were recovered. No retouched pieces, scrapers, or notches were recovered. A red sandstone grinding slab fragment was recovered from TU 4 L5. The fragment measures 96x81x1.6 mm and it weighs 168.1 gm and is the edge of a unifacial basin grinding slab made on an unshaped slab. The grinding surface is 8.1 mm thick on the innermost edge and the metate may have broken due to the thinness of the grinding surface when it was re-roughened. A complete unifacial grinding slab made on an unshaped sandstone tablet was recovered from the creek bed. The slab weighs 50.72 kg and measures 37x25x6 cm. Six undecorated Nocona Plain sherds (Krieger 1946:109-111; Suhm and Jelks 1962:115- 116) were recovered from the Ubil site. All are shell tempered and surface colors range from red to black. Two are rims, the others are body sherds. Body thickness ranges from 6-7 mm. Two pieces of stick impressed daub were collected from level 6 in TU 4. The pieces weigh 3.6 gm and 1.8 gm. In contrast to the small numbers of chipped and ground stone artifacts as well as the pottery, a total of 2,965 pieces (approximately 58.056 kg) of fire-cracked rock were collected from TUs 1-4 and 9-11 (Table 2). Of this total, 2,315 ranged from 0 to 40 mm in length, 572 ranged from 41 to 80 mm and 78 ranged from 81 to 160 mm. The rock is primarily limestone with a few pieces of sandstone, conglomerate, calcite, and goethite. More than half the rock came from L4 and 5 but rock was prominent in the four lower levels in TUs 1-4. Fire-cracked rock was present but not prominent in the pit fill.

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 15 The faunal remains from the Ubil site (Appendix 1) reflect the use of a variety of animals common to the immediate area today. The single fish and snake bones are not considered food sources. It appears that small to moderate-sized sliders and terrestrial turtles were frequently eaten. White-tailed deer were the most common bones found and almost a third of these were phalanges, many of which had been fractured in order to extract marrow. Many of the other deer bones had been broken for marrow extraction, and it is logical to expect that this was done in the fall when marrow was stored in the bones for the winter. Dog, rabbit, and turkey bones were also recovered. As a whole, the assemblage can be interpreted as representing a fall occupation. One thousand forty six pieces (approximately 1,318.4 gm) of unidentifiable bone were recovered from TUs 1-4 and 9-11. Two hundred sixteen (20.65%) were burned and ranged in color from slightly black to white which indicates extreme heating. A large number of bone fragments were recovered from Levels 4 and 5 The burned tip of a bone awl was recovered from TU 9 L16. Based upon the wear on the end, it was either used or re-sharpened extensively. Its dimensions are 14.5+x6x3 mm and it weighs 0.5 gm. One hundred thirteen mussel valves were recovered from TUs 1-4 and 9-11 representing 85 individuals and 9 species (Appendix 2). Species ranking based upon the percentage of occurrence is Potamilus ohioensis (30.58%), Lampsilis hydiana (27.05), Amblema plicata (14.12%), Plectomerus dombeyanus (12.94%), Lampsilis teres (7.06%), Potamilus purpuratus (4.71%) and Quadrula houstonensis, Quadrula mortoni and Tritogonia verrucosa with 1.18% percent each. The majority of the shells were recovered from Level 5 which corresponds to the abundance of fire-cracked rock and bone. Most of the shell was recovered from TUs 3 and 4. The range of shell sizes indicates that optimal foraging was being done and the variety indicates that no species was targeted. Since very few burned mussels shells were recovered, the mussels must have been roasted. Ethnographic evidence and scientific experiments seem to suggest this was the favorite way of preparing mussels (Osburn 1977; Parmalee and Klippell 1974; Waselkov 1987). The mussels represent an assemblage from a shallow to moderately deep perennial stream with slow to moderate currents and a gravel and mud bottom. Based on shell size, it is concluded that the creek would have been slightly larger than it is today. A Potamilus purpuratus shell has been listed in Table 1 as a hoe (Figures 7). Usually Amblema plicata shells have been used as hoes, but P. purpuratus shells have the same, broad posterior end and could have been used to till loose garden dirt. The shell measures 10.31 cm long and 6.39 cm wide. It weighs 65.6 gm and is a right valve. The shell has a central hole which was created by force being exerted from the exterior. The hole is 13.1 mm wide and 22.7 mm long. The shell is 2.9 mm thick on the edge of the hole. The posterior edge is missing some shell but it is complete elsewhere so there is no clear evidence of edge wear. Ubil collected a second perforated Amblema plicata shell from the creek bed and it is larger than the excavated one. This second perforated shell (Figure 8) measures 11.4 by 8.24 cm, weighs 151.0 gm and is a left valve. The hole is parallel to the length of the shell and measures 42.6 by 26.9 mm and the shell is 5.4 mm thick at the

It appears that the hole originated on the inside of the shell and that one edge of the shell ultimately was broken so the hole length listed above is too long. The shell edge does not show any evidence of wear. The use of shells as hoes has been debated (Krieger 1946), but Holmes (1883) provides ethnographic evidence of their use and Harrington (1924:6) found a hafted shell hoe in his excavations in the Ozarks.

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 17 Two thousand two hundred forty-five snail shells representing seven snail species were recovered from TUs 1-4 and 9-11 (Appendix 2). Rabdotus dealbatus is the most common snail followed by Helicina orbiculata. The remaining species are Glyphylinia (Retinella) indentata, Linisa (Polygyra) texasiana, Mesodon thyroidus, and Strobilops texasiana. The aquatic snail Planorbella (Helisoma) trivolvis only has 3 shells. Snail shells were concentrated in Levels 4 and 5. The gastropod fauna indicates an oak-savannah floodplain environment contained within a limestone-based valley. The environment fluctuated between grassland and woodland because the ratio of M. thyroidus and R. dealbatus fluctuated in levels 1 and 2 and levels 5 and 6 in TU 4 and L10 through 17in TUs 9-11. Four additional test units (TU 5-8) were excavated within the site and three are shown on Figure 2. TU 5 was placed six meters east of TU 1 and was excavated to a maximum depth of 104 cm. The first zone was 26 cm thick and consisted of soil with small limestone inclusions. The second zone extended to 56 cm and consisted of bedded rock and sand. The bottom zone consisted of soil that contained small pieces of limestone and shale. No artifacts were collected from this unit although they are reported to have been present. TU 6 was placed on the creek edge southeast of TU 5. The unit was excavated to a depth of 150 cm. The upper zone was 28 cm thick and consisted of grayish brown (10YR5/2) calcified clayey loam. This graded into the second zone which was a brown (10YR5/3) homogeneous clayey loam. The third zone extended from 60 to 77 cm and was a clayey loam with rock and shell inclusions in a dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) matrix. Several rock accumulations that are possible hearths were exposed in the test unit wall, particularly at 95 cm below the present ground surface. The midden zone at 95 cm was 15 cm thick and was a dark grayish brown (10YR4/1.5) clayey loam with an abundance of rock, shell, calcium carbonate, and charcoal. Below this to a depth of 105 was a dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) clayey loam with occasional rock and shell inclusions. From this point to the base of the unit, the matrix remains the same except that it has fewer rocks and shells. Five white-tail deer bones and two turtle shell fragments were found between 1-100 cm and a single thoracic vertebra from a deer was found below 100 cm (Appendix 1). A few mussel shells and snail shells were found in the two levels (Appendix 2). TU 7 was excavated to a depth of 30 cm. The soil was a loose dark brown clayey loam with rock and shell in the upper 20 cm. Three bone fragments and a single white-tailed deer bone were found in the unit (Appendix 1). Mussel shell fragments and 29 snail shells were recovered (Appendix 2). Eighty-five pieces of fire-cracked limestone were found in TU 6 and 14 were found in TU 7. TU 8 was excavated to a depth of 40 cm below the present ground surface. A thin layer of decomposed organic material covered the ground surface. Snail shells were found throughout the dry clayey loam matrix and the number of snails decreased with depth; none were collected. Mussel shell fragments were the only artifacts found in TU 8.

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 18 CONCLUSIONS Excavation of a flower pot-shaped pit that had been exposed and partially eroded away by Artesian Creek has provided a glimpse of prehistoric occupation in one of several narrow valleys that extend into the White Rock Escarpment. Previous excavation of the Baggett Branch site and the Hollings Branch site (41EL33) and untested sites recorded upstream on Hollings Branch provide a setting perspective from which to understand the site. The Baggett Branch site represents the largest site area known in this Escarpment setting but that may be due to its location close to the “face” of the Escarpment whereas the other sites reported in this setting are further upstream and aerially more confined by the narrowing valley. They may also be small due to the activity groups that occupied them and the duration of occupation that may have been at least partially controlled by the water availability. Baggett and Hollings Branches probably flowed year round as does Artesian Creek. Each of these sites is contained in Recent Holocene sediments and it is likely that each of the sites has endured scouring caused by massive valley-wide floods that have flushed out an unknown amount of occupation evidence. Based on the radiocarbon dates and the artifact assemblages, dating is relatively secure in the Late Prehistoric period. Each of the sites appears to have been repeatedly but briefly occupied as shown by the ephemeral rock-lined features, the limited artifact assemblages, and the vertical stratigraphy observed at Baggett Branch. At present it is impossible to know when the other sites along Baggett Branch, Hollings Branch, and Artesian Creek were occupied but it is likely they were all roughly contemporaneous. It had been suspected that the reason for occupation along these drainages was for access to the top of the Escarpment but surveys in the upland at the upper end of Baggett Branch and John Penn Branch have failed to find evidence of occupation (Kent and Skinner 1998; Craver and Skinner 2005) although it should be noted that a probable Late Prehistoric end scraper was found at the Boulder Park Flood Control Dam site on a tributary near the upper end of Five Mile Creek (Skinner 1996:12, Figure 5). It is our interpretation that water from seep springs located near the headwaters of the deeply entrenched drainages that cut into the White Rock Escarpment was available year- round. Thus the Escarpment represented a unique environmental econiche that the Late Prehistoric descendents of the earlier Archaic hunters and gatherers had been aware of but had not exploited in such a way as to leave tell tale evidence in the form of a site. The springs provided a reliable perennial flowage that drained into Mountain Creek and may have reached the West Fork of the Trinity. Mussels and probably fish along with slider turtles occupied the shallow and deep holes of these creeks. Bur oak, hickory, and walnut trees grew in the creek floodplains and provided an abundance of seasonally available mast resources which attracted deer and smaller mammals. The availability of these resources attracted Late Prehistoric hunters and gatherers who established temporary camps where plants and animals were acquired and where the animal carcasses were thoroughly processed for meat, hides, marrow, and maybe where bone tools were manufactured.

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 22 APPENDIX 1. FAUNAL ANALYSIS SITE 41DL336 Robert Scott, MA A non-detailed analysis of faunal remains from prehistoric site 41DL336 indicates extensive utilization of animals common to the Texas cross timbers, river bottoms and prairie ecotones. All of the animals identified are currently extant in the same habitats in Texas and do not represent any exotic, seasonal, or climatic indicator. The bones are in very good condition and only two showed evidence of desiccation or exfoliation from prolonged exposure. Some evidence of gnawing by dogs is present in a few bones, but the scavenging appears to have been incidental to the occupation. Apparently the bones were buried after the seasonal abandonment of the site. A single unburned snake vertebra was present in the collection. It favorably resembles a vertebra from one of the extensive Colubridae family of snakes (rat snakes, water snakes, gopher snakes, etc.). All of those snakes are (potentially) present naturally and the single occurrence of an element should not be interpreted as indicative of a food source. One unidentifiable fish bone was noted in the collection. Based on the bones examined here, fish were not a normal component of the prehistoric diet at this site. Turtle shell was almost ubiquitous across the collection and not identified to species level. Size is a poor indicator of species but it would be safe to subjectively infer the thin and small fragments examined indicate terrestrial turtles (eastern and ornate box) and common sliders (red-eared) — among others in the family Emydidae. None of the plastron or carapace fragments were particularly large or thick, indicating that sliders, at least, might have been selected for a small to moderate size. No burned shell was noted in the collection and none of the shell had indications of cutting, crushing, or hacking. Distribution of the elements throughout the collection certainly point to their frequent use as a food source. A single unidentified long bone of a mature turtle was noted in the collection. White-tail deer was the most commonly identified animal in the collection. Of the bones examined (N=223), 77 were white-tail (about 35%), one-third of the collection. Minimum numbers of individuals (MNI), a count of the least numbers of animals potentially represented by at least two animals, and long bone fragments identified at 41DL336 also had an MNI of 2 white-tails. A surprising number of fractured phalanges were represented in the collection as well. Phalanges accounted for 22 of the elements attributed to white-tail deer, almost a third of the bones. Of these 22, 17 were fractured. Terminal (third) phalanges were generally complete, but the majority of first and second were intentionally fractured. It is interesting to speculate about the importance of marrow fracturing and boiling for bone grease when the time was taken to process bones this small.

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 23 The remainder of elements from white-tails can be generally lumped into discarded joint portions, or butchering units. Proximal and distal portions of the long bones remained after hacking out the joints to quickly disarticulate the animal. Only two bones in the entire collection have good evidence of cut-marks and only one of those can be attributed to a white-tail. The popular view of a deer being carefully disarticulated with a few chert blades may be more accurately viewed as a hack job with heavy cleaving tools. This may be illustrated by 16 of the 22 bones that show some sort of fracturing and are white-tail. Most of the bones with marks retain evidence of spiral fractures, impact fractures, and snap fractures from breaking the green bone for marrow processing. The scattering of the skull, mandible, and vertebrae fragments add to the conclusion that the white-tail remains present represent post-processing, discarded remains. Dogs are represented in the collection as a food source and a taphonomic agent. Five occurrences, including several bones bearing impact fractures and one burned, suggest dogs were part of the diet. Evidence of gnawing by canids is present on a number of fragments, but does not seem to be prevalent enough to have altered the make-up of the collection. In the ID list, dogs are listed under ‘canid’ to make the point that domesticated dog and coyote are indistinguishable from the elements present herein. Rabbits are scattered throughout the collection, again being represented by mandibles, broken lower long bones, foot bones, and pelves that would be expected when inedible portions of the skeleton are discarded. Cottontails and at least one jackrabbit are present. A number of turkeys were identified. Again, the bones present were the lower leg elements and portions of the wings — in other words, the elements discarded after processing. While turkey (and unidentified bird elements of that size) were not numerous, they did occur in 12 different levels (N=14 bones). Seasonality in a relatively small collection like this is tenuous. The singular fracturing of the white-tail phalanges suggests a seasonal Fall occupation. The marrow stored within each phalanx would be modest, but a concerted effort by a few people to process multiple animals might make the fracturing and boiling of such elements worthwhile. Storage and transportation of fat for the winter months is critical in any prehistoric diet. Turkey and deer would be taking advantages of mast crops at this time of year, concentrating them in areas with productive oaks and pecan trees. Turtles remain available into November in some years, so their presence may only modestly influence any seasonal speculation. Rabbit meat in the Fall of a good year may also be at its caloric best, as the animals graze for winter. Since all of these animals — with the exception of the aquatic turtles — can be found year round, the Fall indicator from the fractured phalanges and animal assemblage must be argued judiciously and only in concert with other types of evidence from site 41DL336.

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 29 APPENDIX 2. MUSSELS AND SNAILS FROM SITE 41DL336 Jesse Todd, MS, MA Paleoenvironment The gastropod fauna indicates an oak-savannah floodplain environment that slightly shifts from grass to woodland from time to time. Glyphylinia indentata and Strobilops texasiana indicate an environment with leaves, rotting logs and a probably moist area. The presence of Helicina orbiculata indicates the presence of permanent vegetation. Rabdotus dealbatus may be found in a riparian woodland environment but is also found in grassland areas which it appears to prefer at this site. Mesodon thyroidus prefers a woodland environment as well as Linisa texasiana. The presence of the same gastropod fauna was found continuously from top to bottom in the excavation; therefore the environment did not change drastically. It should be stressed at this point of the importance of flotation sampling. Without the gastropods from the flotation material, this analysis would have been different and misleading for Unit 9. The Planorbella trivolvis shells probably indicate standing water within the floodplain. The standing water is relatively recent since the shells were only found in levels 1 and 3. The gastropods, especially the Rabdotus, probably came to the site for the limestone cobbles in order to consume the calcium from the rocks to strengthen their shells. This point is reinforced by the presence of Rumina decollata which prefers limestone environments. R. decollata is a native of the Mediterranean area of North Africa and Southern Europe and is an introduced species (Neck 1980:136). The presence of various sizes of shells of the same species suggests that the snails were not brought to the site for subsistence purposes, but were distributed throughout the site naturally. Most of the mussels from the site are found in shallow to moderate depths, slow to moderate currents with a gravel and mud bottom. The presence of Lampsilis teres indicates the substrate was not shifting sand and the water was perennial. The exception is Amblema plicata and Potamilus purpuratus which prefer deep pools with minimal current and a muddy bottom. Although the mussels may have been gathered from Artesia Creek or the Mountain Creek drainage, the mussels also may have been gathered from the Trinity River. Peter and McGregor (1988:165) state that Amblema plicata and Lampsilis hydiana shells recovered from the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) usually occupy larger river systems than the Mountain Creek drainage and the presence of the species at the site suggest forays to the Trinity River for possible subsistence purposes. All of the species collected from the site are found within the Trinity River drainage (Strecker 1931) and in Dallas County (Read 1954). The mussels gathered from Artesia Creek suggest the creek would have been slightly larger than today with alternating shallows and deep pools with moderate to slow currents of alkaline water.

THE UBIL SITE AT CAMP WISDOM 30 Subsistence It seems unusual for Potamilus ohioensis to be the dominant specie utilized by the site inhabitants because excavations within the Trinity River drainage usually have either Fusconaia flava or Amblema plicata dominate the assemblage. The presence of P. ohioensis suggests that most of the mussels were gathered locally. There was only one specimen each of Quadrula cf. houstonensis, Quadrula cf. mortoni and Tritogonia verrucosa which might indicate that they were not native to the area and were brought to the site, probably from the Trinity River.
