A split of the recovered carbon material was sent to Beta Analytic, Inc. for radiocarbon dating. After pretreat- ment, 21 grams of charcoal and organic sediment was recovered and subjected to Accelerator Mass Spec- trometry (AMS) dating. Radiocarbon age of the char- coal material was 32,180 +/- 230 BP (Radiocarbon Years), with a two-sigma calibration date of 35,625 to 36,625 Cal. Years BP (Table 1). This is very similar to dates obtained from the Lewisville site (Brannon et al. 1957; Fergusson and Libby 1962; Crook and Harris 1962; Li Liu et al 1986). In the late 1970’s, an extreme drought briefly re- exposed the Lewisville site. A short excavation was conducted from September, 1978 until February, 1979 Figure 2.
