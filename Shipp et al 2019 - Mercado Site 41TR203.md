ABSTRACT On behalf of North Tarrant Infrastructure (NTI), aci consulting conducted survey, testing, and data recovery investigations at the Mercado site (41TR203), a prehistoric multi-component site in the Interstate Highway 35W (I-35W) right-of-way (ROW) along the West Fork of the Trinity River in Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas for the North Tarrant Expressway (NTE), Segment 3A Project. The work was done in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas. The survey and testing investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit 6635, with Dr. Ann M. Scott serving as Principal Investigator. Subsequent data recovery investigations were performed under Permit 6753, first with Dr. Scott and then Julie Shipp serving as Principal Investigator. The Area of Potential Effects (APE) is defined as the existing and proposed ROW straddling the existing lanes of I-35W and extending from near the edge of the West Fork of the Trinity River north for approximately 1,000 feet (ft) (304 meters [m]). The width of the APE varies from 200 to 282 ft (60 to 86 m) on the west side of I-35W and from 52 to 190 ft (15 to 58 m) on the east side of I-35W. Vertical impacts at the bridge for drill shafts are about 60 ft (18 m) deep from the ground surface into bedrock. Other impacts include excavating the ground surface to a depth of approximately 4 to 5 ft (1.2 to 1.5 m) near the northern end of the APE. Most of the improvements consist of fill placement on the existing ground surface. Thus, the APE encompasses 10.232 acres in total, on both sides of the existing I-35W roadway, with vertical impacts of up to 60 ft (18 m). All parcels comprising the APE are owned by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Investigations focused on Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components that would be subject to project impacts. Survey and testing occurred during 2009 and 2013, respectively. The data recovery investigations were conducted during the spring and summer of 2014. A series of Analytical Units (AUs), representing well-preserved, temporally and culturally distinct prehistoric occupations that occurred on the river terraces of the West Fork of the Trinity River, were identified using multiple lines of archeological and geomorphic data, including microstratigraphy. Radiocarbon dates indicate a range of seasonal, intermittent occupations that Mercado Site (41TR203) i July 2019

occurred from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods (2600-500 year[s] calibrated before present [yr Cal BP]). The Late Archaic component at the Mercado site (principally AUs 6-8) formed on a relatively stable surface for about 600 years (approximately 2700-2100 yr Cal BP). The lithic assemblage was limited in variability, containing only a few stone tool forms and types; however, the tools and debitage indicate a fair degree of initial-stage tool manufacture and reduction, and more commonly the later and final stages of formal tool manufacturing. There was also considerable sharpening or rejuvenation of tools before they were discarded. The site is interpreted as an open, seasonally occupied (spring to fall) campsite in the context of a local environment with a broad spectrum of resources, including riverine, woodland, and grassland habitats. Their prey ranged from small mammals and aquatic life to deer and bison. The larger prey was commonly killed and processed off-site, but there were some evidence of whole specimens of both deer and bison being processed at the camp. During the Late/Transitional Archaic Period at the Mercado site, mussels became a more prominent food source, but the subsistence strategy continued to include variable and broad- spectrum hunting and collection activities. Plant processing within earth ovens is evident during this transitional period. The Late Prehistoric component at the site is indicative of a hunting encampment focused on deer, broad-spectrum small mammals, amphibians, and reptiles. Small hearth/earth oven features also preserved significant evidence of plant food processing. There are discernible trends in the subsistence data that indicate changes in occupational intensity, subsistence, and inferentially group size. At the same time, the technological consistency of burned rock features suggests a long-lived subsistence pattern, stretching from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. This subsistence pattern was perhaps made possible by the location of the site, which is situated on a relatively stable surface at the convergence of riverine, woodland, and grassland habitats. Site 41TR203 is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. The site is NRHP eligible under Criterion D Mercado Site (41TR203) ii July 2019

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The Mercado site investigations took place intermittently over the course of five years and involved the efforts of a remarkable team, some of whom remained involved throughout, some who left but then came back in the end, and some who just shined for their moment during the Project. You are all invaluable. Thanks to everyone for working overtime to get it done. This Project would not have been possible without the assistance and coordination of Jennifer Oshel, Environmental Compliance Manager for North Tarrant Infrastructure; and Stan Reece, Vice President, and Kevin Ramberg, Chief Operating Officer, at aci consulting. We appreciate their commitment to the Project. The authors would like to express gratitude for the guidance and inspiration from Texas Department of Transportation archeologists, Eric Oksanen and Dr. Scott Pletka, and Texas Historical Commission archeologists, Arlo McKee, Bill Martin, and Mark Denton (retired). Eric Oksanen and Arlo McKee were also researchers for this investigation. Eric provided a study that he conducted on Gary points, and Arlo conducted the geoarcheological investigations along with Dr. Charles Frederick. The stellar field crews who were part of this investigation maintained high levels of professionalism and morale despite harsh weather of all seasons and prairie winds that at times threatened to land us in Oklahoma. The crew for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) testing phase consisted of Jennifer Hatchett Kimbell, Bennett Kimbell, Michael Smith, Tess Noble, Sarah Loftus, and Jonathon Comer. The data recovery team consisted of Rosemarie Pavel, Michael Smith, Ruben Castillo, Stephanie Martin, Megan Egan, Don Baden, Jonathon Comer, Robin Polseno, Patrick Gainey, Bennet Kimbell, and Jennifer Hatchett Kimbell. Jennifer also served as Project Archeologist, Field Lab Director, TDS Mapper, and GIS Specialist. Dr. Robin Benson Barnes, Katie Canavan, and Nicole Inskeep supervised the laboratory and curatorial duties in various phases of the Project. Megan Lamont served as GIS Specialist. Julie Shipp was Principal Investigator (PI) for the analysis and reporting phases of the investigation and was involved from the beginning of the Project. Mercado Site (41TR203) iv July 2019

Dr. Ann M. Scott was the original ringleader of this operation, serving as the PI throughout NRHP testing and data recovery fieldwork, and coming back into the fold to help coordinate the reporting. This Project benefitted immensely from her involvement. As usual, Dr. Charles Frederick contributed significantly to our understanding of the site, from providing unofficial guidance during the NRHP testing phase to conducting the geoarcheology investigations during the data recovery, and essentially being on-call. aci consulting had the pleasure of teaming with Principal Investigators from other companies and their teams to compile this report. Those individuals are Dr. Ann M. Scott and Dr. David Yelacic from Terracon, Dr. Mary Jo Galindo from Galindo ENV, and Dr. James W. Karbula from PaleoWest. Mary Jo Galindo and James W. Karbula provided expert review of the research in the final phases. Katie Canavan and Megan Cochran graciously accepted the challenge of formatting and editing this report.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY Report Title: Data Recovery of the Mercado Site (41TR203), A Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric Open Occupation Campsite in the Deep Terraces of the West Fork of the Trinity River in Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas Report Date: July 2019 Report Number: 12-13-027 Agency: Texas Department of Transportation Texas Antiquties Permit Number: Data Recovery 6753, NRHP Testing 6635 Project Description: The North Tarrant Expressway (NTE), Segment 3A Project (or Project) includes road expansion activities for the relief of traffic congestion along the corridors of Interstate Highway 820 (I-820), Interstate Highway 35W (I-35W), and State Highway 183 (SH 183) in the cities of Fort Worth, Haltom City, North Richard Hills, Bedford, and Euless in Tarrant County, Texas. aci consulting conducted Phase III data recovery at the Mercado site (41TR203) within the new right-of-way (ROW) acquired for the NTE Project by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) (on Parcels 852-west and 853-east). Phase III archeological data recovery was conducted consistent with the requirements of the Texas Natural Resources Code Title 9, Chapter 191 (Antiquities Code of Texas) and Section 106 (36 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) under the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) and Section 106 of the NHPA of 1992, as amended, was conducted in advance of the proposed road expansion and related activities. Data recovery excavations were conducted under TAC Permit 6753 as mitigation for the adverse effects proposed to prehistoric archeological site 41TR203. The purpose of the Phase III data recovery was to ensure that the site was mitigated before the road expansion construction began and to fulfill TAC and Section 106 requirements. A summary of survey and testing investigations previously conducted under TAC Permit 6635 is presented in this report. Mercado Site (41TR203) vi July 2019

The APE is currently defined as the existing and proposed ROW extending from near the edge of the West Fork of the Trinity River north for approximately 1,000 feet (ft) (304 meters [m]). The APE covers a total area of about 10.232 acres and includes both sides of I-35W. The width varies from 200 to 282 ft (60 to 86 m) on the west side of I-35W and from 52 to 190 ft (15 to 58 m) on the east side of I-35W. Impacts at the bridge for the drill shafts are about 60 ft (18 m) deep from the ground surface into bedrock. Other impacts include excavation of the ground surface to a depth of approximately 4 to 5 ft (1.2 to 1.5 m) near the northern end of the APE. Most of the improvements consist of fill placement on the existing ground surface. All parcels are owned by TxDOT. No work took place on private property. The conditions of TAC Permit 6753 included the hand excavation of 34.8–40.8 cubic meters 3) (m of sediments at the site. Data recovery conducted by aci consulting occurred in two investigations during the spring and summer of 2014. The required volume of hand-excavated sediments was not achieved during the first phase of fieldwork. During the second phase, the THC, in coordination with TxDOT, allowed a modified scope of work to maximize data collection in the time remaining. Overall, a total of 86 1 square meter (m2) excavation units (EUs) and a 17-m-long trench were excavated within the APE. The trench was excavated for geoarcheological purposes and was extended to a width of 3.4 m by the end of the data recovery. Fifteen 1-m by0.5-m EUs were placed within the trench over exposed features. A total of 44 features were recorded during the data recovery investigation, including 32 from the block excavations and 12 from the trench and trench extension. The excavated features consisted of small basin hearths, mussel shell scatters and middens, burned rock middens, pits, and a cache- like lithic concentration. In total, 36.9 m3 of sediments were excavated during the two data recovery investigations led by aci consulting. Of the 36.9 m3, 23.8 m3 were excavated by hand and 13.1 m3 by mechanical trenching. In total, 8,346 faunal remains were recovered and analyzed. Additionally, 64 liters of soil matrix were submitted for flotation analysis. Lithics included 390 pieces of debitage and 22 tools, including bifaces, projectile points, and unifaces. Mussel shell and burned earth were also collected and analyzed.

1.0 CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION By: Julie Shipp and James W. Karbula The North Tarrant Expressway (NTE) Project (or Project) includes road expansion activities for the relief of traffic congestion along the corridors of Interstate Highway 820 (I-820), Interstate Highway 35W (I-35W), and State Highway 183 (SH 183) in the cities of Fort Worth, Haltom City, North Richard Hills, Bedford, and Euless in Tarrant County, Texas. aci consulting conducted Phase III data recovery at the Mercado site (41TR203) within the new right-of-way (ROW) acquired for the NTE Project by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) (on Parcels 852-west and 853-east). Phase III archeological data recovery was conducted consistent with the requirements of the Texas Natural Resources Code Title 9, Chapter 191 (Antiquities Code of Texas) and Section 106 (36 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) under the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) and Section 106 of the NHPA of 1992, as amended, was conducted in advance of proposed road expansion and related activities. Data recovery excavations were conducted under TAC Permit 6753 in mitigation to proposed adverse effects to prehistoric archeological site 41TR203. The purpose of the Phase III data recovery was to ensure that the site was mitigated before the road expansion construction began, and to fulfill TAC and Section 106 requirements. A summary of survey and testing investigations previously conducted under TAC Permit 6635 are presented in this report. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is defined as the existing and proposed ROW extending from near the edge of the West Fork of the Trinity River heading north for approximately 1,000 feet (ft) (304 meters [m]) (Figures 1.1 and 1.2). The APE covers about 10.232 acres on both sides of I- 35W. The width varies from 200 to 282 ft (60 to 86 m) on the west side of I-35W and from 52 to 190 ft (15 to 58 m) on the east side of I-35W. Impacts at the bridge for the drill shafts are about 60 ft (18 m) deep from the ground surface into bedrock. Other impacts include excavating the ground surface approximately 4 to 5 ft (1.2 to 1.5 m) near the northern end of the APE. Most of the improvements consist of placing fill on the existing ground surface. All parcels are owned by TxDOT. No work took place on private property. Mercado Site (41TR203) 1 July 2019

Methods employed were coordinated in detail with TxDOT to ensure THC concurrence with hand-excavated units as well as mechanical trenching that occurred during the data recovery. Revised methods that were employed during the data recovery were concurred upon by both TxDOT and THC before the change in effort was conducted. The conditions of the TAC Permit 6753 included the hand excavation of 34.8 to 40.8 m3 of sediments at the site. Data recovery conducted by aci consulting occurred in two investigations during the spring and summer of 2014. The required volume of hand-excavated sediments was not achieved during the first phase of fieldwork. During the second phase, the THC, in coordination with TxDOT, allowed a modified scope of work to maximize data collection in the time remaining. Overall, a total of 86 1 by 1-m excavation units (EUs) and a 17-m-long trench were excavated within the APE. The trench was excavated for geoarcheological purposes and was extended to a width of 3.4 m by the end of the data recovery. Fifteen 1 by 0.5-m EUs were placed within the trench over exposed features. A total of 44 features were recorded during the data recovery investigation, including 32 from the block excavations and 12 from the trench and trench extension. The excavated features consisted of small basin hearths, mussel shell scatters and middens, burned rock middens, pits, and a cache-like lithic concentration. In total, 36.9 m3 were excavated during the two data recovery investigations led by aci consulting. Of the 36.9 m3, 23.8 m3 were excavated by hand and 13.1 m3 by mechanical trenching. In total, 8,346 faunal remains were recovered and analyzed. Additionally, 64 liters of soil matrix were submitted for flotation analysis. Lithics included 390 pieces of debitage and 22 tools, including bifaces, projectile points, and unifaces. Mussel shell and burned earth were also collected and analyzed. The investigations at site 41TR203 encountered buried features consisting of bone, mussel shell, fire-cracked rock (FCR), lithics, and charcoal located within a series of stratified substantial cultural occupation zones. Using multiple lines of archeological and geomorphic data, including microstratigraphy, a series of Analytical Units (AUs) were identified representing temporally and culturally distinct aboriginal occupations that occurred on the river terraces of the West Fork of the Trinity River. Radiocarbon dates indicate a range of seasonal, intermittent occupations that occurred from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric sociocultural intervals (approximately 2600 Mercado Site (41TR203) 4 July 2019

to 500 years calibrated before present [yr Cal BP]). This series of occupation zones exhibits outstanding context and organic preservation especially in faunal, mollusk, and botanical remains. Data from the site addresses research questions regarding changes in subsistence strategies and technology from the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods in north Central Texas, particularly on sites along the West Fork of the Trinity River. Site 41TR203 is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. The site is NRHP eligible under Criterion D for having yielded information important to our understanding of prehistory. The site qualifies as a SAL according to the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas (TAC, Title 13, Chapter 26), as the property is situated on state-owned property. Furthermore, the site qualifies for formal designation as a SAL under 13 TAC 26.10 (subpart A(1). 1.1 Introduction TxDOT proposed road expansion activities for the relief of traffic congestion along the corridors of I-820, I-35W, and SH 183 in the cities of Fort Worth, Haltom City, North Richard Hills, Bedford, and Euless in Tarrant County, Texas. On behalf of TxDOT and to fulfill requirements under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1992, as amended, for Segment 3A of the NTE Project, aci consulting conducted Phase III data recovery at site 41TR203, which was located within the new ROW acquired by TxDOT for the NTE Project (on Parcels 852-west and 853-east) (see Figures 1.1 and 1.2). Site 41TR203 is a stratified prehistoric site considered eligible for the NRHP under Criterion D and for designation as a SAL under Criteria 1 and 2 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas. 1.2 Site Setting Segment 3A is approximately 8.4 miles (mi) (13.5 kilometers [km]) long, and for design and construction purposes, is divided into two segments. The North Segment consists of the I-820/I- 35W Interchange and includes sections of I-820 east and west from Mark IV Parkway to North Beach Street, a portion of I-35W north of the interchange to Fossil Creek Boulevard, and a portion of I-35W south of the interchange. The South Segment begins with the southern boundary of the North Segment (near IH30) and includes work on US Highway 287. The South Segment also includes a portion of the frontage road.

The boundary of site 41TR203 has been extended onto the ROW on the east side of I-35W, which was the location of the Phase I survey at site 41TR202. The cultural deposits in the area correlated more closely with site 41TR203, rather than with site 41TR202. The APE is located within the South Segment of the NTE Segment 3A Project ROW, on the northern bank of the West Fork of the Trinity River as it crosses I-35W. Site 41TR203 is in an open grassy field primarily on the west side of I-35W but extends through the interstate and continues to the east side as well. The new extended site boundary encompasses 239,214 m2 on the west side of I-35W and 4,909 m2 on the east side of I-35W, for a total of 244,123 m2. Both the eastern and western sides of I-35W are cultivated agricultural fields. The western boundary of site 41TR203 abuts the Trinity River. Historic aerials depict the meandering of the Trinity River almost touching the northwestern boundary of the site (see Chapter 6). The area has been severely impacted over the years by previous roadway construction, maintenance, agriculture, and the channelization of the Trinity River. Despite the urban setting and previous impacts, the APE remains primarily intact. The surface geology at site 41TR203 is mapped as Holocene alluvium (Barnes 1972). The soil is mapped as Frio silty clay, 0-1 percent slopes, which formed within loamy and clayey calcareous alluvium and typically exhibits an A1-A2-A3-A4-Bk profile. Frio soils are a Cumulic Haplustoll, which have a mollic epipedon at least 50 centimeters (cm) thick and have a texture finer than loamy fine sand. Frio soils also exhibit an irregular decrease in organic content and have a slope of less than 25 percent. Frio soils have a high potential for both shallow and deeply buried archeological components (Abbott 2011). The site lies within the West Fork Soil, which formed at the top of the Pilot Point Alloformation, and is located near the ground surface, underneath the plow zone at 41TR203. The West Fork Soil was first identified by Ferring (1986) and dates to the Late Holocene. West Fork Soil is the surface soil on the Trinity River floodplain in some places, and in other places, it is buried by recent alluvium (Ferring 1986). Numerous projects have dated the West Fork Soil where it is buried by the recent alluvium, but few have examined the West Fork Soil where it is the surface soil (Frederick 2011). One potential research benefit from excavations at site 41TR203 was to further define the West Fork deposits at the site and to more closely correlate this natural stratigraphic and Mercado Site (41TR203) 6 July 2019

chronologic marker with the cultural deposits. An in-depth look at this geoarcheological work is presented in Chapter 6. 1.3 Previous Investigations Near APE A literature review of the THC (2018) Archeological and Historic Sites Atlas databases (Atlas) revealed that no sites other than 41TR202 and 42TR203 have been recorded within 1 km of the Project APE. Four archeological surveys have been conducted within 1 km of the Project APE. In 2000, a linear survey sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) was conducted on the south side of the Trinity River. A report documenting the results of the survey was not located, but no affiliated sites are listed in Atlas. Geoarcheological coring was conducted near the project area as well as to the northwest along the Trinity River (Osburn et al. 2005; discussed below). No archeological resources were discovered during a survey conducted prior to railroad system improvements west of the project area (Tinsley and Forbes 2010). Two historic sites were recorded during an additional survey related to railroad corridor improvements west of the project area, but neither is located within 1 km of the proposed project area (Green and Hunt 2010). Site 41TR198 is located approximately 3.4 km (2.1 mi) southeast of the APE, downstream from sites 41TR202 and 41TR203, and on the northern bank of the West Fork of the Trinity River (Figure 1.3). Site 41TR198 had stratified components dating from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods and contained a significant amount of well-preserved faunal remains as well as burned rock features and bone and shell lenses (Peter and Harrison 2011). The natural and cultural deposits at 41TR198 are comparable to site 41TR203. 1.4 Previous Investigations at 41TR203 Site 41TR203 was originally located through geoarcheological coring conducted by Geo-Marine for the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 2005 under TAC Permit 3704 in association with the Central City Hydraulic Mitigation Areas Project (Osburn et al. 2005; Figure 1.4). During this initial investigation, 66 cores were excavated in areas that were considered to have a high probability for archeological sites within three zones: Zone 3A for the hydraulic mitigation, Zone 3B for dam construction, and Zone 3C for recreation zones. Sites 41TR202 and 41TR203 were located within the eastern half of Zone 3C. Site 41TR202 was identified on the Mercado Site (41TR203) 7 July 2019

No cultural materials were observed within the cores excavated at site 41TR202. Cultural materials on the surface consisted of a scatter of mussel shell and burned rock that spanned approximately 35 m (115 ft) northwest to southeast. Previous investigators concluded that this site was likely to contain buried cultural deposits and should be subject to further investigation (Osburn et al. 2005). Cultural material was located on the surface and from 45 to 234 cmbs (1.5 to 7.7 ft) within the cores at site 41TR203. The cores were excavated to 366 cmbs (12 ft). A scatter of mussel shell, burned rock, and one chert flake were observed on the surface between cores 5 and 6. Burned clay, bone, charcoal, and mussel shell were identified throughout the core profiles. Radiocarbon dates from charcoal identified within the cores, as well as the types of cultural materials and their distribution, led investigators to suggest that the site contained Late Archaic components separated by alluvial events. Additional testing was recommended (Osburn et al. 2005). Backhoe trenching was conducted by SWCA Environmental Consultants in 2009 for the Expedited Intensive Archeological Survey at the West Fork Trinity River, Tarrant County Project, which consisted of the widening of the I-35W roadway and bridge construction for TxDOT under TAC Permit 4924 (Galindo and Lawrence 2009; see Figure 1.4). Investigators did not have access to the east side ROW at the time; therefore, that area was not investigated to determine if site 41TR202 was present. Eight backhoe trenches were excavated at site 41TR203 within the APE, which consisted of the existing and proposed I-35W ROW. Six of the eight trenches were positive for cultural material (see Figure 1.4). Three features were identified, including two burned rock features and one concentration of shell and bone. The site appeared to contain at least three discrete, buried cultural components from about 60 to 80 cmbs (25 to 30 inches), 100 to 150 cmbs (40 to 60 inches), and 280 to 300 cmbs (110 to 120 inches). The cultural material consisted of charcoal, bone, burned rock, mussel shell, and one chert flake. The West Fork Soil was identified at the site as well. Site 41TR203 was recommended for NRHP testing, and site 41TR202 was recommended for additional survey to confirm the presence or absence of the site within the APE (Galindo and Lawrence 2009). 1.5 NRHP Testing aci consulting conducted a Phase I survey to locate site 41TR202 within the APE and conducted Phase II NRHP testing at site 41TR203 in August 2013. Ten backhoe trenches and seven EUs were placed at site 41TR203, and four trenches and one 50 by 50-cm test unit (TU) were excavated in Mercado Site (41TR203) 11 July 2019

the APE on the east side of the highway, where it was probable that a portion of site 41TR203 would be located (see Figure 1.4). The natural and cultural deposits were similar on both sides of the highway, and the decision was made to include the cultural material on the east side of the highway as part of site 41TR203. The cultural materials were consistent with the materials located during the 2009 survey, including burned rock, mussel shell, bone, charcoal, and scant lithic material. One chert flake and one chert biface were the only lithics located during the testing investigation. Some possible daub was recovered. Two burned rock features were excavated. Previouis investigaations documented three cultural components at site 41TR203, encompassing both sides of the highway. The component at 270 to 300 cmbs that was reported from the expedited survey in 2009 was not relocated during the current investigation. However, a shallower component, which is mostly still intact below the plow zone, was located. The three cultural components are located at depths of approximately 25 to 45 cmbs, 60 to 80 cmbs, and 100 to 120 cmbs. Radiocarbon dates from previous investigations at site 41TR203 confirm that the three components date to the Late Archaic period from approximately 2210 to 1590 yr Cal BP. 1.6 Summary of Archeological Work Performed Prior to fieldwork, aci consulting conducted background literature research using all available publications, site files (including the NRHP site files), and United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle maps (both modern and historic). The purpose of the archival research was to identify any previously recorded archeological sites (to procure site forms), historic structures, districts, historical markers, properties listed on the NRHP, and SALs that overlapped the project area. Additionally, this data served as a basis for understanding the archeological impact on the area from the past to present. The literature search identified previously recorded sites and surveys within a 1-km buffer around the APE. Site forms were obtained from the THC database for review and to update with the necessary changes based on the data recovery. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil maps and USGS geologic maps were consulted to determine the relative depth of Quaternary or Holocene alluvial deposits at site 41TR203. Between February 12 and March 22, 2014, aci consulting archeologists conducted the first phase of data recovery excavation at site 41TR203 on the north bank of the West Fork of the Trinity River.

During initial data recovery, 33 features were recorded within three discrete zones. The three occupation zones date to the Late Archaic period from approximately 2500 yr Cal BP to 1500 yr Cal BP. An additional data recovery investigation was performed between June 9 and 17, 2014 to fulfill the TAC permit. In the second phase of investigation, 11 more features were recorded. All field investigations were consistent with the requirements of Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the NHPA of 1966 (as amended, 1992) and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990. All work met acceptable professional and safety standards. Personnel met the requirements listed under the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Archeology and Historic Preservation. All artifacts collected in the field were temporarily transferred to the aci consulting laboratory in Austin, Texas, where they were cleaned, cataloged, labeled, and analyzed. Data was entered into a database to facilitate analysis and report production. Artifacts were processed for curation in accordance with the 36 CFR Part 79 and in accordance with the curation agreement entered into by aci consulting and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) curation facility. TxDOT provided artifact inventory forms for analysis. All artifacts were processed, analyzed, and prepared for curation consistent with TARL standards. 1.7 Report Organization Beginning with an Abstract, subsequent orientation sections of the report are organized into an Introduction including Site Setting, Previous Investigations, and Summary (Chapter 1).

2.0 CHAPTER 2 – ENVIRONMENT AND CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY By: Mary Jo Galindo 2.1 Environment Archeological site 41TR203 is within the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity River straddling I-35W in Fort Worth, Texas. While the site boundary was extended to the eastern side of the highway, the data recovery investigations were conducted exclusively on the western side where the site deposits were concentrated. Elevation at the site is approximately 520 ft above mean sea level (msl). Although the site is presently adjacent to its northern bank, the West Fork of the Trinity River was considerably more sinuous before it was artificially channelized for flood control purposes in the mid-twentieth century, and site 41TR203 was probably previously situated between 50 to 100 m southeast of the channel according to historic map data (Foster et al. 2006). The underlying geology of the site is mapped as Holocene alluvium (Fisher 1972), while the soil is Frio silty clay, 0-1 percent slopes, which formed within loamy and clayey calcareous alluvium (Ressel 1981). Frio soils have a high potential to contain both shallow and deeply buried archeological components (Abbott 2011). 2.2 Environmental Setting The site lies within the Grand Prairie ecological region, where the terrain is an undulating plain generally underlain by Lower Cretaceous limestones with interbedded marl and clay (Griffith et al. 2004) (Figure 2.1). The vegetation of the Grand Prairie is similar to the Northern Blackland Prairie; however, the limestone of the Grand Prairie is relatively more resistant to weathering, yet meandering streams deeply incise its limestone surface. This habitat historically supported a rich mixture of diverse plant and animal communities available to the prehistoric peoples of north- central Texas. Grand Prairie grasses include big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, little bluestem, hairy grama, Texas wintergrass, sideoats grama, and Texas cupgrass. The original vegetation was tallgrass prairie in the upland areas and elm, pecan, and hackberry in riparian areas where deeper soils have developed in floodplain deposits or where the underlying clays have been exposed by limestone erosion. Invasive species such as Ashe juniper and honey mesquite have increased with settlement and increasing urbanization (Griffith et al. 2004). Most of the prairie has been converted to cropland (e.g., corn, grain sorghum, and wheat), non-native pasture, and expanding urban uses around Fort Worth. Mercado Site (41TR203) 15 July 2019

Site 41TR203 is within the Texan Biotic Province that occupies an intermediate location between the grasslands of the Southern Plains to the west and the deciduous forests of the Southeast (Blair 1950). A total of 49 species of mammals occur in the region, including white-tailed deer, bison, bear, squirrel, rabbit, and raccoon, along with a wide range of bird species and aquatic fauna such as turtle, snake, frog, fish, and freshwater mussel. Tarrant County has a subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and mild winters, except for short-lived periods of colder weather. The region receives sunshine about 76 percent of the time. Temperatures fall to or below an average of 20°F about six days per year. Only 7.4 cm (2.9 in) of precipitation fall on average as snow, with frozen precipitation occurring in three of four years. Hailstorms typically occur two or three days a year. A wide range of annual temperature extremes characterizes the region. In Tarrant County, the records for daily extremes reflect a low of -8°F in February 1899, and a high of 113°F in June 1980. Typically, temperatures average 47.4°F in the winter season (December to February) and 83.3°F in the summer season (June to August) (Ressel 1981: Table 2). The region has an average annual precipitation of 81.5 cm (32.1 in), with more than a quarter of it occurring during April and May. About 60 percent of the yearly precipitation falls from April through September, usually at night, with an average of about 44 rainfall events a year. The maximum recorded one-day rainfall amount was 24.3 cm (9.57 in), which fell in 1932. The prevailing winds are usually from the south, and the highest speeds reach 22.5 km (14 mi) per hour in March and April. 2.3 Paleoenvironment Archeologists are interested in how environments and site settings have changed through time, because observations about current climatic conditions cannot be assumed to apply to the past. Climates and geological processes have literally shaped archeological deposits, and they provide insight about both specific subsistence resources available at a given time period and the uneven preservation of the archeological record. Walter Taylor (1967:184–187) may have been among the first in 1948 to call for the collection of environmental data by archeologists using the Conjunctive Approach, but by the late 1960s, such practice was entrenched within the New Archeology paradigm. Today many universities concentrate their anthropological graduate programs on the complex relationships between people and the environment. Concurrent with Taylor’s directive, the fossil pollen record in Texas was being assembled as early as the 1940s by J. E. Potzger and B. C. Mercado Site (41TR203) 17 July 2019

Tharp (1943, 1947, 1954) using a series of peat deposits. Their early attempts were informative, as fossil pollen grains can be more reliable paleoenvironmental indicators than any archeological or paleontological data, but early studies like those by Potzger and Tharp lacked chronological control (Bryant and Holloway 1985:40). Site 41TR203 is within the narrow Grand Prairie physiographic area of the Cross Timbers (Griffith et al. 2004), which is sandwiched between the North-Central Plains and the Blackland Prairies (BEG 1996) (Figure 2.2). Alluvial sediments from north Texas generally do not contain preserved pollen in quantities sufficient for the reconstruction of valid paleoenvironmental studies (Bryant and Holloway 1985:66). For this reason, peat bogs in Oklahoma and central Texas have become proxies for fossil pollen evidence providing insight about the north Texas paleoenvironment (see Figure 2.1). The reconstruction of paleoenvironmental conditions at site 41TR203 involved multiple lines of evidence used to infer past conditions, including stable carbon isotopes, sedimentation rates informed by radiocarbon assays, faunal analysis, and mussel shell artifacts. These proxy data were chosen, because they have a specific relationship to the nature of the past environment and the potential to accurately reflect environmental conditions that prevailed at the time in which they were preserved at site 41TR203. Following Caran (1998: Table 4), a geoarcheological study (see Chapter 6) using stable carbon isotope analysis and radiocarbon assays was used to establish adequate stratigraphic, contextual, and chronological controls. Faunal preservation was exceptional at the site, allowing these data to be added to the model. Finally, isotope ratio data from the mussel shell analysis provided another climatic indicator for the site. These multiple lines of evidence are then compared to the paleoenvironmental sequences determined by the fossil pollen record. The following discussion of fossil pollen evidence is generally limited to the Late Holocene time frame preserved at site 41TR203, as determined by radiocarbon assays (3390 to 590 yr Cal BP).

2.4 Fossil Pollen Evidence Lois E. Albert (1981) analyzed peat core samples from Ferndale Bog in Atoka County, Oklahoma (about 160 miles northwest of site 41TR203) (see Figure 2.1). Her study revealed that from approximately 5000 yr Cal BP until 1700 yr Cal BP the fossil pollen record is dominated by high percentages of grass and herbaceous pollen with some Quercus (oak) and Carya (hickory) pollen present (Albert 1981:v; Bryant and Holloway 1985:64). During those 3,300 years, minor fluctuations in pollen types were evident, but overall stability was indicated. By 1700 yr Cal BP there was an increase in Pinus (pine) pollen, signaling the migration of pine into the region, according to Albert (1981:v). Holloway (1993) conducted further studies at Ferndale Bog that situated the beginning of the pine migration at 2100yr Cal BP and the establishment of an oak- hickory-pine forest after 1200 yr Cal BP (Bryant and Holloway 1985:64). Holloway (1993) found that the percentage of pine pollen remained moderate and stable during the 900-year interval before increasing dramatically after 1200 yr Cal BP, although pine pollen never exceeded 30 percent. Both studies agree that an initial post-glacial (10,000 yr Cal BP) grassland vegetation was replaced first by an oak savanna, followed by an oak woodland (5000 yr Cal BP), and finally by a migration of pine that peaks about 1200 yr Cal BP. The earliest study of the central Texas paleoenvironmental record was conducted at Patschke Bog (Potzger and Tharp 1943) (Figure 2.1). The post-glacial period (last 10,000 years) in central Texas was characterized as a time of gradual warming and drying with a predominant savanna of grasses and some oak and hickory trees. All of the central Texas peat bog studies reflect overall declines in arboreal pollen besides oak and concurrent increases in herbaceous and grass pollen (Bryant and Holloway 1985:61). Bryant (1977) studied the Gause Bog and the Boriak Bog (see Figure 2.1) and concluded that the establishment of the present oak-savanna vegetation probably occurred no later than 3000 yr Cal BP, and the vegetation has remained stable since then. Holloway et al. (1987) push this occurrence to 1500 yr Cal BP (Bryant and Holloway 1985:62). The discrepancy may be a function of the incomplete fossil pollen record at any one location. The upper 3 to 4 m of Gause Bog were removed for commercial purposes in the 1940s at the same time that the Boriak Bog was partially drained and suffered an uncontrolled burn. The uppermost radiocarbon date at Boriak Bog was 3400 yr Cal BP, suggesting that the last several thousand years of deposition is missing. Conversely, the Weakly Bog (150 miles southeast of site 41TR203) (see Figure 2.1) spans the last 2,400 years. Pollen data from the Weakly Bog suggest that from 2400 to 1500 yr Cal BP, central Mercado Site (41TR203) 20 July 2019

Texas vegetation probably consisted of open woodland dominated by oaks with some open grassland areas. Around 1500 yr Cal BP, the present oak-savanna vegetation established itself, replacing the oak woodland. Thus, a prolonged period of drier and warmer climatic conditions existed in central Texas after 1500 yr Cal BP according to this fossil pollen record (Bryant and Holloway 1985:62; Holloway et al. 1987). 2.5 Cultural Chronology The following overview of prehistoric north-central Texas is derived mainly from Daniel J. Prikryl’s (1990, 1993) investigations throughout north and northeast Texas, Dee Ann Story et al’s (1990) synthesis of upper Trinity River basin archeological data, Mark J. Lynott’s (1981) work in the Cross Timbers and Blackland Prairie of north Texas, and Jack L. Hofman’s (1989) summary of southern Great Plains archeology. Reservoir development in north Texas targeted the Trinity River drainages, resulting in numerous archeological investigations prior to their inundation. Several large projects took place along the Trinity River’s East Fork at Lake Lavon and Lake Ray Hubbard, contributing significant knowledge about the region’s prehistory (THC 2018), as has a recent data recovery project at site 41DL203 (Tinsley and Dayton 2011). Investigations along other parts of the Trinity River basin have involved the upper Elm Fork of the Trinity River in the Denton area, including Ray Roberts Reservoir, Lewisville Lake, and Grapevine Lake (Ferring and Yates 1997; THC 2018). Large-scale research along the West Fork of the Trinity River has been primarily limited to Mountain Creek Lake (THC 2018), although a recent data recovery project was conducted at 41DL436 prior to a transportation undertaking on a tributary of the West Fork of the Trinity River (Nickels 2014). The following cultural chronology is tailored to the time frame represented at 41TR203, as determined by radiocarbon assays (3390 to 590 yr cal BP), and focuses on the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. 2.5.1 Archaic Period (8500-1250 yr Cal BP) The Archaic period in north-central Texas extended from approximately 8500 to 1250 yr Cal BP with three subdivisions, including early (8500–6000 yr Cal BP), middle (6000–3500 yr Cal BP), and late (3500 to 1250 yr Cal BP), distinguished mainly by projectile point types, inferred climate changes, and shifting subsistence strategies (Prikryl 1990). Based on the definition of analytical units at site 41TR203, a Late/Transitional Archaic Period for the West Fork of the Trinity River is proposed (1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP), overlapping the early Late Prehistoric period.

Diagnostic artifacts associated with the Early Archaic consist of splitstem varieties, while the Middle Archaic is represented by basal-notched types such as Bell, Andice, Carrollton, and Bulverde. Late Archaic dart points include the Castroville, Marshall, Edgewood, Elam, Trinity, and Gary types (Prikryl 1990). Most of these projectile points were recovered on the surface and their ages determined by similar artifacts dated in other neighboring regions. Based on the dearth of discrete or stratigraphic Archaic occupations that have been analyzed in the region, north-central Texas archeology did not warrant its own chapter in The Prehistory of Texas (Perttula 2004), an otherwise comprehensive volume. Generally, the Archaic record likely reflects a slowly increasing population that had to respond to warmer and drier climatic conditions (Lynott 1981). As such, Archaic groups in the Grand Prairies region probably developed diversified hunting and gathering patterns focused on bottomland resources of rivers and major creeks (Hofman 1989). The Calvert Site in the Trinity Valley of Denton Creek (41DN103) (Ferring and Yates 1997) yielded a burial, hearths, and an unmixed Middle Archaic assemblage of artifacts and fauna. Investigators at the site suggested that the climate may have been drier, and that the homogeneity of artifact types with adjacent regions might indicate that Middle Archaic groups participated in broader cultural interactions (Ferring and Yates 1997:305). Two Late Archaic occupations at Mountain Creek Lake and Ray Roberts Reservoir are characterized by repeated occupations by small groups. In north-central Texas, the Late Archaic (and subsequent Late Prehistoric) archeological record commonly describes human burials, several of which are associated with Wylie pit features along the East Fork Trinity River (Stephenson 1952). These pit features became a hallmark of the Late Prehistoric Wylie focus. Investigations at the Richland-Chambers Reservoir indicated that the Wylie pit feature extended back to the Late Archaic and functioned as large-scale food processing sites, analogous to burned rock midden features in central Texas. The burials and pit features suggest larger groups came together seasonally for large-scale processing of food resources during the Late Archaic and extending into the Late Prehistoric. Other sites along the upper Elm Fork of the Trinity River that are suitable for comparative analysis with the Archaic component of site 41TR203 include 41CO144 (Jayrn site) and 41CO150 (Gemma site), which were both excavated within chute cut-off channels (Ferring and Yates 1997). Rapid channel filling preserved discrete occupation surfaces with features and charcoal that were Mercado Site (41TR203) 22 July 2019

separated by sterile alluvium. Site 41CO150 has one of the best series of stratified Late Archaic occupations in the region (Ferring and Yates 1997). 2.5.2 Late/Transitional Archaic Period (1815-1415 yr Cal BP) Based on the definition of Analytical Units 4 and 5 at site 41TR203, a Late/Transitional Archaic Period for the West Fork of the Trinity River is proposed (1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP), overlapping the early Late Prehistoric period. The two periods are intentionally left intertwined in this chronology, similar to the transitional period between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric Periods in Central Texas (Johnson and Goode 1994; Carpenter et al. 2013). Johnson and Goode (1994) place the end of the Archaic Period on the Eastern Edwards Plateau at about 1400 yr Cal BP, but they are open to the possibility that Archaic lifeways continued to about 800 yr Cal BP. Although not a focus of the research design, the Late/Transitional Archaic Period at site 41TR203 is proposed based on the analysis of radiocarbon assays from Features 14, 21, and 26 (Betas 396617, 396618, 396629, 396635, and 396636). This series of Late/Transitional Archaic prehistoric occupations is recorded at the lower contact of the West Fork Soil transitioning into the Lower Pilot Point Alloformation in the terrace setting. More discussion of the Late/Transitional Archaic concept is provided in the Chapter 10 synthesis; however, it is constrained by a lack of diagnostic lithic tools from Features 14, 21, and 26, and instead focuses on subsistence evidence. 2.5.3 Late Prehistoric Period (1250-250 yr Cal BP) Prikryl (1993) divides the Late Prehistoric period into Late Prehistoric I (1250 to 750 yr Cal BP) and Late Prehistoric II (750 to 250 yr Cal BP) based on projectile point and ceramic types. Late Prehistoric I temporally diagnostic arrow points include Scallorn, Catahoula, Steiner, Alba, and Bonham. Diagnostic ceramics primarily consist of grog-tempered, undecorated varieties, although when decorated, the influence from Caddo ceramics of East Texas is evident. During the Late Prehistoric II, influences from southern Plains groups are apparent in the archeological record, which may correspond to an increase in the size of the north-central Texas bison herd. Increasing population may have limited hunting ranges and resulted in a gradual trend toward horticulture and sedentary village life (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970). Plains-influenced material culture (Prikryl 1990) included calcareous-tempered ceramics and unstemmed triangular arrow points like Maud, Fresno, Harrell, Washita, and Perdiz.

are thumbnail scrapers and two- and four-beveled knives. Hoes fashioned from bison scapula provided evidence of horticulture from investigations at Lewisville Lake (Denton County) and Lavon Lake (Collin County) (Barber 1969). The Henrietta complex in north-central Texas was based on findings at the M. D. Harrell site along the Brazos River in Young County. This site and others were often situated on sandy elevated landforms and terraces above river valleys, and contained middens, house structures, rock hearths, storage pits, and burials (Brooks 1989). By the 18th century, documented groups in and around the region included Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo (Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell 1982). Sites attributed to this period contain European ceramics, glass beads, flintlock musket fragments, and metal arrow points in conjunction with chipped lithic tools.

3.0 CHAPTER 3 – INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY OF 41TR202 AND NRHP TESTING OF 41TR203 By: Julie Shipp, James W. Karbula, and Jennifer Hatchett Kimbell aci consulting conducted an intensive pedestrian survey and NRHP testing in August 2013 under TAC Permit 6635. The survey of site 41TR202 was conducted on the east side of I-35W on the north bank of the West Fork of the Trinity River. The NRHP testing at site 41TR203 was conducted on the west side of I-H35, also on the north bank. This chapter presents the data collected from both survey and NRHP testing, which resulted in combining the two sites into 41TR203. The features excavated during NRHP testing are discussed further in the Analytical Units and Feature Descriptions chapter (Chapter 7). 3.1 Field Methods 3.1.1 Intensive Pedestrian Survey at 41TR202 The field methods were based in part on the previous work done at sites 41TR202 and 41TR203. Both sites were located during a coring survey conducted by Geo-Marine in 2005 (see Figure 1.4). Eight backhoe trenches were excavated at site 41TR203 by SWCA in 2009, but no additional work was conducted within the proposed ROW on the east side of I-35W at site 41TR202 due to access issues. Therefore, at the beginning of the current investigation, it was unknown if the boundary of site 41TR202 extended into the current APE within the proposed ROW on the east side of I-35W. Thus, the field effort began by conducting the survey on the east side of I-35W to determine if site 41TR202 was present within the APE. Four backhoe trenches (BHTs) and one 50 by 50-cm TU were excavated within the proposed ROW on the east side of I-35W (Figure 3.1). The trenches were placed from south to north along the proposed ROW and were oriented north-to-south. Backhoe trenches were excavated to a width of 4 ft (1.2 m), a length of 20 ft (6.1 m), and a depth ranging from 5 to 10 ft (1.5 to 3 m). One person was monitoring the excavation, and one person was investigating the back-dirt pile for cultural materials. The trenches were initially dug to 4 ft (1.2 m), then investigators examined the walls for cultural materials, drew profiles, and took photographs of the trenches.

3.1.2 NRHP Testing at 41TR203 NRHP testing at 41TR203 also consisted of BHT and TU excavation (see Figure 3.1). Prior to excavation, the trenches from the intensive survey conducted by SWCA in 2009 were relocated and flagged (see Figure 1.4). Feature 1 in BHT 2 was a burned rock feature at approximately 80 cmbs that previous investigators had covered and reburied. This feature was relocated and excavated, and the trench retained its designation as BHT 2. Nine additional BHTs were excavated to the north and west to define the site boundary and within the center of the site to further understand the cultural and natural deposits near the site centroid. Six TUs were excavated, including one (Unit 1) at Feature 1 (F01) first located during the 2009 survey and the others at additional features. 3.2 Survey Results 3.2.1 Site 41TR202 Incorporated into 41TR203 Four BHTs and one 50 by 50-cm TU (Unit 6) were excavated for the intensive pedestrian survey at site 41TR202 (see Figure 3.1). The cultural deposits in the trench profiles appeared to be similar to those at site 41TR203, with three main occupation zones (I, II, and III) and similar artifacts, such as burned rock, mussel shell, burned clay, and few lithics. Feature 11, a mussel shell midden, was located within the Unit 6 in Zone II. The site was discussed with TxDOT archeologists in the field, and it was decided to lump site 41TR202 with 41TR203, since they appeared to be the same site, divided by I-35W. The new site boundary likely extends from the eastern extent of the APE on the east side of I-35W. The poisitive cores from the GeoMarine study in 2005 are approximaltey 30 m to the east of the APE. Artifacts from site 41TR203 (formerly 41TR202) are at minumin likely to be present from the eastern extent of the current APE on the east side of I-35 to the locations of the 2005 cores. 3.3 41TR203 NRHP Testing Results Eleven BHTs (in addition to the four on the east side of I-H35) and seven 1 by 1-m TUs (in addition to Unit 6 on the east side of I-35W) were placed at site 41TR203 (see Figure 3.1). Backhoe trench and feature numbering were continued from the initial NRHP testing conducted by SWCA. BHT 2 was re-excavated to relocate Feature 1 (F 1), which was covered and not excavated initially. Table 3.1 summarizes the BHTs. Mercado Site (41TR203) 28 July 2019

The features consisted of hearths, charcoal and ash concentrations, rock middens, and a shell midden. Features 1, 5, 6, and 8 were excavated. The remaining features were covered and their locations recorded in anticipation of future excavation. Feature 1: Feature 1 was first observed by archeologists from SWCA during their 2009 backhoe trenching work at site 41TR203. At that time, the archeologists photographed and documented the feature, covered it with orange safety fencing, and backfilled the trench. aci consulting archeologists relocated the trench based on the map of trenches provided by SWCA and used a backhoe to carefully remove the fill from above the feature level. The feature was located at a depth of approximately 50 cmbs and is composed of a cluster of FCR. Once the feature had been re-exposed, archeologists from aci consulting laid out a 1 by 1-m TU (Unit 1), oriented to the cardinal directions, centered over the feature. A vertical datum was set at 10 cm above the surface. The unit was excavated in 10-cm levels, and all fill was screened through 1/4-inch mesh. A 10-cm level in the eastern half of the unit outside the feature was excavated first, leaving the feature intact. After the intact feature was documented through a sketch map and photographs, the feature was bisected, and the upper 10 cm of the eastern half soil of the feature was removed. A portion of the feature fill was set aside as a sample for flotation, and the rest was screened for the presence of artifacts. This process was repeated for the second 10-cm level outside of the feature and then inside the eastern portion of the feature. By the end of the second 10-cm level, the feature had disappeared. The profile of the feature was not distinctive. The excavation process was repeated on the western side of the unit, outside the feature and then inside the feature in 10-cm levels.

Feature 1 consisted of a roughly circular cluster of FCR measuring approximately 60 cm in diameter. The northwestern corner of the TU also contained two fragments of FCR from the same elevations as the feature and two other FCR fragments to the east of the feature which may also be associated. The upper elevation of the cluster was approximately 50 cmbs or 60 cm below datum (cmbd), while the lower elevation was approximately 64 cmbs. The feature comprised 20 to 25 larger cobbles and 20 to 30 small fragments. A few clumps of baked clay were found within the feature, but the soil within the feature did not differ significantly from outside of the feature. Photo 3.1.

Photo 3.2. Feature 1 in Process of Excavation Feature 4: Feature 4 was originally observed as a concentration of charcoal, ash, and baked soil in the west wall of BHT 10 at approximately 84 cmbs. A 1 by 1-m TU (Unit 2) was established over the feature, with the west wall of the BHT creating the east wall of the TU. A vertical datum was established at 10 cm above the surface. The upper 50 cm of overburden was removed mechanically, and hand excavation began at that level. Only the eastern half of the unit was excavated, and the fill was screened through 1/4-inch mesh. No cultural material was recovered from the levels above 90 cmbd. One clump of baked soil was recovered from between 90 and 100 cmbd. The fill around the feature was excavated in 5-cm levels, but no artifacts were present. The feature measures approximately 45 cm from north to south by 25 cm from west to east. Charcoal samples were removed for radiocarbon dating and plant identification. Excavation was terminated at 110 cmbd, and the feature was covered with several layers of material for preservation. Further investigation of this feature was recommended. Mercado Site (41TR203) 34 July 2019

Feature 5: Feature 5 was initially observed in the west wall of BHT 11 as a cluster of FCR at approximately 55 cmbs. A 1 by 1-m TU (Unit 3) was established over the feature after the upper 25 cm of overburden had been mechanically removed. A vertical datum was established at 10 cm above the surface. Only the eastern half of the unit was excavated. The upper 30 cm of fill was removed quickly in 10-cm levels and screened through 1/4-inch mesh, but no cultural material was recovered. At approximately 65 cmbd (55 cmbs), the cluster of FCR was exposed. Some charcoal and baked earth were observed in association with the FCR. Two bone fragments were also recovered from the soil matrix between 65 and 75 cmbd. A sample of feature fill was removed for flotation analysis. No evidence of the feature was found below 75 cmbd (65 cmbs). Photo 3.5. Feature 5 in Process of Excavation Mercado Site (41TR203) 36 July 2019

Feature 6: Feature 6 was initially observed as a cluster of FCR with smears of charcoal and baked earth in the floor of BHT 2 at approximately 115 cmbs. A 1-x-1-m TU (Unit 4) was established over the feature, and a vertical datum was established at 10 cm above the surface. Due to space constraints, the unit was aligned parallel to BHT 2 rather than to the cardinal directions. The crew carefully removed matrix from around the visible FCR and then from around mussel shell, bone, and areas of baked earth and charcoal, leaving as much cultural material in place as was possible. Matrix was screened through 1/4-inch mesh, and all cultural material found in the screen was collected. Between 122 and 130 cmbd, 41 individual articles were mapped and collected as point- plotted items. Mapped materials included FCR, mussel shell, bone fragments, baked earth, and charcoal. The bone fragments recovered were relatively fragile and tended to break apart easily during excavation. At 130 cmbd, very few artifacts were still present in the unit, and no artifacts were present below 134 cmbd. The feature extent, which was difficult to determine when the excavation unit was established, proved to encompass the northwest, northeast, and southeast quadrants of the excavation unit; very little material was present in the southwest quadrant. The feature appeared to represent a discard pile of food remains and cooking debris (FCR, ash, and charcoal). The FCR did not appear to reflect the kind of pattern that would be expected of a hearth or oven feature. Mercado Site (41TR203) 37 July 2019

Feature 7: BHT 10 was expanded in order to determine whether additional features similar to Feature 4 might exist nearby. The presence of one or more similar features in the immediate vicinity of Feature 4 would support the hypothesis that Feature 4 represented a structural support post. The backhoe was used to remove overburden to the east of Feature 4, and at approximately 90 cmbs, just over 2 m east of Feature 4, three amorphous clusters of charcoal were exposed. The largest of the three charcoal clusters was roughly circular in outline, measured approximately 9 cm in diameter, and was labeled as Feature 7. A sample of charcoal from this cluster was removed for radiocarbon dating. No other cultural material was observed in association with Feature 7, but the charcoal clusters may indicate the presence of the remains of one or more posts. The feature was covered with several layers of material before the trench was backfilled. Further investigation of Feature 7 was recommended. Photo 3.8.

Feature 8: Feature 8 was originally observed as a lens of FCR and mussel shell in the east wall of BHT 2 at approximately 20 to 30 cmbs, immediately below the plow zone. A 1 by 1-m TU (Unit 7) was established to the east of BHT 2, and the same vertical datum used for Unit 1 was also used for Unit 7. The feature consisted of a cluster of FCR with small amounts of charcoal and baked earth. Several mammal bone fragments were also present within the FCR cluster. The feature appears to be limited to a lens between approximately 34 and 45 cmbd. A flotation sample of feature fill was taken from each 10-cm excavation level, and samples were also taken of the soil from outside the feature. Just west of the FCR cluster and at a slightly lower elevation, were several fragments of animal bone. Fifty-six cmbs below the animal bone, the soil matrix was devoid of cultural material. This feature may represent a small hearth with a collection of discarded animal bones nearby, or it may represent an area where both FCR and animal bones were discarded. Photo 3.9.

Feature 9: Feature 9 was located in the east wall of BHT 14. The feature consisted of burned clay and charcoal in the east wall of the trench. It was noted that the feature was similar to Feature 4, which is possibly a burned post or tree root. Both features were vertical in orientation and consisted primarily of burned earth and charcoal. The charcoal within Feature 9 was not as substantial as the pieces from Feature 4. Feature 9 was also shallower, ranging in depth from 40 to 70 cmbs. Feature 9 was not excavated. The feature was covered and reburied. A small sample of the feature was collected in the event that we chose to date the charcoal or float the sample. Those samples were not analyzed. Photo 3.11.

Feature 10: Feature 10 was located in the walls and floor of the northern end of BHT 16. A dense concentration of burned rock was noted in both walls and the floor of the trench. The feature was at a depth of 20 to 50 cmbs and was still present in the floor when trenching was ceased. The density of rocks suggests that this feature may be a burned rock midden. The feature was covered and and protected for excavation during data recovery phase when an excavation block was placed at the north end of the trench. Photo 3.12.

Feature 11: Feature 11 is a mussel shell midden that was located in one of four trenches excavated on the east side of the highway, in BHT 19. The feature was originally noted as about five pieces of burned rock in the east wall of the trench, at approximately 60 cmbs. A 50-cm TU (Unit 6) was situated over the rocks and was excavated from the surface. A mussel shell midden was then located over the burned rock at approximately 45 cmbs. The shells were concentrated in the southeast corner of the TU, but the material was present throughout the 50-cm test. The feature did not appear to extend into the trench and was not present in the west wall of the trench. Feature 11 was covered for future excavation. An excavation block was intended to be placed to extend from the east wall of the trench to excavate the feature, but that block was never excavated, thus neither was Feature 11. Photo 3.13. Feature 11, Facing South 3.3.2 Geoarcheology Three broad cultural components were located at site 41TR203, which now encompasses the APE on both sides of the highway.

components were located at depths of approximately 25 to 45 cmbs, 60 to 80 cmbs, and 100 to 120 cmbs. A column sample was collected from the BHT 12 wall adjacent to Feature 6, Unit 4, and the physical properties were analyzed. The magnetic susceptibility and particle-size analyses were most indicative of potential discrete cultural occupations and the formation of a paleosol at the bottom of the profile. The magnetic susceptibility peaked at several places, namely just under the plow zone and again at the bottom of the profile (Figure 3.2). The particle-size analysis correlated more closely to the assertion of an upper, middle, and lower component; although, the textual variation is fairly minimal and indicative of a clayey alluvial flood plain. Peaks in the coarser textures are also indicative of discrete flood events that would bury and preserve archeology components (Figure 3.3). 35 40 45 50 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 Figure 3.2.

The dates are generally positioned in correct stratigraphic order from the Late Archaic period to the Late Prehistoric Period. However, some of the dates are out of sequence.

The flotation samples represent 20.65 cubic decimeters of soil matrix from six excavation units and Features 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8. All the carbonized samples were wood charcoal, 45 of which could be identified to genus or species. The trees identified were primarily box elder and cedar elm, which are typical floodplain species. The botanical study, while lacking in remains directly related to diet, such as charred seeds or bulbs, illustrated that wood charcoal was abundant and identifiable at the site. Further analysis of wood charcoal at the site would contribute to the identification of fuel types and potentially indicated changes in vegetation types, and thus climate and seasonality. 3.3.5 Faunal Remains All the animal bones collected during the NRHP testing of site 41TR203 were analyzed by Dr. Jodi Jacobson (see Appendix C). The majority of the 1,073 vertebrate bones that were analyzed were mammal, ranging from large to small, and including bison, horse, deer, antelope, pig, dog, raccoon, Mercado Site (41TR203) 47 July 2019

rabbit, prairie dog, possum, rat, and vole. The specimens were analyzed for human modification, post-depositional alterations, and age and sex of the animal. Four cut marks and one chop mark were observed, and 53 of them appear to have been burned. Evidence of post-depositional alterations include carnivore gnawing on five of the bones and varying degrees of weathering. The preservation of the faunal material was good and the remains identifiable. The presence and availability of bison and antelope are still relatively unknown in north Texas. The Fish Creek Slough site (41DL436) (see Figure 2.1) would potentially provide a nice comparison site for site 41TR203 in these regards. In addition, the presence of white-tailed deer could provide data on paleoenvironment. And finally, there is substance data concerning cooking techniques that could be derived from breakage patterns on the bones. In general, the faunal material is well-preserved and maintains a high potential to contribute to research questions regarding available resources, cooking techniques, climate, and seasonality (see Appendix C). 3.4 Recommendations 3.4.1 Archeological Site Evaluations As federal funding is involved with the proposed Project, under the Section 106 process of the NHPA, federal agencies are required to consider the impact of a project on historic properties that are included in or eligible for the NRHP. The regulations for administering the Section 106 process are contained in 36 CFR Part 800 – The Protection of Historic Properties. Under the Programmatic Agreement (PA) between the FHWA, the Texas State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and TxDOT, TxDOT has identified, initiated, and continued consultation with interested parties which includes Native American Tribes with interests in the region (36 CFR 800.1–3) Site 41TR203 was initially identified by Galindo and Lawrence (2009) as an archeological historic property potentially eligible for listing in the NRHP (36 CFR 800.4) under Criterion D. Investigators also found that the site was also eligible for SAL designation. The current investigation also recommends site 41TR203 as eligible for listing in the NRHP and for SAL designation. The NRHP nominating and evaluation criteria are listed in 36 CFR 60.4. An Mercado Site (41TR203) 48 July 2019

archeological site must possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and: A. That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or B. That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or C. That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or D. That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. Site 41TR203 is potentially eligible for listing under Criterion D of the evaluation criteria. Criterion D refers to the potential of a site to “…have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.” Critical to a site being able to provide information, and therefore, fulfill the requirement of Criterion D is the physical preservation and integrity of place of deposits and material. The investigations at site 41TR203 encountered deposits consisting of bone, mussel shell, FCR, and charcoal within three occupation zones. The organic material had a high degree of preservation. Radiocarbon dates that were obtained from the original intensive surveys and NRHP testing show that these occupations occurred during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (see Appendix A). This site has the potential to address research questions regarding changes in subsistence strategies from the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods in north-central Texas, particularly on sites along the West Fork of the Trinity River. The site would also qualify as a SAL according to the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas (TAC, Title 13, Chapter 26), as the property is situated on state-owned property. Furthermore, the site may qualify for formal designation as a SAL under 13 TAC 26.10 (subpart A(1). Similar to the NRHP evaluation criteria, the Texas Antiquities Committee uses one or more of the following criteria when assessing the appropriateness of official landmark designation, and/or the need for further investigations under the permit process: 1. The site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information; Mercado Site (41TR203) 49 July 2019

2. The site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site; 3. The site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history; 4. The study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; and/or 5. The high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and official landmark designation is needed to insure maximum legal protection, or alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site cannot be protected. The site has potential to qualify under Criterion (1), as the site has potential to provide significant information about prehistoric subsistence and paleoenvironment. The site has potential to qualify under Criteria (2) and (3) for stratified alluvial deposits that have potential to contain preserved and intact cultural material, and the observed high degree of faunal preservation is rare at most Texas archeological sites, respectively. In addition, the site has potential to qualify under Criterion (4), as the site has potential to investigate theories on subsistence, resource procurement, and possibly intrasite patterning. Based on the fieldwork and analysis conducted, site 41TR203 was recommended as eligible for listing in the NRHP and formal designation as a SAL. aci consulting proposed that the ROW contains an archeological historic property (36 CFR 800.16(l)(2)). Therefore, the proposed undertaking would have an adverse effect on archeological historic properties (pursuant to Stipulation VII of the First Amended PA among the FHWA, TxDOT, Texas SHPO, and ACHP Regarding the Implementation of Transportation Undertakings [PA-TU]). The Project merited data recovery investigations in compliance with the Memorandum of Understanding ([MOU] 43 TAC 2.24(f)(4)(A)) between TxDOT and the THC. Data recovery excavations at site 41TR203 commenced the following winter. Mercado Site (41TR203) 50 July 2019

4.0 CHAPTER 4 – RESEARCH DESIGN By: Julie Shipp The Mercado site (41TR203) was determined to be NRHP and SAL eligible because of its potential contribution to north-central Texas archeology. In particular, site 41TR203 is significant in that there are discrete, well-preserved Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components within the top 1.5 m of alluvium on the West Fork of the Trinity River. Few sites of this type have been excavated; thus, the site provides the opportunity to investigate these periods within the Upper Trinity River Basin, and how subsistence strategies may have changed throughout the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods. The data recovery excavations conducted in February, March, and June of 2014, confirmed the contextual integrity of the site, and the amount and types of data collected provide for a productive data recovery investigation. After fieldwork was completed, geoarcheological investigations were conducted (see Chapter 6), 39 radiocarbon dates were obtained (see Appendix A), and the AUs for the investigation were defined. 4.1 Analytical Units The AUs are comprised of the four main occupations identified through peaks in microartifacts (B, E, G, and L), with the addition of five of the ephemeral occupations (C, D, J, K, and M) for which there is excavation data. However, this makes for eight AUs rather than nine, because Occupations B and D were combined to create AU 1, and Occupations K and L were combined to create AU 6 in Block C. Occupation J stands on its own as AU 5. In addition, Occupation E was split into two separate AUs due to the discrepancy in radiocarbon dates and depths below datum. The AUs are numbered 1 through 8 from the top to bottom of the profile (Table 4.1). Chapter 7 outlines the occupations and the depths of the AUs. Mercado Site (41TR203) 52 July 2019

Not all AUs are present within each block, and the thickness varies between blocks. This is in part due to the exercise of creating AUs that match the excavation data, while also correlating with the occupations derived from the geoarcheological data and, in most cases, increasing the width of those occupations. The variation between AUs in different blocks is also due to the horizontal expression of the site, such as the topography at the time of occupation and the location of activity areas. The cultural data recovered from each AU further defines the nature of each unit. The AUs are evaluated in relation to the excavation zones, in that they date to three primarily different periods throughout the occupations of the Late Holocene. The cultural features and artifact types that are present within each AU reflect apparent changes through time in subsistence strategies and possibly the intensity or duration of the occupations. AUs 1 through 3 date to the Late Prehistoric period, with a radiocarbon date range of 1530 to 930 yr Cal BP. AU 1 contained a burned rock midden. AU 2 contained a simple hearth feature. AU 3 is characterized by small hearth features and faunal material. AUs 4 and 5 are radiocarbon dated to an apparent Late/Transitional Archaic period (1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP) that is characterized by mussel shell middens and few other artifacts. AUs 6 through 8 are Late Archaic occupations (2760 to 2145 yr Cal BP), and this lower portion of the site is composed of a sheet midden with abundant mussel shell, burned rock, lithics, burned clay, and faunal material, including bison.

4.2 Research Design The site provides the opportunity to investigate settlement patterns and subsistence strategies within the Upper Trinity River basin in north-central Texas and how those strategies may have changed throughout the Late Archaic period. The research questions were approached from a Historical Ecological perspective. Historical Ecology is a general theoretical framework that focuses on human relationships with a particular environment over the long term and considers the landscape as a part of human ecology. This approach provides a practical context in which to combine archeology with ecological studies and allows for humans to both affect and be affected by ecology rather than simply being set into the backdrop of a static environment (Balée 1998; Crumley 1994a, 1994b). The Historical Ecological approach is well-suited for the study of hunter-gatherer behavior at site 41TR203, because it relies on the subsistence data. The primary archeological assemblages from the site are faunal remains and FCR; only a handful of lithic artifacts have been recovered. However, the botanical remains extracted from the soil are also an important contribution to a balanced perspective on the broad-spectrum diet and subsistence strategies employed by Late Archaic hunter-gatherers in the Upper Trinity River Valley (Ferring and Yates 1997). The Historical Ecology approach is also relevant because of the repeated occupations of the site. The late Holocene landscape was evolving from both natural and cultural processes during these episodic occupations by humans. The ecology of the site certainly changed over the course of the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, and data from site 41TR203 suggest a Late/Transitional Archaic period in the region, which remains poorly defined. This Research Design includes the five main topics of 1) Paleoenvironment; 2) Regional Chronology; 3) Subsistence Strategies; 4) Lithic Technology; and 5) Geoarcheological Analysis of Burned Earth. Each topic heading contains completed analyses and research questions that were addressed. Mercado Site (41TR203) 54 July 2019

4.2.1 Research Topics 4.2.1.1 Paleoenvironment The Late Archaic period is marked by numerous fluctuations in climate (Abbott 2011; Ferring and Yates 1997). Human adaptations are often related to creating stability in an unpredictable and suddenly changing climate (Butzer 1982; Rosen 2007), and a significant amount of climate data has been compiled for the Late Holocene in north-central Texas (Ferring 1994; Ferring and Yates 1997). However, much work remains to be done in Texas to create linkages between climate and the availability of resources for prehistoric peoples and the subtle variability with which these relationships changed temporally and spatially (Abbott 2011). The climate data from site 41TR203 assist in refining our understanding of the nature of the climate from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods, which also provided information about the seasonal use of the site and insight into the continued use of the site during this time, including the apparent periods of abandonment between occupations. Stable Carbon Isotopes Stable carbon isotopes analysis is an invaluable tool for which to measure changes and identify patterns in environmental fluctuations. There are a few other sites in the Upper Trinity River Valley where stable carbon isotopes have been reviewed, but most of these studies are incomplete compared to the profile at site 41TR203. The existing data from these sites do, however, reflect a climate shift around the same time, despite some variations (see Chapter 6). Additional paleoclimate work remains to be done in order to help refine the climate shift in the region during the Late Archaic period. Site 41TR203 was a good candidate for this due to the wide chronological range in sample dates and good preservation at the site. Stable carbon isotope research questions include the following: 1. Were there any major climate shifts that occurred near the end of the Late Archaic? 2. What is the pattern of shifting C3 and C4 faunal and floral specimens? Does the pattern correlate with the AUs at the site? 3. Do the climate shifts and C3/C4 patterns at site 41TR203 correlate to other contemporary sites in the region?

Sedimentation Rates Frederick and McKee (see Chapter 6) used 33 radiocarbon dates from both feature contexts and microartifact samples in each of the blocks (A through C) at site 41TR203 to produce a composite age-depth model that reflects the sedimentation rate. Models for each profile were produced by using radiocarbon ages that were calibrated according to a published radiocarbon calibration curve, standard deviations, and depth measurements. The age-depth models were calculated, making the sole assumption in each case that the sediments were deposited with the oldest deposits at the bottom and youngest at the top. The 95 percent confidence interval (CI) of the age-depth model and the probability distributions of each sampled date were then plotted and an image file created (see Chapter 6: Figure 6.12). This method allowed for the sedimentation rates of each of the profiles to be compared. Research Design questions included: 1. Do sedimentation rates correlate with occupations? 2. Does the sedimentation at the site reflect a steady deposition, or were there variations in flood plain aggradation rates? 3. What is the relationship between the paleosol and AUs 6 through 8? Did the slower sedimentation during this period affect the context of the cultural material, and to what degree? 4. Are the variations in sedimentation rates attributed to rainfall, channel migration, channel incision, or a combination of these factors? 5. What are the post-depositional disturbances? 6. Do sedimentation rates correlate with the other environmental data? Faunal Analysis Faunal bone preservation at site 41TR203 is considered exceptional because out of 8,346 vertebrate specimens, 7,265 (87%) were identifiable to class (see Chapter 8). Even so, the vertebrate remains at the site lack the diversity to provide detailed data on fluctuating climate. However, there is a clear distinction in the assemblages from the upper and lower portions of the site, which reflect a change in C3 and C4 environments. In addition, bison are only present in the lower portion of the site. Some questions regarding paleoenvironment that the faunal assemblage can address are: Mercado Site (41TR203) 56 July 2019

## Page 88

1. What are the differences between the faunal assemblages from the upper portion (AUs 1 through 5) and the lower portion (AUs 6 through 8) of the site? 2. Do the changes in faunal assemblages indicate changes in C3 and C4 plants? 3. What are the results of the stable carbon isotope analysis on the rabbit specimens? Do they correlate to the other isotope subsets? Mussel Shell Mussel shell is an excellent proxy indicator of paleoenvironmental factors. Species identification of mussel shell can reveal where habitat shell was harvested from, i.e., the nature of the local water source. The stable carbon isotope analysis on the mussel shell provides data regarding the environmental changes at the site during the eight described occupations. Environmental data from the mussel shell should help to address such questions as: 1. What are the changes in temperature and rainfall in AUs 1 through 8? 2. What is the nature of the river over the course of the site’s occupations? 3. Do the shifts in mussel species correlate with changes in C3 and C4 plants? 4.2.1.2 Regional Chronology The Mercado site is located in the Upper Trinity River Basin, which begins at the northern end of the Trinity basin, from the headwaters of the four branches of the Trinity River, the Clear Fork, the West Fork, the Elm Fork, and the East Fork, down to the southern end of Dallas County. Significant comparable sites within the Upper Trinity River Basin that contain Late Archaic components were identified, and the archeological assemblages compared with those at 41TR203 in an attempt to further refine the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods in north-central Texas. The goal is to compare the Mercado site with the other sites in relation to research topics of paleoenvironment, subsistence strategies, and geoarcheological burned earth analysis. Radiocarbon Dating In order to compare site 41TR203 with other Late Archaic sites in the Upper Trinity River Basin, additional radiocarbon samples were collected from all features and from within all defined cultural zones to refine the chronology at the site (see Appendix A). Radiocarbon dating is especially Mercado Site (41TR203) 57 July 2019

important given the paucity of diagnostic artifacts recovered from the site. Research questions regarding radiocarbon dating included: 1. What are the date ranges for the AUs? 2. Do these ranges match other sites in the region for Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations? 3. Are there date ranges in the AUs for cultural periods that have not been previously defined? 4.2.1.3 Subsistence Strategies Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups returned to site 41TR203 to procure and process resources for more than 1,500 years. However, while it is clear these activities were taking place, the resources that were being exploited and the way they were processed may have shifted according to seasonality, climate, or as a result of human adaptation in the form of technological innovations that occurred throughout the site’s occupational history. Considering how subsistence strategies shifted or remained static at site 41TR203 over time has the potential to provide important insight into the lives of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric peoples living in north-central Texas. Previously recorded sites located along the West Fork of the Trinity River do not typically contain many lithic artifacts, and this is the case at site 41TR203. However, in the absence of large quantities of lithic artifacts, data pertaining to subsistence strategies can be ascertained through other methods of analysis, particularly through the analysis of floral and faunal remains. Floral and faunal remains, both of which are found at macro and micro scales at site 41TR203, were used to identify what resources were procured and processed at the site over time. Additionally, the excavation and analysis of burned rock cooking features provided information about how these resources were being processed. 1. What were the resource opportunities at the site in addition to mussel shell and hardwood? 2. Did the available resources differ between occupations? 3. During what seasons was the site inhabited? 4. Did the seasonality change from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric? Mercado Site (41TR203) 58 July 2019

Faunal Analysis Faunal remains were the most abundant artifacts recovered at the site. Of these, the diversity was limited with a predominance of bison and deer in AUs 6 through 8. The recovery of bison remains at site 41TR203 is interesting given that, to date, the degree to which bison was a part of the Late Archaic people’s subsistence strategy in this region of north-central Texas is not yet well defined (Peter and Harrison 2011). Excavations at site 41DL203 identified bison remains in scant quantities within all observed Late Archaic components; however, at site 41TR198, located approximately 3.4 km (2.1 mi) downstream from site 41TR203, no bison remains were identified within the Late Archaic assemblage (Peter and Harrison 2011; Tinsley and Dayton 2011). Bison availability may have been a factor, but the faunal assemblage at nearby site 41TR203 contained a significant number of bison as well as white-tailed deer. Zooarcheological studies conducted during the data recovery phase were designed to determine species variability, human subsistence strategies, taphonomic processes, and cultural use of bone. The faunal analysis was conducted by Dr. Jodi Jacobson. Research design questions posited by Shipp and Jacobson include: 1. Do the changes in faunal assemblages reflect changes in C3 and C4 ecosystems? 2. Are there a significant number of bison remains? 3. How does the number of bison compare to other open-prairie-style species? 4. Do grassland changes appear to have affected the presence of bison? 5. Do any of the specimens exhibit cut marks? 6. Do the cut marks or other data indicate the animals were butchered on site or were they brought in from elsewhere? 7. Do the various species reflect a broad-spectrum diet? 8. Does the faunal material reflect a specialized use of the site? 9. Does the assemblage suggest seasonal occupation of the site? If so, is there a change in seasonality in the AUs? 10. Do the concentrations of faunal remains reflect different processing activities? 11. Is there evidence of bone grease processing? 12. Were some of the rock features used for boiling bones to produce bone grease? Mercado Site (41TR203) 59 July 2019

13. Was the site near the kill sites of the animals and used as an initial processing site, or does the evidence suggest a post-processing site? Does this differ between AUs? Mussel Shell Mussel shell was present within all AUs at the site and was by far the predominant artifact category in AUs 4 and 5. This phenomenon is addressed in regard to resource availability and climatic factors. The shell itself is proxy climate data and may be utilized for stable carbon isotopes, but this analysis was not conducted. Mussel shell that represents a non-repetitive element was identified to the lowest taxon possible (often species in well-preserved assemblages). This reveals the mussel community structure harvested. Using the program UNIO by Robert Warren, the riverine habitat the shell was harvested from was estimated. When possible, shell lengths were measured as a proxy for age, enabling species-specific age histograms to be generated. Depending on the stratification of the assemblage, potential harvest pressure through time can be assessed by evaluating shifts in the age structure. While identifying the shell, signs of burning, raccoon predation, and tooling were also noted. By quantifying the shell, the relative abundance of the mussel community being harvested can be determined in addition to the likely habitat of the river from which these mussels were collected, and potentially, the harvest pressure on this mussel community. Approximately 23 percent of the total mussel shell assemblage was analyzed by Traci Popejoy, who was guided by the sampling strategies of Woo et al. (2015) and Cambell (2017). Research questions that she sought to address include: 1. Are the mussel species in AUs 4 and 5 different than the other AUs? 2. Is there tooling evidence on the shells? 3. Were the shells harvested on a regular basis? 4. What was the riverine habitat the shells were collected from, and did it change between AUs? 5. Do changes in stable carbon isotopes correlate with changes in grassland types? Mercado Site (41TR203) 60 July 2019

Botanical Remains The botanical analysis was conducted by Dr. Leslie Bush. No charred seeds were recovered, only wood charcoal and two charred bulb fragments. The research questions regarding botanical remains and subsistence strategies are: 1. What plants were processed at the site? 2. What type of wood was burned as fuel in hearth features? 3. Are these wood types present in the modern vegetation? 4. What types of vegetation were located at the site throughout the Late Archaic occupation to the Late Prehistoric occupation, and do these differ? 5. Do the plants reflect seasonal use of the site? 6. How does this floral assemblage compare to other regional sites? Burned Rock Features Rock features were the most common feature type at the site and ranged from small basin hearths to burned rock middens. The ways in which people were processing plant and animal resources using burned rock features provide insight into subsistence strategies beyond simply identifying what resources were being exploited. The rock features potentially provide information concerning what level of effort and innovation went into processing the resources and help further our understanding of plant and animal processing in this region during the Late Archaic period. Burned rock feature analysis focused on questions such as: 1. What types of resources were processed in each feature? 2. What types of burned rock features are present? 3. What sorts of scenarios occurred to create the archeological remains? 4. Were both plants and animals processed at the site in these features? 5. Are some of the rocks boiling stones? 6. Are the rock features typical of other Late Archaic rock features both inside and outside of the region? 7. Do rock sizes indicate feature use? Mercado Site (41TR203) 61 July 2019

4.2.1.4 Lithic Technology The amount of lithic material recovered from the Mercado site was sparse, as is the case with most of the sites in the region during these periods. However, there were lithics recovered from all AUs, including 11 projectile points. The lithics were analyzed according to TxDOT protocols. Research questions regarding lithic material include: 1. Are there distinct lithic assemblages within each AU? How do they vary? 2. What types of stone tool are present within each AU? 3. What types of raw material were being used? 4. What percentage of the lithic material was heat-treated? 4.2.1.5 Geoarcheological Analysis of Burned Earth As mentioned above, the geoarcheological investigations involved defining the alluvial stratigraphy (including the Pilot Point Alloformation), creating an age-depth model that defined the sedimentation rates in each excavation block, analyzing microartifacts, and defining 13 main and ephemeral occupations. Other geoarcheological analyses involved soil micromorphology and stable carbon isotopes. The latter subtopic was addressed above in the paleoenvironment section. The results of the soil micromorphology indicated that some of the pieces of burned earth were mixed with sand and burned elsewhere from where they lay. Thus, the burned earth was not burned in-situ, but rather altered elsewhere and dropped at or near the location of excavation. Burned Earth The analysis of the artifact assemblage of the materials recovered by the excavation of 41TR203 identified two morphological variants of burned clay in the artifact assemblage: 1) platy fiber impressed fragments; and 2) irregular rounded objects. The geoarcheological study (see Chapter 6) documented three forms of burned earth: 1) in-situ thermal rubified rims associated with thermal features; 2) small fragments of burned earth presumed to have been detached from the baked earth of thermal features (presumably scatted by cleaning out hearths and other features); and 3) platy, apparently sand-tempered objects. The first two categories are thought to be related and were noted in the soil micromorphological analysis (see Chapter 6, Figures 6.26 and 6.22) as well as in the Mercado Site (41TR203) 62 July 2019

microartifact study. The last category, platy burned objects, was incidentally sampled by a micromorphological sample from Feature 20, Unit 28. Although it was not apparent that the latter was a fiber-impressed burned object, the appearance of this material in thin section indicated that it was not incidentally fired site matrix material, but rather contained considerably more sand, and was most likely a sand-tempered earthen object of some form. Research included: 1) background research; 2) documentation of the burned earth assemblage in basic terms; 3) characterization of the materials using various analytical methods, specifically using thin section petrography and computer tomography; and 4) experimental replication and subsequent analysis of resulting objects in a manner similar to that used to characterize the burned earth artifacts.

5.0 CHATPER 5 – FIELD AND LABORATORY METHODS By: Julie Shipp 5.1 Field Methods The field methods for the date recovery were based on the findings of the NRHP testing. The site was originally recorded as two sites during the survey phase, including site 41TR202 on the east side of the highway and site 41TR203 on the west side of the highway. During testing, it appeared that the cultural occupations were contemporaneous, and the smaller investigated area on the east side of the highway (41TR202) was incorporated into the site boundary of 41TR203. The largest concentration of cultural material on the west side of the highway that was located during NRHP testing was the focus of data recovery excavations. The deposits appeared as at least three occupation zones in between sterile deposits; thus, a general excavation method was outlined in the field with TxDOT archeologists in an attempt to maximize time and effort and avoid excavating numerous unit levels in sterile clay. It was the consensus that mechanical excavation be employed in between occupations. 5.1.1 Excavation Blocks Both mechanical and hand excavation were employed to investigate site 41TR203. The plow zone, which was estimated to be the upper 25 cm of sediment, and the previously identified zones lacking features and substantial cultural evidence (estimated as 15 to 20 cm in thickness) were removed by mechanical excavation. The sterile levels were scraped in layers within the entire excavation block before the hand excavations commenced at Zones I through III. The locations for the hand- excavated units were determined based on the locations of known features or occupation surfaces encountered during NRHP testing. The original permit research design plan was to hand excavate two levels per occupation zone, or approximately six levels per 1 by 1-m unit in Excavation Blocks A through D, and six levels in Block E near Features 4 and 7. The approximate total of hand excavations of cultural zones was proposed at 348 levels, or 34.8 m3, and up to 40.8 m3. However, as excavations unfolded, it became apparent that Zones I and II consisted primarily of discrete, scattered features, rather than dense occupation surfaces, and in some cases were not two levels thick. Excavation units that were not Mercado Site (41TR203) 65 July 2019

used to define feature boundaries, such as mussel shell or burned rock middens, were not hand-excavated, particularly because the units were not abundant in artifacts; these levels were mechanically scraped. The use of careful mechanical excavation also improved efficiency and helped to meet deadlines without the loss of data-rich features. This change in methodology was discussed and approved verbally in the field by TxDOT archeologists on March 5, 2014. Block A, a 4 by 4-m excavation block, was placed between BHT 3, where Feature 2 was located, and BHT 2, where Features 1 (an FCR cluster in Zone 2), 6 (FCR, mussel shell, and bone in Zone 3), and 8 (FCR, mussel shell, bone, and burned earth in Zone 1) were located (see Chapter 7 and Figure 7.1). Block B, a 4 by 4-m excavation block, was placed at the north end of aci consulting’s BHT 16, where Feature 10 was exposed at 25 cmbs (see Chapter 7and Figure 7.1). Feature 10 is a burned rock midden that was observed in the trench floor and extended into the east, west, and north walls. The feature was not excavated during the testing phase because of time constraints. The excavation block was centered over the north end of BHT 16, encompassing Feature 10. Block C, a 4 by 4-m excavation block, was placed west of the south end of aci consulting’s BHT 11 (see Chapter 7 and Figure 7.1), where Feature 5 (a cluster of FCR, baked earth, and charcoal at 55 to 75 cmbs) was exposed and partially excavated. Block D, located on the east side of I-35W, was not excavated due to lack of time (see Chapter 7 and Figure 7.2). Rather, aci consulting expanded the geoarcheology trench to investigate the densest occupations identified during the excavations. To maximize the area investigated, the THC supported the use of additional exposures with limited hand excavation. An emphasis was directed toward detecting, recording, and sampling features. Ten 50-cm shovel tests were excavated in a checkerboard-type pattern on alternating sides of the trench. The shovel tests within the geoarcheology trench expansion resulted in the recording of nine additional features. Block E, located in the southern part of the site, was re-opened to explore the possible post features discovered during the previous testing phase (see Chapter 7 and Figure 7.3). Features 4 and 7 were relocated, as were two additional possible posts, designated Features 22 and 23. The four post features appeared to be in an arc pattern of an approximate 4.5-m radius. Although these features appeared to possibly represent a prehistoric structure that had burned, the nature of the features was Mercado Site (41TR203) 66 July 2019

still questionable. No substantial lenses of cultural material were observed in the sediments above these features, suggesting that the occupation surfaces found in other portions of the site do not extend this far south. Thus, mechanical scraping of about 80 cm in this area was utilized to reach the top of the cultural zone at which time the 1 by 3-m excavation block. An expedited radiocarbon sample was sent for analysis during the field investigations. The results of the analysis revealed Feature 23 was modern (Beta 375548). With concurrence from TxDOT and the THC, further investigation of Block E was abandoned, and no further excavations were required in the block. This was devised to maximize the area for data recovery. Between June 9 and June 17, 2014, aci consulting archeologists conducted further data recovery investigations at site 41TR203. In the original scope of work, it was proposed that between 34.8 and 40.8 m3 of deposits would be hand-excavated. The total amount of hand excavations when aci consulting originally left the field was 23.8 m3, which was an insufficient amount to meet the excavation requirements for the THC permit. The THC required at least an additional 5 m3 of Zone III be excavated. Thus, Block F was opened west of the geoarcheological trench that had been excavated by Charles Frederick. Zone III in that block was represented by only an ephemeral signature of the sheet midden, and it was decided to open an approximately 7.5 by 14.5-m block on the west side of the geoarcheological trench, which included the entire area in the center of the site between the previous excavation blocks and the geoarcheological trench. A total of 5.5 m3 of Zone III was hand-excavated in 23.5 units within Block F. Twenty-three 1 by 1-m and one 1 by 0.50-m excavation units were opened in various small blocks throughout Block F over potential features that had been exposed during scraping (see Chapter 7 and Figure 7.1). 5.1.2 Backhoe Trenching One 17-m-long by 1-m-wide trench was machine excavated for geoarcheological purposes from the south end of Block A to the north end of Block C (see Chapter 7 and Figure 7.1). TxDOT in consultation with aci consulting decided the focus of the investigataion should shift to the center of the site, on the west side of the highway where the geoarcheological trench was situated. It was determined the trench would be extended to the west by an additional 2.4 m, for a total width of 3.4 m, and 15 50-cm test pits were hand-excavated across the floor of Zone III, 5 of which sampled features. During the subsequent field visit by TxDOT and the THC on March 18, 2014, it was further suggested that a sample across the floor of Zone III be taken at 50-cm intervals.

revision in methodology was suggested to save time and to gather as much feature data as possible with the time remaining. The work at the trench was to be equivalent to the 54 levels that were planned for Block D. TxDOT and the THC approved the above-mentioned approach and change in effort via email correspondence with aci consulting on March 20, 2014. 5.1.3 Excavation Procedures A Sokkia Total Station was set up over the main site datum established during the NRHP testing, which was given the point N 1000 E 3000, elevation 100. A 5-m grid was staked out across the site. A single vertical datum, relative to the elevation of the site primary datum, was established for each excavation block. Prior to excavation, beginning elevations and photographs were taken. Shovel skimming was the primary excavation technique, with some troweling in instances where a finer provenience is required, as in the case of feature excavation. Excavation levels were 10-cm thick and were screened through 1/4-inch (6.35 millimeter [mm]) hardware cloth. An excavation level form was completed for each 10-cm level. A sketch plan view map of the level floor was drawn, and the floor was photographed. All artifacts were collected, including FCR, burned earth, daub, lithics, bone, and shell, and were placed in bags and labeled by unit and level provenience. Artifacts larger than 3 cm found in-situ were plotted, as well as concentrations of pieces of burned earth and pedogenic features. The top and bottom elevations were taken for mapped feature artifacts. A feature form was completed for each feature (see further detail below). All in-situ charcoal was collected from excavation levels and features, then piece-plotted on field record maps (see further detail below). Artifacts smaller than 6.35 mm were recovered from the flotation processing of bulk soil samples; the methodology for this is presented below. Additional documentation and records included a daily journal maintained by the Project Archeologist, excavation unit and feature forms, plan view and profile sketches of unit floors and features, excavation block and trench wall records, photograph logs, field specimen logs, and sample specimen logs. 5.1.4 Sampling Bulk soil samples were collected from each hand-excavated level. The bulk soil samples were taken in 5-cm increments from the southwest corners of all 1 by 1-m excavation units. This resulted Mercado Site (41TR203) 68 July 2019

in two bulk samples per 10-cm excavation level. Each sample is approximately 10 by 20 by 5 cm in size and result in about 1 liter in volume. The samples chosen for analysis were determined based upon the excavation results (i.e., which samples provided the most valuable data for addressing the proposed research questions). The majority of the samples used were from features. A minimum of one 2-liter sample from each feature was collected. An additional 24 bulk samples were collected from the control trench (BHT 25) located along the northern margin of the site. The trench was opened and a 20 by 10-cm bulk soil sample column was collected in 5-cm increments to approximately 120 cmbs. These samples served as control samples for comparative analysis. Additionally, column samples were taken from Blocks A through C at 5-cm intervals during the geoarcheological analysis. Samples collected for Accelaerator Mass Spectometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating were primarily those from charred plant material. As mentioned, radiocarbon samples were collected in-situ from excavation levels and features. The samples were collected in a way to avoid contamination by hand touching. Samples were placed in aluminum foil and wrapped to avoid crushing of the specimen. The sample bags were labeled with the appropriate provenience information, numbered in sequence with a specimen number, and logged on the specimen sample form. Carbonized samples were not collected from the screen. The samples selected for submission were chosen after an inventory of the samples had been completed. Floral and faunal materials were also chosen for AMS dating. 5.1.5 Feature Excavation All burned rock hearths and middens were exposed to their full extent during the block excavation and mapped in plan view. Features were bisected and excavated in controlled 10-cm levels to expose the feature profiles. All corresponding 1 by 1-m units containing feature materials were excavated in depth, simultaneously. Any artifacts or burned rock that was encountered during feature excavation was initially pedestaled. At the base of each level, photographs were taken and exposed artifacts were mapped in place. Additionally, top and bottom elevations for all sizable artifacts and burned rock were recorded using the control vertical datum. Following documentation, all artifacts and burned rock were collected and bagged for further analysis. Once the base of the feature was reached, the profile was drawn and photographed. The other half of the feature was treated the same way. All of the feature back fill from burned rock hearths and middens Mercado Site (41TR203) 69 July 2019

was collected unless the feature size made total collection impractical. In such instances, a 25- percent sample of the feature was collected. Feature forms were used to document and describe all feature attributes including size, shape, depth, artifacts present, matrix descriptions, and degree and type of thermal alteration. 5.1.5.1 Burned Rock Features Burned rock hearths and middens were recorded with the possible cooking technologies and scenarios in mind. Attributes of the features that were recorded include the length, width, outline, cross-section, rock shape, rock count, rock density, feature coherence, fine matrix, and charcoal. The nature of the deposits surrounding the feature was also recorded. Collection of these attributes aided in the interpretation of these often complex but informative cooking features (Ellis 1997). 5.1.5.2 Mussel Shell Middens All complete mussel shell and fragments of shell including the umbo were collected to determine the minimum number of individuals. Shell fragments, not including umbos, were counted and noted on the excavation level forms but not collected. 5.1.5.3 Concentrations of Burned Clay or Daub Burned clay or possible daub features were treated like other features and recorded in detail, with samples collected from the burned areas as well as adjacent sediment matrix for thin section comparisons. Larger portions (approximately 10 cm in size) of burned clay features were collected for further analysis in the lab. 5.2 Laboratory Methods Artifacts and samples collected in the field were bagged by material or sample type and recorded on a Lot Record Form in the field laboratory. The field bags were transported to the aci consulting laboratory in Austin, Texas. The laboratory staff inventoried the artifact bags, prepared the artifacts or samples for in-house analysis or transport to specialists for study, and prepared artifacts for curation at TARL.

5.2.1 Inventory Artifacts and samples were assigned lot numbers based on provenience. Lot numbers were assigned in the field laboratory, and lot information was recorded on a lot record inventory. Artifacts were stored and then transported to the aci consulting laboratory in Austin, Texas in large plastic bins. After arriving at the laboratory, all artifact bags were accounted for and the lot record was entered into the electronic Microsoft Access database created for the testing phase at site 41TR203. The database has since been converted to Microsoft Excel. 5.2.2 Cleaning and Sorting of Artifacts Once in the laboratory, artifacts were cleaned and re-bagged as necessary. This involved washing or brushing. Cleaning methods were determined on a case-by-case basis in part by the preferences or requirements of the artifact analysts. Once the artifact bags were cross-checked with the field records and electronic database, artifact bags were sorted into analytical categories. These analytical categories were initially based on material types. Further into the analysis, samples of artifacts were chosen for special studies. 5.2.3 Analysis Techniques FCR was sorted in the aci consulting laboratory before being sent to a studies specialist. Soils, faunal, lithics, mussels, botanical material, and burned earth were analyzed in the laboratories of the special studies scientists. 5.2.4 Fire-cracked Rock FCR was subject to a basic analysis in the aci consulting laboratory. The rocks from features were sorted and charted by size, from 1 to 15 centimeters. FCR was then transported to Dr. Richard Thompson Stark for further analysis. Data was analyzed from the following domains of relevance: size-longitudinal axis (mm), weight-scaled measurements (grams), weights per feature, weights per AU, cumulative weights, presence/absence of vugs, fractures descriptions (polygonal, curvilinear, dendritic, hackly, steppe), plan view photos/illustrations of refit joints, color (cortex/core) (Munsell values integrated describing the cortex and profile), refit analysis limited to within features, and general vertical distribution of FCR.

5.2.5 Lithics Lithics from the data recovery investigations of site 41TR203 were analyzed by Dr. James W. Karbula according to TxDOT lithic analysis protocol in the PaleoWest laboratory. 5.2.6 Faunal The faunal material was analyzed to the highest taxonomic level possible, or to the approximate size of the animal at a minimum. The specimens were counted for the number of identified specimens (NISP) and minimum number of individuals (MNI) when possible. The faunal specimens were examined for rodent gnawing, evidence of burning, fracturing, and butchering marks. Paleoenvironmental data was also obtained from the faunal material. The faunal analysis was conducted by Dr. Jodi Jacobson, formerly of TRC Solutions, Inc. 5.2.7 Mussels Mussel shell was counted for the NISP. MNI was not calculated for mussels due to the degree of fragmentation. Because of this, only whole mussel shells or those that at least retained the umbo were collected. The mussel analysis was conducted by Traci Popejoy, PhD Candidate at the University of Oklahoma. 5.2.8 Botanical The bulk samples selected for analysis underwent flotation processing in the aci consulting laboratory. A 60-gram subsample of the soil was removed prior to flotation for possible soils and microbotanical analysis. These samples were not utilized. The light fractions of the flotation samples were sent to Dr. Leslie Bush for analysis. 5.2.9 Burned Earth The burned earth was treated to a basic analysis in the aci consulting laboratory. These artifacts were weighed and examined for distinguishing features, such as fiber impressions. Dr. Charles Frederick conducted further analysis on the burned earth.

6.0 CHAPTER 6 – GEOARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS By: Charles D. Frederick and Arlo McKee This chapter presents the results of geoarcheological investigations of the alluvial deposits exposed at site 41TR203. Using data derived from analysis of the bulk physical properties, soil micromorphology, microartifacts, and radiocarbon dating, this work presents a stratigraphic framework for the data recovery in archeological excavations. 6.1 Setting Archeological site 41TR203 is situated on the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity River, immediately west of I-35W and south of Northside Drive in Fort Worth, Texas. Today, the site lies adjacent to the north bank of the river, but prior to channelization in the mid-20th century, the West Fork of the Trinity River was considerably more sinuous and only closely approached the site on the northwest (Figure 6.1). The site resides about halfway between the 1915 Trinity River channel and the northeast valley wall, defined by the outcrop of the Lower Cretaceous undivided Pawpaw Formation, Weno Limestone, and Denton Clay (BEG 1972). The soil mapped at the site by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is Frio silty clay, 0-1 percent slopes, occasionally flooded (Ressel 1981). The Frio soil series is classified as a fine, smectitic, thermic Cumulic Haplustoll and is described as forming within “very deep, well- drained, moderately slowly, permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium” (National Cooperative Soil Survey 2015). The type section for the Frio series exhibits an A-Bk profile where the A-horizon is divisible into four parts and is about 1 m thick. 6.2 Alluvial Stratigraphy The cultural deposits at the site lie within the Pilot Point Alloformation of the Trinity River. The Late Quaternary alluvial stratigraphy of the Trinity River has been described by Ferring (1994, 1990), and the Pilot Point is one of seven unconformity-bounded (or allostratigraphic) units identified by Ferring. A suite of 32 radiocarbon ages are cited by Ferring (1994: 51–52) for this deposit, and these indicate deposition of the Pilot Point Alloformation occurred in the middle to late Holocene between approximately 4500 and 500 yr Cal BP.

Although the thickness of the Pilot Point is not explicitly stated by Ferring (1994), examination of the measured sections he documented provides some impressions. In the flood basin facies, the deposit is generally between 1.5 m and 3 m thick (e.g., 3 m at the Aubrey Site; 1.6 m at site 41CO144-J), whereas in the near channel meander belt facies it is much thicker, often in excess of 6 m (e.g., 6.1 m at 41CO144-C; > 6 m at 41CO141-NC1). The alluvial architecture (or three-dimensional arrangement of the alluvial deposits) identified by Ferring suggests that for the majority of the Holocene, the floodplain of the Trinity River has been vertically aggrading, depositing each allostratigraphic unit directly upon the previous one in a layer cake manner. This has resulted in the Pilot Point Alloformation being the surficial deposit of the floodplain in most places, although in proximity to the modern channel, it is often buried by a thin (<1 m) veneer of the Recent Alluvium. As a result, numerous archeological studies have encountered the Pilot Point Alloformation. In fact, it is relatively uncommon for such studies of the Trinity River floodplain to expose any deposit older than the Pilot Point. Although a number of different alluvial depositional facies have been described for the Pilot Point Alloformation, Ferring mentions only one soil formed within it, which he named the “West Fork Soil.” This soil sometimes occurs as the surface soil on the floodplain, and in other places as a paleosol where it has been buried by sediments associated with the youngest alloformation, the Recent Alluvium. This soil is present toward the top of the Pilot Point, and the top of this soil is the upper boundary of this alloformation where it has been buried by recent sediments. The period of formation of the West Fork soil is noted by Ferring (1994:59) to be somewhat variable. A cumulic or pachic variant is described as having “formed on floodplains between ca. 4.5 ka and the present,” whereas “a facies of the “West Fork soil” formed along meander belts as the rate of lateral migration of channels slowed between ca. 1.5–1.4 ka” and this soil is found adjacent to modern meander belts often buried by Recent Alluvium. Following Ferring’s work, several archeological studies have determined the age of the West Fork Soil by direct radiocarbon dating of soil organic matter, charcoal, and in some instances, mussel shell. Some, such as Hall et al. (2011), have suggested that the formation of this soil in flood basin settings is a shorter duration than Ferring advocates for the cumulic version and longer than the lateral migration variant. Specifically, Hall et al. (2011) argue that the West Fork Paleosol on the Clear Fork of the Trinity at 41TR170 was formed between 2300 and 1000 yr Cal BP and represents Mercado Site (41TR203) 77 July 2019

a wet meadow soil that was buried by channel rejuvenation associated with the onset of the Mediaeval warm around 1000 years ago. Other studies (e.g., Skinner et al., 2005; Skinner et al. n.d.) have noted the presence of multiple stacked buried soils within thick sections of the Pilot Point Alloformation, but the origins of such exceptional occurrences are still relatively poorly understood. Given that thick deposits of the Pilot Point principally occur within meander belt environments, it is likely that multiple buried soils within thick deposits of the Pilot Point occur near the rear of meander belts and at the edge of the flood basin environments, and that the location and age of such occurrences are controlled by local depositional factors such as distance from channel, height of surface above the channel, threshold of overbank sedimentation, as well as regional climatic factors (see discussion in Frederick et al. 2006). In order to more objectively assess the age of the West Fork soil, we compiled a sample of radiocarbon age determinations obtained for this soil by various archeological studies, including the work by Ferring (1994) and the work done as part of this Project (Table 6.1 presents the list of dates and sources below). This list, which consists of 40 age determinations from work done prior to this study, is not intended to be comprehensive and does not include work done on small tributaries of the Trinity River. When the results of this study are included, the total increases to 74 dates. The resulting dates were then calibrated and compiled into aggregate sum probability distributions, which are shown in aggregate form on Figure 6.2 and by site on Figure 6.3.

Plots in red are from this site, the West Fork Soil (top 65 cm of the profile) and the Paleosol (below 100 cm). The results provide a much clearer image of the age of the West Fork Soil/Paleosol. In the aggregate, the age of the West Fork Soil using all samples returns a mean and standard deviation of 1531±159 yr Cal BP and spans the period between approximately 4000 and 250 yr Cal BP with the majority falling between 700 and 2400 yr Cal BP. If the results of this Project are excluded, the age is 1662±784 yr Cal BP. As can be seen on Figure 6.3 the age of the West Fork Soil varies considerably between sites.

A control trench was also excavated off site. From each block excavation and the trench, a profile was drawn and described. These profiles are illustrated on Figures 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6. A similar profile was observed in each of these exposures, and a composite stratigraphic profile for the site is provided on Figure 6.7, and a general description is provided on Table 6.2. The site deposits are divided into two basic groups: 1) Upper Pilot Point, which comprises the upper meter of the excavations; and 2) the Lower Pilot Point, which consists of deposits below 1 m. The top approximate 60 cm of the Upper Pilot Point exhibits a distinct soil, which is identified as the West Fork Soil. The entire exposed section of the Lower Pilot Point has been altered to form a soil as well, and this feature is here termed the Paleosol. The site excavations did not expose the top of the next older alloformation, the Sanger, and cores Mercado Site (41TR203) 82 July 2019

Figure 6.11. Depth Variation in Sediment/Soil Physical Properties of the Deposits within the Control Trench In general terms, the deposits show little textural variation with respect to depth. Block A contains more sand than the other profiles and exhibits a slight upward coarsening in the top 40 cm and a similar but less pronounced trend within the paleosol. The cores examined by Osburn et al. (2005) note a coarsening of the Pilot Point from southeast to northwest at this site, and this is generally consistent with the trend observed within the block profiles. But it is fair to say that there is little textural variation within the deposits overall. All three excavation block profiles show subtle but clear magnetic susceptibility enhancement of the West Fork Soil and the Paleosol, and this is most notable with respect to the ACk horizon that separates them, which exhibits notably lower low frequency magnetic susceptibility values. All the profiles exhibit clear visible evidence of organic enrichment of the West Fork Soil in the upper 60 cm of the profile and the Paleosol, but laboratory analysis of organic carbon content fails to show a clear organic enrichment of the Paleosol, which is perplexing, given the clear melanization of this deposit that was visible in the field (see Figure 6.7). Calcium carbonate content is low within the West Fork Soil and the Paleosol, and varies inversely with respect to the magnetic susceptibility, as one would expect if the variation in calcium carbonate is related to soil formation. But Ferring (1994:116) notes that the vertical variation of calcium carbonate within the Pilot Point Alloformation is an artifact of depositional control, stating that, “Soil formation was pronounced when deposition rates slowed and when finer sediments were deposited; the finer sediments had lower initial carbonate content, resulting in a vertical carbonate distribution similar to that in a Mercado Site (41TR203) 90 July 2019

profile in which a soil had formed.” In other words, Ferring argues that the decrease in carbonate within the West Fork Soil is due to deposition of less carbonate-rich sediment rather than pedogenesis and dissolution by meteoric water (i.e., rainfall). First, there is no correlation between particle size and calcium carbonate content (Pearson product moment correlation coefficient of r = 0.1890), but a weak negative correlation between low frequency magnetic susceptibility and calcium carbonate (Pearson product moment correlation coefficient of r = -0.3513). There is a reasonable necalgative correlation between organic carbon and calcium carbonate (Pearson product moment correlation coefficient of r = -0.4729), indicating that deposits with the greatest organic carbon have the lowest calcium carbonate content, which is what would be expected if the carbonate content was affected by leaching by meteoric water. Hence, despite the anomalous absence of organic matter enrichment within the Paleosol, the other physical attributes are consistent with both the West Fork Soil and the Paleosol as pedogenic features. It is interesting to note that the Paleosol also corresponds with a period of slower sedimentation that occurred between approximately 2600 and 2050 yr Cal BP (see age-depth model discussion below). In regard to magnetic susceptibility, it was noted previously that both the West Fork Soil and the Paleosol appear to exhibit magnetic susceptibility enhancement. But in addition to this, the magnetic susceptibility plots all three block profiles illustrate one or more discrete anomalies, and comparison of these with the microartifact data indicates that each one is attributable to an occupation. In Block A, there is a single discrete rise in magnetic susceptibility between 40 and 50 cm that directly corresponds with the major occupation in the Zone I excavation slice, whereas in Block B, there is a prominent peak in magnetic susceptibility at 20 cm that directly corresponds with the uppermost occupation and specifically a peak in fragments of micro-burned earth. In Block C, there are two small discrete peaks in the magnetic susceptibility curve, one at 20 cm, which corresponds with a peak in small FCR, and another around 50 cm, which directly corresponds with the major occupation within the top of the Zone II excavation slice. Hence, it appears that the broad trends in magnetic susceptibility are of a pedogenic origin, but the abrupt changes are anthropogenic. 6.4 Age-Depth Model and Sedimentation Rate In order to better understand the age structure of the deposits, the radiocarbon dates from each of the blocks (A through C) were analyzed to produce an age-depth model that reflects sedimentation Mercado Site (41TR203) 91 July 2019

on the site. This included 33 radiocarbon dates that were analyzed from both feature contexts and microartifact samples. The age-depth model was produced using the Bchron package in R Studio (Parnell 2014; R Core Team 2014). The Bchron package was developed for the task of studying sedimentation rates in aggrading settings that typically reflect relatively continuous sedimentation, such as lacustrine settings. Settings with pauses in sedimentation can cause difficulties. The methods that the Bchron package uses to produce an age-depth model have been fully presented by Haslett and Parnell (2008) and Parnell, et al. (2008) and are only briefly reviewed here. Models are produced by first inputting raw radiocarbon ages, standard deviations, and depth measurements. The ages are then calibrated according to a published radiocarbon calibration curve. In the case of site 41TR203, intcal13 was used (Reimer et al. 2013). The calibrated age probabilities are then calculated for each measured sample in the profile and assigned to that sample depth. An age-depth model is then calculated using the calibrated age-depth probability distributions to simulate potential ever-increasing paths through the profile. This is to state that the only assumption that the model makes is that the sediments were deposited with the oldest deposits at the bottom and youngest at the top. The model is left to iterate through 10,000 ever-increasing random paths, and the probability occurrence of the iterated paths is used to estimate the parameters of a Poisson-Gamma distribution for each depth in the core. The 95 percent CI of the age-depth model and the probability distributions of each sampled date are then plotted and output to an image file (Figure 6.12) Mercado Site (41TR203) 92 July 2019

Figure 6.12. Results of the Age-depth Calculations from Blocks A–C Figure 6.12 shows the differences in each profile calculation and the final aggregate age-depth model using all profiles on the right. Notice the numerous age reversals have resulted in the age- depth calculation following the path of greatest probability and allowing for both younger and older dates to be incorporated in the upper 50 cm of the profile. This method allows for the sedimentation rates of each of the profiles to be compared. Although each block contained a comparable stratigraphic profile, there were differences in age-depth projections for the upper portion of the profile that varied by up to 500 years. The results, shown in the three panels on the left side of Figure 6.12 suggest that this is likely a function of the numerous age reversals present in each profile. These reversals become compounded when combining dates across the site. The majority of the reversals occur in the range between approximately 20 and 60 cm. Additional turbation was evident in the analysis of the microartifact samples in the upper 30 cm of the profile (discussed below). Following examination of the age-depth models for each block, it was concluded that the most reliable approach was to aggregate all the radiocarbon ages for the site and use the combined data set to compile an age-depth model for the entire site, and this plot is shown on the right side of Figure 6.12.

The principle advantage of using this method is that it facilitates estimating the age of unsampled locations of the profile with associated uncertainties. These data are therefore useful for assessing temporal variations in sedimentation rate at the site (Figure 6.13 and Table 6.3) and estimating the probable age of the different occupations (discussed below in the Microartifacts section). Visual inspection of the simplified age-depth plot suggests that the sedimentation rate at the site has varied through time, between periods of relatively rapid sedimentation (e.g., ~2700 to 2600 yr Cal BP [15.75 cm/century], ~2040 to 1880 yr Cal BP [13.44 cm/century], ~1450 to 1200 year Cal BP [9.87 cm/century], and ~620 to 460 yr Cal BP [4.27 cm/century]) and periods of slower sedimentation (e.g., 260 to -2040 yr Cal BP [5.28 cm/century], ~1880 to 1450 yr Cal BP [3.24 cm/century], ~1200 to 620 yr Cal BP [2.12 cm/century], and ~460 yr Cal BP to present [0.7 cm/century]). Hence, the West Fork Soil, which generally occupies the upper 60 cm of the site, appears to be attributable to a period of slow sedimentation that occurred after 1200 yr Cal BP (although the earliest phase appears to also encompass a period of more rapid sedimentation between ~1500 and 1200 yr Cal BP). Interestingly, the Paleosol, which occurs at the site at depth below a meter, appears to be formed during a period of slower sedimentation that occurred between 2600 and 2050 yr Cal BP.

6.5 Microartifact Analysis A single 20 by 20-cm column of bulk sediment samples was collected at 5-cm increments from one wall of excavation Blocks A, B and C, and from the control trench. These samples were subsequently disaggregated with sodium hexametaphosphate, wet-sieved through a 1-mm sieve, and then dried. The dried residues were then passed through 2- and 4-mm sieves, and the cultural material from each size fraction (1 mm, 2 mm, and 4 mm) was separated by type (specifically debitage, burned rock, burned earth, mussel shell, charcoal, bone, and Historic artifacts) then counted and weighed. A total of 11,737 microartifacts were identified for a combined weight of 1,625 grams (g). The results of this work are presented graphically by count on Figures 6.14, 6.16, 6.18, and 6.20 and by weight percent on Figures 6.15, 6.17, 6.19, and 6.21. These data were then used in conjunction with drawings of the excavation block walls from where the columns were collected to identify the stratigraphic position of the various occupation zones. 6.5.1 Occupation History as Inferred from the Microartifact Data A close examination of the depth distribution of the cultural material recovered by the microartifact columns suggests that there are about 13 prehistoric occupations at the site during the last 2,700 years and were designated A through M. Four of these occupations appear, on the basis of ubiquity within the microartifact columns, to represent significant presence within the block excavations, and they are B (Late Prehistoric, ~1100 to 600 yr Cal BP), E (Late Prehistoric, ~1400 to 1350 yr Cal BP), G (Transitional Archaic, ~1730 to 1470 yr Cal BP), and L (Late Archaic, ~2585 to 2300 yr Cal BP). In the following discussions and data presentations, the presumed occupations are referred to in depth below surface rather than elevation, primarily because the relative depositional position is better captured by depth for occupations which exhibit subtle slopes. For instance, an occupation surface that is dipping within a large stratigraphic unit may consistently have the same depth below surface but be represented by different elevations owing to the sloping surface. As previously noted, the deposits at the site appear to represent relatively continual sedimentation throughout the last 2,700 years, although the sedimentation rate appears to have varied slightly through time. Most of the prehistoric occupations appear to exhibit fairly discrete depth profiles, which when viewed in light of the sedimentation rate, imply fairly good contextual integrity. Two places in the profile, however, present exceptions to this generalization: 1) the plow zone (top 30 or 35 cm); and 2) the lowest occupations (L and M, ~110 to 135 cm).

The presence of Historic age artifacts to a depth of about 35 cm suggests that plowing dispersed historic materials downward into sediments that were originally deposited in the Late Prehistoric, between 500 and 1,200 years ago, and most likely dispersed Late Prehistoric cultural material upward. Prehistoric materials were noted above 30 cm in all three block excavations, and some of these materials exhibited peaked depth distributions; however, it is not clear if these represent discrete occupations with integrity or the depth frequency is merely are an artifact of Historic dispersion of prehistoric remains by the plow. The most significant and widely dispersed occupation is L (and possibly M), that was the subject of the Zone III excavations in each block. This occupation is thicker than most, and different artifact classes exhibit peaks at slightly different depths, which to the conclusion that this “single occupation,” which is estimated to have occurred between 2585 and 2300 yr Cal BP, may represent a surface with more time averaging than most, and really be the result of multiple short stays over a long period of time. Between the base of the plow zone and Occupation L, the microartifact data suggests that the site was repeatedly occupied between ~2250 and1200 yr Cal BP, but only two of these appear to have been significant (E and G). Most of these occupations are represented by very small artifact occurrences and either are occupations for which the blocks are on the edge of the occupation surface or very short duration stays. The nearly continuous presence of these occupations (when observed as depths on Table 6.4) may be due to a too literal interpretation of the microartifact depths. In addition, some of the occupations represented as “distinct” events in different blocks may be the same event owing to small scale vagaries in sedimentation.

The prehistoric occupations that appear to be present are listed on Table 6.5. Prehistoric materials exhibit a broad but distinct peak between 10 and 20 cmbs, with charcoal, bone, mussel shell, lithics, and FCR all peaking in this portion of the profile. This peak is separate from a smaller but discrete occurrence of charcoal, mussel shell, lithics, and FCR at the very top of the Zone I excavation slice at 30 cmbs. The main occupation within the Zone I slice is located between 40 and 45 cm and is represented by elevated amounts of bone, charcoal, burned earth, lithics and FCR. Between the Zone I and the Zone III excavation slices, there is a very subtle increase in charcoal, bone, burned earth, and lithics at 60 cmbs, and in lithics, mussel shell, and Mercado Site (41TR203) 98 July 2019

burned earth between 75 and 80 cmbs. There is a subtle increase in fine charcoal and bone near the top of the Zone III excavation slice at 95 cm; however, the main prehistoric expression in this excavation slice is between 110 and 115 cm and is represented in the microartifact column by peaks in all artifact classes. The fact that the frequencies rise to the base of the column suggests that the microartifact column was not deep enough to bracket this entire occupation. Table 6.5.

as 15 cm. There appears to be a shallow occupation that has been dispersed upward, the peak of which is probably right at the top of Zone 1 around 15 to 25 cm, which consists of FCR, burned earth, and a few lithics and mussel shells. The south wall profile exhibited a clear component around 40 cmbs (D), but in the microartifact data this is very subtle, with minor peaks in bone fragments and burned earth. A much more pronounced occupation is present immediately below this around 45 to 55 cm, denoted by discrete level of mussel shell, burned earth and FCR, and in the south wall profile this occupation was a nearly continuous line of mussel shell. A very small peak in burned earth and medium and small bone fragments between 60 and 65 cm may represent an occupation (H?) as well, but this was not noted in the south wall profile nor represented by other artifact classes. A few isolated flakes of microdebitage were observed between excavation zones II and III (cf. 75 to 80 cmbs, 95 cmbs), but these were not associated with any other artifact classes and may be occupations not well represented in Block B. Within the Zone III excavation strip there is a very pronounced occupation that appears to between 115 and 125 cm, represented by every artifact class. The thickness of this occupation zone suggests that it may be more than one occupation that occurred in a relatively short period. The final occupation within the Block B column is present at the very base of the Zone III excavation, around 135 cmbs, and is represented by increases in small and medium bone fragments and one FCR.

as well as around 20 cm, and mussel shell around 20 cm. The first clear relatively undisturbed prehistoric presence is present around 30 to 35 cmbs, represented by small but consistent amounts of charcoal, burned earth, and FCR. This suite of occupation debris does just overlap with the lowest Historic materials and it is possible that this occupation surface is the source of some of the prehistoric cultural material within the plow zone. There is a prominent occupation between 55 and 70 cmbs near the top of the Zone II excavation window, which is represented by FCR, lithics, burned earth, and mussel shell. A second component appears to be present near the base of the Zone II excavation, around 75 to 85 cmbs, consisting of small but apparently discrete increases in mussel shell and lithics. Burned earth does not show a bimodal distribution within the Zone II excavation, but rather a broad smear peaking around 60 to 65 cm and trailing off gradually, and the presumed occupation around 75 to 80 cm is within the tail of this distribution. Between the Zone II and Zone III excavations there are two isolated occurrences that may represent occupations. The first is a small peak in mussel shell around 95 cm, and the second is a small peak in burned earth that peaks at 105 cm. Within the Zone III excavation slice, there is a prominent occupation near the top of the block, between 110 and 125 cmbs, represented by every artifact class, but the peak depth varies by material. This variation may indicate that this occurrence is actually more than one occupation. At the very base of the Zone III excavation there is a rise in charcoal, bone, mussel shell, and lithics which appears to represent another occupation surface. Table 6.7.

Samples collected for micromorphology consisted of oriented blocks carved from the excavation walls/floors that were then wrapped in toilet tissue and masking tape, and subsequently dried, embedded in polyester resin under a vacuum, then slabbed on a rock saw. The block samples were first dried at low temperature (50˚C) in a convection oven then embedded in polyester resin under a vacuum when less than 15 cm long. Larger samples were not vacuum-embedded. Samples were first unwrapped then placed in a plastic container and the provenience and orientation information transferred to the new sample container. Then the embedding medium, a 7:3 mixture of unpromoted polyester resin and styrene mixed with a small amount of methyl ethyl ketone peroxide catalyst, was added to the container up to the upper edge of the sample but with care not to completely immerse the sample. The sample was then placed in a vacuum desiccator and placed under a vacuum with a vacuum pump. After a few minutes, the vacuum was released, and more resin added if necessary, then once again placed under a vacuum. This procedure was repeated about four times, after which the sample was removed from the desiccator and resin once again added to nearly, but not completely, cover the sample. The next day, the samples were completely immersed in polyester and allowed to cure for about a week. Once the polyester set, samples were placed in a low temperature (50˚C) convective oven overnight to completely harden the polyester. The samples were then slabbed with a rock saw using mineral oil as the lubricant. Slabs were subsequently scanned on a flatbed scanner, the locations for thin sections selected, and the position then drawn on a print of the slab. The thin section blanks were then cut from the slabs using a water-cooled trim saw, immediately dried, labeled, and notched for orientation. The seven prepared blanks were then submitted to HD Analytical Solutions, Inc. (London, Ontario, Canada) for thin section manufacture. Upon completion the prepared 2 by 3-in (51-x-76-mm) thin sections were scanned at 1000 dpi using transmitted light on a flatbed scanner and an 8.5 by 11-in color print made. The enlarged prints of the slides were examined for features of interest, and the thin sections were then examined at low magnification on a Leica S8APO binocular microscope equipped to permit transmitted polarized light microscopy. The lowest magnification on the S8APO permits viewing a 1-cm-wide area of the slide, whereas the highest magnification provides a 1.5-mm-wide field of view. High magnification examination was performed on a Leica DMEP polarizing light compound microscope. Photomicrographs of samples were collected using a Leica Mercado Site (41TR203) 106 July 2019

DFC280 digital camera using Leica Firecam 3.0 software. Description of the samples follows general guidelines provided by Bullock et al. (1985) and Stoops (2003). 6.6.1 Block B, Zones II and III Two samples were collected from the south wall of the Block B excavations including one from Zone II and one from Zone III. The sample from Zone II yielded a single slide that was centered on visible occupation materials, specifically a mussel shell and a fragment of burned earth. Examination of the slide revealed the presence of strong subangular blocky to weak prismatic structure and a chamber microstructure. The sample exhibits an open porphyric related distribution with a small amount of fine sand set in a silty clay matrix, and overall the deposit exhibits a c/f ratio of 20:80 with a limit of 0.1 mm. The ground mass is light brown in plane light and exhibits a speckled b-fabric in cross-polarized light. About 1 to 2 percent of the slide consisted of small (0.25 mm thick) calcium carbonate coats lining pores. The cultural material on this slide consists of one large item (a mussel shell) and a single rounded aggregate of burned earth. No large charcoal fragments are present, but there are numerous very small (0.02 to 0.05 mm) fragments scattered across the slide, with the greatest concentrations observed with fecal pellets (worm casts; see bottom right panel on Figure 6.22). The sample from Zone III shows a similar pattern, except there small cultural materials are dispersed across 10 cm of sediment with no obvious occupation surface or even clear concentrations. Although worms are incapable of moving large artifacts, they are capable of dispersing small materials <1 to 2 mm in diameter and may also bury and concentrate larger items by bioexhumation.

dispersed charcoal. The passage feature on the right (labeled YPF) is presumably younger, and still retains a porous, and dispersed fecal microfragments. Other passage features are visible on this image, and it is likely that much of this fine matrix has been reworked by worms on more than one occasion. 6.6.2 Floor of Block A A single block was collected from a patch of burned earth that was exposed on the floor of Unit 28, between 130 and 140 cmbd, in Block A, Zone II excavation. In the field it was anticipated that this was part of an in-situ thermal feature (such as a thermal reaction rim that might be associated with a fire kindled on a flat surface), but the thin section revealed that this interpretation is incorrect. The location of the sample within the excavation unit is shown in the top left portion of Figure 6.23, and a photograph of this object prior to collection of the sample is shown in the top right portion of Figure 6.23. After the block was embedded and slabbed, it became apparent that the burned objects in question had very sharp lower boundaries (see Figure 6.23, bottom left). This is inconsistent with in-situ thermal oxidation rims under heated features, which are typically clear to gradual. Examination of the thin section revealed that the burned objects in question, which were about 23 mm long by 8 mm tall, consist of a mixture of fine to medium sand and silty clay similar to the site matrix, resulting in a close porphyric related distribution and a c/f ratio of 60:40. The sand fraction is composed of approximately 60 percent quartz and 40 percent carbonate rock fragments. The sand and fine material are poorly mixed together, with distinct patches of each clearly visible. The fragments exhibit a subtle horizontal fabric parallel or slightly subparallel with the long axis of the fragments. The fine portion of the matrix is a reddish-brown color in plane light, and the carbonate rock fragments all appear gray, consistent with exposure to heat. Mercado Site (41TR203) 109 July 2019

(highlighted in a thin black line). Rectangles A and B are locations of photomicrographs shown on Figure 6.24. None of the site matrix contains anywhere near this much sand (Figure 6.24, top half), and this fact, considered together with the abrupt edges (especially the bottom edge) of these objects suggests that they represent sand-tempered silty clay that was subsequently burned and dropped onto the occupation surface. They were not fired here in this location, but it is not clear if this object was fired intentionally or accidentally, but the fact that they exhibit oxidized colors throughout, as opposed to the carbon core typically associated with ceramics, suggests that they were fired in a high-temperature freely oxidizing thermal environment different from most prehistoric ceramics. It is probable that this object (or objects) was made of clay mixed with sand to check cracking of the smectite-rich clay. Burned objects similar to this were observed at site 41DL203 (Tinsley et al. 2011:111–117), except there were more prominent fiber impressions on one side and they were fired a higher temperature, as indicated by the fact that the clays had started to sinter. Following experimentation designed to try and replicate them, it was concluded that the most likely origin was a mud plastered thatch roof. The objects here (at site 41TR203) were not fired at as high of a temperature as the ones observed at site 41DL203, but some of the burned earth objects from this occupation do have fiber impressions. It may be worth a closer look at some of the fiber-impressed objects during a later phase of the analysis. Apart from the burned objects, the deposits beneath Feature 20 were typical for the site. These sediments exhibit a prominent 15 to 17-mm-wide prismatic structure that parts to 5 to-10 mm subangular blocky structure and has a chamber to channel microstructure. The open porphyric-related distribution consists of a small amount of fine sand set in a silty clay matrix, and overall the deposit exhibits a c/f ratio of 20:80 with a limit of 0.1 mm. The ground mass is light brown in plane light and exhibits a speckled b-fabric in cross-polarized light. There appear to be about 5 percent of pores with relatively thick (0.25 mm) coats of calcium carbonate (see Figure 6.24, bottom two photos). Several clear, weakly coalesced and porous passage features consistent with worm bioturbation were observed, and many others that have subsequently coalesced into a dense matrix are suspected given the number of arcuate edges observed across the slide.

A single large micromorphology block was collected from Feature 24, and it was embedded in two parts as it naturally parted along ash in the upper third of the block. Three thin sections were made from this block (Figure 6.26, panel 1). Although the site notes do not clearly state an interpretation of this feature, it is most likely that this feature was an in-situ hearth that consisted of a layer of ash and charcoal, overlying a thick (~15 cm) reddened thermal reaction rim that formed in the earth beneath the fire. The cross-section of the feature suggests the reddened reaction rim was slightly more than 10 cm thick, but the slabs made from the embedded blocks suggest it was closer to 15 cm thick, and as such is very thick for such a feature. Uncharacteristically, the slabbed polyester embedded block from this feature was, in some ways, more interpretable than the thin sections, as many of the features clearly visible in the block were often difficult to resolve in the thin sections. The dominant attribute of this block was intense reworking of the fine-grained matrix by soil mesofauna, specifically worms. Owing to the dramatically different color and composition of the feature deposits, the degree of faunal reworking is much more readily observed here than in the dark grayish brown matrix that dominates the occupation away from the feature. Bi-directional movement of the fine earth matrix is apparent in all three thin sections made from this block. The upper-most thin section sampled vestiges of the ash and rubified earth, and it is clear that there was once more ash in the upper part of this feature, and much of it has been dispersed by fauna, both up and down from its original location. The intact fragments of ash show minor reworking by fauna (in the form of inclusion of small rounded fragments of burned earth within the ash) (see Figure 6.26, panels 3 and 4), whereas the slides from the lower portions of the rubified reaction rim reveal an intimate mix of burned earth and redeposited ash. Although it is difficult to estimate with confidence, it appears that more than 75 percent of this feature has been reworked by worm bioturbation. This is representative of the degree of post-depositional bioturbation within the deposits at the site, and it is abundantly clear why there are no sedimentary structures preserved within the deposits. There are few clues as to how hot this feature became, but one fragment of burned earth located in the vicinity of the ash in the upper part of the block was partially vitrified (see Figure 6.26, panels 5 Mercado Site (41TR203) 113 July 2019

and 6), suggesting that this feature was quite hot at some point. Of course, the depth of the reaction rim would also point to this as well, although it is unclear to what extent thermal saturation (the period of time at elevated temperature) may be responsible for the very thick reddened zone under this hearth.

Figure 6.27 shows the results from the four profiles analyzed with respect to the estimated ages of each sample. The results are also shown plotted by depth below surface on Figures 6.8 through 6.11. The overall trend from site 41TR203 is for a slight increase in organic carbon from C4 plants from the start of the record around 2700 yr Cal BP to about 1900 years ago. With the exception of one sample from the Control Trench at depth, the maximum contribution C4 plants observed occurs around 1900 yr Cal BP at around 48 percent Carbon from C4 plants. After this point the trend shifts toward a decreasing contribution in C4 to minimum values of approximately 20 to 25 percent at the top of the site. This shift can be modeled in all profiles as a second order polynomial that suggests a maximum C4 concentration at 1897 yr Cal BP. This regression explains over 80 percent of this variation at the site (Figure 6.28). Mercado Site (41TR203) 116 July 2019

Figure 6.28. Linear Regression from Each Dated Profile at Site 41TR203 Using data from site 41TR170 (Figure 6.29), a nearly identical trend in carbon isotopic signature is 3 identified (Hall et al. 2011). The isotopic data from 41TR170 was interpreted as suggesting relative stability within the Pilot Point alluvium at near a 64 percent contribution from C4 plants. Near the top of the West Fork Paleosol, Hall notes a shift toward a community dominated by C4 species, which occurs after around 1000 yr Cal BP. The high values of δ13C were interpreted as representing a tall grass prairie vegetation within a wet meadow floodplain, with the upper shift in δ13C as representing a change to a drier climate with lower water tables, channel downcutting, and invasion of dry floodplain trees (Hall 1982, 1990; Hall et al. 2011). Although the data from site 41TR203 does not compete with this interpretation, it can be seen that this shift occurs much earlier and at a more gradual pace than was described at site 41TR170. In fact, main difference in the dataset from sites 41TR170 and 41TR203 is a shift in δ13C values of approximately 2.8 per mil and a slightly older record at site 41TR203. The shift in absolute δ13C values may be explained by the fact that site 41TR203 occupies a lower position in the valley below the major confluence of the Clear Fork and West Fork, while site 41TR170 is positioned over 5 mi upstream from this confluence along the Clear Fork Trinity River. The data from site 41TR170 can also be fit with Mercado Site (41TR203) 118 July 2019

nearly an identical regression equation with an apex at 1937 yr Cal BP and an R2 suggesting that the regression explains over 85 percent of the data. If we take these regressions at face value, then it is possible to state that this shift toward a drier climate is present as a regional signature beginning at around 2000 yr Cal BP. Figure 6.29. Four Recent δ13C Studies from the Upper Trinity River Valley Notice the similarities between site 41TR170 and potentially site 41TR198, which may be reflective of a regional climatic signature. In contrast, the results from two lower-order tributaries of the East Fork (sites 41DL203 and 41COL172) are reflective of highly localized variations. A regional δ13C signature is not so clear when compared with other studies in the Upper Trinity River Valley (see Figure 6.29). The most directly comparable site is 41TR198, which is situated along the West Fork in a similar setting as site 41TR203, with the exception that Sycamore Creek, a small tributary, has contributed sediments to the site (Peter and Harrison 2011). The isotopic signature from site 41TR198 was interpreted as a general increasing composition C3 vegetation during the period of West Fork Soil formation then very slightly drier conditions occurred after this period. However, the sampled record at site 41TR198 was much shorter than at site 41TR203, and a regression equation does not adequately fit the sample spread.

between the two sites suggests that there may be a comparable subtle shift in δ13C at site 41TR198 within the West Fork Soil, but the Recent Alluvium capping the site reflects a local signature from inputs of Sycamore Creek. Site 41DL203 is located along a medium-sized tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity River, Rowlett Creek (Frederick 2011). The analyzed δ13C at that site extends back to approximately 3100 yr Cal BP, and it shows a gradual increase of organic carbon from C3 plants from the start of the record until around 500 yr Cal BP. While the magnitude of this shift is comparable to the record at site 41TR203, the shift is much more gradual, and it begins earlier in time than at site 41TR203. Frederick (2009:102) attributed this character to pedogenic processes having more of an influence on smoothing the record rather than on reflecting the regional depositional processes. At approximately 500 yr Cal BP the record at site 41DL203 begins to swing back in favor of C4 vegetation by about 10 percent, which was interpreted as being reflective of being influenced more by a detrital, or regional, signal than by a local or pedogenic. However, given that the other sites in the comparative set do not show this shift, it seems equally likely that the Latest Holocene or Recent Alluvium would be reflective of the most localized signature. Site 41COL172 was located along Muddy Creek, a tributary of the East Fork Trinity River (McKee 2010). This stream is located highest in the watershed of the comparative sites and is consequently expected to contain the most locally variable signature. The sampled record does not quite stretch back to 1000 yr Cal BP and is very highly variable from sample to sample. Overall, there is a general trend of decreasing C4 vegetation between approximately 1000 yr Cal BP and 400 years ago and a trend back toward increasing C4 vegetation within the Recent Alluvium. This may be subtly apparent in the data, but high-frequency variation from sample to sample results in a poorly expressed regression. This general trend is similar to observations at site 41DL203 and perhaps site 41TR198, with a shift toward C4 enrichment during the past 500 years. Although Muddy Creek owes its name to its propensity for having a nearly continually saturated floodplain during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this does not appear to reflect a similar signature of a wet meadow bottomland vegetation. 6.8 Discussion The results of the geoarcheological investigations indicate that the site contains evidence of multiple short-term prehistoric occupations of the floodplain of the Trinity River that occurred a Mercado Site (41TR203) 120 July 2019

relatively short distance from the channel during the last three millennia. The deposits exposed by the site excavations represent the upper part of the Pilot Point Alloformation, which was deposited in the middle to late Holocene. A cumulic soil called the West Fork Soil generally marks the upper part of the Pilot Point, and the excavations revealed the West Fork Soil in the top 65 cm of the profile, and a paleosol below that between ~100 and 150 cm below the modern ground surface. Coring during previous phase of work (Osburn et al. 2005:44) found that the Pilot Point Alloformation here is almost 4 m thick, and they inferred that a coarser textured portion of the deposit beneath the site was deposited as a crevasse splay on a floodplain, but the depth of these deposits is more consistent with deposition within a meander belt setting. Regardless of the actual depositional environment, it is clear that the site was, at least early in its history, close to the Trinity River channel, and the presence of the Paleosol here is most likely related to the mechanics of sedimentation within or adjacent to the meander belt. Analysis of the aggregate sum probability age distributions for a sample of radiocarbon ages obtained from the West Fork Soil at other sites in the region indicates that the age of the Paleosol at site 41TR203 is consistent with the older parts of the West Fork Soil. Statistical analysis of the radiocarbon ages from the site yielded an age-depth model that permits assessing variations in sedimentation rate through time as well as estimating the age of various occupations with the site deposits. Three periods of more rapid sedimentation appear to have occurred between 2700 and 2600, 2050 and 1880, and 1450 and 1200 yr Cal BP, with slower sedimentation rates occurring between these events. The oldest period of slower sedimentation, between 2600 and ~2050 yr Cal BP appears to coincide with formation of the Paleosol. Analysis of the depth variation in microartifacts recovered from three column samples, one from each major block excavation, provide an impression of the number and age of prehistoric occupations at the site and also provide some evidence for assessing the contextual integrity of the occupations. At least 13 probable prehistoric occupations were noted in these samples, most of which appear to be relatively discrete, isolable occupations. Some of these are represented by very small amounts of cultural material, whereas there appear to be four major occupations that contain abundant cultural material. The top 35 cm of the profile exhibits evidence of disturbance by cultivation and the next to the lowest occupation appears to represent multiple occupations over a long period of time and may exhibit some evidence of overprinting.

soil micromorphology samples provided insights on several issues. Such examination of burned earth within the next to lowest Late Archaic occupation suggests that there may have been a mud plastered thatch-roofed building on the site at that time. Examination of samples collected from a hearth within the same occupation revealed that worm bioturbation has been excessive and may have contributed to the apparent compression of multiple occupations in the lowest part of the site. Finally, documentation of the depth variation in stable carbon isotopes yielded a record of past vegetation change similar to some of the previously published studies. Although the temporal inflection points between these periods here appears to vary somewhat from recently published work. It should be noted that two lines of investigation discovered during this work may be worth pursuing in more detail. First, during the picking and examination of the microartifact samples the presence of numerous small snails was noted and following from other recent investigations of Trinity River tributary deposits in this region (cf. Nickels et al. 2014), it is possible that the identification of these snails by a malacologist may provide more details on how the floodplain environment changed throughout the period of occupation. Second, the burned earth objects identified in Feature 20 (and the surrounding occupation surface), which appear to be sand- tempered mud, most likely represent mud plastered thatch associated with an ancient building that today has almost negligible archeological visibility. Detailed documentation of the burned earth objects within this assemblage (e.g., size, shape, thickness, nature of fiber impressions, and additional petrographic examination) combined with experimentation designed to better understand the origin and function of such material, similar to that performed at site 41DL203 (Tinsley et al. 2011) but specifically aimed at mud plastered thatch, may provide additional insights on the creation and structural implications of such burned objects.

7.0 CHAPTER 7 – ANALYTICAL UNITS AND FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS By: James W. Karbula, Julie Shipp, and Ruben Castillo For the purposes of this investigation and in accordance with TxDOT standards, the excavation data from site 41TR203 was subdivided for analysis into 8 different AUs. AUs are defined as distinct occupational time periods that correspond with discrete periods of human activity. The AUs were derived based on data collected during the data recovery excavations, and in particular, the geoarcheological investigations. 7.1 Data Recovery Excavations The data recovery excavations began with three 4 by 4-m blocks (A through C) (Figure 7.1). The excavations were focused on three stratigraphic zones within the 1.5-m profile that contained dense cultural material, and the deposition in between the zones was removed mechanically. Block D, located on the east side of I-35W, was not excavated due to lack of time (Figure 7.2). Rather, aci consulting expanded the geoarcheology trench to investigate the densest occupations identified during the excavations.The geoarcheological trench was excavated along the east side of the data recovery excavations, from Block A to Block C (Figure 7.1). This trench was then expanded to the west. Block E, located in the southern part of the site, was reopened to explore the possible post features discovered during the previous testing phase (Figure 7.3). An expedited radiocarbon sample form Block E was sent for analysis during the field investigations, which revealed Feature 23 was modern (Beta 375548). Further investigation of Block E was abandoned. A final excavation block, Block F, was excavated in the middle of all previous excavations (Figure 7.1). This block was opened to explore the sheet midden comprised of AUs 7 and 8. The upper portions of the profile were not excavated within Block F. 7.2 Geoarcheological Investigations Given the importance of the geoarcheological investigations in determining the AUs, the following provides a brief overview of the results of the microstratigraphic analysis authored by Frederick and McKee (see Chapter 6). Frederick and McKee’s analysis, which included bulk physical properties, radiocarbon dating, micro-artifacts, and soil micromorphology, revealed 13 identifiable occupations within a 1.5-m alluvial profile containing approximately 2,700 years of cultural deposition. The 13 occupations vary significantly in terms of length, intensity, integrity, and Mercado Site (41TR203) 124 July 2019

cultural features. Of the 13 occupations identified through microstratigraphy, 4 are substantial occupations with high quantities of cultural materials and features (B, E, G, and L). These four major occupations were identified during the field investigations and were subject to excavation at Stratigraphic Zones I through III. The remaining nine occupations (A, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, and M) were identified through the microstratigraphic analysis. These are more ephemeral and were not observed as discrete occupations in the field, although excavation data was collected for five of them (C, D, J, K, and M). Per Frederick and McKee (Chapter 6), some of the more ephemeral or minor occupation zones have “very small artifact occurrences and either are occupations for which the blocks are on the edge of the occupation surface or very short duration stays.” Thus, assigning each of the occupation zones to AUs may be a too literal interpretation of the microartifact depths, in light of other evidence, and some of the occupations represented as distinct events in different blocks may be the same event owing to small vagaries in sedimentation. The physical properties identify the soil as the Pilot Point Alloformation of the Trinity River floodplain. The Pilot Point began to form during the middle Holocene and continued until recently. The West Fork Soil has formed in the upper portion of the Pilot Point, from the ground surface to approximately 60 cmbs. A Paleosol formed during a time of exposure in the lower portion of the Pilot Point from about 100 to 150 cmbs. The cultural deposits were excavated primarily from these two soils, as depicted in Figure 7.4. Frederick and McKee used a Bchron Package to produce an age-depth model for the site. This exercise attempted to reconcile discrepancies in the radiocarbon dates in the upper 60 cm of the profile. Bioturbation was noted in the field at ground surface and in the top sections of the profile, and a distinct plow zone is present, resulting in the deposition of Historic-age artifacts up to 35 cmbs. The plow zone and bioturbation account for a significant amount of mixing in the upper portion of the profile. The model makes it easier to compare the numerous profiles at the site, and also to assign ages for portions of the profile that were not excavated (see Chapter 6).

Figure 7.4. Soil Profile (from Chapter 6) AUs are initially assigned on the basis of observed and recorded divisions of cultural content, separation in the sediments, depth below surface, calibrated radiocarbon ages, and correlated closely to the age-sedimentation model and microartifact studies. The identification of AUs is initially narrowly matched to the identified geoarcheological occupation zones, and both charcoal and sediment radiocarbon ages. The AUs, as initially identified, are comprised of the four main occupations identified through peaks in microartifacts (B, E, G, and L), calibrated radiocarbon ages, the age-sedimentation model of the landform, and correlated depths below surface of Mercado Site (41TR203) 129 July 2019

associated burned rock features, with the addition of five of the more ephemeral occupations (C, D, J, K, and M) for which there is excavation data. However, this makes for eight AUs rather than nine, because Occupations B and D were combined to create AU 1, and Occupations K and L were combined to create AU 7 in Block C (Table 7.1). Occupation J stands on its own as AU 6. In addition, Occupation E was split into two separate AUs because of the discrepancy in radiocarbon dates and depths below surface. The AUs are numbered 1 through 8 from the top to bottom of the profile. Table 7.1.

The manifestation of AUs differs in each block. Not all AUs are present within each block, and the thickness varies between blocks. The variation within AUs in different blocks is also due to the horizontal expression of the site, such as the topography at the time of occupation and the location of activity areas. The AUs are evaluated in relation to the excavation zones, in that they date to three primarily different periods throughout the occupations of the Late Holocene. The cultural features and artifact types that are present within each AU reflect apparent changes through time in subsistence strategies and possibly the intensity or duration of the occupations. AUs 1 through 3 date to the Late Prehistoric period, with a range of 1530 to 930 yr Cal BP. AU 2 contained a simple hearth feature. AU 1 contained a burned rock midden. AU 3 is characterized by small hearth features and faunal material. In AUs 1 through 3, only eight flakes and two formal Mercado Site (41TR203) 130 July 2019

stone tools were recovered. Yet, over 1,200 faunal elements were recovered from AUs 1 through 3 and were concentrated in AU 3. Faunal elements consist primarily of small, unidentified mammal bone fragments along with several positive identifications of white-tailed deer. AUs 4 and 5 date to a Transitional Archaic period (1710 to 1415 yr Cal BP). AU 4 is characterized by mussel shell middens and few artifacts (four uniface fragments, eight flakes, and 57 pieces of bone, including deer). AU 5 contained one rock midden (Feature 15) and three pit features (Features 16, 17, and 31) along with 14 pieces of debitage and 54 fauna fragments. AUs 6 through 8 are Late Archaic occupations (2760 to 2145 yr Cal BP), and this lower portion of the site is composed of a sheet midden with abundant mussel shell, burned rock, lithics, burned clay, and faunal material, including bison. The collection of stone tools and debitage from AUs 6 through 8 includes 20 stone tools, approximately 350 pieces of debitage, and nearly 6,000 faunal elements. Through detailed examination of AUs 1 through 8 (see below), it becomes apparent that site 41TR203 can be meaningfully evaluated in terms of three main prehistoric sociocultural intervals in the north-central Texas regional chronology: Late Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric. This may be best achieved by examining multiple and additional lines of archeological data, by AU, and by features and artifacts recorded within AUs, within the overall framework of the geoarcheological model. These include 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages from feature contexts, faunal and stone tool associations, depth below surface, and feature morphology within the context of the intact and nearly pristine terrace sediments, and the presence of the deeply buried paleosol (see Chapter 10). This explains in part, the observed overlap in radiocarbon ages, cultural content, feature morphologies, organics, and stone tool assemblages observed between different groupings of AUs (see below and Chapter 10). 7.3 Contextual Integrity The site maintained a high degree of contextual integrity at the time of the excavations. The sedimentation rates obtained from the age-depth model demonstrate how periods of more rapid sedimentation preserved the occupations that occurred on the more stable surfaces formed during times of slower sedimentation. There are, however, some exceptions to the otherwise ideal alluvial Mercado Site (41TR203) 131 July 2019

deposition, including disturbances from post-depositional processes and some mixing of occupations within the Paleosol. The post-depositional disturbances are primarily from plowing. Bioturbation from tree roots or rodents was not common in the excavation profiles below 30 cmbs and was primarily present in the upper 30 cm of the profile. The plow zone consists of the top approximately 30 cm of the profile, although it is as shallow as 20 cm in some places, as evidenced by intact hearth features located at 20 cmbs. Historic and prehistoric artifacts were mixed within the plow zone, and it is difficult to discern the level of disturbance of the prehistoric components in the uppermost portion from plowing (see Chapter 6). Furthermore, the surface may have been graded during the construction of the West Fork Trinity River flood zone, which includes a levee system. AUs 6 through 8, in the lower portion of the profile, are located within the Paleosol, which formed when sedimentation rates slowed between 2600 and 2050 yr Cal BP. The slower sedimentation coupled with more frequent and/or denser occupations likely caused some mixing of cultural material from multiple occupations. AU 6 in particular appeared in the field as the most artifact- dense occupation, when in fact it may represent several smaller occupations over a period of approximately 600 years. The assignment and location description of each AU is discussed in more detail below. The discussion includes a brief description of the features that were excavated in each AU with associated calibrated radiocarbon ages. All artifact types were present within each unit, and include burned rock, charcoal, lithics, burned clay, and faunal material. However, it should be noted that portions of AU 3, all of AU 4, and portions of AU 5 primarily contained mussel shell. See Table 7.1 for a summary of the occupations and depths of the AUs. Table 7.2 summarizes radiocarbon ages with 2-sigma calibrations by feature, sediment zone, and AU. Table 7.3 summarizes associated radiocarbon dates from bone collagen.

7.4 Analytical Unit Descriptions This section includes more detailed descriptions of the AUs that represent distinct occupational time periods of site 41TR203 and the feature and artifacts attributed to each. The descriptions are presented first, followed by associated figures. Figures 7.5 through 7.7 correlate 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages from the site with the proposed ages of the geoarcheology investigations. Figures 7.8 through 7.15 show an overview of the excavations and highlights features associated with each AU, culminating with Figure 7.16, which maps all features discussed within the AUs. 7.4.1 Analytical Unit 1 (1280 to 970 yr Cal BP) AU 1 was at 10 to 35 cmbs, ranging from elevations of 99.97 to 99.72, and was beneath (and possibly truncated by) the plow zone. This AU correlates with Strat Zone I in Block B. Occupations B and D were both incorporated into AU 1, as were the deposits 5 cm above Occupation B and the 10 cm in between B and D (Figure 7.6). Occupation B was one of the main occupations, and D was one of the ephemeral occupations. The radiocarbon dates from features also suggest that AU 1 likely represents more than one occupation. The majority of the features in AU 1 were small hearths with a significant amount of deer and other associated faunal material. The most distinctive feature of AU 1 is a burned rock midden (Feature 10) (Figure 7.8). During the excavations, the midden was bisected and was found to be basin- shaped, with good preservation of wood charcoal, including one large (20-cm-long) piece of wood that remained within the center of the midden. Five radiocarbon dates were obtained for the midden from charred samples of oak, elm, cherry, unidentified hardwood. The dates range from 1280 to 970 yr Cal BP (Betas 399610, 396611, 396612, 396615, 396616) (see Table 7.3). Feature 8 was excavated during the testing phase, but it also was located adjacent to Zone I in Block A and thus, correlates with AU 1. Feature 8 was a hearth feature with abundant faunal material, primarily deer. One unifacial fragment, four pieces of debitage (three 1/4-inch flakes and one 1-inch flake), 88 macrobotanical remains, and 38 faunal elements are attributed to AU 1.

7.4.2 Analytical Unit 2 (1530 to 1380 yr Cal BP) AU 2 was beneath the plow zone, from 20 to 40 cmbs, ranging in elevations from 99.81 to 99.61. This component correlates with Strat Zone I in Block C and with Occupation C (Figure 7.7). Occupation C was also recorded with Block A and was 5 cm thick in both blocks (Figure 7.5). However, AU 2/Occupation C was not observed during the scraping of Block A and thus, there is not excavation data for the AU within Block A. AU 2 is 20 cm thick in Block C and was expanded by 15 cm to include the excavation data above and below the occupation as identified from the microartifact analysis. The excavation focused on the eastern portion of the block, around Feature 12 (Figure 7.9). Feature 12 was a hearth that consisted of eight burned limestone cobbles. Faunal remains, mussel shell, burned rock, burned earth, charcoal, and lithics were present within this component, but were not abundant. A radiocarbon sample from a charred piece of oak wood yielded a date of 1530 to 1380 yr Cal BP (Beta 396608) (see Table 7.3). The radiocarbon samples from the geoarcheological investigation yielded a date of about 1200 yr Cal BP. One blade-flake fragment, three pieces of debitage (one 1/4-inch flake and two 1-inch flakes), 11 macrobotanical remains, and 10 faunal elements are attributed to AU 2. 7.4.3 Analytical Unit 3 (1055 to 930 yr Cal BP) AU 3 correlates with Strat Zone I in Block A and was at 35 to 50 cmbs, ranging in elevation from 99.81 to 99.66 (Figure 7.5). Occupation E was only expanded by 5 cm to incorporate the excavated material and to create AU 3. Feature 13 was excavated within Block A and is a hearth feature that consisted of three overlying courses of rock (Figure 7.10). Many of the rocks appeared thermally fractured and in-situ. A significant amount of burned clay and charcoal were present. A piece of red oak charcoal from Feature 13 was dated to 1055 to 930 yr Cal BP (Beta 396613) (see Table 7.3).

No stone tools, one piece of debitage (one 3/4-inch flake), four macrobotanical remains, and over 1,225 faunal pieces are attributed to AU 3. 7.4.4 Analytical Unit 4 (1710 to 1415 yr Cal BP) AU 4 correlates with Strat Zone II in Block B and was 40 to 60 cmbs, ranging in elevation from 99.67 to 99.47 (Figure 7.6). Occupation E was only expanded by 5 cm to incorporate the excavated material and to create AU 4. Feature 21 was a mussel shell midden that was located along the southern wall of Block B and appeared to continue beyond the wall (Figure 7.11). The portion of the shell midden that was visible within the excavated block measured approximately 1 m north to south, 2 m east to west, and 10 cm thick. A radiocarbon sample from a charred piece of ash wood yielded a date of 1710 to 1560 yr Cal BP (Beta 396629) (see Table 7.3). This feature is similar to Feature 14, excavated from Block C and AU 5. Both features are mussel shell middens, and the only features excavated that date to the Transitional Archaic period. Features 25 through 28 were excavated from the geoarcheology trench. Feature 25, 26, and 28 were shell middens, which are prevalent in this AU. Feature 27 was a pit feature that was also excavated from the geoarcheology trench with a significant amount of burned clay and charcoal. A total of four unifacial fragments, eight pieces of debitage (two 1/4-inch flakes and six 3/4-inch flakes), 75 macrobotanical remains, and 29 faunal elements are attributed to AU 4. 7.4.5 Analytical Unit 5 (1815 to 1570 yr Cal BP) AU 5 correlates with Strat Zone II in Block C (Figure 7.7). AU 5 was 45 to 75 cmbs, at elevations ranging from 99.56 to 99.26. Occupation G was expanded 10 cm above and 5 cm below the range defined during the geoarcheological analysis. Occupation G/AU 5 was also present in Block A, but was not observed during the mechanical scraping and thus, was not excavated within this block (Figure 7.5).

The focus of excavations in AU 5 was around Feature 14, which was a mussel shell midden that extended into the northern wall of the block (Figure 7.12). The excavated portion of Feature 14 was approximately 3 m east to west, 1.5 m north to south, and 10 cm thick. Two radiocarbon samples from charred pieces of elm and unidentified hardwood yielded dates of 1720 to 1570 yr Cal BP (Beta 396618) and 1815 to 1615 yr Cal BP (Beta 396617), respectively (see Table 7.3). Feature 14 in AU 5 is similar to and dates to roughly the same interval as Feature 21, excavated from AU 4. Features 15 through 17 and Feature 31 were excavated with the geoarcheology trench. Feature 15 was a rock midden, and Features 16, 17, and 31 were pits. Features 1 and 5 from the testing phase correlate with AU 5 and were hearth features. No stone tools, 14 pieces of debitage (six 1/4-inch flakes, six 3/4-inch flakes, and two 1-inch flakes), 54 macrobotanical remains, and 54 faunal elements are attributed to AU 5. 7.4.6 Analytical Unit 6 (2760 to 2145 yr Cal BP) AU 6 correlates with the top of Strat Zone III in Block A (Figure 7.5). AU 6 was 90 to 100 cmbs, at elevations ranging from 99.26 to 99.16. Occupation J was expanded 5 cm to include the excavations above the occupation. Occupation J/AU 6 was also in Blocks B and C, but because of its ephemeral nature, was not observed with the other blocks during the mechanical scraping and thus, was not excavated in those blocks (Figures 7.6 and 7.7). Features 18 and 19, excavated in this AU, were hearth features defined by a concentration of burned rock, although burned rock was prevalent throughout the zone (Figure 7.13). The features contained all artifact types, namely burned rock, burned earth, mussel shell, lithics, bone, and mussel charcoal. Two radiocarbon dates from charred pieces of hardwood collected from Feature 18 yielded ages of 2345 to 2295 yr Cal BP (Beta 396632) and 2325 to 2145 yr Cal BP (Beta 396634) (see Table 7.3). Feature 30 was excavated from within the geoarcheology trench, and its spatial location correlates with AU 6. This feature was a hearth. Mercado Site (41TR203) 138 July 2019

One biface fragment, two pieces of debitage (one 1/4-inch flake and one 1-inch flake), 27 macrobotanical remains, and 67 faunal elements are attributed to AU 6. 7.4.7 Analytical Unit 7 (2720 to 2350 yr Cal BP) AU 7 correlates to Strat Zone III in all blocks, and Occupation L from the geoarcheological analysis (Fiugres 7.5, 7.6, and 7.7). AU 7 was 105 to 130 cmbs, at elevations ranging from 99.11 to 98.76, depending on the excavation block. AU 7 was characterized by an extensive sheet midden containing faunal material, mussel shell, burned rock, burned earth, lithics, and charcoal. The midden was the densest in Block A but was present in all blocks. Additional features consisted of a few discrete ring hearths comprised of burned limestone that contained faunal remains. Lithic materials, which were relatively scarce at the site, were most prevalent in this AU, and several dart points were recovered from AUs 7 and 8. AU 7 was the most productive component at the site and is most likely a series of occupations that occurred over a period of approximately 400 to 500 years. AU 7 comprises the majority of Strat Zone III, and the excavations were 20 to 35 cm thick. The cultural deposits within this component resulted in the formation of a sheet midden that consisted of various faunal materials, mussel shell, burned rock, burned earth, charcoal, and lithics. The abundance of faunal material was particularly notable in comparison to other units and included bison bone and teeth as well as teeth and bones from a variety of smaller fauna. Additionally, sand was observed within pieces of burned earth during the soil micromorphological analysis of this component. The sand is not present within the matrix and appears to have been intentionally added. This suggests there could have been some sort of mud-plastered structure at the site during this occupation or perhaps the burned clay was used as boiling stones. Both of these hypotheses have been suggested for sites similar to site 41TR203. Fourteen features (Features 6, 29, 32 through 41, 43, and 44) were located within the sheet midden defined in AU 7, including Block F and the geomorphic trench (Figure 7.14). The features were either basin-shaped hearths or pit features with highly burned reaction rims, indicating that these features may have been used as ovens. The features were heavily burned and contained substantial Mercado Site (41TR203) 139 July 2019

amounts of ash with a few pieces of burned rock in the bottom. The sheet midden may be a result of cleaning out these ovens. Features 34 through 41, 43, and 44 were excavated from AU 7 in Block F. Features 35 through 39 and 43 were hearth features, and Features 34 and 44 were pits that were less well-defined but may also have served as hearths as discussed above. Feature 40 was a small shell midden that may simply have been a particularly dense concentration of shells, for it was not nearly as large or clearly defined as the mussel shell middens from AU 4. Feature 41 was a dense concentration of artifacts including in-situ burned earth. A charred piece of cherry wood from this feature yielded a date of 2720 to 2430 yr Cal BP (Beta 396624) (see Table 7.3). Feature 43 was a hearth feature that also appeared to exhibit in-situ burned earth. A radiocarbon date from an indeterminate piece of charred material yielded a date of 2680 to 2640 yr Cal BP (Beta 396623) (see Table 7.3). Features 29, 32, and 33 were excavated from the geoarcheology trench, and their spatial location correlates them with AU 7. These were hearth features. Feature 6 from the testing phase is also in AU 7 and was a pit feature. A total of 13 stone tools including Gary Late Archaic projectile point forms and uniface and biface fragments, as well as 316 pieces of debitage (117 1/4-inch flakes, 24 1/2-inch flakes, 92 3/4-inch flakes, and 83 1-inch flakes), 242 macrobotanical remains, and 4,474 faunal elements are attributed to AU 7. 7.4.8 Analytical Unit 8 (2740 to 2355 yr Cal BP) AU 8 is stratigraphically situated beneath AU 7, at the bottom of Strat Zone III (Figures 7.5, 7.6, and 7.7). It was the deepest stratigraphic unit excavated at the site, from 125 to 145 cmbs, ranging in elevations from 98.70 to 98.56, depending on the excavation block. Feature 20 was the most productive hearth feature excavated in Block A (Figure 7.15). The feature was a limestone hearth in a roughly circular pattern. The rocks ranged from 3 to 12 cm in size and were flat to subangular. Faunal materials, including bison teeth and a bison scapula, mussel shell, charcoal, and burned earth were collected from within the feature. Two radiocarbon dates were processed from the feature. A sample of charred white oak yielded a date of 2715 to 2360 yr Cal Mercado Site (41TR203) 140 July 2019

BP (Beta 396625), and a sample of burned cherry wood was calibrated to 2700 to 2635 yr Cal BP (Beta 396626) (see Table 7.3). Features 24 and 42 were excavated within AU 8. Feature 24 was a hearth feature with a dense concentration of ash and burned earth. Two soil micromorphology samples were taken from Feature 24, one from the feature and one from the surface outside of the feature. These samples demonstrated an unusually thick thermal reaction rim and vitrification near the top of the features. A sample of charred hickory or pecan wood from the feature yielded dates of 2700 to 2355 yr Cal BP (Beta 396620) (see Table 7.3). Feature 42 was located in Block F and consisted of eight large cobbles arranged in a disarticulated circular shape. Cultural materials associated with the feature included a few faunal remains and lithic material. There was a noticeable amount of sedimentation between Components IIIb and IIIc of about 20 cm within Block F. Components IIIb and IIIc conformed in the other blocks. A date of 2740 to 2490 yr Cal BP was obtained from a charred piece of hardwood from Feature 42 (Beta 396637). Five stone tools including Gary and Ensor Late Archaic projectile point forms, 31 flakes (nine 1/4- inch flakes, three 1/2-inch flakes, ten 3/4-inch flakes, and nine 1-inch flakes), 80 macrobotanical remains, and 2,261 faunal elements are attributed to AU 8.

A 1-x-1-m excavation unit (Unit 7) was established to the east of the BHT. The same vertical datum used for Unit 1 was also used for Unit 7. The feature consisted of a cluster of FCR with small amounts of charcoal and baked earth. Several mammal bone fragments were also present within the FCR cluster. The feature appears to be limited to a lens between approximately 34 and 46 cmbd. A flotation sam- ple of feature fill was taken from each 10-cm excavation level, and samples were also taken of the soil from outside the feature.Just west of the FCR cluster and at a slightly lower elevation were several fragments of animal bone. Below the animal bone, by 56cmbs, the soil matrix was devoid of cultural material. This feature may represent a small hearth with a collection of discarded animal bones nearby, or it may represent an area where both FCR and animal bones were discarded.

Bottom Elevation 99.70 Size 140 X 120 cm Associated Floor Elevation Range(m) 99.80 - 99.70 Shape Ovoid; basined Fuel Type Blackhaw, elm, plum/cherry Associated Diagnostics None Faunal Evidence Various mammalian and (Lot No and elevation) vertebrate remains Description Feature 10 was originally located during NRHP testing and excavated during the data recovery phase from the walls and floor of the northern end of BHT 16 (see Table 7.4 ). A dense concentration of burned rock was noted in both walls andthe floor of the trench. The feature was at a depth of 20–50 cmbs (99.83–99.70) and was still present in the floor when trenching wasceased. The density, size, arrangement, and presence of a basin lined with larger, unfractured rocks, along with organic remains,suggest that Feature 10 is an earth oven with its lower heating elements still intact. Excavation Block B was opened around this featureduring data recov- ery. The feature is a dense concentration of FCR located just underneath the plow zone. The top of the feature waslikely disturbed and partially truncated by plowing and from the discovery ofthe feature by machine. Feature 10 is a roughly oval basined pit that measures 140 cm north–south by 120 east–west, and is 15 cm thick. The feature wasbi(cid:882) sected along its north–south axis, between Units 25 and 29 to the west, and to the west of Units 26 and 30. Excavation was in 10 cm levels in Units 25 and 29 and was expediently removed from Units 26 and 30. All soil matrices and FCR were collected, along with11 point-plotted FCR from the top of the feature within Unit 25. A total of 426 FCR weighing 61.93 kg was collected, making this the largest burned rock feature. The cross-section showed the feature to consist of a shallow basin containing a dense, compact layer of large FCR representing the basal rock heating elements of an earth oven. FCR and burnt earth nodules in Units 30 and 31 appeared to represent the partial clean-out of the feature. Charcoal flecking was ubiquitous, and large pieces of charred branches were located at the bottom of the basin (76 charcoal remains in total). Additionally, 12 macrobotanical remains (carbonized plants) and 10 faunal specimens were collected, including one from a small bird (dove, plover, screech owl size), two from a small mammal (rabbit, prairie dog, or squirrel size), and seven from miscellaneous vertebrates.

A dense concentration of burned rock was noted in both walls andthe floor of the trench. The feature was at a depth of 20–50 cmbs (99.83–99.70) and was still present in the floor when trenching wasceased. The density, size, arrangement, and presence of a basin lined with larger, unfractured rocks, along with organic remains,suggest that Feature 10 is an earth oven with its lower heating elements still intact. Excavation Block B was opened around this featureduring data recov- ery. The feature is a dense concentration of FCR located just underneath the plow zone. The top of the feature waslikely disturbed and partially truncated by plowing and from the discovery ofthe feature by machine. Feature 10 is a roughly oval basined pit that measures 140 cm north–south by 120 east–west, and is 15 cm thick. The feature wasbi(cid:882) sected along its north–south axis, between Units 25 and 29 to the west, and to the west of Units 26 and 30. Excavation was in 10 cm levels in Units 25 and 29 and was expediently removed from Units 26 and 30. All soil matrices and FCR were collected, along with11 point-plotted FCR from the top of the feature within Unit 25.

The feature was in a figure 8 shape, approximately 80 cm in diameter and 15 cm thick. The feature was excavated in Unit 10 in 10-cm levels but not bisected. A dense cluster of approximately 50 FCR was fracturedin situ in two and three flat layers. The basined nature, the bed of larger rocks in the lower basin, and the loose smaller FCR covering the lower bed are suggestive of a small earth oven. The loose smaller rocks may represent lid rocks from the upper elements of a small-sized oven. Alternatively, the remains of a small hearth feature may be indicated. Four charcoal remains, one unidentified mussel shell, and burned clay were collected from the feature, along with one lithic flake, ¾-inch in size. A piece of historic glass was col- lected from the first excavation level, indicating that the top of the feature may have been truncated or partially mixed with the bottom of the plow zone.

The feature was excavated in 10 cm levels from Units 37 and 38. Amorphous in shape, the feature dimensions were approximately 1 m north– south and 2 m east–west, although the feature extended into the south wall of the excavation block and so the extent of the size and shape is unknown. A large round area in the middle of the feature did not contain mussel shell; the shape is vaguely amorphous and may be a possible indicator that a textile or mat may have been used to carry and place the cooked ingredients and then removed afterward. The analyzed shells from Feature 21 consisted of 72 Fusconaia sp., 40 Pleurombemini, 27 Cyclonaias mortoni, 22 Pleurobema riddelli, 13 Amblema plicata, five gastropods, three Plectomerus dombeyanus, three Quadrula sp., one Lampsilis teres, one Quadrula apiculata, one Tritigonia verrucosa, one Truncilla truncata, and 36 unidentified mollusks. Addition- ally, four pieces of debitage (two ¼-inch flakes and two ¾-inch flakes), and four macrobotanical remains (three charcoal and one carbonized plant) were present within the feature.

Feature 1 Flotation Results Juniperus 7.5.5 Analytical Unit 5 Feature Type Burned rock cluster Analytical Unit 5 Block Backhoe Trench 2 Radiocarbon Dates None Provenience North of Block A Top Elevation 99.43 Bottom Elevation 99.29 Size 60 x 60 cm Associated Floor Elevation Range(m) 99.40 - 99.30 Shape Roughly circular; Basin Fuel Type Juniper, indeterminate hardwood Associated Diagnostics None (Lot No and elevation) Faunal Evidence Unidentified rodent, unidentified small mammal Description Feature 1 was first observed by archeologists from SWCA during their 2009 backhoe trenching work at site 41TR203. At that time, the archeologists photographed and documented the feature, covered it with orange safety fencing, and backfilled the trench. aci archeologists relocated the trench based on the map provided by SWCA and used a backhoe to carefully remove the fill from above the feature level during the NRHP testing phase. The feature was located at a depth of approximately 50 cmbs (99.43) and is com- posed of a cluster of FCR (see Table 7.4). Once the feature had been re-exposed, archeologists from aci laid out a 1-x-1-m excava- tion unit (Unit 1), oriented to the cardinal directions, centered over the feature. A vertical datum was set at 10 cmabove the surface. The unit was excavated in 10-cm levels, and all fill was screened through ¼-in mesh. A 10-cm level in the eastern half of the unit outside the feature was excavated first, leaving the feature intact. After the intact feature was documented through a sketch map and photographs, the feature was bisected, and the upper 10 cm of the eastern half of the feature was re- moved. A portion of the feature fill was set aside as a sample for flotation, and the rest was screened for the presence of artifacts. This process was repeated for the second 10-cm level outside of the feature and then inside the eastern portion of the feature. By the end of the second 10-cm level, the feature had disappeared. The profile of the feature was not distinctive. The excavation process was repeatedon the western side of the unit, outside the feature and then inside the feature in 10-cm levels. Feature 1 consisted of a roughly circular cluster of FCR measuring approximately 60 cm in diameter. The northwestern corner of the excavation unit also contained two fragments of FCR from the same elevations as the feature. Two other FCR fragments to the east of the feature may also be associated. The upper elevation of the cluster was approximately 50 cmbs (60 cmbd), while the lowereleva(cid:882) tion was approximately 64 cmbs. The feature contained 20–25 larger cobbles and 20–30 small fragments. A few clumps of baked clay were found within the feature, but the soil within the feature did not differ significantly from that outside of the feature.The feature is interpreted to be a small hearth, or possible rake-out discard pile. The matrix from outside the featureyielded 10–15 small mam(cid:882) mal bones and bone fragments, several of which were whole rodent bones.

A 1-x-1-m excavation unit (Unit 4) was established over the feature, and a vertical datum was established at 10 cm above the surface. Due to space constraints, the unit was aligned parallel to the BHT rather than to the cardinal directions. The crew carefully removed matrix from around the visible FCR and then from around mussel shell and areas of baked earth and charcoal, leaving as much cultural material in place as was possible. Matrix was screened through ¼-in mesh, and all cultural material found in the screen were collected. Between 122 and 130 cmbd, 41 individual articles were mapped and collected as point-plotted items. Mapped materials included FCR, mussel shell, baked earth, and charcoal. At 130 cmbd, very few artifacts were still present in the unit, and no artifacts were present below 134 cmbd. The feature extent, dif- ficult to determine when the Unit 4 was established, proved to encompass the northwest, northeast, and southeast quadrants of the excavation unit; very little material was present in the southwest quadrant. The feature appears to represent a discard pile of food remains and cooking debris (FCR, ash, bone, and charcoal). The FCR did not appear to reflect the kind of pattern that would be expected of a hearth or oven feature. Top of Feature 6, before excavation BHT 2 180

The feature was excavated within Unit 67, and was round, 50 cm in diameter, and 10 cm thick. Feature 35 was bi- sected, and half of the feature was collected. The burned rock was in a ring shape, and contained lithic debris and mussel shell. Some burned rock and bone were scattered out- side of the feature as well. A 20-cm-long area of burnt earth (similar to the one outside of Feature 20.1) was sampled for soil micromorphology. The entire piece of burnt earth was collected. It appears that the burned rocks and burnt earth were removed from within the feature, as the center is empty except for some burnt earth nodules and a few shells. Cultural materials recovered from this feature include eight macrobotanical remains (charcoal), one quartzite biface fragment (SN211.01) and nine pieces of debitage, (one ¼-inch flake, one ½-inch flake, three ¾-inch flakes, and four 1-inch flakes). Feature 35 may represent the remains of a rockless cooking pit, or alternatively, an amorphous area of cultural discard, part of a sheet midden of cultural debris scat- tered over a larger area on a relatively stable geomorphic surface, over a lengthy period of time.

The feature was excavated from Block A, within Units 18, 19, 22, and 23 at 110–117 cmbs (99.06–98.99; see Table 7.4). Feature 20.1 measured approximately 135 cm north–south, 115 cm east–west, and 10 cm thick. Most of the rocks were in one layer, some in two layers, and varied from 3 to 12 cm in size. Some of the rocks were fractured in situ. The profile was a very shallow basin, almost flat. One Cyclonaias mortoni and one unidentified mollusk shell were analyzed from this feature. The 187 faunal remains included eight bison (Bison bison), two probable bison (cf. Bison), eight large Bovidae (bison), one medium-large or large mammal, 146 large mammals (bison or elk size), nine miscellaneous mammal, and 13 miscellaneous vertebrate remains. Charcoal was also observed and collected. Feature 20.1 may represent an intact hearth feature or earth oven basal remnant with an associated lid rock or rake-out pile immediately adjacent.

The feature was then excavated during the data recovery phase. A 1-x-1-m excavation unit (Unit 2) was established over the feature, with the west wall of BHT 10 creating the east wall of the excavation unit. A vertical datum was established at 10 cm above the surface. The upper 50 cm of overburden was removed mechanically, and hand excavation began at that level. Only the eastern half of the unit was excavated, and the fill was screened through ¼-in mesh. No cultural material was recovered from above 90 cmbd. One clump of baked soil was recovered from between 90 and 100 cmbd. The fill around the feature was excavated in 5-cm levels, but no artifacts were present. The feature measured approximately 45 cm north–south by 25 cm east– west. Charcoal samples were removed for radiocarbon dating and species analysis. Excavation was terminated at 110 cmbd, and the feature was covered with several layers of material for preservation. Feature 4 was initially thought to be prehistoric posts but was later found to be historic. Associated Features 7, 22, and 23 appeared to be in an arc pattern of an approximate 4.5-m radius located in Block E. An expedited radiocarbon sample was sent for analysis during the field investigations. The results of this analysis were that Feature 23 was modern (Beta 375548). TxDOT and the THC concurred with the abandonment of Block E, and the feature was not investigated further.

The presence of such features would lend weight to the hypothesis that Feature 4 was a prehistoric post. Mechanical excavation of overburden ap- proximately 2 meters to the east of Feature 4 led to the discovery of three amorphousclusters of charcoal at 90 cmbs. The largest of which measured to about 9 cm in diameter. Feature 7, later, was covered with materialand abandoned to be investigated in the fu- ture.

8.0 CHAPTER 8 – VERTEBRATE REMAINS By: Jodi Jacobson, Kenneth L. Brown, and Marie E. Brown 8.1 Introduction and Research Orientation A total of 8,346 vertebrate faunal remains were recovered from the Mercado site (41TR203) during data recovery by aci consulting (Table 8.1). Site 41TR203, located along the West Fork of the Trinity River, is a multicomponent site containing Late Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric occupations. The entire vertebrate faunal assemblage was examined. The present analysis forms the basis for addressing several research issues relating to this assemblage, such as species variability, human subsistence strategies, taphonomic processes, and the cultural use of bone. Specific vertebrate faunal research questions developed for data recovery include: 1. Do the changes in faunal assemblages reflect changes in C3 and C4 ecosystems? 2. Are there a significant number of bison remains? 3. How does the number of bison compare to other open prairie style species? 4. Do grassland changes appear to have affected the presence of bison? 5. Do any specimens exhibit cut marks? 6. Do cut marks or other data indicate that the animals were butchered on site or were brought to the site from elsewhere? 7. Do the various species reflect a broad-spectrum diet? 8. Do the vertebrate faunal remains reflect a specialized use of the site? 9. Does the assemblage suggest seasonal occupation of the site? If so, do the AUs reflect changes in seasonality? 10.Do the concentrations of faunal remains reflect different processing activities? 11.Is there evidence of bone grease processing? 12.Were any of the rock features used for boiling bones to produce bone grease? 13.Was the site near the kill sites of the animals and used as an initial processing site, or does the evidence suggest a post-processing site? Does this differ between AUs? The following descriptions and discussions focus on the AUs and features, then on the vertebrate faunal assemblage as a whole, allowing for intra-site comparison within a temporal framework. The discussion begins with a description of the research methods used in this study. This is Mercado Site (41TR203) 212 July 2019

(Balkwill and Cumbaa 1992; Ford 1990; Jacobson 2004; Olsen 1964, 1968) were consulted. All vertebrate faunal remains recovered from 1/4-inch screening of excavated deposits and from flotation heavy fraction were analyzed. No faunal sampling was conducted. Basic information recorded for each specimen, a complete bone or tooth or a fragment thereof, included the taxon, element, laterality, portion, weathering, burning, gnawing, and evidence of butchering and working. Taxonomic classification follows Page and Burr (1991) for fish, Stebbins (2003) for reptiles and amphibians, Peterson (1988) for birds, and Schmidly (1994) for mammals. Taxonomic identifications were made to the lowest level of specificity (e.g., order, family, genus, species) warranted by each specimen. When diagnostic characteristics were not as variable, such as presence of a character which had been noted as defining only 65 percent of the time in bison, the modifier cf. (compares favorably) was used. For example, in the case above, a species determination would be listed as cf. Bison bison. Not all of the animal bones were identifiable beyond class. Therefore, size categories were used to differentiate the various bones. Size categories by class or other taxonomic level are useful for understanding human subsistence strategies and prey choice preferences (high biomass versus low biomass) within an environment. Size categories may also give an indication of an environment’s overall species richness (Lawton 1990). Size categories for birds include small (e.g., dove, American golden plover, screech owl), medium (e.g., mallard duck, caracara, red-tailed hawk), and medium-large (e.g., goose, turkey, great blue heron). Size categories for mammals include very small mammal (e.g., wood rat, hispid cotton rat, vole), small (e.g., rabbit, prairie dog, squirrel), small-medium (e.g., opossum, beaver, skunk), medium (e.g., dog, raccoon, bobcat), medium-large (e.g., deer, pronghorn, pig), and large (e.g., bison, cattle, horse). Identified Artiodactyla bones not identifiable to species were sub-divided into medium-large artiodactyl (e.g., white-tailed deer, mule deer, pronghorn), large artiodactyl (e.g., bison, elk), and medium or larger artiodactyl (i.e., any artiodactyl larger than sheep or goat). Very small Muridae include cotton rats, woodrats, and prairie voles. The interpretation of any faunal assemblage is subject to several sources of probable bias. First, because of preservation factors and excavation techniques, it is impossible to recover every bone originally deposited in a site. An excavated assemblage, therefore, is by very nature a sample. In Mercado Site (41TR203) 215 July 2019

addition, it is a sample of a sample because few sites, if any, are excavated in total. Depending on where excavations occurred within a site, such as in structures, middens, refuse disposal areas, and activity areas, analysis of the recovered faunal remains can produce varying or conflicting interpretations. Sample size is another potential source of bias, particularly in small assemblages. As stated by Grayson (1984a:117), “extremely small samples probably do not provide an adequate base from which statistical inferences concerning relative abundances within the target population can be made.” (The target population is the animal set exploited by a group of people [Grayson 1984a:116].) Sample size is also subject to other biases. Relative taxonomic abundances may be significantly correlated with the size of the samples from which they have been determined. Consequently, interpretations of relative abundances may prove to be primarily interpretations of the size of the samples from which the abundances have been derived (Grayson 1984a:129). One measure of taxonomic abundance is richness. This refers to the number of taxa (e.g., species) that have contributed to a faunal assemblage (Cruz-Uribe 1988:180; Grayson 1984a; Leonard 1989:23). Another measure sometimes used to ascertain taxonomic abundance is general diversity, which takes into account both the number of taxa present (i.e., richness) and the relative frequency of each taxon (Cruz-Uribe 1988:179). Some researchers (e.g., Grayson 1984a:138–149; Leonard 1989; Leonard and Jones 1989; Meltzer et al. 1992) have shown strong correlations between richness and sample size as measured by NISP. In the present analysis, interpretations are based on the NISP, the MNI, and relative percentages. The MNI is the number of animals of an identified taxon necessary to account for all the recovered bones of that taxon (Shotwell 1955:330). Although used by American paleontologists as early as the 1920s (see Grayson 1973:433, 1984a:27–28), the method for determining MNI was introduced into American archeology by White (1953). Improvements of White’s technique have occurred over the years (Bökönyi 1970; Chaplin 1971; Grayson 1973, 1979, 1984a). The different methods utilized for determining MNI, however, can yield varying results for the same assemblage (see Casteel 1977a, 1977b; Grayson 1973, 1978, 1979, 1984a; Horton 1984; Ringrose 1993:126–128). As a result, some researchers see little value in the use of MNI (e.g., Casteel 1977b; Turner 1980). As suggested by Horton (1984:255), “there is no single ‘best’ method, since the one that is chosen depends upon the result desired, and on the particular features of the site and excavation.” With these drawbacks in mind, MNI values are presented as a quantitative counterbalance to the NISP values. It is a means of standardizing the data. In addition, MNI values are used herein because Mercado Site (41TR203) 216 July 2019

they are relatively unaffected by differential fragmentation among species and samples and are, therefore, better for assuring comparability among indices computed for different samples (Cruz- Uribe 1988:180; Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1984). In addition, not all levels of aggregation to obtain MNI values are likely to be sensible according to site contexts and research questions. The problem of aggregation, therefore, is probably not as great as Grayson (1984b) suggests (Ringrose 1993:128). After the variables were recorded, the NISP was computed for each taxon and the minimum MNIs were determined for each identified species or genus (see Table 8.1). The calculation of minimum MNIs is done in two ways. First, MNIs are calculated based on the site assemblage as a whole and assume that all specimens of a specific taxon could represent the same individual, regardless of provenience. Second, the maximum MNIs were calculated based on the total MNIs according to each of the eight AUs that represent distinctive geomorphic stratigraphic levels that correspond to three cultural/temporal periods, including Late Archaic, Transitional Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric, and Late Prehistoric. This type of MNI is based upon provenience or association with specific features and geomorphic stratigraphic units. The calculation of each type of MNI considered taxon, element, side, portion, and age, which was based on the degree of bone fusion, tooth eruption and wear, and porosity (i.e., overall ossification) of bone specimens. The bones of very young mammals are distinctly spongier (i.e., less ossified) than those of adults. The calculation of MNI values for higher taxonomic levels and for animal size classes other than mammals (e.g., small bird, medium bird) was determined by the composition of the assemblage. For example, if a specimen was identified to a taxonomic level higher than genus (e.g., Rodentia [order]) and another specimen was recorded at a lower taxonomic level within it (e.g., Neotoma sp.), the MNI was determined only for the lower taxonomic level. Not all recovered vertebrate archeofaunal remains from a site are cultural. Although some researchers base intrusiveness on the presence of partial or nearly complete skeletons of animals, such as small rodents (Thomas 1971; Ziegler 1973), analysts also must consider the taphonomic factors affecting the differential preservation of bones (Lyman 1984) as well as recovery techniques. Szuter (1989:209–219) presents five pieces of evidence for interpreting rodent bones. Three of these criteria are used in varying degrees in this analysis: (1) ethnographic accounts; (2) ecological studies; and (3) archeological evidence (including context and condition of the bones).

As indicated by the research questions, elucidation of subsistence patterns is a major focus of this analysis. Subsistence systems involve at a minimum the interaction of humans, technology, and floral and faunal resources. The study of these interactions through time and across space provides a description and an understanding of various lifeways (Lyman 1982:331). A subsistence study, therefore, requires consideration of more than just the animals. It is intimately involved with the interaction of humans, including their technology and adaptive exploitative strategies, and animals with the environment and with each other. Several diverse but related fields of research are used, including ethnography, environmental science, cultural ecology, and animal ecology. 8.3 Natural History and Ethnographic Background The following are brief descriptions of the natural history of taxa identified to the level of family, genus, or species (see Table 8.1). Their natural histories provide a database from which to glean information for reconstruction paleoenvironments and habitats associated with the various occupations spanning the Late Archaic through the early Late Prehistoric periods at the Mercado site. When available, ethnographic data are presented for these taxa. These data are derived from a variety of North American Indian groups, not only those of the Plains and Southwest, and are not intended to suggest exact usage by the Native American inhabitants of the Project area. Rather, they are presented as examples of why and how the identified taxa may have been exploited by the inhabitants of the Mercado site (41TR203). 8.3.1 Class Actinopterygii – Ray-Finned Fishes 8.3.1.1 Family Ictaluridae (Catfish) The vertebrate assemblage contains one fish bone, that of a medium-size catfish. Species associations with general size classifications are not possible for catfish. The bullhead catfish family is the largest family of freshwater fish endemic to North America north of Mexico, with 40 species found in the U.S. and Canada. Four species of Ictaluridae, including Ictalurus melas (black bullhead), Ictalurus natalis (yellow bullhead), Ictalurus furcatus (blue catfish), and Ictalurus punctatus (channel catfish), occur in the West Fork of the Trinity River in the vicinity of the Mercado site (41TR203). A single non-diagnostic cranial specimen was recovered from AU 8; thus, it could represent one of the following four species that occur in the region. Mercado Site (41TR203) 218 July 2019

The black bullhead, Ictalurus melas, prefers slow-moving or still water over mud or other soft bottoms in lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. It avoids upland streams. It can attain a length of 15 to 30 cm. Spawning occurs in May or June with the spawning season varying widely according to locality, and it may extend into August. Although the black bullhead, a bottom feeder, is omnivorous, it browses along the bottom in search of anything edible (Page and Burr 1991:194; Thompson 1985:106–107). The yellow bullhead, Ictalurus natalis, prefers slow-moving or still water over mud or other soft bottoms in lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. It can attain a length of 15 to 30 cm. Spawning occurs in May or June with the spawning season varying widely according to locality, and it may extend into August. Although the yellow bullhead, a bottom feeder, is primarily carnivorous and will eat almost any animal matter, the bulk of its diet consists of aquatic insects, but it also consumes clams, snails, leeches, worms, and small fish (Page and Burr 1991:194; Thompson 1985:108). The blue catfish, Ictalurus furcatus, occurs in rivers with a swift current where it can attain a large size. A length of 1.2 m and weight of more than 68 kilograms (kg) is possible. However, a size of 9 to 18 kg is more common. Spawning occurs in late spring and early summer in pools and backwaters. Although the blue catfish, a bottom feeder, is primarily carnivorous, its principal diet consists of other fish, and it is also a scavenger that feeds mainly at night (Brown 1970:6; Cross 1967:210–212; Kemp 1971:35; Parmalee et al. 1972:Table 11; Sublette et al. 1990:237–239). The channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, prefers slow-moving or still water over deep pools with mud or other soft bottoms in lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams but avoids upland streams. It can attain a length of 1.27 m. Spawning occurs in May or June. Although the channel catfish, a bottom feeder, is omnivorous, it also browses along the bottom in search of anything edible (Page and Burr 1991:191–192). 8.3.2 Class Amphibia – Amphibians 8.3.2.1 Family Bufonidae (True Toads) Bufo sp. (n = 1) Only one amphibian bone was recovered from the site. Species present included toads the size of a large woodhouse toad. There was also one bone classified as herpetile that was indeterminate Mercado Site (41TR203) 219 July 2019

between reptile and amphibian. Five species of toads, including Bufo debilis (eastern green toad), Bufo punctatus (red-spotted road), Bufo Speciosus (Texas toad), Bufo valliceps (Gulf Coast toad), and Bufo woodhouseii (Woodhouse’s toad), occur in the vicinity of the Mercado site (41TR203). A single femur shaft was recovered from AU 8; thus, it may represent any of the following five species. Bufo debilis (eastern green toad) matures to be 1.5–2 inches long. It thrives in unusually dry habitats in open, grassy plains near pools where breeding takes place. It is primarily nocturnal, and breeding occurs from March to September when rain sufficiently fills pools, ditches, or streambeds. If conditions are not favorable, it will not breed. It feeds on a variety of insects (Garrett and Barker 1987:6). Bufo punctatus (red-spotted toad) matures to be 1.5 to 3 inches long. It thrives in unusually dry habitats in open grassland, but requires a constant source of moisture such as springs, seepages, pools along streams, and cattle tanks. It is primarily nocturnal and most active at twilight. It feeds on a variety of insects. Breeding occurs from April to September when rain sufficiently fills pools, ditches, or streambeds (Garrett and Barker 1987:10). Bufo speciosus (Texas toad) matures to be 2 to 3 5/8 inches long. It is adapted to dry environments, prefers sandy soils, and can be found in a variety of habitats ranging from prairies to open woodlands to cultivated areas. Its sources of moisture in dry locales are cattle tanks, irrigation ditches, and temporary rain pools. It feeds on a variety of insects. Breeding occurs from April to September after rains sufficiently fills pools, ditches, or streambeds (Garrett and Barker 1987:11). Bufo valliceps (Gulf Coast toad) matures to be 2 to 4 inches long. It occurs in a variety of moist habitats that include ditches, gardens, dump sites, and storm sewers. It is primarily nocturnal and is most active during twilight. It feeds on a variety of insects. Breeding occurs from March to September when rain sufficiently fills pools, ditches, or streambeds (Garrett and Barker 1987:12). Bufo woodhouseii (Woodhouse’s toad) occurs where suitable soils and moister conditions exist, such as in river valleys. It is usually confined to the vicinity of streams and river valleys, and to agricultural areas and river floodplains in more mesic habitats with permanent water. This toad is an excellent burrower that prefers loose soil. As with most toad species, Woodhouse’s Toad is nocturnal, emerging from its burrow to feed at dusk and after dark. It breeds from March to Mercado Site (41TR203) 220 July 2019

September in permanent water or in temporary pools after heavy summer rains (Degenhardt et al. 1996:61–63; Garrett and Barker 1987:15; Johnson 1977:76–78; Stebbins 1985:72, Map 33; Wheeler and Wheeler 1966:4, 44; Williamson et al. 1994:161–162). Because toads are fossorial and/or seek shelter in burrows, their presence within the site is considered intrusive. In addition, it is doubtful that true toads (i.e., Bufo spp.) were eaten because they produce a toxic skin secretion that is irritating to the eyes and to mucous membranes and can cause skin inflammations (Brown 1985:560; Conant 1975:305; Johnson 1977:70; Stebbins 1985:68-69; Williamson et al. 1994:153, 159, 161). 8.3.3 Class Reptilia – Reptiles 8.3.3.1 Family Emydidae (Box and Water Turtles) Terrapene sp. (Box Turtle) (n = 2) There were a total of 52 reptile bones recovered from site 41TR203. Medium-sized reptiles, specifically turtles but some snakes as well, dominated the reptile assemblage. There were no large reptiles (e.g., alligators) recovered from the site. Some researchers may assume that only medium-sized reptiles were consumed, but there is coprolitic evidence from southwest Texas and elsewhere (Bryant 1974; Reinhard and Bryant 1992) that Native Americans consumed small lizards. Given other evidence for cultural modification of the bone (e.g., cuts and thermal alteration), the reptile specimens are considered having a cultural association. Terrapene sp. (box turtle) can attain a length of 10 to 15 cm. It is a terrestrial species that can enclose itself in its shell. It prefers dry open grasslands, seldom entering wooded areas. Although it is very dependent upon water, the box turtle may enter shallow pools during hot weather. Box turtles hibernate in the ground during the winter, and burrows can reach depths of 61 cm in open grasslands but are shallower in woodlands. These turtles can have a population density of more than one individual per acre. The box turtle is omnivorous, with a diet consisting of insects, vegetation, and carrion (Collins 1974:95–98; Degenhardt and Christiansen 1974:30–33; Ernst and Barbour 1972:96–102; Williamson et al. 1994:134). Although the box turtle is sometimes eaten, it is believed to be a source of illness (Ernst and Barbour 1972:95). Mercado Site (41TR203) 221 July 2019

Trachemys scripta (Red-eared Slider) (n = 41) Trachemys/Pseudemys sp. (Slider/Cooter Turtle) (n = 2) The slider (Trachemys scripta), which attains a length of 9 to 36 cm, is an aquatic species that seldom ventures far on land. It prefers quiet water, soft bottoms, and abundant aquatic vegetation. The slider basks on logs or floats at the surface. Hibernation occurs in underwater burrows and in hollow stumps. Nesting usually takes place in damp, friable soil near water. Several clutches of eggs are laid from late April to July, with births occurring from early July to late September. Its diet consists of aquatic plants, crayfish, snails, tadpoles, fish, and insects (Degenhardt and Christinsen 1974:37–40; Ernst and Barbour 1972:147–154; Stebbins 1985:100–101). Turtles were consumed as secondary food resources by the prehistoric inhabitants of Texas. Although box turtles may have been easy to obtain by simply picking them up when observed, special techniques were probably necessary to obtain aquatic and semi-aquatic species. Some, however, may have been caught when they ventured onto land to nest. After killing the turtles with a stone, the Miwok roasted the turtles in ashes until they split open. Then, the intestines were removed (Barrett and Gifford 1933:139). Among the Pawnee, turtles were used to make soup (Weltfish 1977:231). After first killing the turtles by putting their heads in a fire, the Cheyenne eviscerated them while they were still in their shells. “Then a large fire was built, and the turtles were placed about it, standing up on the edges of their shells and thus roasted. Some people boiled the turtles in their shells” (Grinnell 1923[I]:308). The Florida Seminole usually did not kill the turtles prior to preparing them for consumption, rather “…they merely cut off the plastron and butcher the animal alive and kicking, when it is set up before the fire and roasted in its own oven” (Skinner 1913:76–77). The Southeastern groups ate turtle eggs (Swanton 1946:298). Besides functioning as a food resource, turtles have also been used as a source of raw material for utilitarian objects and ornaments, such as carapace bowls and rattles, by a variety of peoples, such as the Southeastern groups (Swanton 1946:252, 627). The Hopi, one of many groups that used turtle shells as dance rattles, killed the turtles to be used as rattles: by cutting the skin away from the shell and drawing the body out of the shell by the neck. The body was thrown back into the water in the belief that it would grow a new shell and so be caught again on another occasion. The shells were brought Mercado Site (41TR203) 222 July 2019

back to the village and hung up to dry in the sun, being tested at intervals by flicking with the forefinger to determine the amount of drying advisable to produce the maximum sound. Sheep’s hooves were tied to the shells to produce the completed rattle (Beaglehole 1936:23). Formerly, the Navajo used a turtle carapace as a medicine cup in chants (Kluckhohn and Wyman 1940:45). The Menomini often tipped arrows, for use in battle, with turtle claws (Skinner 1921:322). 8.3.3.2 Family Anguidae (Anguid Lizards), Gekkonidae (Geckos), Iguanidae (Iguanid Lizards), Scincidae (Skinks), and Teiidae (Whiptails) Lacertilia – Lizards Several species of lizards, including Ophisaurus attenuates attenuates (western slender glass lizard), Hemidactylus turcicus (Mediterranean gecko), Anolis carolinensis (green anole), Cophosaurus texanus taxanus (Texas earless lizard), Crotaphytus collaris collaris (eastern collared lizard), Holbrookia maculate perspicua (eastern earless lizard), Phrynosoma cornutum (Texas horned lizard), Sceloporus olivaceus (Texas spiny lizard), Scelporus undulates consobrinus (southern prairie lizard), Sceloporus undulates hyacinthinus (northern fence lizard), Eumeces faciatus (five-line skink), Eumeces obsoletus (plains skink), Aumeces septentrionalis obtusirostris (southern prairie skink), Scincella lateralis (ground skink), Cnemidophorus gularis gularis (Texas spotted whiptail), and Cnemidophours sexlineatus viridis (prairie-lined racerunner) (Garrett and Barker 1987:130–191), are indigenous to the Mercado site area along the West Fork of the Trinity River. A few lizard specimens (n = 2) are not identifiable to a lower taxonomic level. Lizards were consumed by many peoples, such as the Hualapai and Yavapai (Gifford 1936:268; Spier 1928:117, 123), some Florida groups (Swanton 1946:252, 281, 298), and Texas coastal groups (Krieger 1956:50, 53–54). Larger lizards (e.g., chuckwalla) that were worth catching and preparing due to their size, were eaten by some Basin-Plateau groups (Steward 1938:40), Death Valley groups (Wallace 1978), and the Yavapai (Gifford 1936:268). The Hualapai used a hooked or barbed stick to pull chuckwallas from rock crevices (McGuire 1983:32). Similar techniques were employed by the Yavapai (Gifford 1936:268) and Death Valley groups (Wallace 1978).

with an attached sharply pointed bone barb (Wallace 1978:110–112). After capturing a chuckwalla, the Yavapai killed it by seizing it by the tail and striking it against a rock. Then, either gutted or ungutted, it was cooked in hot ashes (Gifford 1936:268). The Miwok roasted lizards in hot ashes after gutting them (Barrett and Gifford 1933:137, 139). Lizards caught by the Tarahumara were skinned and roasted on a spit. The Tarahumara also used some lizard species for medicinal purposes such as remedies for toothaches, headaches, and sterility in women. The open bodies of lizards were used as a poultice for fractured bones (Bennett and Zingg 1935:127; Pennington 1963:134–135). The Yavapai occasionally fed lizards to captive eagles and hawks (Gifford 1932:240). The paucity (n = 2), small size, and unburned condition of the recovered lizard remains from the Mercado site suggest that their presence is not the result of cultural factors. In addition, lizards seek refuge and/or hibernate in burrows. Therefore, the lizard is considered intrusive (i.e., natural). Although it is possible that lizards may have been occasionally consumed by the occupants of the Mercado site during times of extreme food stress, the quantity and type of recovered faunal remains indicate that this generally was not the case. 8.3.3.3 Family Colubridae (Non-poisonous Snakes) Lampropeltis sp. (Kingsnake) (n = 2) Three species of kingsnakes, including Lampropeltis calligaster calligaster (prairie kingsnake), Lam- propeltis getulus holbrooki (speckled kingsnake), and Lampropeltis getulus splendida (desert kingsnake), occur in the vicinity of the Mercado site. Snake specimens consist of vertebrae that could be associated with any of these three species. However, of the three species, the site area is within the primary environs of the prairie kingsnake. Lampropeltis calligaster calligaster (prairie kingsnake) attains a length of 2 to 3 ft and prefers open grassland, rocky hillside pasture, and riparian woodland habitats. Its diet includes mice, rats, gophers, moles, birds, frogs, toads, lizards, and other snakes. It is egg-bearing, laying clutches in earthen cavities several inches below the ground surface during June and July (Tennant 1985:151). Lampropeltis getulus holbrooki (speckled kingsnake) is found primarily in the easternmost part of Texas, east of the West Fork of the Trinity River. It usually attains a length of 18 to 36 in, although the record length is 6 ft. It prefers damp grassy pastures and shelter beneath piles of driftwood and Mercado Site (41TR203) 224 July 2019

logs in forested bottomland. It is a powerful constrictor and is generally carnivorous, with a diet consisting of smaller vertebrates, foraging mostly at night. It is egg-bearing in early summer and hatches in late summer (Tennant 1985:168). Lampropeltis getulus splendida (desert kingsnake) is found primarily in the western half of Texas, west of the West Fork of the Trinity River. It attains a length of 22 to 38 in with a record of 60 in. It prefers subterranean environs for protection from predators. Its diet includes other snakes, lizards, and small mammals. It is egg-bearing, laying clutches in late June or July and as deep as 12 in below the ground surface (Tennant 1985:169). 8.3.3.4 Family Viperidae (Poisonous Snakes) Eight species of poisonous snakes, including Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma (western cottonmouth), Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (southern copperhead), Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus (broad-banded copperhead), Crotalus atrox (western diamondback rattlesnake), Crotalus horridus (timber or canebrake rattlesnake), Sistrurus milirius streckeri (western pygmy rattlesnake), Sistrurus catenatus tergeminus (western massasauga), and Micrurus fulvius tenere (Texas coral snake), occur in the vicinity of the Mercado site. Snake specimens consist of a vertebra that could be associated with any of these eight species. Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma (western cottonmouth) is found primarily in the eastern half of Texas that includes the West Fork of the Trinity River. It generally attains a length of 20 to 30 in, with a record of 60 in. It prefers woodland or grassland, most often within a quarter-mile of permanent water. It favors semiaquatic environments but can survive in entirely dry environments. Its diet is primarily frogs, but also includes fish, mammals as large as muskrats and young cottontails, water birds, and water snakes. It is a live-bearing snake with young born during August, September, and October (Tennant 1985:226; Werler 1978:21–22). Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus (broad-banded copperhead) is found primarily in the central part of Texas, with its eastern boundary near the West Fork of the Trinity River. It attains a length of 18 to 38 in. It prefers tree-shaded areas where leaves, logs, and branches offer terrestrial shelter. Its diet includes a variety of prey with deer and harvest mice being most common. It is live-bearing, laying clutches in July through September (Tennant 1985:230; Werler 1978:14–15).

Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (southern copperhead) is found primarily in the eastern third of Texas, with its western boundary near the West Fork of the Trinity River. It attains a length of 18 to 30 in, with a record of approximately 38 in. It prefers tree-shaded areas where leaves, logs, and branches offer terrestrial shelter. Its diet includes a variety of prey, with white-footed and harvest mice being most common. It is live-bearing, laying clutches in July through September (Tennant 1985:228; Werler 1978:12–13). Crotalus atrox (western diamondback rattlesnake) is found throughout Texas, with the exception of the easternmost part of the state. It is the largest, most widespread and most dangerous serpent in the state. It attains a length of 3 to 4 ft. It is a resident of nearly every terrestrial habitat within its range. Its diet includes mostly mammals such as mice, cottontails, jackrabbits, and ground-living birds. It is live-bearing with birthing usually in September (Tennant 1985:233–234; Werler 1978:30–31). Crotalus horridus (timber or canebrake rattlesnake) is found in the eastern third of Texas, with the Trinity River near its western boundary. It attains a length of 30 to 60 in, with a record of just over 74 in. It prefers dense, extensive thickets and also occurs in deciduous woods and second-growth pastures of unused farmland. Its diet includes mostly mammals, such as mice, cottontails, rats, and squirrels. It is live-bearing with birthing usually in late summer (Tennant 1985:238; Werler 1978:34–35). Sistrurus catenatus tergeminus (western massasauga) is found in central Texas within the Trinity River drainage. It generally attains a length of 24 in, with a record of nearly 35 in. It prefers grasslands and is primarily nocturnal, hiding below ground or in dense clumps of prickly pear cactus or bunchgrass during the daylight. Its diet includes mostly small mammals including mice, lizards, snakes, and frogs. It is live-bearing with birthing usually in July and August (Tennant 1985:246; Werler 1978:24–25). Sistrurus milirius streckeri (western pygmy rattlesnake) is found in the eastern third of Texas, with its western boundary within the vicinity of the West Fork of the Trinity River. It generally attains a length of 18 to 24 in. It prefers dry habitats and is primarily nocturnal. Its diet includes mostly small mammals as well as mice, lizards, snakes, and frogs. It is live-bearing with birthing during the summer and late summer (Werler 1978:28–29). Mercado Site (41TR203) 226 July 2019

Micrurus fulvius tenere (Texas coral snake) is found in the southeastern half of Texas with its northwestern boundary near the vicinity of the West Fork of the Trinity River. It generally attains a length of 30 in. It prefers dry habitats that include coastal plains, pine woods, hardwood forests, rocky canyons, and sandy wooded areas. It is an efficient burrower, coming to the surface after warm rains to feed upon small lizards and snakes. It is Texas’s only poisonous snake that is egg- bearing (Werler 1978:45–46). Several historic groups, such as the Miwok (Barrett and Gifford 1933:137), Shoshonean groups (Steward 1938:40), and Texas coastal peoples (Krieger 1956:50, 53–54) ate snakes. Rattlesnake meat was considered a delicacy by the Tonkawa (Sjoberg 1953:286). Most people did not consider snakes as food items, although some groups, such as the Choctaw (Campbell 1959:13), did consume them as famine foods. The Navajo had a taboo against the killing of snakes. To do so was believed to cause aches and pains in the spine (Hill 1938:176). The Western Apache generally did not molest snakes. “When snakes were killed, accidentally or otherwise, they were buried to prevent contact with snake blood or a dead snake, for if such occurred it was believed that the unfortunate person would become crippled” (Buskirk 1986:142). The Sanpoil and Nespelem believed that eating snake flesh would result in “gradual withering and death” (Ray 1932:90). Snakes were more likely to be used for non-subsistence purposes. The Gros Ventre sometimes decorated the backs of bows with snakeskins (Kroeber 1908:151). The Wishram dipped their arrow points in rattlesnake venom (Spier and Sapir 1930:199, 231). Some Southeastern groups used the teeth of venomous snakes as arrow points. In addition, some Southeastern medicine men used snake teeth for scarification and wore snakeskins, or even live snakes, on their heads (Swanton 1946:252). Among the Omaha, if someone disregarded the authority of the chiefs or disturbed the social order, official punishment (i.e., death) was administered with the poisoned end of an ironwood staff that was also tipped with rattlesnake fangs (Fletcher and La Flesche 1911:213). The Southern Miwock used rattlesnake meat as medicine (Barrett and Gifford 1933:137). Both non- poisonous and poisonous snakes have a prominent and significant role in the Snake Ceremony of the Hopi. The ceremony, which has been described as an elaborate prayer for rain (Hough 1903:51), is announced 16 days before its celebration commences. It consists of 9 days of ceremonies. The ceremonies of the first 7 days are held in secret. The final two days are public dances performed in the plaza. The dance on the first public day is the Antelope Dance, and the dance on the second public day is the Snake Dance proper (Fewkes 1897:277). Mercado Site (41TR203) 227 July 2019

The Pomo performed a ceremony which required the use of a rattlesnake. A single rattlesnake was caught with a forked stick. After its mouth was sewn up, the snake was taken to the village where a man held it between his teeth as he danced around a pole. Following the dance, the snake was placed in a hole and given an offering of feathers and beads. Then the stitches were removed from its mouth, and it was returned to the spot where it was captured. This Rattlesnake Ceremony was an integral part of the Pole Ceremony which was performed to ensure good crops and bountiful harvests (Barrett 1952:57). Most, if not all, of these types of non-subsistence functions, unfortunately, have a low probability for preservation in the archeological record. Therefore, in some situations it is not possible to determine whether the presence of snake remains is due to cultural factors. The paucity of snake remains within the vertebrate assemblage, however, suggests their presence is intrusive, not cultural. 8.3.4 Class Aves – Birds 8.3.4.1 Family Anatidae (Web-footed Waterfowl) Tribe Anserini – Geese Branta canadensis (Canada Goose) (n = 1) There were a total of 16 avian bones recovered from site 41TR203, of which only 5 were identifiable beyond class, belonging to the order Anseriformes (water fowl) including a Canada goose (Branta canadensis), small to medium duck and medium duck or goose (Anatidae), and unassignable waterfowl (Anseriformes). Overall, medium aves (e.g., duck, goose, etc.) dominate the avian assemblage. The Canada goose (Branta canadensis) is a year-round resident in the Dallas area. Its habitat consists of marshes and stream channels. Breeding begins in early March. Nesting sites include marshes, the tops of muskrat houses, islands, and cliffs. Nests are lined with down. Most clutches contain 4 to 7 eggs. Molting occurs about a month after the young hatch. The Canada goose is attracted to cultivated fields where it feeds on grains such as maize. In addition, grasses and marsh plants are also consumed (Bellrose 1976:141–164; Peterson 1990:40, Map 35; Rue 1973:7–17). Mercado Site (41TR203) 228 July 2019

Geese were important secondary food items for many peoples. Although not hunted extensively by the Gros Ventre, goose eggs were a favorite food (Kroeber 1908:149). The Miwok employed fire at night to attract geese. As the birds approached, they were killed with clubs (Barrett and Gifford 1933:187). Whenever available, geese were eaten by the Pomo, who usually hunted them with bows and wood-pointed arrows, and slings. The Wintun and some Pomo groups even hunted geese with a type of bola. After the birds were plucked, they were broiled (Barrett 1952:100, 140, 148). Geese also had non-subsistence-related functions. Goose feathers are used ceremonially by various Puebloan groups (Beidleman 1956:18). The Zuni use the feathers of this bird on prayer sticks. In addition, ceremonial dance masks and ritual objects are decorated with goose feathers (Ladd 1963:81). The Pomo used goose feathers in making some clothes. In addition, down was used for a head-net. Whistles and ear ornaments were manufactured from the wing bones (Barrett 1952:100). Although the Canada goose is presently considered a choice game bird (Martin et al. 1951:51), the paucity of goose remains (n = 1) recovered from the Mercado site suggests geese were not generally the focus of subsistence strategies. They were probably obtained opportunistically, possibly attracted to cultivated fields. 8.3.5 Class Mammalia – Mammals There are 7,174 mammal bones recovered from site 41TR203, of which 2,018 (28.1 percent) are unassignable to a size designation due to the fragmented condition of the bone. A total of 5,155 are assignable to a size category. Overall, large mammals (bison-size) account for 1,449 specimens or 28.1 percent of the mammal assemblage. Medium-large mammals (deer/pronghorn-size) account for 868 specimens, or 16.8 percent of the mammal assemblage. Medium-size mammals (dog/coyote- and beaver-size) account for 34 specimens or 0.7 percent of the mammal assemblage. A general grouping of medium or large mammals accounts for 2,567 specimens or 49.8 percent of mammal assemblage. Higher body mass mammals, such as bison-size and deer/antelope-size, dominate the assemblage. Small-medium (e.g., fox and raccoon-size) and small mammals (e.g., lagomorph- and squirrel-size) account for 18 specimens, or 0.3 percent, and 179 specimens, or 3.5 percent, account for the mammal assemblage, respectively. Very small mammals and microtines, such as cotton rats, pocket gophers, harvest mouse, and ground squirrel, comprise 0.8 percent (n = 41) of the mammalian assemblage (see Table 8.1).

8.3.5.1 Family Leporidae (Rabbits, Hares) Sylvilagus sp. (Cottontail) (n = 34) Although the cottontail (Sylvilagus sp.) specimens were not identified to the species level, two species, including the swamp rabbit (S. aquaticus) and eastern cottontail (S. floridanus), of this small game mammal may be represented within the faunal assemblage. The eastern cottontail is the most widespread, occurring throughout the state (Bailey 1931:54; Davis and Schmidly 1994:86–92; Findley et al. 1975:89). The majority, if not all, of the cottontail remains are probably of this species (Bailey 1913:18, 33, 1931:54; Davis and Schmidly 1994:86– 92). It inhabits brushland and marginal areas and seldom ventures far from brush cover. Brush or shrubs are necessary for resting and hiding (Bailey 1931:54–60; Chapman and Willner 1978:2–3; Clark and Stromberg 1987:80; Findley 1987:57; Zeveloff 1988:92). This cottontail subsists mainly on grasses, forbs, and shrubs (Bailey 1931:55–56; Chapman et al. 1982:102; Chapman and Willner 1978:3). Cultivated plants, including maize, are also eaten (Bailey 1931:55– 56; Chapman et al. 1982:101). Much of the cottontail’s water requirements are provided by its food (Bailey 1923:71–72; Chapman et al. 1982:102; Findley 1987:57; Zeveloff 1988:92). The archaeofaunal assemblage may contain remains of the swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus), but it is not very likely. The Mercado site is at the western boundary of the swamp rabbit (Bailey 1913:43, 1931:63), which prefers poorly drained river bottoms and coastal marshes. It is adapted to a semi-aquatic habitat and is at home in the water (Davis and Schmidly 1994:87). The cottontail has a restricted home range of usually 1 to 5 acres and is normally active early in the morning and at night. Predation by a variety of animals, including bobcats, coyotes, foxes, raccoons, skunks, raptors, snakes, is the major cause of cottontail deaths, and it is the primary regulator of cottontail abundance (Chapman et al. 1982:106—107; Clark and Stromberg 1987:78– 79; Ingles 1941:236; Zeveloff 1988:88, 92). The cottontail, however, is an r-selected mammal. Its high mortality rate is offset by a high reproductive rate. Breeding generally occurs from mid or late winter through late summer. A single female may have as many as 6 litters, usually of 4 to 7 individuals, per year. The first and last litters of the year tend to be smaller. Female desert cottontail born in the spring are capable of breeding during their first summer, offsetting their low litter sizes. The young are born hairless and blind in a pear-shaped, fur-lined nest dug 6 to 10 Mercado Site (41TR203) 230 July 2019

inches into the ground (Chapman et al. 1982:94; Clark and Stromberg 1987:78, 81; Findley 1987:57–58; Hoffmeister 1986:131, 137; Martin et al. 1951:241–242; Zeveloff 1988:93). Cottontails were hunted for food and other uses by many historic peoples, such as the Navajo (Hill 1938:171), Hopi (Beaglehole 1936:11–15), Omaha (Fletcher and La Flesche (1911:104, 376, 451), and Chippewa (Densmore 1929:44). Although cottontails were occasionally killed during communal hunts or drives for jackrabbits, different hunting strategies were utilized to procure cottontails due to their behavior. They do not usually venture far from cover and when alarmed, they seek shelter in burrows. In addition, “cottontails often move along regular paths, wearing trails or runways in the vegetation, snow, or underbrush piles” (Schwartz and Schwartz 1981:104). Thus, they are easy to find. Finally, cottontails do not run as fast as, nor do they run as far as, jackrabbits. All these factors make it easier for cottontails to be procured by individual hunters using simple techniques such as snares and traps. Basin-Plateau groups hunted cottontails with snares and with bows and arrows (Steward 1938:39). The Omaha used headless arrows with sharpened shafts for hunting rabbits (Fletcher and La Flesche 1911:451). The Sanpoil also killed rabbits with bows and arrows (Ray 1932:87). The Hopi used deadfalls and snares to catch rabbits (Beaglehole 1936:17). Among the Northern Shoshone, cottontails were hunted by boys with the aid of dogs (Lowie 1909:185). Some groups such as the Chiricahua Apache employed long sticks to dislodge rabbits from burrows. An end was twisted into the fur and then the animal was pulled out (Opler 1941:326). Before thrusting the stick into the hole, the Navajo worked one end down to a point and abraded it so that it would catch in the fur easier. If the burrow had two openings, however, the Navajo built a fire in one and smoked the animal out. Cottontails caught in the jackrabbit drives were clubbed (Hill 1938:171). After skinning rabbits and removing the internal organs, the Pomo pounded the carcasses to a pulp. This reduced the bones to small fragments that could be easily consumed with the meat which was broiled (Barrett 1952:63). After the cottontails were skinned and cleaned, the Shoshone cooked them in the hot ashes (Lowie 1924:197). Although the Havasupai usually roasted rabbits in ashes, roasting pits may also have been used (Spier 1928:117). The Chippewa prepared the carcasses two ways: Mercado Site (41TR203) 231 July 2019

a. The meat was removed from the bones, roasted, and pounded. The bones were then pounded with what meat remained on them. The pounded bones were boiled in a small kettle and the grease skimmed off and eaten with the pounded meat. b. The meat was cut in pieces and dried, along with the bones. The bones were pounded into a powder and mixed with the dry meat and any available grease. This was eaten dry, and not boiled at the time of using (Densmore 1929:44). As stated earlier, cottontails also had non-subsistence functions. Caddo women used rabbit skins dyed red for tying their hair behind their heads (Espinosa 1927:177). The Sanpoil used rabbit fur for caps, mittens, and blankets (Ray 1932:87). The Ute (Lowie 1924:216) and Plains Cree (Mandelbaum 1940:214) also had rabbit skin blankets. These were worn as robes and/or functioned as bedding. Although rabbit skin robes were commonly made with only jackrabbit skins by many peoples, some groups, such as the Havasupai (Spier 1928:188, 190) and Shoshone (Lowie 1924:216), also used cottontail skins. The cup-and-pin game was played with either a cottontail or jackrabbit skull by the Havasupai (Spier 1928:340). Lepus californicus (Black-tailed Jackrabbit) (n = 8) The black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) occurs throughout the entire state and inhabits deserts and open short-grass prairies with scattered shrubs. In addition, this jackrabbit is very adaptable to agricultural conditions (Davis and Schmidly 1994:92–94). Areas of heavy brush or woods are avoided (Cockrum 1982:134–135; Dunn et al. 1982:133; Findley 1987:54–55; Findley et al. 1975:93–94; Hoffmeister 1986:140–141; Zeveloff 1988:98). “They are found in mesquite, sagebrush, desertscrub, into open piñon-juniper” (Hoffmeister 1986:141). The black-tailed jackrabbit is most common, however, in open, treeless habitats (Findley 1987:55). The jackrabbit usually feeds at night on grasses, mesquite, and herbs. Cultivated crops are also consumed. As with the cottontail, the jackrabbit obtains protein and certain B vitamins by consuming its soft droppings. This leporid, like the cottontail, depends on succulent or green vegetation for water. Surface water, however, is drunk when available. The size of the jackrabbit home range is dependent upon the availability of food, cover, and water. The black-tailed jackrabbit has a home range that varies from 4 to 75 ha. Daylight hours are usually spent in its form, an unlined hollow scratched into the ground. Forms are found both in the open and in dense vegetation. The breeding season extends from mid or late winter to late summer. As a result, a Mercado Site (41TR203) 232 July 2019

single female may have as many as 7 litters, usually of 2 to 4 individuals, per year. The young are born in shallow depressions or excavations that are sometimes fur-lined. Unlike cottontails, the newborns are precocial (more independent). They are fully furred, can see, and are able to move about. Because the black-tailed jackrabbit is an r-selected species, the yearly number and size of litters per breeding female help to offset the high mortality rates. The jackrabbit is subject to predation by a wide variety of predators, such as snakes, eagles, hawks, owls, coyotes, foxes, bobcats, skunks, and humans (Clark and Stromberg 1987:84–87; Cockrum 1982:134; Dunn et al. 1982; Findley 1987:56; Hoffmeister 1986:141–142; Schwartz and Schwartz 1981:114–121; Zeveloff 1988:84, 98–100). Although some people consider jackrabbit flesh unpalatable or inferior to that of the cottontail (e.g., Buskirk 1986:134; Castetter and Opler 1936:25; Dunn et al. 1982:137; Opler 1941:325–326; TGFOC 1945:133–134), ethnographic data indicate jackrabbits were exploited as food resources and as raw material sources by many peoples, such as the Navajo (Hill 1938:170–171), Havasupai (Spier 1928:108), Omaha (Fletcher and La Flesche 1911:104), Cheyenne (Grinnell 1923:I:247, II:218, 269), Coahuiltecans (Ruecking 1953:481), and Basin-Plateau groups (Steward 1938:38–39). Jackrabbit behavior is ideal for communal hunts and drives. When alarmed, the jackrabbit may remain motionless or run away slowly or very rapidly. It can attain speeds of 30 to 35 mi (56 km) per hour over short distances. Normally, a jump covers 5 to 10 ft (1.5 to 3 m), but the distance increases to 15 to 20 ft (4.6 to 6 m) when the animal is speeding. It can also jump as high as 5.5 ft (1.7 m) (Dunn et al. 1982:134; Findley 1987:56; Schwartz and Schwartz 1981:119). Therefore, hunting the jackrabbit with a bow and arrow is difficult. Communal efforts are more efficient. Although the Hopi held communal rabbit hunts at irregular intervals through the year, such hunts usually occurred in early summer and fall when the crops had to be protected from the rabbits or when rabbits were needed daily to feed captive eagles. The hunters formed a two-winged circle and, as they walked toward the center of it, they flushed the rabbits from the bushes and killed them with curved or straight pointed throwing sticks (Beaglehole 1936:11–17). The Navajo clubbed the jackrabbits as they tried to escape an encircled area. Although nets and corrals were not used by the Navajo when hunting rabbits, fire was occasionally employed. After the animals were encircled with fire, they were clubbed to death as the fire closed in on them (Hill 1938:170–171). Basin- Plateau groups also used fire surrounds but not very often “because desert shrubs are usually too widely spaced for a fire to spread” (Steward 1938:39). Instead, the jackrabbits were driven into a Mercado Site (41TR203) 233 July 2019

large semicircular arrangement of long, low nets where the animals were killed with sticks or bows and arrows (Steward 1938:38–39). After driving them into huge nets, as much as 100 yards long, the Paiutes shot the rabbits with arrows (Lowie 1924:196–197). The Havasupai did not encircle the rabbits. Instead, they employed a straight formation to drive the animals which were then shot, never clubbed (Spier 1928:112). Communal hunts could last for several days or as much as a month (e.g., see Lowie 1924:196–198; Steward 1938:97). Western farmers used large rabbit drives in the late 1800s to control jackrabbit populations (Dunn et al. 1982:138). Jackrabbits “tend to graze forage more severely than cattle” (Findley 1987:56). After the rabbits were skinned and dressed, the Hopi cooked the meat in a pot with maize and squash (Beaglehole 1936:14). The Havasupai roasted rabbits in ashes and possibly in roasting pits (Spier 1928:117). Shoshonean groups employed several methods to cook rabbits, including hot ashes and watertight baskets in which hot stones were placed for heating the contents. In addition, some of the Shoshonean groups pounded the bones very fine and consumed them with the meat (Lowie 1924:196–197, 233). Most of the aforementioned groups made jackrabbit skin robes and/or blankets. The construction techniques were basically similar. Therefore, only one, that of the Plains Cree, is presented: A rabbit was flayed by breaking through the skin at the tendons of the hind legs and the whole hide peeled back over the head. The hide was then cut in one continuous strip, 3 to 4 inches wide, and hung to dry for 2 days. It soon curled so that the fur was outermost on all sides. Four poles were lashed together to make a rectangular frame. A strip of hide was laced to the top of the frame and a line of perforations punched along its length. Similar strips were attached to the two vertical sides of the frame. The initial strand of fur was passed in and out of the top holes and then through one hole on the side strip where it was looped back on itself. The “simple loop” netting technique was used. When one strand ran out, another was knotted to it (Mandelbaum 1940:214). Jackrabbits also had other non-subsistence uses. Some Northern Shoshone men wore rabbit skin caps with several rabbit tails attached (Lowie 1909:181). Sometimes, Havasupai women used tubes made from jackrabbit leg bones as rattles on their belts (Spier 1928:188). The cup-and-pin game of the Havasupai utilizes the jackrabbit.

The cup and pin game consists of a cotton-tail or jackrabbit skull fastened to a sharply pointed twig, about 8 cm. long, by a slightly longer cord. The base of the skull is cut away, the teeth drawn, and it is boiled free of meat. The cord is tied behind the incisors. Holding the stick, the skull is swung toward the body and caught on the point. Catching by any hole scores 1; any tooth hole, 6; ear hole, 10; incisor hole, 40; and if the stick splits off in a foramen palatinum, the game is won. Three hundred or more counters are made of soapweed leaves split into narrow pieces, 10 cm. long. The side which gets all the counters wins (Spier 1928:340–341). 8.3.5.2 Family Sciuridae (Squirrels and Allies) Spermophilus sp. (Ground Squirrel) (n = 3) Four ground squirrel species, including the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), eastern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), eastern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans), and black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), occur in the vicinity of the Mercado site, 41TR203 (Bailey 1931:109–117; Davis and Schmidley 1994:102–120; Findley et al. 1987:70–73; Zeveloff 1988:131–142). The thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) is a small ground squirrel whose range is from northern Texas and in a corridor extending from Tarrant and Dallas counties in north-central Texas south to Atascosa, Bee, and Calhoun counties along the Gulf Coast. They prefer short-grass prairies. They live in burrows which radiate well-marked paths to their feeding grounds. These squirrels are strictly diurnal, but their annual cycle of activity includes a very long period of hibernation that lasts up to 240 days. Adults enter hibernation in July and the young in August or September. They emerge from the middle of February to the first of March. Their diet is green grasses and herbs but also includes seeds, flower heads, and insects. Generally, one litter is produced annually with young numbering 2 to 13. The young are self-reliant after 6 weeks. They mature sexually at about 9 to 10 months (Davis and Schmidly 1994:108–110). Several groups hunted ground squirrels for food and other uses. Even early Euro-Americans ate these animals and sometimes used the skins for clothing (Tomich 1982:202). Basin-Plateau groups caught ground squirrels by pouring water into the burrows and capturing the animals as they tried to escape. Digging sticks or rodent skewers were used to remove them from their burrows. They Mercado Site (41TR203) 235 July 2019

were also smoked out. Away from their burrows, they were killed with deadfalls or were run down and dispatched with sticks and stones (Lowie 1924:199; Steward 1938:40). “The Tepehuan hunt five species of squirrels that are killed either because they are edible or because they prey upon newly planted corn fields” (Pennington 1969:134). Two of these species are ground squirrels that are either killed with bows and arrows or caught in a rock or basket trap (Pennington 1969:124). The Sanpoil flooded ground squirrels out of their burrows and then killed them with clubs (Ray 1932:87). The Havasupai used deadfalls to kill squirrels. “Traps are placed on the rodent trails in the fields and near storehouses to catch the squirrels and rats which root up the corn, tear their way into the storehouses, etc.” (Spier 1928:113). The Yavapai caught ground squirrels in stone deadfall traps. They also extracted them from their burrows with sticks (Gifford 1936:266–267). The Miwok hunted squirrels mostly in the winter when they were fat. They were shot with bows and arrows or captured by dogs (Barrett and Gifford 1933:137, 183). The Miwok (Barrett and Gifford 1933: 183) and Havasupai (Spier 1928:117) did not preserve squirrel meat, but rather prepared it for immediate consumption. If the animal was to be boiled, the Havasupai first eviscerated it and removed the skin, head, and tail. If it was to be roasted, it was only eviscerated (Spier 1928:117). The Yavapai cooked ground squirrels in an earth oven after they eviscerated and skinned them (Gifford 1936:267). After the ground squirrels were skinned and drawn, the Tepehuan roasted them either on spits or on coals (Pennington 1969:124). Great Basin peoples prepared ground squirrels for consumption by first burning off their fur in an open fire. “They might then have been pit roasted whole, sometimes eviscerated and stuffed with wild onions. Ground squirrels…were also boiled and pulverized in a mortar or on a metate” (Fowler 1986:82). Preparation of these animals included processing the bones and entrails (Fowler 1986:82). In addition to eating the ground squirrel, the Yavapai used its skin for a tobacco bag: Ground squirrels taken for food, normally skins not saved. August was the best time to obtain squirrel skins for tobacco bags. Deadfall traps were used and were baited with prickly pear. To skin the squirrel, cuts were made on the inside of both hind legs and carried to the anal opening. No cut made full length of abdomen. Cuts in the legs were later sewed, leaving openings 1 ½ in. in diameter for the insertion of tobacco. No brains used on squirrel skin, which was held in a worker’s lap or on his leg and rubbed with a small stone (Gifford 1936:273). Mercado Site (41TR203) 236 July 2019

Sciurus niger (Eastern Fox Squirrel) The eastern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) is a large tree squirrel whose range includes all of eastern and central Texas. They are adapted to a wide variety of forest habitats, with open upland forests of mixed trees being preferred, particularly mature oak-hickory woodland. Hollow trees are preferred den sites, otherwise they build outside leaf nests consisting of leaves and twigs. A single fox squirrel occupies an area of at least 4 ha in extent. Acorns are the mainstay diet and are buried in the fall in individual caches for winter use. They also have a fondness for green corn. Mating occurs in January and February and again in May and June. Females average four offspring per year. Sexual maturity is attained in 10 to 11 months (Davis and Schmidly 1994:117–118). Glaucomys volans (Eastern Flying Squirrel) The eastern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) is a small squirrel with a flattened, bushy tail. Flying squirrels do not actually fly but travel by gliding from one tree to another, with glides being 6–9 m in length. Its range is the eastern third of Texas with Tarrant County being near its western boundary. These nocturnal squirrels inhabit forested areas where suitable trees are present to afford den sites. They are sociable and tend to live together in groups. Holes in stumps are preferred den sites, otherwise they utilize almost any cavity that is dry and large enough. Nuts and acorns are their mainstay diet, but they also procure insect larvae, beetles, young and eggs of birds, persimmon, and cultivated corn. Food is cached in holes in trees for winter use. Mating occurs in February and March and again in July. Females average three to four offspring per year during a single mating. Sexual maturity is attained in one year (Davis and Schmidly 1994:119–120). The Yavapai caught tree squirrels in stone deadfall traps. After they were skinned, they were roasted in an earth oven (Gifford 1936:267). The Navajo killed tree squirrels with bows and arrows, skinned and cleaned them, and cooked them on hot coals. Sometimes caps were made from the skins (Hill 1938:172). “The skins were tanned and hung on cradles for the protection of babies” (Hill 1938:172) in case of a fall. The Tepehuan killed tree squirrels with bows and arrows, with stones thrown either by hand or with a sling, or by felling trees in which they were hiding. After the squirrels were skinned and eviscerated, they were roasted either on a spit or on coals (Pennington 1969:124). Mercado Site (41TR203) 237 July 2019

Cynomys ludovicianus (Black-tailed Prairie Dog) The eastern boundary of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) range is in Tarrant County (Davis and Schmidly 1994:114). It inhabits semi-arid, short-grass prairies, avoiding stands of tall grass. It is a highly social animal that lives in very large colonies that can extend over large expanses of plains. Family groups retain some cohesion and independence within the well- organized colonies. Communication among colony members is both vocal and visual. A dome or doughnut-shaped mound surrounds the entrance to the burrow which may extend almost vertically to a depth of 5 m before leveling off. The entrance mound prevents water from entering the burrow. Much of the winter is spent in the burrow. Breeding occurs in late winter, and a single litter of about four young is born in late March and early April. The black-tailed prairie dog consumes the stems, leaves, and seeds of a variety of grasses, weeds, and shrubs. The black-footed ferret, an endangered species, was the most specialized predator of prairie dogs. Formerly, both species had nearly identical distributions. Other predators include hawks, coyotes, foxes, bobcats, badgers, and snakes (Davis and Schmidly 1994:112–115; Findley 1987:67–68; Findley et al. 1975:130–132; Hoffmeister 1986:194–196; Zeveloff 1988:145, 147). Prairie dogs are not known to store food in their burrows. During the summer, they are active early in the morning and late in the afternoon. During the winter, they stay underground when it is very cold. Although it is not known if they hibernate, they generally emerge from their burrows between mid-February and late March. Prairie dog populations are periodically decimated by diseases, such as plague (Findley 1987:68; Hoffmeister 1986:196–198; Pizzimenti and Hoffmann 1973:3; Zeveloff 1988:145, 149–150). Prairie dogs have a reputation as agricultural pests. Because they are believed to compete with livestock for food on grasslands, eradication (e.g., poisoning) campaigns have been aimed at prairie dogs. As a result, they have been extirpated throughout much of their range (Findley 1987:68; Hoffmeister 1986:195; Zeveloff 1988:145, 150). However, these rodents are not as harmful as was once maintained. Because they tend to be most numerous on ranges that have already been overgrazed by livestock, they could be a symptom rather than a cause of poor range conditions. In fact, they may actually hasten the recovery of poor rangelands, for they tend to feed on plants typical of a range’s early stages.

encourages the growth of climax plant species, those appearing at the end of the successional sequence. It is these climax plants which provide high-quality livestock forage (Zeveloff 1988:145). The burrowing activities of these mammals can severely impact buried cultural deposits if their colonies are established in a buried site. The potential for faunal turbation is great. The Hopi used deadfalls and snares to catch prairie dogs (Beaglehole 1936:17). Northern Shoshone boys used their dogs to hunt prairie dogs (Lowie 1909:185). These animals were dug out of their burrows, drowned out of their burrows, or shot with bows and arrows by the Navajo (Hill 1938:171). Special arrows were used in hunting prairie dogs. These were unfeathered, and the points had only one barb. (Formerly, when arrow points were found, one barb was broken off, or bone points of this pattern were made. With the introduction of iron, points of the same type were hammered out) (Hill 1938:171). A piece of mica, placed in a split stick, was used by the Navajo to blind a prairie dog as it emerged from its burrow. It was then shot and pulled out by means of a barbed arrow (Hill 1938:171–172). After heavy rains, flood waters were directed into holes to drown out the prairie dogs. Water was also carried to the holes for this purpose. The hole was first plugged with manure and grass, and a basin built around it. When the basin was filled, the plug was removed, allowing a large volume of water to descend into the hole at one time (Hill 1938:172). If several frightened prairie dogs ran into the same hole, the Navajo dug them out with a digging stick. In addition, the Navajo used traps to catch these animals. Nooses attached to a rock or stake were placed at the burrow entrances (Hill 1938:172). Similar methods were utilized by Basin- Plateau groups to procure prairie dogs. “They were either dug with a digging stick, pulled from their burrows by means of a rodent skewer, smoked out, flooded out, or killed with deadfall traps” (Steward 1938:40). The Yavapai caught prairie dogs in stone deadfall traps (Gifford 1936:266). The Navajo generally used only one method for cooking prairie dogs. After the carcass was cleaned, the liver, lungs, and fat were placed in the body cavity, and it was salted. The opening was Mercado Site (41TR203) 239 July 2019

pinned closed with twigs. “Then the hair was singed in an open fire and the animal buried in the ashes to roast” (Hill 1938:172). The Yavapai cooked prairie dogs in hot ashes after first cleaning and skinning them (Gifford 1936:266). 8.3.5.3 Family Geomyidae (Pocket Gophers) Geomys bursarius (Plains Pocket Gopher) (n = 2) Plains pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius), the only pocket gopher species occurring in the vicinity of the Mercado site, 41TR203, typically inhabits sandy soils where the topsoil is 10 cm or more in depth. Clayey soils are usually avoided. The pocket gopher is a highly fossorial rodent that lives a solitary life almost entirely underground. Owls, hawks, snakes, badgers, weasels, foxes, and coyotes are major predators. It subsists on a wide variety of herbaceous plants, grasses, bulbs, tubers, roots, and cacti. In addition, it also consumes crops. Feeding tunnels parallel the surface and average between 15 and 30 cm in depth (Bee et al. 1981:106; Hoffmeister 1986:223–224; Zeveloff 1988:161, 165). Depending on soil conditions, burrow systems can vary from less than 30 cm to more than 1 m in depth (Felthauser and McInroy 1983:557). During the winter, pocket gophers also burrow through the snow, depositing soil excavated from their underground burrows in the snow tunnels (Hoffmeister 1986:225). Breeding occurs from February through August. Litters consist of about 3 to 4 individuals. The young are born in a nest within the burrow. The nest may be as much as 1.6 m deep (Davis and Schmidly 1994:126–127; Hoffmeister 1986:225). Because the pocket gopher is highly fossorial, it mixes and deepens the soil. A single individual can displace 1 to 3 or more tons of soil annually (Kennerly 1964:428; Richens 1966:533). Consequently, the impact of faunal turbation via this rodent on the cultural deposits of archeological sites yielding remains of this burrower should be considered. Recent research has focused on the effects of pocket gopher burrowing activities on the distribution of archeological materials (Bocek 1986; Erlandson 1984; Johnson 1989). Several groups ate pocket gophers, including the Gosiute Shoshone (Steward 1938:138–139), Navajo (Hill 1938:172), Tepehuan (Pennington 1969:124–125), and Plains Cree (Mandelbaum 1940:199). Pocket gophers and other small burrowing rodents were important sources of food for the Basin-Plateau groups. In addition to using the hunting methods previously mentioned to obtain prairie dogs, pocket gophers were also run down and killed with sticks and stones if they were Mercado Site (41TR203) 240 July 2019

observed away from their burrows (Steward 1938:40). The Plains Cree caught gophers with snares. “A sinew noose was placed over a gopher’s hole. The other end of the line was held by the snarer. When a gopher appeared, the line was jerked” (Mandelbaum 1940:199). A similar technique was used by the Gros Ventre (Kroeber 1908:149). After the gophers were skinned and cleaned, the Gosiute Shoshone dried the meat without removing the bones (Steward 1938:139). The Tepehuan skinned and cleaned the gophers before they were either roasted on a spit or boiled with other meat (Pennington 1969:125). These rodents also had nonfood functions. The Navajo drank a mixture consisting of water and gopher stomach and flesh as a remedy for stomach aches (Hill 1938:172). Such a usage would not be visible in the archeological record. 8.3.5.4 Family Castoridae (Beaver) Castor canadensis (Beaver) (n = 8) cf. Castor canadensis (Beaver) (n = 1) C.canadensis/Erethizon dorsatum (Beaver/Porcupine) (n = 1) At the time of European contact, beaver lived throughout North America, “except for the arctic tundra, most of Florida, and the southwestern deserts” (Zeveloff 1988:190). Intensive trapping during the nineteenth century exterpated or reduced the beaver, a semi-aquatic mammal and the largest extant rodent in North America, throughout much of its range by the early 1900s. As a result of restocking programs since that time, beaver now thrive in much of their former range. In terms of the Project area, beaver presently occur along the Trinity River and its tributaries (Cockrum 1982:103; Findley et al. 1975:187; Hall and Kelson 1959:547; Hoffmeister 1986:319; Zeveloff 1988:189). The beaver is associated with permanent bodies of water. It is abundant along permanent watercourses where its preferred foods, including cottonwoods, willows, aspens, or alders, are plentiful. Non-woody vegetation, such as corn and various water plants, is also eaten. Food is stored for winter consumption. Two types of house structures are constructed. One is the familiar dome-shaped, mud and stick lodge surrounded by open water. The other is a bank house with an underwater entrance, but the main chamber is above the high-water line. The dam is its other Mercado Site (41TR203) 241 July 2019

familiar construction. A single litter, usually of three or four young, is born in nests within the houses in April or May. Besides humans, principal predators include coyotes, dogs, wolves, bobcats, mountain lions, otters, and minks (Cockrum 1982:102; Findley et al. 1975:187–188; Hoffmeister 1986:319–321; Jenkins and Busher 1979; Schwartz and Schwartz 1981:174–181; Zeveloff 1988:189–192). Historically, the beaver was exploited as a food resource and for its pelt. It was the mainstay of the North American fur trade for almost three hundred years (~1550–1840). The Navajo obtained beaver along the San Juan River. “Returning raiding parties passing there broke the dams and, when the water drained out, dug the beaver from their holes” (Hill 1938:170). Shaman headbands were made from the skins. The castor was burned as incense in the Bead Way chant and was burned and inhaled as a cure for bad colds (Hill 1938:170). Tonkawa men occasionally tied their hair with beaver fur (Newcomb 1961:138). The Osage hunted beaver for meat and pelts (La Flesche 1932:221; Mathews 1961:447). Prior to the appearance of the Euro-American, the Cheyenne used dogs to hunt beaver for food and clothing (Grinnell 1923:I:295–296). The Chippewa trapped beaver, the tail of which was considered a great delicacy due to its fat content (Densmore 1929:44). The Crow made glue with the hide from a beaver tail (Lowie 1922:231). 8.3.5.5 Family Muridae (Mice and Rats) Reithrodontomys sp. (Harvest Mouse) (n = 1) Two species of harvest mice occur in the vicinity of the Mercado site, 41TR203, the plains harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys montanus) and fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens). These mice prefer to inhabit climax, or nearly climax, well-drained grasslands. Their nests are composed of fine grass compacted into small balls and are either in bunch grass or just beneath the ground in their burrows. Their diet consists of green parts and seeds of a variety of plants, including small grains. They breed year-long with 2 to 5 per litter. They are sexually mature in approximately 2 months (Davis and Schmidly 1994:159–165). Mercado Site (41TR203) 242 July 2019

Sigmodon sp. (Cotton Rats) (n = 3) Sigmodon hispidus (Hispid Cotton Rat) (n = 6) The Hispid Cotton Rat (Sigmodon hispidus) occurs throughout the entire State of Texas. It is a moderately large robust rat that inhabits tall-grass areas where such grasses as bluestem, cordgrass, or sedges offer both freedom of movement under a protective canopy and an adequate food supply. They form a network of interconnecting travel ways. They live in dens at the bases of small, low clumps of mesquite in otherwise nearly barren terrain. Nests are built either in chambers off underground burrows or above ground in dense clumps of grass, piles of brush, or other areas that offer some concealment and protection. Nests are globular, about 12 cm in diameter and are composed of shredded grasses and weeds. Their diet is almost exclusively plant material, but they also feed on the eggs of ground-nesting birds. Their breeding is prolific, producing several litters of 2 to 10 young averaging five times per year. They are subject to violent fluctuations in populations with eruptions in populations followed by crashes, usually as a result of disease (Davis and Schmidly 1994: 188–189). Neotoma sp. (Woodrat) (n = 1) The Mercado site, 41TR203, is within the range of two woodrat (Neotoma) species, including eastern woodrat (N. floridana) and southern plains woodrat (N. micropus). Each tends to occupy different habitats. The Eeastern woodrat (N. floridana), found in the eastern third of Texas west to Wichita, has a wide range of habitat that includes swamplands, forested uplands, and arid plains. These rats do not construct surface nests, but rather live in burrows at the bases of trees. They normally live in underground burrows with dens or build a large surface house at the base of a tree. They also take over the burrows dug by other and larger animals. Their diet consists almost exclusively of vegetable matter which provides both food and water. In east-central Texas, they feed on acorns, yaupon berries, and the leaves of oaks, yaupon, French mulberry, green briar, peppervine, rattan, and hackberry. The breeding season extends from January to September with litters ranging from one to five and up to three litters annually. Major predators include owls, snakes, ringtails, coyotes, badgers, bobcats, and weasels (Bailey 1931:175–180; Cockrum 1982:114–115; Davis 1974:221; Davis and Schmidly 1994:192–193; Findley 1987:97–100; Findley et al. 1975:241–242; Hoffmeister 1986:406–407; Zeveloff 1988:209–210).

The southern plains woodrat (N. micropus) prefers xeric or semi-arid grasslands with thickets of cacti, mesquite, or thornbush. It also inhabits crevices in rocky outcrops. Bulky, conspicuous houses are commonly constructed of sticks, cactus joints, and thorns. These houses are built at the base of shrubs and cacti or in rock outcrops. Protected within the house, the nest consists of dry grasses and fine plant fibers. Within the structure, tunnels are used for food, resting chambers, and escape routes. In addition, an underground burrow system may be present. Two or more litters, of usually two or three young, are born from early spring until August. A variety of plant materials is consumed, including leaves, seeds, roots, berries, and nuts. Prickly pear blades and various cacti fruits are favored foods. Major predators include snakes, owls, hawks, coyotes, foxes, and bobcats (Bee et al. 1981:140–141; Davis 1974:218–219; Findley 1987:97–100; Findley et al. 1975:238– 240). The woodrat is often called a “pack rat” from its habit of collecting all sorts of objects, both cultural and non-cultural, and incorporating them into the den or nest. This rodent can disturb the artifact distribution patterns of a site and/or create pseudo-features (Hester and Hill 1980; Hoffman and Hays 1987). Burned woodrat houses, including contents, look suspiciously like prehistoric hearths (Hester and Hill 1980). Therefore, woodrats are a potential agent of faunal turbation at sites in which their bones are found. However, the presence of woodrat bones in a site’s faunal assemblage is not necessarily indicative of intrusion. As suggested by ethnographic data, the woodrat was exploited by several groups. Woodrats were eaten by the Jicarilla Apache (Opler 1936:207), the Navajo (Bailey 1931:185; Hill 1938:173), Walapai (McGuire 1983:32), Basin-Plateau groups (Steward 1938:40, 83, 158), Kiliwa (Michelsen 1967:74), Yavapai (Gifford 1932:205, 1936:266), and Chiricahua Apache (Opler 1941:325). This rodent was a staple in the diet of peoples in southern Texas (Hester and Hill 1980:318). Ethnographic literature also mentions unspecified rats (possibly woodrats) as having been consumed by groups such as the Omaha (Fletcher and La Flesche 1911:104) and Tonkawa (Newcomb 1961:139). The flesh of this rodent has been described as “tender, sweet, and delicious as young rabbit or quail” (Bailey 1931:180). Basin-Plateau groups used woodrat hunting techniques similar to those for ground squirrels and prairie dogs (Steward 1938:40). The Navajo killed woodrats after digging them from their nests (Hill 1938:173). The Chiricahua, working in pairs, procured woodrats with a different technique.

While a hunter poked a stick into a nest opening, another hunter waited for the prey at the other opening. When it came out, it was shot with a headless arrow that had a sharpened shaft. Sometimes the woodrats were hit with a stick when they tried to escape from the nest (Opler 1941:325). The Hopi utilized deadfalls and snares to catch rats (Beaglehole 1936:17). The Kiliwa poked a pole into the nest. When the frightened animal attempted to flee, it was stomped by a hunting companion’s feet, killed with rocks, or shot with an arrow. If the woodrat refused to emerge, the nest was burned (Michelsen 1967:75). A hooked stick was used by the Walapai to remove woodrats from their nests (McGuire 1983:32). The Yavapai employed several methods for procuring woodrats. Stone deadfall traps were used. Woodrat nests in cacti or bushes were pulled apart with the curved end of 6- to 8-ft sticks. The rats were killed as they tried to escape. In addition, the hunters took the piñon nuts stored in the nests. Woodrats were also forced from their nests by poking the straight end of the long sticks into their nests. The woodrats were killed with bows and arrows or with sticks. If a hunter seized a woodrat by its neck with his bare hands, the rodent was struck against the rocks to kill it (Gifford 1932:217, 1936:266). The Tepehuan trapped woodrats with an inverted, tilted earthenware bowl “supported by a figure-four release mechanism and baited with a few grains corn or wheat (Pennington 1969:125). Michelsen (1967:76) provides a detailed description of the preparation of a woodrat for consumption by the Kiliwa: Preparations for eating are quick and efficient. First a fire is built of small branches. While the flames are high the whole animal is tossed into the fire. When the hair is well singed the rat is removed with a pair of sticks, used as tongs, and placed on a branch of fresh juniper or some similar evergreen. The skin, partially cooked, slips off cleanly and easily. The entrails are removed and the rat laid on the green boughs. After the flakes of the fire have died down sufficiently the carcass is placed on the coals to roast for 10 or 15 minutes. The most remarkable part of the procedure takes place after the meat is cooked. The legs are pulled off and nibbled in the classic manner. However, the rib cage, spine and pelvis are placed on a flat rock, sometimes a metate, and thoroughly crushed with a hammerstone. The carcass, well shredded, is then eaten, bones and all (Michelsen 1967:76). Mercado Site (41TR203) 245 July 2019

After singing off the fur, Great Basin groups pit-roasted wood rats whole or eviscerated them and stuffed them with wild onions (Fowler 1986:82). The Yavapai prepared wood rats for consumption in several ways. They either boiled them whole or after removal of the intestines. After skinning and eviscerating the wood rats, the Yavapai placed the skin in the abdominal cavity and baked the carcass under ashes. The skin was consumed as a delicacy. Wood rats also were preserved for short periods for later consumption. In that case, they were slightly charred after skinning and were hung in the hut in bundles of 20 or 30. They could be kept this way for a few days, and when they were to be eaten, they were boiled (Gifford 1936:266). After skinning and cleaning the woodrats, the Tepehuan roasted them either on a spit or over coals (Pennington 1969:125). Woodrats had other cultural uses. The Navajo sometimes used woodrat fur in incense (Hill 1938:173). A subsistence strategy of the Pawnee indirectly exploited woodrats. In the fall, women collected part of these rodents’ wild bean and potato hoards, leaving a portion for the woodrats’ consumption (Weltfish 1977:321, 415–416). The Yavapai also raided woodrat nests for piñon nuts. Woodrat brains were preserved for skin dressing, and their skins, with the fur side in, were used as infant winter foot wrappings (Gifford 1936:257, 266, 275). The woodrat remains recovered from LA 151618 are considered cultural. 8.3.5.6 Family Canidae (Dogs, Coyotes, Wolves, Foxes) Canis sp. (Dog/Coyote) (n = 7) Dog/coyote (Canis familiaris/C. latrans) remains consisting of teeth, a pelvis, and a tibia were recovered from the Mercado site. The dog is associated closely with humans. Based on a radiocarbon date of about 8400 B.C., the earliest known domestic dog remains in North America came from Jaguar Cave, Lemhi County, Idaho (Lawrence 1967:44). “Since dogs were domesticated from an Old World, not a New World stock, and since the remains discussed are of a small animal with typical dog characters, domestication must have taken place at a considerably earlier date” (Lawrence 1967:44). When humans entered North America, dogs accompanied them. The domestic dog probably descended from the wolf (C. lupus). As Olsen believes: The wolf has perfected hunting habits that would not have been lost on early human hunters who observed their game-getting practices. Both wolves and humans were pack, or team, hunters early on, and it is likely that these similar tactics for Mercado Site (41TR203) 246 July 2019

obtaining prey were influential in bringing about the initial stages of association between the two species. This hunting association and the fact that both hominids and large canids have mutually compatible social organizations eventually led to taming and, ultimately, to domestication (1985:xi). Pre-Columbian dog remains in North America fall into at least four size categories: 1) a large wolf- like northern form; 2) the Plains Indian dog (known in the Southwest as the large Pueblo dog), 3) the small short-faced Pueblo dog; and 4) the small long-faced Pueblo dog (Allen 1920:503; Olsen 1974:343, 1985:35). As Solis (1931:61) records, the Caddo had hybrid dogs, called jubines, that were dog, coyote, or wolf mixtures. When Spanish explorers first entered the American Southwest, Spanish greyhounds, used to control local populations, accompanied them. These dogs were larger than coyotes and large Pueblo dogs but smaller than the local wolf (Olsen 1978:19; Winship 1990:34). On several occasions during the Coronado entrada (ad 1540–1542), greyhounds were used in dog-baiting episodes. In an effort to force Bigotes and Cacique to reveal the whereabouts of a supposed golden bracelet, dogs were set on them, but the victims were not injured seriously (Bolton 1990:200, 203). In an incident that occurred either during the siege or after the fall of Moho in early ad 1541, some freed Indians were chased and bitten by a Spanish dog. As in the previous incident, no one died (Bolton 1990:228). During De Soto’s expedition into what is now the southeastern United States, Spanish dogs served similar functions. Bloodhounds were used “in tracking down Indians, retrieving those who tried to escape and tearing in pieces guides who misled” (Swanton 1939:92). As settlers moved into New Mexico, so did various domestic dog breeds. Dogs were (and in some cases still are) used by many groups for hunting, as beasts of burden, and at least occasionally, as food. Although not specifically trained for hunting, Hopi dogs were sometimes used to run down game. Puppies or older dogs also were butchered and fed to captive eagles and hawks when rabbit meat was unavailable (Beaglehole 1936:8, 21). The Havasupai sometimes used dogs for hunting rabbits and deer (Spier 1928:113). The Navajo used dogs “for hunting when no ritual was involved. They were trained to track and follow wounded animals. Some were castrated. They were never eaten” (Hill 1938:97). The Navajo still use dogs to guard their sheep. The Yavapai occasionally ate dogs. They were either cooked in an earth oven or boiled. Dogs also were used for hunting fawns and wounded deer (Gifford 1932:205, 217–218, 1936:264). Mercado Site (41TR203) 247 July 2019

A unique Yavapai custom involved dogs and teeth. To ensure healthy permanent teeth, the first deciduous tooth lost by a child was either encased in food and fed to a dog or thrown toward the east by the child’s father (Gifford 1936:300). Dogs occasionally were eaten by the Miwok, who sometimes used them to hunt squirrels and deer. After Euro-American contact, the Miwok used dog skins for quivers (Barrett and Gifford 1933:219, 270). Among the Tepehuan, “dogs constitute an important element in individual or communal hunting, and good hunting dogs are highly prized” (Pennington 1969:119). Among the Arikara, the flesh of young dogs was served during a feast, such as that of the Buffalo Society observed by Gilmore in 1926 (Gilmore 1934). Arikara methods of killing and butchering dogs on such occasions were different from those of other groups. The host’s wife did the killing, dressing, and cooking. She seized the dog by its hind legs and whirled it several times in a vertical circle. Then she struck its head and back on the ground with enough force to stun the animal. While in this condition, she placed a foot on its neck, suffocating it. Supposedly, the swinging made the dog dizzy and lessened its pain when it hit the ground. After the dog was dead, the host’s wife laid it on a fire and turned it until the hair was singed off. Then she washed the carcass with water to remove the singed hair. She began the actual butchering process by slitting the carcass from throat to tail. The viscera were removed and discarded along with the head and tail, which were severed next. The dressed carcass, with its skin still on it, was divided into portions according to well- established traditions (Gilmore 1934:37–38). “These portions are the two forequarters, the two hindquarters, the two sets of ribs, the cervical and dorsal vertebrae with adjacent bones and muscles between the shoulders, and the lumbar vertebrae with the bones and muscles which form the pelvic girdle” (Gilmore 1934:38). Then the portions were cut into small pieces and boiled. Coyotes (C. latrans) occur throughout the Southwest, occupying a wide range of habitats. The coyote is found throughout New Mexico, but it is most common in grassland. It subsists primarily on animal matter (Cockrum 1982:24–25; Findley et al. 1975:281). “Broken country, interrupted by rocks, brush, clumps of piñon-juniper or other vegetation, makes excellent habitat for coyotes” (Hoffmeister 1986:462). Dens usually are in the ground. Brush-covered slopes, riverbanks, and rock ledges serve as den sites. Unlike wolves, coyotes normally do not mate for life. A single litter, of usually 5 or 6 pups, is born in the spring. Much of the coyote diet consists of rabbits, rodents, and carrion, but birds, sheep, deer, juniper berries, cactus fruit, and insects are also eaten. To protect their livestock, ranchers have killed thousands of coyotes, but programs to eradicate these Mercado Site (41TR203) 248 July 2019

canids generally have been ineffective. Coyotes are also hunted for their valuable pelts. The coyote’s major nonhuman predators are cougars and wolves (Findley et al. 1975:281–282; Bee et al. 1981:165; Cockrum 1982:24; Hoffmeister 1986:464; Zeveloff 1988:248–249). The Yavapai ate coyotes when deer were scarce, using large deadfall traps to catch them. After they eviscerated and skinned the canid, they either cooked it in an earth oven or boiled it. They did not eat its marrow (Gifford 1932:205, 216, 1936:266). Some Plains groups, such as the Cheyenne, also ate coyotes (Grinnell 1923:I:256). Although the Tepehuan did not eat coyotes, they hunted them because coyotes kill chickens and consume young cornstalks. Some hunting techniques made use of bows and arrows or pit traps (Pennington 1969:127). Although coyotes were occasional food resources, they were probably sought more for their pelts. Currently, they are still a valuable furbearer (Carbyn 1987:372). Although the Hopi did not eat coyotes, they caught them with deadfall traps and used their skins (Beaglehole 1936:17–18). The Navajo used several types of deadfall traps to obtain coyote skins for the Coyote Way chant (Hill 1938:168–170). The Yavapai used coyote skins without the legs for capes, robes, and blankets, and also made quivers from coyote hides (Gifford 1932:226, 1936:273, 286). The hides were dried inside out. “Then moist earth was applied and the skin worked with the hands to soften it” (Gifford 1932:223). As a variation, the hide was softened by rubbing it with a stone. Then it was buried in damp ground for less than a day. Brains were unnecessary for processing coyote hides. Just four or five skins sewn together made a robe (Gifford 1932:223, 226, 1936:273, 286). The Havasupai tracked coyotes in the snow to obtain their pelts for robes and bedding (Spier 1928:111). The Tepehuan used coyote skins as sleeping mats (Pennington 1969:127). Coyote pelts were used for robes and blankets by the Sanpoil (Ray 1932:86), Northern Shoshone (Lowie 1909:179), and Havasupai (Spier 1928:111), among others. The Sanpoil made quivers from coyote skins (Ray 1932:89). The dog/coyote remains recovered from the Mercado site are those of an adult and are considered cultural. 8.3.5.7 Family Cervidae (Deer, Wapiti) Odocoileus hemionus (Mule Deer) (n = 1) Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) (n = 7) cf.

Definite deer specimens (n = 156) are the highest identified taxon in the Mercado site vertebrate archaeofaunal assemblage. Historically, two deer species, including mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), occurred in or near the vicinity of the Mercado site (Findley et al. 1985:329, 331). The mule deer, a browser, is found at all elevations and in a variety of habitats—brushy and wooded areas, broken country, and open plains. It inhabits the Upper Sonoran, Transition, and Canadian zones (Bailey 1913:32, 43, 47). As a result, a varied diet is consumed. It is a browser that feeds mainly on oak, juniper, piñon, cliffrose, bitterbrush, fir, ponderosa pine, and aspen. When grazing, forbs are preferred over grasses. Cultivated crops are also consumed. The winter diet primarily consists of juniper, piñon needles, sagebrush, saltbush, and Mormon tea. Formerly, major predators included grizzly bears and wolves. Mountain lions, coyotes, bobcats, and eagles also prey on mule deer (Bee et al. 1981:220–221; Cockrum and Petryszyn 1992:164; Davis and Schmidly 1994:278–283; Findley 1987:140–141; Findley et al. 1975:328–329; Hoffmeister 1986:542–543; Zeveloff 1988:326–327). The white-tailed deer also inhabits the Upper Sonoran, Transition, and Canadian zones (Bailey 1913:32, 1931:35, 37). In areas where both species live close together, white-tailed deer usually occur at higher elevations and in more rugged terrain, “such as steep, rocky, canyon sides” (Findley et al. 1975:330). During summer, white-tailed deer may be found as high as 10,000 ft (Findley et al. 1975:332). This species is “found primarily in woodland communities consisting of evergreen oaks or in mixtures of oak-juniper-pinyon” (Hoffmeister 1986:545). White-tailed deer also occur in desert scrub. Juniper, piñon, hackberry, mesquite, and other bushes and shrubs supply much of their diet. They also eat crops, such as corn. Predators of adult white-tailed deer and/or fawns include coyotes, wolves, bobcats, mountain lions, gray foxes, and raptors (Hoffmeister 1986:545, 547–548; Zeveloff 1988:329–330). Usually, only male deer have antlers, which are shed in early February at the end of the breeding season. New antlers begin growing in May and remain in velvet until sometime in September when they stop growing. Breeding takes place from late fall to early winter, primarily from December 1 through January 15. Does usually mate for the first time when they are about 18 months old. Deer are K-selected mammals. As a result, the gestation period is almost 7 months. In pre-Columbian and early historical times, deer were important food resources and also provided raw materials for clothing and tools. Deer were one of the principal animals hunted by the Jicarilla Mercado Site (41TR203) 250 July 2019

Apache. “Whistles, designed to imitate the bleat of the fawn, were used to draw does to their death, and head nooses were strung along trails” (Opler 1936:207). Individuals and small parties of Omaha hunted deer, usually in winter when the deer were fat and in good condition (Fletcher and La Flesche 1911:270–271). The Chippewa had several deer hunting techniques, such as using pitch torches and deer calls. The deer were attracted to the light and a sound similar to that of a fawn (Densmore 1929:128–129, 149). Individual Sanpoil hunters had a similar technique, using a leaf to imitate fawn sounds. Deer hunting by the Sanpoil was mainly a group venture that often occurred during winter and consisted of driving deer to the head of a canyon or valley or into a river where the animals were easily killed. They also drove deer over the edge of a cliff (Ray 1932:77–81). Prior to the acquisition of the horse, the Hopi, working in pairs, sometimes ran down individual deer on foot. More often, however, a group of hunters surrounded and rounded up a number of deer. Although the hunters sometimes killed the exhausted animals with arrows, they usually strangled them (Beaglehole 1936:3–7). Navajo hunters drove deer into an ambush, tracked them down, waited in ambush for the animals to pass by, stalked deer, used animal disguises, occasionally encircled deer with fire, used pit falls, and ran them down on foot (Hill 1938:96–133; Elmore 1953). Some Basin-Plateau groups killed deer with poisoned arrows (Steward 1938:36). The importance of deer as a raw material source for clothing, tools, and other items is well known and needs no discussion. Several cultural customs associated with deer, however, are presented. The Jicarilla Apache gathered the waste and bones of deer and disposed of them far from camp to ensure continued success in hunting (Opler 1936:207). When the Navajo obtained sufficient deer meat, they broke the accumulated bones. “Not a single one was left whole, because it was believed that by breaking the bones deer hunted in the future would be unable to escape. These bones and the horns were deposited at the base of a cliff rose” (Hill 1938:128). The Hopi did not break the bones for marrow or give them to their dogs, but rather placed the bones (including the skulls) and unused antlers on a shrine (Beaglehole 1936:7–8). The Laguna cooked the head and bones in a large cooking jar (Goldfrank 1954:419), and the Kiliwa ground deer bones to a fine paste in a mortar (Michelsen 1967:77). All of the deer remains recovered from the Mercado site are considered cultural. Mercado Site (41TR203) 251 July 2019

8.3.5.8 Family Antilocapridae (Pronghorn) Antilocapra americana (Pronghorn) (n = 6) cf. Antilocapra americana (Pronghorn) (n = 2) Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) formerly occurred throughout the Southwest, but intensive hunting greatly reduced their numbers by the early 1900s. The eastern boundary of the present range is just east of Tarrant County. Since the early 1900s, they have been expanding within their former range. Pronghorn were once almost as numerous as bison. They inhabit arid and semi-arid grasslands, subsisting on browse such as sagebrush, buckbrush, and rabbitbrush. Prickly pear cacti, forbs, grasses, and cultivated crops are also eaten. Most, or all, of the necessary water is obtained from the plants consumed. Pronghorn congregate in large herds (e.g., 100 individuals) during the winter but disperse into smaller groups in the spring. Breeding occurs in the fall. Does give birth, usually to twins, in mid-June. The pronghorn uses its great speed (up to 60 miles per hour) to elude predators such as bobcats and coyotes (Findley 1987:144–145; Findley et al. 1975:333–334; Hoffmeister 1986:549, 551–552; Jones et al. 1985:318; Zeveloff 1988:334–336). The pronghorn served as a food resource for many North American pre-Columbian and historic peoples. The Cheyenne dug pits and built enclosures on established trails where large numbers of pronghorn were enticed, drawn, led, or driven and killed with clubs (Grinnell 1923:I:277–290). Solitary Chiricahua Apache hunters stalked pronghorn (Opler 1941:324). Pronghorn was the Navajo’s second most important meat source. Many deer hunting techniques also served to bring down pronghorn. Animals were stalked, tracked, flushed, driven into an ambush, run down, or driven into a corral by a pair or group of Navajo hunters, but impounding was the most common method (Hill 1938:101–113, 117–131, 145–156). The Hopi also relied on deer hunting methods to hunt pronghorn, and they treated the bones in a similar manner (Beaglehole 1936:4–9). The Pima stalked pronghorn (Ebeling 1986:594). During the summer and fall, the Sanpoil often found pronghorn near water holes, where one or two men using bows and arrows hunted them together (Ray 1932:82). The Shoshone and Crow conducted communal pronghorn drives into corrals (Lowie 1922:211; Steward 1938:34–35, 81–82). The Havasupai occasionally wore a disguise when stalking pronghorn. “The stuffed headskin of an antelope is worn on the head, while the body is painted pink and white to resemble that animal. Mimicking its actions, the hunter approaches within ten or fifteen meters before he lets fly (Spier 1928:110). The Yavapai hunted pronghorn by Mercado Site (41TR203) 252 July 2019

stalking, driving, or surrounding them. In addition to eating the meat of this animal, they also consumed the marrow (Gifford 1932:216, 1936:265). Pronghorn also were a raw material resource for various material culture items of many groups. The Yavapai used pronghorn skins for leggings, breechcloths, and drumheads, but because pronghorn skin is thin and easily torn, they did not use it for all the same purposes as they used deer hides (Gifford 1936:273–274, 288). The Yavapai also used the horns as flakers (Gifford 1936:287). The Havasupai made ropes from pronghorn skin (Spier 1928:146), and the Hopi used the horn as an arrow wrench (Spier 1928:161). The Navajo made clothes from pronghorn hides, but the hides were not sturdy enough for moccasins (Hill 1938:156). All the pronghorn specimens recovered from the Mercado site are considered cultural. 8.3.5.9 Family Bovidae (Bovids) Bison bison (Bison) (n = 46) cf. Bison bison (Bison) (n = 4) Bison remains were recovered from the Late Archaic components from the Mercado site (see Table 8.1). The bison, the largest extant terrestrial mammal in North America, was formerly the dominant mammal of the prairies. This grazer of open grasslands once numbered in the millions, but it has been extirpated throughout most of its range. By 1890, less than 1,000 bison were left in North America. Extermination of the bison was part of a United States government policy to suppress the Indian tribes that depended on them for food, clothing, and shelter. At the turn of the century, efforts were finally made to save them from extinction (Zeveloff 1988:345). Today, almost 100,000 live in public and private herds in western North America. Although the bison is primarily a grassland species, it also occurs along forest edges and in the prairie-forest transition zone. This bovid is very gregarious, living in large herds. Core herds consist of females, calves, yearlings, and 2-year-olds. Older males are solitary or form small groups on the peripheries of the main herds. During the breeding season, from mid to late summer, the males join the female-subadult herds. Bison are a K-selected species. After a gestation period of approximately 9.5 months, a single precocil calf per breeding female is usually born in the spring. Occasionally, a female may have twins. Although sexual maturity is attained by the age of 3 for Mercado Site (41TR203) 253 July 2019

both sexes, males generally do not breed much until the age of 6 (Bee et al. 1981:229–230; Findley 1987:146; Zeveloff 1988:346–347). Bison are efficient grazers. They are “capable of growing and maintaining good condition on less nutritious fare than domestic cattle require” (Findley 1987:146). Although grasses are preferred, sedges and brushy plants are consumed when grass is unavailable. Bison seek water each day. During droughts, however, they can go several days without water. Besides humans, major predators include wolves and grizzly bears (Bailey 1931:16; Bee et al. 1981:230; Findley 1987:146; Zeveloff 1988:346). Large quantities of burned bone and unidentified bone raises the possibility that intensive bone processing occurred at the site. Ethnographic data indicate marrow extraction and bone grease processing were undertaken by many groups (Binford 1978; Densmore 1929:44; Grinnell 1923:I:216; Lowie 1922:214; Mandelbaum 1940:193; Peale 1871; Ray 1932:107; Wilson 1924:174; Wissler 1910:22–23). Mainly, the bones of large game animals such as bison, deer, elk, caribou, and bear were processed for marrow and bone grease, but the bones of smaller animals, such as rabbits, were also processed for grease by some groups (Densmore 1929:44). Besides being a primary source of food, bison were a raw material resource for various material culture items of many groups, which is well documented in the ethnographic literature and will not be dealt with further here. All the bison specimens recovered from the Mercado site are considered cultural. Given the groupings above, subsistence would have been focused on medium or larger mammals. Small mammals were not widely selected. Very small mammals and microtines within the assemblage are likely intrusive or naturally occurring. However, coprolite studies from the Lower Pecos indicate cotton rats, voles, and other rodents were commonly consumed by Native Americans (Bryant 1974; Reinhard and Bryant 1992; Texas Beyond History 2013). An analysis of MNI indicates similar reliance as NISP. For the most part, only one bone, or no more of any one element was present for most species. In those cases, the MNI was determined to be 1. The mammal genus with the greatest MNI is deer. Due to the potential for both white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to be present, any bone not identifiable to species per Jacobson (2004) or exhibiting either characteristics of both species or indeterminate characteristics was left as a broader deer determination (Odocoileus sp.). Only one bone was identifiable as mule deer, (O. hemionus), but 15 bones exhibited characteristics Mercado Site (41TR203) 254 July 2019

identifiable as white-tailed deer (O. virginianus). Therefore, MNI for mule deer is equal to 1, but MNI for white-tailed deer is two based on the presence of two right distal humeri. In addition, for deer unassignable to species (Odocoileus sp.) there were two left nearly complete/complete petrous portions, two right petrous portions (one complete and one posterior half), two upper left third molars, and two right distal humeri (one adult and one fetal). While an argument could be made that most of the specimens used to establish general deer MNI may represent unassignable to species specimens from the two white-tailed deer MNI already established, the presence of same- side distal humeri mean that no fewer than four deer (inclusive of mule deer, white-tailed deer, and general unassignable to species deer) are represented at the site. Furthermore, by using specimens, such as teeth (e.g., an un-erupted lower third molar and deciduous lower fourth premolar), wear patterns on a lower third molar and upper third premolar, heavy wear on a lower fourth premolar and upper third molar, and a fetal bone, it is possible to establish the presence of deer from at least four distinct age groups: 1) fetal; 2) 4 to 5 months of age; 3) 3 to 3.5 years of age; and 4) 6 to 6.5 years of age, resulting in an MNI of at least four individuals. Bovid bone was identified to bison if clear indicators following Balkwill and Cumbaa (1992) were present on the bone, although it is assumed, due to the radiocarbon-dated stratified deposits, the bovid bone represents bison. Any bovine bone associated with AUs 2 through 8 (below the plow- zone and deeper) can be assumed to be bison based on stratigraphic context and age. One bone, the proximal half of a metacarpal, was examined for being cow (Bos taurus), since its characteristics were identified based on Balkwill and Cumbaa, however (characteristics 3, 4, and 5) vary from 57 to 88 percent accurate, therefore there is a substantial possible error, especially given its stratigraphic context with Feature 34 in AU 8, a well-dated Late Archaic context. One left complete second to third fused carpal was examined using the defining characteristics of Balkwill and Cumbaa (1992) where only 57 percent accuracy for bison was achieved for character 1, 46 percent accuracy for cow for character 2, and 59 percent accuracy for bison and 72 percent accurate for being cow for character 3. There are similar sized cf. bison carpals within the same stratigraphic contextand it is possible that all of the carpals are from the same individual. Therefore, identifying domesticated cow within the assemblage is very weak, and all the identified bovine specimens are considered bison. Bison MNI is equal to 2 based on two left astragali, two left distal humeri, two left ulnar carpals, two left second to third fused carpals, and two left upper third molars.

Similar to deer, some of the specimens could not be assigned specifically to species and were left at a broader designation of bovidae. The MNI of 2 for bovidae is based on two left calcanei. Medium-size mammals, such as canid- and beaver-size, are represented by an MNI of 1. The small mammal presence is higher based on an MNI for cottontail (Sylvilagus sp.) of 4 based on four right distal humeri. In addition to the cottontail, the MNI for jackrabbit (Lepus sp.) is 2 based on two right astragali. Overall, at least six lagomorphs (four cottontail and two jackrabbits) are represented in the site assemblage. MNI for very small rodents indicates a minor presence at the site. The pocket gopher (Geomys sp.) MNI is 2 based on two right proximal ulnas. The Hispid cottonrat (Sigmodon hispidis) MNI of 3 is based on three left mandibles, but Sigmodon sp. is assigned an MNI of one based on one left mandible, therefore the MNI for all cotton rats is 4. 8.4 The Vertebrate Faunal Assemblage The vertebrate faunal assemblage recovered from site 41TR203 consists of 8,346 specimens. A variety of taxa was identified (see Table 8.1), some of which are considered intrusive. Most of the assemblage consists of mammals (n = 7,174, 86.0 percent). The second largest category consists of indeterminate vertebrate remains (n = 1,080, 12.9 percent). Reptiles (n = 73) represent 0.9 percent, birds (n = 16) represent 0.2 percent, and amphibians (n = 1), indeterminate amphibian/reptile (n = 1), and fish (n = 1) each represent < 0.1 percent. The identified taxa and the NISP and minimum MNI for each taxon are listed in Table 8.1 and represent that for the site as a whole. Summaries of material recovered from the site as a whole and discussions regarding environment and subsistence strategies, taphonomy, cultural bone modifications, and interpretations are discussed in the following sections, along with a discussion of the same topics divided by AU. In general, less than 50 percent of bones from Texas assemblages are identifiable to class, and in this case, 87.1 percent (n = 7,266) was identified which is above the norm. The assemblage is dominated by deer-size and larger mammals. Of the 8,346 vertebrate remains identified, 85 (1.0 percent) are complete and unbroken. This low percentage of complete, unbroken bones is similar to other well-preserved sites in Texas. Mercado Site (41TR203) 256 July 2019

For comparison, the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) has one of the more well-preserved archeological faunal assemblages in Texas and is located in a similar open (non-rockshelter) alluvial setting in Williamson County (Baker 1998). Of the 15,309 vertebrate remains recovered from 1/4-in screens, only 30 percent were identifiable to class or a more specific taxon. Of the 38,618 specimens recovered from 1/8-inscreens, only 32 percent were identifiable to class or a more specific taxon. Only 0.7 percent of the 1/4-in screened and 0.6 percent of the ⅛-in screened bone were complete and unbroken. In contrast, although the assemblage at Fish Creek Slough (41DL436) in Dallas County was not as fragmented as most regional faunal assemblages, only 53.1 percent of the 8,701 bones were identifiable to class. The site, however, had much greater faunal diversity, with mammals only representing 68 percent of the assemblage. Consequently, identification of the numerous small bone fragments to class was more complicated. Of the Fish Creek Slough assemblage, 435 bones (5 percent) were complete, unbroken specimens, which is greater than the complete, unbroken specimens from the Mercado site. Given the good preservation and stratigraphic context of bone recovered, the faunal assemblage data are informative with regards to environment, subsistence strategies, butchering and processing, cultural bone modification, and taphonomic conditions. 8.4.1 Environment Due to the lack of diversity of species present there is limited habitat information available. However, there were a wide range of habitats utilized by the prehistoric occupants of site 41TR203 over its Late Archaic, Transitional Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric, and Late Prehistoric cultural/temporal periods of use. White-tailed deer, fox, and squirrel are indicative of forest or forest-edge (Schmidly 1994). Mule deer, cottontail rabbits, and jack rabbits prefer shrub brush/chaparral habitats (Schmidly 1994; NRCS 1999). Bison, pronghorn, hispid cotton rat, harvest mouse, and pocket gopher are indicative of open prairie and grassland. Beaver, goose, duck, other waterfowl, water snake, pond turtles, red-eared sliders, and catfish all inhabit aquatic/wetlands (Peterson 1988; Schmidly 1994; Stebbins 2003). Some of the terrestrial species present in the assemblage can inhabit multiple environs as represented by ecotones within the above habitats, such as prairie or brush (e.g., ground squirrel and hispid cotton rat) and grassland or creek bottoms (e.g., harvest mouse). While overall, the species present are diverse and representative of multiple habitats, they are consistent with a single Mercado Site (41TR203) 257 July 2019

The presence of reptiles, especially turtle, although minimal (n = 73, 1 percent of total assemblage), indicate the site was used during warmer seasons with temperatures above 38 to 45 °F (temperature at which most species of turtles hibernate), likely between spring to late fall (i.e., March to November) (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] 2013; Roots 2006). Many amphibians and reptiles will estivate during times of drought, which in Texas can be an indicator of seasonality as mid-summer typically has lower rainfall, but given the proximity of the West Fork of the Trinity River and perennial drainage, limits of species availability due to seasonal estivation cannot be assumed. While antlers were recovered from the site, typically antlers are not necessarily indicative of human subsistence and hunting as deer antlers are shed annually and were a highly sought-after resource for tool manufacture. There was one antler fragment consistent with being near the end of its course of velvet at time of death. The antler fragment suggests a late summer or early fall presence, or immediately prior to the rutting season (September–October) based on typical antler development of present-day Texas deer (Brown 1994; Jacobson 1994; Marchinton and Miller 1994; Schmidly 1994).

Other indicators for seasonality using deer are available due to the presence of fetal and a 4- to 5-month-old fawn (Odocoileus sp.). The fetal bone is represented by a distal humeri consistent in size with comparative material from a maternal April death in Tennessee. Given the difference in timing of parturition between white-tailed deer in Tennessee (late May to June) and Texas (May to early June), the maternal death associated with the fetal bones likely occurred around mid to late March in Texas. Additionally, two lower un-erupted third molar fragments and the wear on a deciduous fourth premolar indicate the presence of a 4- to 5-month-old fawn based on eruption and wear patterns (Cain and Wallace 2003). Deer reproductive cycles are based on annual photoperiodic cues set based on the location of their birth. Given modern and historic reproductive cycles for white-tailed deer in the Dallas area (Jacobson 1994), this suggests seasonal occupation sometime between late September to November. Therefore, based on deer alone, there are multiple seasons of occupation at the site, including spring and fall. Seasonal bird migration and presence/absence of these species at a site can also be used to deter- mine season of use by human occupants. In Texas, however, the presence of migrating waterfowl at the site is not typically conclusive as there are species of ducks that are resident year-round in the state. One exception to this, the presence of Canada geese (Branta canadensis), would suggest a winter presence at the site between October and March, although there are some geese that linger longer in Texas. Therefore, while most indicators above effectively suggest occupation of the site during moderate temperature months (early spring through late fall), there is also evidence for mid-summer and winter use of the site, although more minimal. Given the deep temporal use of the site, seasonal indicators will also be examined within each AU and cultural/temporal affiliation, including Late Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric. 8.4.3 Taphonomy The bones were examined for signs of breakage (spiral and green breaks versus dry breaks) and weathering. A total of 85 bones (1.01 percent) are complete and unbroken. The degree of weathering to which a bone had been subjected was recorded for each specimen. The degree of weathering was recorded following Lyman’s (1994) synthesis of Behrensmeyer (1978), Andrews (1990), and Johnson (1985). The weathering scale consists of rankings from 0 to 5 where 0 equals a bone with some flesh still attached and 5 is a bone with large splinters which is disintegrating. Mercado Site (41TR203) 260 July 2019

Typically, all archeological material is minimally assigned a 2 or 3 ranking. Bone assigned a ranking of 5 has likely been exposed to the sun and weathering for a prolonged time prior to burial, whereas bones with a ranking of 2 or 3 have been buried shortly after or at the time of their discard. Most (n = 6,956, 82.9 percent) of the bone recovered from site 41TR203 is assigned a ranking of 3. Of the remaining, only three specimens (< 0.1 percent) are assigned a ranking of 2, 1,196 specimens (14.2 percent) a ranking of 4, and one bone (< 0.1 percent) a ranking of 5. A few bones are between weathering classifications, so 143 bones (1.4 percent) are assigned a rank between 3 and 4 and 70 bones (0.8 percent) are assigned a rank between 4 and 5. Twenty-four specimens (0.3 percent) are not assigned a ranking due to burning which obscured the degree of weathering, oversight, and indeterminate classifications. The higher degree of bones with a rank of 3 indicate these specimens spent only minimal time on the surface before being buried which is consistent with floodplain deposits. Additionally, while all but 83 of the specimens exhibit a break of some kind, the fragments are generally larger and more identifiable as is evidenced by the low ratio of specimens assigned as indeterminate vertebrate. 8.4.4 Skeletal Part Frequencies Skeletal part frequencies can be used to infer butchering, transport, food preparation, disposal habits, nutritional analysis, activity areas, site function, economic institutions, and social organization (Reitz and Wing 1999). Researchers (Read 1971; Styles 1981) have proposed that bones of large animals may not be transported from the kill site to the habitation site and the likelihood of differential conveyance increases with the animals’ distance from the habitation site. White (1952) posited that not all parts of a large animal, such as bison, would have been brought back to camp. He stated that “since the lower limb does not carry any usable meat it is conceivable that it was chopped off and left at the place of kill to reduce the load” (White 1953: 162). The process of returning only the higher, meat-yielding elements to the site after a kill is sometimes referred to as “schlepping.” Skeletal part frequency analysis is useful in not only determining potential site function (kill site versus habitation site) but can provide additional insight. Skeletal part frequencies can help researchers infer taphonomic conditions, for instance when less dense bones such as vertebrae may be present in lower frequency than dense bone such as long bone fragments. They provide information about the archeological site’s ecological surroundings. If there are different frequencies Mercado Site (41TR203) 261 July 2019

of high versus low meat utility bones for similar sized species but which inhabit different habitats, the case may be made that one of those species is being locally obtained while the other may be coming from a greater distance. Skeletal part frequencies can also aid in understanding the relationship between human subsistence strategies and dietary stress. For example, the presence of primarily high meat value elements at a site suggests the abundance of game animals (i.e., non-food stress), whereas the presence of highly processed lower meat value elements suggests food stress. As bison and deer are the most prevalent typical prey species, an examination of their skeletal part frequencies was conducted. Pronghorn, while similar in size to deer, are only minimally represented (n = 7) in the assemblage and are represented by no more than one animal (MNI = 1). Given the absence of a robust sample, pronghorn are not included in the analysis as any discussion would be lacking in relevance. The following analysis uses bovid and cervid NISP to illustrate trends in skeletal part frequencies (Figure 8.1). The NISP is used since its method of calculation is consistent throughout the entire site assemblage and consists of larger values that are more suitable for illustrating trends. One drawback in using NISP is that the occurrence of specific elements is over-represented due to breakage that may result in multiple counting of the same element. However, since NISP values are consistently applied throughout the entire assemblage, they are deemed appropriate given the low MNI values, which do not lend themselves to generating indices and exhibiting trends. In addition, MNI values are not calculated for unidentified bovid and cervid specimens but rather at the lower taxonomic levels only (e.g., genus, species) which reduces the frequency of occurrence of these taxa in other archeological contexts in which they may be present.

There is greater skewing for the frequency of the lowest meat utility elements (skull and phalanges) in cervids than bovids, although both depict a higher frequency of those elements than higher meat utility elements. One explanation for this skewing may be that pronghorn were also present at the site, and many elements including ribs, vertebrae, and long bone fragments would be more difficult to distinguish between deer and pronghorn when fragmented. Therefore, all medium-large artiodactyl bones including deer, pronghorn, and those specimens unassignable to genus were analyzed and results are presented in Figure 8.2. For this figure, all vertebrae were grouped to also include those unassignable to cervical, thoracic, lumbar, or caudal. There is still a much greater skewing toward lower utility medium-large artiodactyl bones present at the site indicating difficulty in identifying to species some elements that are morphologically similar to animals of the same size was not a good explanation. Given that within the species relative density of most bones of artiodactyls are similar (e.g., metapodials denser than vertebrae), if procured and processed in the same manner, skeletal part frequencies should be more similar. Therefore, something beyond taphonomic processes is responsible for the differences in skeletal part frequencies between bovids and cervids. 8.4.4.1 Deer Given mule deer is represented by a single specimen (n = 1), variations between cervid species cannot be examined with confidence to determine if there were differences between mule deer and white-tailed deer. Conflating all deer could be problematic, because while the two species have been known to ecologically overlap and even hybridize, their preferred habitats are different. Differences in skeletal part frequencies between the two species could influence the numbers due to differences in hunting strategies or local availability of the two species. Given that the majority of the identified bone assignable to species, however, was white-tailed deer (n = 13), it is assumed the majority of the unassignable specimens represent white-tailed deer. For discussion purposes, all mule deer, white-tailed deer, and Odocoileus sp. specimens are grouped together for a discussion with regards to skeletal part frequencies. To better interpret the data, meat utility rankings for white-tailed deer (Jacobson 2000) are used to determine the number of Odocoileus element groupings for high, middle, and low meat utility ranking (Figure 8.3).

part frequencies to the frequencies of elements with the same utility rankings in one animal (Figure 8.4). Upon examination, deer are unrepresented by any high and middle meat utility parts and are heavily over-represented by low meat utility parts relative to the average distribution. Despite the fact that lower utility bones also tend to have higher density, this substantial difference suggests that the site could have been used for initial processing with low meat utility parts discarded post processing. Low meat-bearing but high marrow yield elements, such as the metapodials, display evidence for marrow processing (spiral fractures and platform impacts/percussion point fractures), suggesting that marrow was removed from the bones during initial processing and the bones discarded. Given the rate at which deer catabolize fat stores from their long bones, metapodials would retain fat stores long after most other long bones are depleted. In contrast, there was no evidence for intentional breakage on the phalanges. Mercado Site (41TR203) 265 July 2019

8.4.4.2 Bison Skeletal part frequencies and standardized gross utility rankings for bison were also examined. Emerson’s (1990) averaged total products model was used to separate bison elements into high, middle, and low utility categories. Elements with a unit value greater than 70 (e.g., ribs, thoracic vertebrae, and lumbar vertebrae) are considered high meat utility. Elements with a unit value between 30 and 70 (e.g., cervical vertebrae, sternum, sacrum/pelvis, femur, and scapula) are considered middle meat utility. Any elements with a unit value less than 30 (e.g., humerus, cranial, tibia, radius/ulna, metacarpal, metatarsal, caudal vertebrae, tarsals, phalanges, and carpals) are considered low meat utility. While classified as low, humeri and tibia are right on the cusp of middle meat utility elements. Most identifications were left broad as bovidae if not assignable to bison based on morphological characteristics, but due to the age of deposits, it is assumed most, if not all, of the bone is actually bison. Due to this, the general distribution of elements for bison within Emerson’s (1990) bison rankings are depicted in Figure 8.5. As can be noted in Figure 8.6, there is a similar pattern of over-representation of low utility parts as with deer, but not to the same pronounced degree. In addition, there were fewer middle meat utility parts present relative to both high and low meat utility parts as there are in the standard distribution. While most of the high and middle meat utility elements (e.g., ribs, thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, cervical vertebrae, sternum, pelvis, scapula) are less dense (Lyman 1994) and, therefore, more subject to taphonomic processes, one of the middle meat utility elements (i.e., femur) is much more dense and likely to be preserved. While there were significantly more femur fragments (n = 8) than less dense vertebrae (i.e., thoracic vertebrae n = 2), there are a higher number of scapula (n = 12) and rib (n = 19) fragments. It is possible other taphonomic factors beyond soil acidity and erosion may be the cause of the bone fracturing. Given that bovids are heavier and more robust than deer, it is also likely a higher degree of bone discard at a processing site would be necessary to allow for transport, or schlepping, higher meat-yielding elements back to the habitation site (Perkins and Daly 1968; Reitz and Wing 1990). Meat might be stripped from heavy bones such as femurs and the heavier bones discarded. Furthermore, when processing the front limb, the easy disarticulation point is at the blade of the scapula, so removal of it and stripping of associated meat would be an efficient method in butchering. Many of the bison long bones also exhibit evidence (i.e., spiral fracture and percussion Mercado Site (41TR203) 267 July 2019

points) for marrow processing, but no discernible evidence of grease processing. Removal of fatty marrow for carrying would be lighter and more expedient than hauling the heavier bones. Canid bones and evidence of carnivore gnawing and breakage of bone at the site are present. Canid gnawing of spongy bone can be destructive. In general, though, given the preservation of other fragile bone, such as artiodactyl neonate bone, the high presence of trabecular bone, and even many trabecular fragments without associated cortical exterior in the assemblage, other factors beyond taphonomy are likely responsible. Of interest is that bovid cranial specimens were identified in the assemblage, but no bovid cervical vertebral fragments were recovered. Cervical vertebrae articulate with the skull, and it would be anticipated to find them in association with the skull. The complete absence of cervical vertebrae suggests removal from the site in whole or, more likely, the schlepping of high meat-yielding elements back to the site, leaving less meat-value elements at the original kill site (Perkins and Daly 1968; Reitz and Wing 1990).

8.4.5 Fragmentation The types and amount of fragmentation of bones were examined and recorded (Table 8.3). Extensive fragmentation of larger bones is typically indicative of heavy processing for marrow and bone grease. Smashing of long bones of medium mammals and larger was common amongst most Great Plains groups for the extraction of marrow and bone grease (Kehoe and Kehoe 1960; White 1953, 1954, 1955). General observations during analysis were that some long bones, those with higher utility based on marrow content had been fractured, but the bone does not appear to have been smashed for bone grease extraction. In addition, while most of the long bones such as femurs, humeri, tibias, radii, and metapodials have been broken for marrow, phalanges had not been intentionally broken. Table 8.3. Bone Breakage Represented in the Total Assemblage from 41TR203 Type of Break NISP Spiral 627 Green 48 Dry 7,382 Indeterminate 204 Unbroken 85 Total 8,346 Approximately 8 percent of the specimens in the assemblage exhibit spiral and green breaks. Of the 627 bones with spiral fractures, 506 specimens belong to medium-size or larger mammals including indeterminate mammals, artiodactyls, pronghorn, deer, and bovids. The remaining 121 specimens with spiral fractures include rabbit (n = 3), indeterminate size mammal (n = 105), and indeterminate vertebrate bone (n = 13). Of the 627 bones exhibiting spiral fractures, 336 could not be identified to element. Of the remaining 291 spiral fractured bones, the majority (n = 264, 91 percent) exhibiting spiral fractures are long bones. Among them, however, are only four phalanges, despite being the dominant bone present for both deer and bovids that exhibited spiral fractures. A separate designation of green fractures was recorded, as not all fresh breaks result in spiral fractures. Green break could be caused by splitting ribs or other bones, smaller animal long bones being broken, also some carnivore fracturing results in green breaks. While the majority of Mercado Site (41TR203) 270 July 2019

specimens with green breaks belonged to medium-size or larger mammals, including indeterminate mammal, artiodactyls, pronghorn, deer, and bovids (n = 30), rodent (n = 2), leporid (n = 9), indeterminate-size mammal (n = 5), waterfowl (n = 1), and indeterminate vertebrate (n = 1) also had signs of green breaks. The overall low frequency of intentional breakage and percentage of unbroken bones indicate that dietary stress was not severe as the specimens do not appear to have been highly processed for bone grease. Given the presence of striking platforms/percussion points on some of the bones, the location of spiral breaks, the intactness of many epiphyseal ends, and the general large nature of even midshaft fragments, there is clear evidence for marrow processing of bison and deer from the site. However, there is little to minimal indication for bone grease manufacturing. Based on skeletal part frequency analysis above, elements “absent” or with only minimal presence are those with higher meat utility. It should be taken into consideration if their absence could be due to high fragmentation as a result of bone grease processing which would have obscured identification of the element. However, these elements are not the ones most likely to contain high quality marrow and grease deposits. Deer and bison tend to catabolize fat from long bones in a specific order. Deer catabolize their fat stores, the femur, humerus, tibia, and radius marrow fat is mobilized at similar rates with the upper limbs just above the lower, but the metapodials are the last reservoir for fat storage and can maintain high fat levels even when the fat in the femur has dropped below 30 percent. Bison medullary cavities tend to maintain stable reserves until after most body fat and bone grease from axial bones have been depleted, with eventual reserves pulled from the proximal-most bones first (humerus and femur) and progressing to the distal-most bones (metapodials and phalanges) last. This gives other cause for reliance on the more dependable long bone marrow over the depleted bone grease reserves for seasonally stressed bison. There is no evidence for more than potential limited bone grease processing at the site, which is based on a few specimens exhibiting spiral fractures as discussed in the AU discussions below. 8.4.6 Carnivore and Rodent Modification Of the 8,346 bones recovered from the site, 58 (0.7 percent) exhibit signs of carnivore or rodent modification. Thirty-one specimens exhibit evidence of carnivore modification (Photo 8.1). Of the carnivore modified specimens, two had been gnawed. One of the specimens has been punctured by Mercado Site (41TR203) 271 July 2019

a canine or carnassial. Twenty-eight specimens exhibit etching, polishing, and worn edges typical of bones which had been through a carnivore’s digestive tract. Rodents had gnawed on 27 of the bones recovered from the site. All the bones had been gnawed by mice, rats, or voles. None of the bones had been gnawed by squirrels. Research (Klippel and Synstelien 2007) has shown that brown rats only gnaw bone which is fresh and still laden with fats, while squirrels only gnaw on thicker bone cortices after their fats have leached away. Rats will gnaw on bones recently deposited, while squirrels tend to be more likely to gnaw on bone left exposed for a prolonged period of time. Therefore, most of the gnawing likely occurred near or at the time of deposition, suggesting at least some commensal rodent presence. 8.4.7 Taphonomy Summary Despite the fact that most of the bone (n = 7,586, 90.9 percent) exhibits dry (post-depositional) or indeterminate (unknown whether just post-mortem or post-depositional) breaks, the bone from site 41TR203 is more identifiable and better preserved than most assemblages in Texas. Given the minor degree of green/spiral breaks, it is assumed that the identifiability of the assemblage is directly related to the absence for any evidence of substantial bone grease processing of the assemblage. The minor presence of advanced weathering combined with the overall preservation of the bone is also indicative of relatively fast burying of the faunal remains. Despite some evidence for carnivore and rodent gnawing, there is only a minor degree of scavenging on remains after butchering. This would also indicate fairly rapid burying of the material during or just post- deposition. Lastly, taphonomy alone cannot be responsible for skeletal part frequency differential distributions of the major prey species at the site. There is some evidence for initial processing of remains at the site and some selective transport of elements to the site from the original kill site which was likely some distance away from the habitation site.

Photo 8.1. Carnivore Modification 8.4.8 Cultural Modification The bone was examined for evidence of cultural modification, including cut, chop, and saw marks, other signs of processing such as a striking platform for bone breakage and marrow extraction (Figure 8.2), or any form of thermal alteration. Bone was also examined for modification into or use as a bone tool. In addition, as other evidence for expedient bone tool use has been noted at other regional sites with minimal lithic assemblages, the bones were examined for abrading or other evidence of use wear (Photo 8.3). Of the 8,346 bones recovered from the site, 810 (9.7 percent) had evidence for cultural modification. Of the 810 bones which had been culturally modified, thermal alteration (n = 692, 84.8 percent) was by far the most common form of modification. Mercado Site (41TR203) 273 July 2019

Of the 810 modified bones, approximately 7.8 percent (n = 63) exhibit cut marks and three displayed evidence of being chopped with a stone tool. In addition, 13 specimens exhibit evidence of other cultural modifications which are summarized in Table 8.4. Table 8.4.

Brown discoloration is indicative of short-term and lower heat burning, such as exposure to a grass fire or camp fire for less than 6 minutes (Lyman 1994). Blackened bone has been carbonized and would indicate prolonged exposure to a grass fire or camp fire. Gray and white bone has been fully calcined, which means that it has lost all organic matter and become plastically deformed. Thermal alteration was by far the most prevalent modification on the bone (n = 692, 84.8 percent of culturally modified bone, 8.3 percent of all bone in the assemblage). Of the 692 bones with thermal alteration, 205 exhibit brown discoloration, 304 are blackened, 159 are fully calcined, and 24 have turned gray from heating. Thermal alteration includes both direct burning of the bone which was exposed to fire and indirect modification of the bone from another heat source. It was noted during analysis that numerous long bones, a mandible, and rarely, a rib had a localized brown spot on the bone varying in size but approximately 2 to 3 cm long by 2 to 3 cm wide. Within the browning were microfractures on the bone radiating out, indicating quick contact with extreme heat (rather than being held over a flame and slowly increasing in heat to the bone). The localized browning was near or adjacent to a spiral/green break, typically at the breakage point along a long bone for marrow extraction. Similar brown marks have been described elsewhere in the literature). They have been assumed to be Mercado Site (41TR203) 275 July 2019

associated with heating of the bone for marrow extraction. A suggestion has been that these marks are instead the result of application of a heated rock to the bone, in essence searing the bone and weakening it, such that striking it would cause it to break with less effort. There is evidence from site 41TR203 for burned rock features. The rock could have been heated for placing the meat on the rocks and heating palettes. As heating of poor lithic raw material is well-known to make breakage more predictable and less labor-intensive (Domanski and Webb 1992), it is possible similar techniques were applied to bone for marrow extraction. Since the fragments of small lizard (cut), very small colubrid snake (thermal alteration), small aves (thermal alteration), pocket gopher (cut), marsh rice rat (thermal alteration), cotton rat (thermal alteration), and a microtine mouse/vole (thermal alteration) exhibit evidence of cultural modification, it is suggestive that these species may have been subject to human consumption. 8.4.10 Analytical Units Most of the bone recovered from site 41TR203 was recovered from well-stratified deposits with associated C-14 dates. Of the 8,346 total bones recovered from the site, 8,067 (97 percent) are from well-defined stratigraphic levels that are grouped into three temporal/cultural periods, including Late Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric. The remaining 279 bones are either located between levels or could only be assigned to rough approximations of levels. Temporal associations of each analytical unit (AU) were determined by radiometric dating (Table 8.5). Dates for those units have been compiled, and the oldest occupation is discussed first. Given the good stratigraphic control and good preservation of bone, it was possible to examine shifts in species presence at the site over time and determine changes in both subsistence strategies and environment (Table 8.5).

Stratigraphically, it is beneath AU 7 at the base of Strat Zone III. A total of 2,261 vertebrate remains were recovered from AU 8, accounting for greater than 27.1 percent of the entire vertebrate assemblage at the site. Table 8.6 summarizes the NISP and MNIs for each taxon and general animal size recovered from AU 8. Feature 21.1 has bison associated with it, while Feature 20 has only unidentified large mammal (bison-size), and Feature 24 has a few specimens identified as jackrabbit and cotton rat. No faunal remains were associated with Feature 42. Grassland species, such as bison (n = 28), rabbit (n = 20), and pocket gopher (n = 2), dominate the identifiable bone recovered from AU 8. Cotton rats (n = 4) can inhabit scrub brush or grassland and most jackrabbits (n = 5), cottontails (n = 5) and other rabbits (n = 10) occupy open and scrub brush terrain. Odocoileus sp. could represent either mule deer or white-tailed deer. While white-tailed deer are more diverse in habitats which they can utilize, they must have forest edge/riparian nearby for foraging. Mule deer (n = 1) prefer shrub brush and chaparral habitats. As it cannot be assigned to species, and mule deer and white-tailed deer tend to utilize different habitats, overlap of their presence is considered uninformative. Whereas deer are the dominate mammal in the entire vertebrate assemblage based on NISP, within AU 8 there are only 10 deer bones contrasted with a total of 70 bovid bones that are all bison. In addition to grassland species, there is a presence within AU 8 of aquatic/wetland species such as catfish (n = 1), turtle (n = 1), beaver or beaver/porcupine (n = 4). Therefore, based on the species present, it is likely that the environment and habitat associated with site 41TR203 during the Late Archaic period represented in AU 8 was an open grassland prairie, potentially grassland floodplains near to a reliable aquatic resource (see Table 8.6).

aquatic species present (beaver, catfish, and turtles) prefer slow-moving water or shallow ponds with muddy bottoms. It is possible that despite the faster-moving waterway of the West Fork of the Trinity River located there today, the aquatic resources may have come from an oxbow, slough, or slow meander associated with the West Fork of the Trinity River that is no longer present. Figure 8.7 illustrates the frequencies of grassland/prairie, chaparral, and woodland species. Figure 8.8 illustrates the frequencies of aquatic versus terrestrial taxa. 8.4.11.1 Seasonality Data Given the presence of reptiles (i.e., turtles and snakes) in the assemblage, there is evidence for warmer weather occupation of the site, as turtles typically hibernate when temperatures drop below 45°F. Based on historic and modern daily averages, the average daily temperatures in the Dallas area are above 45°F from March through November. Reptiles are the only indicator of seasonality within AU 8.

8.4.11.2 Skeletal Part Frequencies Skeletal part frequency analysis for deer (Figure 8.9) depicts a similar degree of high, middle, and low utility elements. While sample size is only 10, elements present in AU 8 represent either nearby or onsite kill and consumption. These elements include ribs, cervical vertebrae, metatarsals, lateral malleolus, a temporal bone fragment, and a lower incisor. What is interesting is a contrast illustrated in Figure 8.10 for white-tailed deer with the analysis for the entire site discussed above where low utility parts dominated. That is not the case with AU 8. Skeletal part frequency of the 70 bovid bones associated with AU 8; however, indicate a slightly higher degree of low utility elements than expected and a few less middle utility elements. It is assumed, due to the deposits having been dated to 2645 to 2430 yr Cal BP, that all bovid bone within AU 8 is bison. Bones included in the frequency analysis below include ribs, femur, patella, scapula, humeri, radii, tibia, metacarpals, various tarsals and carpals, lateral malleolus, phalanges, and teeth. There were some vertebral fragments, but unassignable to cervical, thoracic, lumbar, or caudal. There is evidence for carnivore modification on 18 specimens, and both innominates and vertebrae with their high porosity could have been easily consumed. Overall, it appears both meat processing and consumption was occurring at the site within the AU 8 Late Archaic period occupation of the site. 8.4.11.3 Cultural Modification Both deer and bovid skeletal part frequencies are consistent with some onsite processing and consumption. In addition, modified bone from AU 8 consists of 17 specimens with cut marks (26.6 percent of the 64 total cut marks recorded at the site), 3 specimens with chop marks (100 percent of the three total chop marks recorded at the site), 2 specimens with percussion points/striking platforms (33.3 percent of the six total percussion/striking marks recorded at the site), 1 abraded expedient bone tool (33.3 percent of the total for this category recorded at the site), and 117 burned specimens (16.9% of all burned bone at the site). The modification numbers suggest onsite butchering, and the burning is consistent with cooking and subsistence activities. 8.4.11.4 Breakage Of the 2,261 total bones recovered from AU 8, 23 are unbroken, 2,150 have only evidence of dry breakage, 83 exhibit spiral fractures, three have evidence for other green bone fresh fractures, and Mercado Site (41TR203) 281 July 2019

four have indeterminate breaks. As spiral and green breaks are evidence for cultural processing, a review of bones was undertaken to analyze which bones were being intentionally broken. Forty-six unidentified specimens exhibit spiral fractures. Of the specimens with spiral breaks identifiable to element, or at least to a broad category such as “long bone,” 35 of the 37 specimens are long bones including undefined long bone (n = 27), humeri (n = 4), radius/ulna (n = 3), and tibia (n = 1). The remaining two specimens that exhibit spiral fractures include a second phalanx. In addition, non-spiral green break fractures are also present on two long bone fragments and a temporal cranial bone. Therefore, all the intentional fragmentation is consistent with marrow removal or breakage of the skull to access the brain for consumption. Mercado Site (41TR203) 282 July 2019

8.4.11.5 Weathering Bone from AU 8 was assessed for its degree of weathering. Bone with a ranking of 3 (n = 1,865) was most prevalent, although there are 357 fragments with a ranking of 4, and 41 fragments with an intermediary ranking of 3 to 4. In general, weathering indicates most of the bone was buried immediately after its disposal, but given the 357 bones with a ranking of 4, at least some were exposed to weathering prior to burial. 8.4.12 Analytical Unit 7 (2260-2210 yr Cal BP) AU 7 was initially analyzed as a series of occupations that span a period of 500 years and is stratigraphically within Strat Zone III. Most of the bone within AU 7 was recovered from a sheet midden, potentially formed from cleaning of a few notable earth oven features also located within AU 7. A total of 4,474 vertebrate remains were identified in AU 7, which accounts for more than half (52.3 percent) of the total vertebrate assemblage recovered from the site. In addition, the assemblage from AU 7 accounts for more than half of the total mammalian assemblage (n = 3,584, 51.2 percent), the majority of the avian assemblage (n = 16, 88.9 percent) including all but one of the waterfowl from the site total assemblage, the majority of the reptile assemblage (n = 66, 90.4 percent) including all but one of the turtle remains from the site, and the only unassignable herptile bone (n = 1). Table 8.7 summarizes the NISP and MNIs for each taxon and specimen recovered from AU 7. Only a few specimens identified to a taxon were recovered from features. Bison is associated with Features 32, 34, and 41, and snake and leporids are associated with Feature 33. No faunal remains are associated with Features 6, 35, 36, 38, 40, and 43. Table 8.7.

The fauna from AU 7 is the most diverse of any of the AUs and includes grassland, mixed scrub brush and grassland, scrub brush, riparian, and wetland/aquatic species. Grassland and prairie species dominate. Bison (n = 15) and bovids (n = 57) assumed to be bison due to the age of deposits associated with AU 7 is nearly equal to the NISP in AU 7, but most of the pronghorn (n = 5) and the only identified mule deer (n = 1) are also within AU 7. Both bison and pronghorn are grassland species, although mule deer tend to occupy more scrub brush settings and other open settings. Other grassland species were present, such as pocket gopher (n = 3) and hispid cotton rat, which prefers tall grass (n = 3). There is a moderate presence of species preferring both grassland and scrub brush including a harvest mouse (n = 1), ground squirrel (n = 2), coyote/dog (n = 6), and those preferring brushy/chaparral or edge open environments including the one mule deer (n = 1), cottontail (n = 25), jackrabbit (n = 3), and other leporid rabbit (n = 19). The primary riparian/woodland species present is white-tailed deer (n = 5), though the one fox bone could belong to either a gray fox, which prefers woodland, or a kit fox, which prefers grasslands and deserts. In addition, there are a moderate amount of vertebrate species that prefer aquatic environments, including beaver (n = 6), indeterminate beaver or porcupine (n = 1), Canada goose (n = 1), ducks and small geese (n = 2), indeterminate waterfowl (n = 1), box turtle (n = 2), red eared slider (n = 41), other sliders/cooters (n = 1), pond turtle (n = 3), and other indeterminate turtle (n = 17). Environmental preferences of the identified species are illustrated in Figure 8.11. The presence of diverse species across these habitats is indicative of an early stage successional environment with some grassland transitioning to scrub brush/chaparral and riparian habitat available along the river. This ties in well with noted shifts in C-4 to C-3 plants which peak during and then drop with the temporal termination of AU 7. Most of the aquatic species utilize slower moving, pond-like habitats (e.g., ducks, turtles, and beaver), so it is likely there was a nearby oxbow, slough, or other relict channel associated with the West Fork of the Trinity River during this Late Archaic period utilization of the site. There is a much higher degree of vertebrate aquatic species present than in the later AUs (AUs 1 through 6), however, given the shell midden associated with AU 6, there may have been a shift in the type of aquatic resource utilization from vertebrate to invertebrate taxa. The mollusk shell is discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 10). A comparison of terrestrial to aquatic taxa represented in AU 7 is illustrated in Figure 8.12. Mercado Site (41TR203) 286 July 2019

8.4.12.1 Seasonality Data Given the presence of reptiles (especially turtles) in the AU 7 assemblage, there is evidence for warm weather occupation, as turtles typically hibernate when temperatures drop below 45°F (Roots 2006). Based on historic and modern daily averages (NOAA 2013), the average daily temperatures in the Dallas area are above 45°F from March through November. Geese could also indicate warmer temperatures, but some geese winter in the Dallas area so their presence is not definitive. Another seasonal indicator is the presence of geese and ducks recovered from AU 7. In Texas, however, the presence of migrating waterfowl is not typically conclusive as there are species of ducks that are resident year-round in the state. One exception to this, the presence of Canada geese (Branta canadensis), would suggest a winter use of the site between October and March, although there are some geese that linger longer in Texas. There were no juvenile or neonate artiodactyls in the assemblage associated with AU 7, and while there was antler, none of it was in velvet. Since deer drop their antlers annually, there is potential for them to have been picked up or associated with any season of the year. Given the above, it is probable that AU 7 was occupied multiple times given both warm and winter seasonal indicators. This is consistent with other artifact analyses associated with AU 7 that suggest multiple occupations over a 500-year time span. 8.4.12.2 Skeletal Part Frequencies When skeletal part frequencies from bovids and deer are examined from AU 7, interesting trends are noted. There were only five white-tailed deer bone clearly assignable to a utility category (four low utility and one middle utility) and only one mule deer bone (middle utility) in the AU 7 assemblage. Presence of both could represent different subsistence strategies, yet due to low sample sizes, all deer including white-tailed deer, mule deer, and unassignable Odocoileus sp. were grouped together. The deer bone was pooled in order to examine skeletal part frequencies. Results are similar to those when the full site assemblage was assessed with a much higher than anticipated presence of low utility elements (Figure 8.13). This would support use of the site during this timeframe for initial animal processing with at least some of the higher utility elements being transported to the site from kill sites located some distance away (i.e., schlepping the high meat value elements back to the habitation site).

Bison and bovid bone present, however, indicate a similar trend as the deer with a much higher than anticipated presence of low utility bones (Figure 8.14). Therefore, it is likely that the site would represent a kill and initial processing location with some transport of middle and high utility bones to the site from other kill sites located some distance away.

8.4.12.3 Modification There were only minimal cut marks present on bones from AU 7 (n = 12), no chop marks, and only three specimens with percussion points/impact platforms associated with marrow processing. This represents only 0.3 percent of the AU 7 assemblage and is surprising given the presence of earth oven features within this occupation level. However, 412 bones, or 9.4 percent of the AU 7 assemblage, exhibits signs of burning which would be consistent with cooking in earth ovens and later disposal. 8.4.12.4 Breakage Of the total 4,474 bones from AU 7, 33 specimens are unbroken, 4,048 exhibit dry breaks, 216 exhibit spiral breaks, 15 exhibit non-spiral green breaks, and 126 have indeterminate breaks. As spiral and green breaks are evidence for cultural processing, a review of bones was undertaken to analyze which bones were being intentionally broken. A total of 109 bones of undetermined element exhibit spiral fractures, of which 100 were long bones including undefined long bone (n = 89), radius/ulna (n = 4), femur (n = 3), tibia (n = 3), and metatarsal (n = 1). The remaining specimens with a spiral fracture included one scapula and six rib fragments. In addition, non-spiral green break fractures were also present on one humerus, two radii, one tibia, one tarsometatarsus, eight long bone fragments, and one unknown specimen. Therefore, the majority of intentional fragmentation is consistent with marrow removal. Some bone grease processing is possible given the fragmentation on ribs and scapula, although the spiral fragmentation could have occurred during other butchering or expedient bone tool production. 8.4.12.5 Weathering The bone from AU 7 was assessed for its degree of weathering. Bone with a ranking of 3 (n = 3,553) was most prevalent. There are 690 specimens with a ranking of 4, 75 with an intermittent ranking of 3 to 4, 69 with an intermittent ranking of 4 to 5, 1 with a ranking of 5, and 1 with an indeterminate ranking. Given the high occurrence of 3 and 4 rankings it is likely that most of the bone was left exposed to weathering for a short, not prolonged, period prior to burial. Some of the bone, however, was exposed to weathering for a substantial time given the 4 to 5 and 5 rankings. Given the presence of most of the bone in a sheet midden, some of the bones dumped on top could have been left unexposed during unoccupied times. Mercado Site (41TR203) 291 July 2019

8.4.13 Analytical Unit 6 (2000 yr Cal BP) AU 6 is associated with the top of Strat Zone III and may be associated with a dense shell midden. A total of 67 vertebrate remains were identified in AU 6, accounting for only 0.8 percent of the total vertebrate assemblage from the site. Only a few specimens were recovered from Feature 30, and none were recovered from Feature 19. The fauna from AU 6 is not very diverse, as it only contains mammals and vertebrates. The identifiable mammal species are limited to bison (n = 3), large artiodactyl (n = 2), cottontail (n = 1), and other rabbit (n = 1). Table 8.8 summarizes the NISP and MNIs for each species and specimen recovered from AU 6. Table 8.8.

There is no presence of deer or any medium-large artiodactyls. Bison consists wholly of three teeth fragments, with large artiodactyl consisting of a sesmoid and possible astragalus fragment. Only seven specimens were culturally modified, all of which are burned. One large mammal bone had an odd groove on the external surface which could be incised, but no additional information is available. Obviously, there were some open grassland or edge environments due to the presence of bison and cottontail, but given the paucity of identified vertebrate remains, no environmental information can be stated with confidence based on the vertebrate fauna. 8.4.13.1 Weathering All bone from AU 6 was assessed for their degree of weathering, of which all 67 specimens exhibited a fragmentation ranking of 3, suggesting minimal or no exposure prior to being buried.

8.4.14 Analytical Unit 5 (1815-1470 yr Cal BP) AU 5 corresponds to Strat Zone II. A total of 54 vertebrate remains were recovered from AU 5 which account for only 0.6 percent of the total vertebrate assemblage from the site. The fauna from AU 5 is not very diverse but includes mammals, reptiles, and vertebrates, and identifiable species are limited to pronghorn (n = 1), indeterminate deer (n = 1), medium-large artiodactyl (n = 4), cottontail (n = 1), a slider/cooter turtle (n = 1), and snake (n = 1). Notably absent are bison, bovid, large artiodactyl, and large mammal remains. The presence of pronghorn suggests at least some lingering grassland presence, but not enough or of the quality to support bison, as it is assumed bison would be a preferred prey over pronghorn if present. Also, the only identified pronghorn specimen was a tooth located in a floodplain with no definitive cultural association. It is possible the pronghorn represents redeposition instead of a cultural event. Table 8.9 summarizes the NISP and MNIs for each species and specimen recovered from AU 5. Given the minimal presence of bone, little specific information can be gleaned from the small assemblage from AU 5. The only modified bone are four burned fragments. All 54 fragments exhibit a 3 rank for weathering, so they were buried shortly after their disposal. There are no bones suggestive of seasonality, with the exception of the turtle which would indicate a warm season occupation. Table 8.9.

Part of AU 4 includes a mussel shell midden. There is limited bone associated with AU 4, with only 29 vertebrate remains identified, which account for only 0.3 percent of the total vertebrate assemblage from the site. Only a few bone specimens were recovered from Features 25 and 26, and none were recovered from Feature 21. The fauna from AU 4 is limited to only one identifiable species, coyote/dog (n = 1) with the remainder being only identifiable to mammal and vertebrate. Notably absent are artiodactyls. Table 8.10 summarizes the NISP and MNI for each species and specimen recovered from AU 4. Again, the paucity of vertebrate remains recovered from AU 4 limit the information that can be gleaned from it. The only modified bone includes two burned specimens. Weathering rankings include eight specimens with a rank of 3, 17 with a rank of 4, and one with a rank of 4 to 5. Weather rankings suggest bone was left exposed for some duration prior to burial.

13.5 percent of the total vertebrate assemblage from the site. The fauna from AU 3 is lacking in overall diversity and of bone identifiable beyond class. Deer, including white-tailed deer (n = 8) and indeterminate deer (n = 77), dominate the assemblage. An additional 55 medium-large artiodactyls were also recorded. Large Bovidae (bison-size) (n = 5) is represented by a phalanx and a few rib and vertebra fragments. These large Bovidae remains could not be identified to genus or species. Therefore, there are no definitive grassland species present. The assemblage consists predominantly of mixed scrub brush and woodland or wood-edge species (Figure 8.18). Table 8.11 summarizes the NISP and MNIs for each species and specimen recovered from AU 3. 8.4.16.1 Skeletal Part Frequencies Skeletal part frequencies were assessed for deer. There was a wide disparity in the frequencies in which low utility bones are present with regard to high and middle utility (Figure 8.16). Low utility bones consist predominantly of metapodials, phalanges, radius/ulna, carpals, and cranial remains. Much of the lower utility long bones exhibit evidence of spiral or green fractures which are consistent with processing for extracting bone marrow. 8.4.16.2 Breakage Of the total 1,225 specimens in the AU 3 assemblage, 21 are unbroken, 815 exhibit dry breaks, 261 exhibit spiral breaks, exhibit non-spiral green breaks, and 21 have indeterminate breaks. As spiral and green breaks are evidence for cultural processing, a review of bones was undertaken to analyze which bones were being intentionally broken. A total of 170 specimens of undetermined elements exhibit spiral fractures. Of the specimens with spiral breaks identifiable to element, or at least to a broad category such as “long bone,” 83 include undefined long bone (n = 75), metacarpal (n = 5), tibia (n = 2), and metatarsal (n = 1). The remaining bones with spiral fractures include a first phalanx (n = 2), cranial fragments (n = 5), and one axial fragment. In addition, non-spiral green break fractures were also present on a humerus and a metatarsal, two long bone, one cranial, and three unidentifiable fragments. Therefore, most of the intentional fragmentation is consistent with marrow extraction or breakage of the cranium to access the brain. Mercado Site (41TR203) 295 July 2019

8.4.16.4 Modification A total of 139 bones associated with AU 3 exhibit modification. Of the 139 specimens, 20 exhibit cut marks and 129 had been thermally altered, with some specimens exhibiting both. There were no identifiable butchering marks, such as chopping or percussion points for impact breaks. 8.4.17 Analytical Unit 2 (1530-1200 yr Cal BP) AU 2 occurred directly beneath the plow zone. The vertebrate assemblage associated with AU 2 is very limited. Only 10 vertebrate remains were identified in AU 2, accounting for only 0.1 percent of the total vertebrate assemblage from the site. The identified fauna from AU 2 is limited to only one identifiable taxon beyond class, medium-large artiodactyl (n = 1) with the remainder only identifiable to mammal. Table 8.12 summarizes the NISP and specimens recovered from AU 2. Given the limited size of the assemblage, only minimal information can be gleaned; however, there is one potential expedient tool with an abraded edge associated with AU 2. The only other modified bone has either been gnawed by rodents (n = 2) or burned (n = 2). Weathering rankings include nine specimens assigned to a rank of 3, but one specimen has a rank of 2. Weather rankings suggest bone was buried soon after its deposition. There are no identified faunal indicators for seasonal use of the site. Table 8.12.

species identified beyond class from AU 1 is deer (n = 1). Table 8.13 summarizes the NISP and MNIs for each species and specimen recovered from AU 1. Given the limited assemblage size, only minimal information can be gleaned from it. The only modified bone is one burned specimen. Weathering rankings include 16 specimens with a rank of 3, 18 with a rank of 4, and 1 with a rank of 4. Weather rankings suggest the bone was weathered for an extended time prior to burial.

These specimens are primarily derived from trenches and shovel tests that were not able to provide more accurate depth and geomorphological context. Identified taxa include a single lizard specimen (Lacertilia), deer (Odocoileus sp.) (n = 15), pronghorn (n = 1), cf. pronghorn (n = 1), and bison (n = 1). Features 14 and 29 are included in this assemblage. None of the identified taxa are associated with these two features (see Table 8.14). The occurrence of bison, deer, and pronghorn suggests many of these unassigned specimens are most likely associated with the Late Archaic component at the Mercado site, or AUs 7 and 8. Because there is no chronological affiliation or vertical association assigned to these specimens, they do not warrant further Mercado Site (41TR203) 299 July 2019

The ten specimens were judgmentally selected based upon the following criteria: 1) identification to the lowest taxonomic level, preferably species or genus; 2) complete or nearly complete, or an articular end of a long bone; 3) large enough to produce a reliable AMS date; and 4) as many of the eight AUs were represented as possible, particularly those grouped according to cultural/temporal affiliation, including Late Archaic (AUs 6 through 8), Transitional Archaic (AUs 4 and 5), and Late Mercado Site (41TR203) 300 July 2019

The breadth of information presented thus far will be summarized with respect to these issues. Specific vertebrate faunal research questions developed for data recovery include: 1. Do the changes in faunal assemblages reflect changes in C3 and C4 ecosystems? Environmental conditions and species availability within the catchment area of the site altered over time. The vertebrate faunal assemblages recovered from AUs 1 through 8 provide collaborative evidence in conjunction with the radiometric dates of paleoenvironmental habitats that were exploited by the Late Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric inhabitants of site 41TR203. Regarding the radiometric dated geomorphic levels at the site, stable carbon isotopes reported as δ13C values provide information on local vegetation. It has been recognized for a long time that different groups of plants have significantly diverse pathways of photosynthesis, resulting in a unique chemistry in plant tissues. Most plants are C3 (approximately 95 percent), with C4 Mercado Site (41TR203) 301 July 2019

accounting for approximately 5 percent. The C3 and C4 pathways produce different δ13C signatures. C3 woody plants have δ13C values that are less than -19percent (more negative), and C4 grasses have δ13C values that are more than -19percent (less negative) (O’Leary 1988). Seven AMS radiocarbon dates of bone collagen from AUs 1 through 8 yielded δ13C values ranging from -9.1 to -0.5percent spanning the period 2723 to 956 yr Cal BP (774 B.C. to A.D. 994) (see Table 8.5). Based upon δ13C values, the earlier Late Archaic components (AUs 7 and 8) had local vegetation consisting of mixed shrubs/grasses vegetation as evidenced by δ13C values clustering around -9.1 to -9.5 and also -20.0 to -20.5 from bison and deer collagen. The Transitional Archaic period vegetation was likely dominated by grassland with deer collagen yielding a δ13C value of - 20.2. More recently, during the Late Prehistoric, the local vegetation was grassy shrubland as evidenced by cottontail collagen yielding a δ13C value of -18.2. The vertebrate faunal assemblages collaborate these paleoenvironments. 2. Are there a significant number of bison remains? All the identified bison remains (to genus level) were recovered from the Late Archaic components comprised by AUs 6 through 8. The total bison and cf. bison NISP (n = 49) is the largest meat producing identified taxon from this component. Its absence in the assemblages for the Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods is indicative of its importance in the subsistence of the Late Archaic period occupants of the site. 3. How does the number of bison compare to other open prairie style species? The bison NISP (n = 49) compared to other grassland taxa include pronghorn (n = 5) and deer (n = 67) during the Late Archaic period. The presence of bison and pronghorn are indicative of predominately grassland habitats while the deer supports a grassland and forest ecotone environment being present nearby to the site during the Late Archaic. 4. Do grassland changes appear to have affected the presence of bison? There are noted environmental changes represented by the shifting ratios and presence of identified taxa noted in the AUs where the amount of bone present exceeds 100 specimens, which includes AUs 3, 7, and 8. AU 8, representing the Late Archaic, is dominated by grassland species such as bison, but with a shift to a more diverse assemblage during AU 7, which is slightly later during the Mercado Site (41TR203) 302 July 2019

Late Archaic. There are indicators of nearby prairie with a successional ecotone of scrub brush and riparian habitats overlapping or adjacent to the site. By the time of AU 3, representing the Late Prehistoric at 1719 to 1025 yr Cal BP, taxa presence shifted to those species that prefer woodland and some scrub brush and mixed open habitats. The occupation of the Mercado site (until 1050 yr Cal BP) ends just prior to the earliest occupation of a well-preserved nearby site, Fish Creek Slough (41DL436). The earliest occupation at Fish Creek Slough is dated to 1270 AD, or approximately 800 yr Cal BP. In that earliest occupation at the site, bison was present, but minimally (n = 2), with an increase in the presence of bison by AD 1405 to 1650 and a decreasing in their presence after A.D. 1650. The two well-preserved, nearby sites can give a fairly holistic picture of bison presence and shifting grassland availability from 2645 yr Cal BP to the nineteenth century. The faunal evidence suggests a shift or transition from predominately a grassland habitat to a mixed grassland and forest or ecotone habitat during the end of the Late Archaic into the Transitional Archaic periods. This change from predominately grassland to mixed grassland and forest appears to have affected the presence of bison and a shift in the subsistence economy as represented by the later (Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric) cultural components. 5. Do any specimens exhibit cut marks? Cut marks, minimal chops, and breakage of bone with a hammerstone (percussion points) were evident and browning at some break points may have indicated localized heating of bone with hot rocks to make breakage of the bone easier. Spiral fractures were predominantly noted on long bones consistent with breakage for the extraction of marrow. There was no pattern suggesting an increase or decrease in marrow extraction over time, and there is no direct evidence for processing bone to extract grease at the site. 6. Do cut marks or other data indicate that the animals were butchered on site or were brought to the site from elsewhere? Skeletal part frequencies for AU 8, Late Archaic, indicate nearby kill and onsite consumption, but skeletal part frequency analysis for both bison and deer for AU 7, Late Archaic, and for deer for AU 3, Late Prehistoric, would indicate that while the animal was killed near the site, and some Mercado Site (41TR203) 303 July 2019

## Page 335

initial processing for meat removal and marrow extraction occurred at the site. Elements with high and middle meat utility may have been transported to the site from other kill loci through schlepping. 7. Do the various species reflect a broad-spectrum diet? The diverse faunal assemblage recovered from the Late Archaic (AUs 6 through 8) component suggests a broad-spectrum subsistence strategy. However, the paucity of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds suggests these taxa are likely intrusive to the cultural deposits or were acquired opportunistically if readily available by the site’s occupants. In contrast, the larger game that includes bison, deer, and pronghorn appear to reflect a focal hunting strategy of large game, with hunting forays on short trips to surrounding areas and the kill sites being elsewhere. The presence of most of the site’s lagomorph (n = 39) remains, also from the Late Archaic component, suggests these smaller game animals were probably acquired opportunistically. 8. Do the vertebrate faunal remains reflect a specialized use of the site? The vertebrate faunal assemblage from the Mercado site strongly suggests the site was used as a semi-permanent seasonal camp by its prehistoric occupants, spanning the Late Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. The Late Archaic component, represented by AUs 6 through 8, represents a base camp where bison, deer, and pronghorn were killed elsewhere, and the high-meat yielding elements were returned to the site for further processing for consumption. The Transitional Archaic occupation, represented by AUs 4 and 5, is characterized by shell middens (see Chapter 8). The vertebrate faunal assemblage is indicative of a focal subsistence centered on the harvesting and processing of mollusks from the West Fork of the Trinity River. The Late Prehistoric component, represented by AUs 1 through 3, has a limited variety of taxa with an emphasis upon deer (n = 86). The deer specimens are indicative of hunting forays into the nearby deciduous forests and schlepping the higher meat-yielding bones back to the Mercado site for further processing for consumption. 9. Does the assemblage suggest seasonal occupation of the site? If so, do the AUs reflect changes in seasonality? Mercado Site (41TR203) 304 July 2019

The occurrence of amphibians and reptiles in the Late Archaic assemblage, AUs 6 through 8, is indicative of spring through fall use of the site when these taxa would have been active. There is no direct evidence of a winter or cold weather occupation of the site. Indirect evidence of a fall occupation is illustrated by the dominance of bison, deer, and pronghorn. Traditionally, among Plains Tribes, fall hunting forays were pursued prior to the winter months, when the large game animals were most fit with regards to their meat value and condition of their hides for making clothing and shelters. Consequently, an apparent focus on hunting large game animals indirectly supports a fall occupation of the site. 10.Do the concentrations of faunal remains reflect different processing activities? The vertebrate faunal remains do not reflect different processing activities. A large part of the assemblage is fragmented as a result of probable processing of bone marrow. The fragmentation of predominately the long bones appears to have occurred during both the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations of the site. The paucity of vertebrate faunal remains from the Transitional Archaic period occupation of the site does not permit reflecting upon this, since the component is dominated by shell middens. 11.Is there evidence of bone grease processing? The types and amount of fragmentation of bones were examined and recorded. Extensive fragmentation of larger bones is typically indicative of heavy processing for marrow and bone grease. Smashing of long bones of medium mammals and larger was common amongst most Great Plains groups for the extraction of marrow and bone grease (Kehoe and Kehoe 1960; White 1953, 1954, 1955). General observations during analysis were that for bison, deer, and pronghorn, some long bones with higher utility based on marrow content had been fractured, but the bone does not appear to have been smashed for bone grease extraction. In addition, while most of the long bones such as femurs, humeri, tibias, radii, and metapodials have been broken for marrow, phalanges had not been intentionally broken. 12.Were any of the rock features used for boiling bones to produce bone grease? Some of the rock features may have been used to prepare bone grease; however, general observations during analysis were that for bison, deer, and pronghorn, some long bones with higher Mercado Site (41TR203) 305 July 2019

utility based on marrow content had been fractured, but the bone does not appear to have been smashed for bone grease extraction. 13. Was the site near the kill sites of the animals and used as an initial processing site, or does the evidence suggest a post-processing site? Does this differ between AUs? The general absence or paucity of low-meat yielding elements of bison, deer, and pronghorn suggests the kill sites were likely near the Mercado site, and the highest meat-yielding bones were returned, or schlepped, back to the site for further preparation for consumption. There does not appear to be any difference in the processing of the larger game animals between the Late Archaic (AUs 6 through 8) and the Late Prehistoric (AUs 1 through 3). The paucity of vertebrate faunal remains from the Transitional Archaic period, AUs 4 and 5, does not permit comparisons with the preceding Late Archaic or the subsequent Late Prehistoric period occupations. 8.7 Paleoenvironment Table 8.16 summarizes the preferred habitats of the identified taxa recovered from AUs 6, 7, and 8, which represent the Late Archaic occupation at site 41TR203. The identified taxa represent all available local habitats and environs that include aquatic, riparian, grassland, deciduous forest, and culturally modified landscapes. Since the Late Archaic occupants of the Mercado site unlikely were engaging in agricultural activities, agricultural fields are unlikely to have existed as a habitat for those taxa, but they are mentioned and included as a basis for possible early agricultural pursuits along the West Fork of the Trinity River. Bison, deer, and pronghorn, the largest game animals, also having the highest meat value, were undoubtedly the focal subsistence taxa hunted by the site occupants during this period. Based on the elements present in the assemblage, local individuals were likely hunted opportunistically, while more oftentimes the animal kill sites were some distance from site 41TR203, and the high meat value bones were returned, or schlepped back, to the site for further processing. Expansive grasslands with deciduous forests along the river would be expected to be dominant during this period. Precipitation and temperatures were ideal for maintaining the grassland and mixed deciduous forest habitats and ecotones, which has supportive evidence in the presence of aquatic and riparian taxa also represented in the assemblage.

Table 8.17 summarizes the preferred habitats of the identified taxa associated with AUs 4 and 5, which represent the Transitional Archaic period occupation of site 41TR203. The limited identified taxa, being only deer and pronghorn, indicate a habitat consisting of mixed deciduous forest and grassland. The paucity of vertebrate faunal remains and the elements represented in the assemblage suggest these taxa were likely hunted opportunistically when they entered the vicinity of the Mercado site.

This major shift in subsistence and procurement strategies may be associated with climatic events that altered the preferred habitats of grazers and browsers such as the bison, deer, and pronghorn. Or there was a shift in subsistence preferences that emphasized exploitation of mollusks in the West Fork of the Trinity River. Given the presence of the shell middens, the river must have had a reliable water flow that provided an ideal habitat for large numbers of mollusks. Table 8.18 summarizes the identified taxa and their preferred habitats for AUs 1, 2, and 3 which represent the Late Prehistoric occupation of site 41TR203. The limited taxa indicate habitats consisting of mixed deciduous forest and grassland with riparian also represented. There are no aquatic vertebrate taxa and only medium-large (e.g., deer) and small (e.g., cottontail, cotton rat, wood rat) mammals are represented. The cottontail and deer would have been attracted to agricultural fields if they existed. These taxa were likely hunted opportunistically when they entered the vicinity of the Mercado site.

After a very minimal presence of bison represented by fragmented teeth in AU 6 at approximately 2000 yr Cal BP there is a complete absence of identifiable bison bone in any of the AU 1 through 5 assemblages. Given the dominance of bison in the diet when available, the paucity or absence of bison or large Bovidae indicates they rarely occurred within the site catchment area after 2000 yr Cal BP through 1050 yr Cal BP. Also of note is that after approximately 2210 yr Cal BP, represented by AU 7, there is an absence of any vertebrate aquatic habitat species, which is interesting given the proximity of the West Fork of the Trinity River. This coincides with the introduction of shell midden assemblages and may simply signify a shift from vertebrate to invertebrate aquatic resources. Most of the aquatic species utilized, such as beaver, ducks, turtles, and catfish, would tend to prefer slower moving or ponded waters, such as a slough, oxbow, or slow meander. The shift in subsistence at this time may also indicate a change in the riverine environment as well, and the mussel shell assemblage provides information pertinent to the type of aquatic environment represented by those species during later occupations. 8.8 Subsistence Strategies It is hard to discuss accurate usage of aquatic resources without the complimentary information on findings regarding the mollusk analysis, but it appears only in the earliest assemblage, AU 8 of the Mercado Site (41TR203) 309 July 2019

Late Archaic period, focused on the use of aquatic resources. Additionally, those resources seem to either have been hunted (e.g., beaver and ducks) or gathered (e.g., turtles), with only minimal fishing occurring as only one catfish bone was identified in the assemblage. Shifts after 2,000 years ago suggest a reliance on deer, after which there is little diversity in the later Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric assemblages. 8.9 Taphonomy The preservation of bone at site 41TR203 is unique for North Texas assemblages of its age. A few factors likely contributed to the site’s preservation, including rapid sedimentation and burial of material, likely from flood events of the West Fork of the Trinity River, and the substantial use of mussel shell which, due to its calcareous nature, can alter soils to be less acidic and allow for better bone preservation. There was substantial dry bone breakage at the site, but most bone was not heavily weathered, and fragments tended to be larger than smaller, still in good condition, and not brittle. There was some evidence for rodent gnawing and carnivore consumption (puncture and digestive erosion), but its presence is minimal considering the amount of bone recovered. Overall, few sites in Texas could come close to a similar level of preservation as the Mercado site. 8.10 Cultural Use of Bone North Texas and the region surrounding Tarrant and Dallas counties tend to be poor in high quality lithic resources. Expedient bone tools have been noted at other sites in the region, such as Fish Creek Slough (41DL436), and were noted here at the Mercado site (41TR203) as well. When processing bone for marrow, breaks tend to be sharp. Although they may become dull over time and deposition, the working edges generally are retained with an angled edge, yet some bones in the assemblage exhibited a polish from being held, used, and worn, with abraded edges being sharp as they should be. Bone, unlike stone, cannot easily be re-sharpened, so once becoming dull through use, most bone tools would have been discarded. In addition to the expedient bone tool presence, there were a couple of long bone fragments that had been incised, although the bone was too fragmentary to better identify the taxon or the tool’s function. Sites should be more closely assessed to look at seeming raw bone for potential cultural modifications to glean a better picture of expedient bone tool use in addition to other cultural use of bone. The unique preservation and large faunal assemblage from the Mercado site have provided knowledge about cultural lifeways, prehistoric human ecology, and environmental conditions Mercado Site (41TR203) 310 July 2019

9.0 CHAPTER 9 – LITHICS By: James W. Karbula and Robert Lassen 9.1 Introductions and Methods In accordance with TxDOT Chipped Stone Analytical Protocol (TxDOT 2014), lithic artifacts were separated into various taxonomic groups during analysis to help determine associations between landscape, periods, groups, and regions and the manufacturing styles and techniques used among the people who occupied these spaces. The analysis follows the basics of the Protocol outline for both stone tools and debitage. All studied artifacts were coded with metrics on the TxDOT Stone Tool Microsoft Excel recording forms. Artifacts were initially separated into two taxonomic groups according to technology: chipped- stone (the result of flint knapping) or ground stone (lithic manufacturing via the grinding or pecking of one stone with another). Class was then used to further separate the tools (lithics designed for intentional use/function) from the non-tools (lithics that cannot demonstrate intentional use/function). When appropriate, artifacts were assigned an Analyst Specimen Number, the formula for which begins with the Lot Number assigned in the field per unique provenience followed by an analyst assigned number in numeric order. Analyst Specimen Numbers are provided in this chapter when discussing unique artifacts which correspond with artifact tables and photographs. Those artifacts classified as chipped-stone tools were further separated into subgroups based upon primary manufacturing technique: simple detachment-based, complex detachment-based, and core-based. Simple detachment-based tools are considered those which required little to no modification once detached (e.g., flakes or blades). Complex detachment-based and core-based tools are those tools subject to substantial modification prior to use, including bifacial and unifacial reduction (e.g., projectile points). Core-based tools, however, are distinguished by their manufacture from material cores, as opposed to manufacture from detachments. Because the difference between complex detachment-based tools and core-based tools lies in the initial piece the tool was manufactured from, differentiation is difficult (TxDOT 2014). Simple detachment-based tools were then separated into two classes: flakes and blades, further distinguished by either modified or unmodified flakes or blades. Complex detachment-based and Mercado Site (41TR203) 313 July 2019

core-based tools were separated into bifaces and non-bifaces, further distinguished by formal and informal bifaces/non-bifaces. A formal tool is considered that which can be easily recognized by its morphology due to the traditional manner in which the tool was manufactured. Conversely, an informal tool cannot be recognized beyond that it is a complex detachment-based or core-based tool. Complex detachment-based and/or core-based formal tools were identified by their function, then identified within the classical typological system (Gary, Ellis, Ensor, etc.) (TxDOT 2014). When analyzing the lithic collection from 41TR203, five stages of manufacture were recognized per the TxDOT Protocol (2014). Stage 1 refers to the initial reduction. Pieces are recognized by the presence of cortex and show signs of mass thinning, initial shaping, and “hard-hammer percussion.” Stage 2 refers to blanks, those pieces which exhibit intentional reduction towards develop into a tool. Minimal cortex may remain. Stage 3 refers to preform production, where a generalized tool has been developed and only a minimal number of tools can be manufactured moving forward. Significant reduction in thickness is visible and shaping and thinning of the tool is what remains to be addressed. Stage 4 refers to tools that have been manufactured and need marginal work to be completed (notching, edge grinding). Stage 5 refers to rejuvenated tools marked by retouched edges, reduction in size, or remodeling (TxDOT 2014). Raw materials type for tools (and for debitage) is generally observed and recorded in the following discussion and quantified in the TxDOT Stone Tool recording forms. Core based tools that are clearly bifacial (flaked on both sides of the artifact) are classified as formal tools and then by function (arrow, dart, adze, knife) dependent upon size, thickness, number of working edges, presence of hafting technology, and especially indications of use and re- sharpening, such as heavily modified blade or working edge lateral edge angles and impact fractures. Utilized and re-sharpened projectile points are easily identified through altered lateral edge angles and impact fractures. These types of artifacts were typically broken during re- sharpening and rejuvenation. Most of the projectiles at site 41TR203 exhibit utilized, re-sharpened, and broken attributes during re-sharpening. Several of the darts at site 41TR203 strongly resemble the Late Archaic Gary type with a contracting, pointed and tapering stem with a broad blade and variable shoulders, which is a well-documented manufacturing trajectory for these formal tools. Core-based or core-derived non-bifacial tools with one working unifacial edge (i.e., uniface) can represent formal or informal tools based on intentional versus unintentional modification and Mercado Site (41TR203) 314 July 2019

determination of function (e.g., adze, knife, burin, end-scraper, drill, etc.). Unifaces can be manufactured on flakes used for specific functions or unmodified expedient tools. These often exhibit extensive cortex as a core-derived tool. Observations are recorded regarding production- related discard versus use-related discard. Tool breakage fracture patterns are evaluated in support of this determination. Basic use wear studies were conducted of the projectile points to examine where possible edge morphology flake scar patterns, edge construction types, wear patterning, flaking attrition, crushing, smoothing, presence of polish, etching, and hafting evidence. Further analysis of the lithic collection included indication of thermal alteration on the artifacts. Thermal alteration is the intentional subjection of the lithic to fire in order to more easily work the piece. Due to the difficulty in determining whether a piece was intentionally subjected to fire or incidentally subjected to fire, all pieces visibly subjected to heat were termed thermally altered. An estimation of percent cortex was undertaken for the flakes. Debitage was grouped in the following percentages: 0 percent, 1 to 25 percent, 26 to 50 percent, 51 to 75 percent, 76 to 100 percent. 9.2 Stone Tools A total of 394 lithic items were collected from data recovery investigations in 4 open excavation blocks (A, B, C, and F) and 1 geoarchaeological trench investigation at site 41TR203 (excluding shatter). Of the 27 tools recovered, 13 are considered formal tools, 9 informal tools, and 5 otherwise classified. Twelve of these are complete or fragmented projectile points, six are biface fragments (209.01, 211.01, 118.01, 228.01, 251.01, and 247.01), seven are modified or unmodified utilized flakes (51.01, 89.01, 223.01, and 145.01, 103.01. 165.02, 192.04), and one is a ground stone fragment in four pieces which do not conjoin (144.01) (Table 9.1). Six of the darts are complete specimens (136.01, 209.02, 254.01, 90.01, 90.02, and 264.01), and six are fragments (250.01, 73.01, 237.01, 276.01, 136.03 and 151.01). One flake is identified as a small flake-blade preform, narrow and blade-like in shape, with a distinct dorsal ridge (58.01). Projectile points are also classified by AU and by feature in Table 9.1. All studied artifacts were coded with metrics on the TxDOT Stone Tool recording forms. Mercado Site (41TR203) 315 July 2019

These tend to be thick, medium to large, triangular bladed contracting stem projectile points with indistinct squared shoulders that may be slightly barbed or have an upward taper. The points exhibit medium to long, contracting, pointed to rounded stem bases. Stems can also be slightly expanding with a convex base. Gary variants typically exhibit a random flaking pattern and heavily re-sharpened blades. Photo 9.1. Gary Points Recovered from 41TR203 (from Left to Right: 254.01, 136.01, 209.02, and 250.01) Specimen 254.01 is made on a coarse-grained gray chert. The blade lateral edge angles are heavily altered, indicating use and re-sharpening (Stage 5; TxDOT 2014). The shoulders are indistinct but slightly barbed, the stem markedly contracting, and the base pointed. The flaking pattern is random and crude. Flaking attrition indicates bifacial wear consistent with use in cutting, and distal polish suggests piercing. Though it was almost certainly hafted, no polish indicative of hafting was observable at 20x. Specimen 136.01 is a smaller projectile point manufactured on a white, opaque chalcedony-like material. The blade is re-sharpened and the artifact reused and re-sharpened (Stage 5). One shoulder is slightly flared and the other indistinct. The stem is markedly contracting and Mercado Site (41TR203) 317 July 2019

tapering to the pointed base. Bifacial attrition along the lateral blade edges indicates cutting use, but no polish was observable under 20x magnification. Specimen 209.02 is manufactured on a fine- grained gray chert. The triangular blade edges are relatively straight and even, but exhibit altered lateral edge angles on both edges at the distal tip, and it is, therefore, a Stage 5 utilized and re- sharpened artifact. The stem is markedly contracting and the base slightly convex. The shoulders are somewhat barbed. Traces of cortex are present along the base. This artifact may have been much larger before extensive re-sharpening. The blade edges exhibit bifacial flaking attrition and shallow polish, along with polish on the stem, indicating that the point was hafted and used for cutting. Specimen 250.01 is another Stage 5 heavily utilized and re-sharpened projectile point. This small dart exhibits significantly altered and damaged blade lateral edge angles, and a significant impact fracture emanating from the distal tip. The dart is manufactured on a fine-grained tan material. The shoulders are heavily re-sharpened; the stem markedly contracting to the pointed or rounded base. Bifacial attrition and shallow polish along the blade edges, along with the impact damage, indicate that the point had pierced and cut materials. Proximal polish demonstrates that the point was hafted. One projectile point bears affinities to the well-documented Gary projectile point type and is likely of similar age range (Photo 9.2). Specimen 264.01 is a small, triangular bladed projectile point with extensively altered lateral edge angles indicating a Stage 5 finished, utilized, and re-sharpened artifact. The artifact is manufactured on a fine-grained, slightly purple banded chert and may exhibit evidence of thermal alteration. The shoulders are well pronounced. The contracting stem is broken due to impact burination and the base missing except for along one edge. Like most points, it exhibits bifacial cutting attrition along its blade edge, along with shallow polish. Signs of hafting were likely obliterated in the proximal damage, however. The artifact exhibits the size, blade shape, and contracting stem of Late Archaic Gary points. Mercado Site (41TR203) 318 July 2019

Gary, Wells, and Ensor/Ellis Points (from Left to Right: 264.01, 90.01, and 90.02) 9.2.1.2 Wells Projectile Point (n = 1) One projectile point is morphologically similar to the documented Wells projectile point type. These artifacts are long, narrow darts with distinct to weak shoulders and a long contracting stem (Turner et al. 2011:170; Prewitt 1974; Prikryl 1990, Shafer 1963; Suhm and Jelks 1962). These are typically Middle Archaic projectile points (6000–4500 yr Cal BP) and collected from east Texas, east central Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Specimen 90.01 is a long, slender, narrow projectile point (see Photo 9.2). The artifact is manufactured on a fine-grained tan-brown chert. The blade is extensively re-sharpened, and almost reworked to a drill-like tip. The shoulders are indistinct and the stem is long, narrow, contacting, and tapering. The base is straight to slightly convex. The blade exhibits bifacial edge attrition, along with shallow lateral and deep distal polish, consistent with piercing and cutting. The stem is also slightly polished, indicating hafting. 9.2.1.3 Ensor/Ellis Projectile Point (n = 1) One projectile point is identified as Ensor with Ellis affiliations (90.02) (see Photo 9.2). The artifact is small and thick with a heavily re-sharpened blade, side or corner notches, a markedly expanding stem, and a convex base. This point exhibits bifacial edge attrition as well as shallow distal and Mercado Site (41TR203) 319 July 2019

lateral polish on the blade, consistent with use as a projectile point. Additional stem polish indicates hafting. It is manufactured on a fine-grained gray chert. Turner et al. (2011) suggest that there is a wide range of variation among basal shapes of Ensor points with a chronology that spans the Transitional Archaic (~2200 to 1400 yr Cal BP). They are geographically widespread in central and south Texas. The artifact morphology fits well within the documented range of variability for Ensor points (Anthony and Brown 1994; Karbula 2000, Prikryl 1990; Story et al. 1990; Suhm and Jelks 1962). In fact, the morphological variation of many projectile points of the Texas Late Archaic and Transitional Archaic intervals has led to the recognition of an Ensor- Frio-Fairland continuum, all of similar age and varying morphologies. Turner et al. (2011:93) also suggest that Ellis projectile points can be difficult to distinguish morphologically from Ensor. And the geographic distribution of Ellis points overlaps the location of 41TR203 in Tarrant County, north- central Texas. The temporal range for Ellis is Late to Transitional Archaic, and they have been dated to early as 3000 yr Cal BP (Turner et al. 2011:93). 9.2.1.4 Miscellaneous Forms (n = 5) Five artifacts are identified as miscellaneous projectile point forms (Photo 9.3). Two are broad-bladed triangular projectiles that can be generally assigned to Late Archaic, based on size and general morphology. One of these is a fragment missing the distal portion of the artifact (237.01). The lateral blade edges that remain are extremely sinuous and uneven. The flaking is irregular. This dart may have been broken during final thinning of the blade based on the perverse fracture (Stage 4, Final Stage). Additionally, there is a lack of edge attrition and polish, suggesting it was not used. The dart exhibits wide corner notches and one shoulder is very strong and pronounced. The stem is contracting and the base slightly convex. Another broad triangular bladed specimen (151.01) is manufactured on a fine-grained light tan chert. One shoulder and the base are missing. One corner notch is an indication of hafting. The artifact is Stage 5, utilized and re- sharpened, as the blade is extensively re-sharpened. Bifacial edge attrition indicates cutting use. Another fragment represents a miscellaneous distal tip (276.01, not depicted). The shoulders may be intact and are very indistinct, but the base is missing. The proximal break was reworked into a scraper edge. The scraper edge and one lateral edge exhibit shallow unifacial scraping attrition, as well as shallow polish. The artifact is Stage 5, utilized and heavily re-sharpened. Mercado Site (41TR203) 320 July 2019

Another specimen is bifacial and a possible project point (73.01). It is triangular in form with no notches or shoulders. The intact stem is slightly expanding and the base is straight suggestive of hafting. The blade is extensively re-sharpened (Stage 5), and there is a significant impact fracture emanating from the distal tip. It exhibits bifacial attrition on one edge and unifacial on the other, with shallow polish present on the lateral and proximal edges as well. A final artifact, 136.03, is a very small distal point fragment. The thickness indicates that it is likely from a dart point, but no other typological information can be discerned. It is made on heat-treated chert. It exhibits bifacial edge attrition but no observable polish. Photo 9.3. Miscellaneous Forms (from Left to Right: 237.01, 151.01, and 73.01) 9.2.2 Bifaces (n = 6) The biface fragments are small, crude, and trend toward expedient use of available materials. Specimen 209.01 is thick and crudely sharpened on a small chert cobble (Photo 9.4). Two very sinuous crude edges are apparent and the tool is covered in approximately 70 percent cortex. Bifacial flaking attrition is visible on one edge, along with shallow lateral and distal polish, suggesting the tool was used for cutting and piercing activities. Specimen 211.01 is a crude fragment manufactured on a quartz cobble. Although some bifacial and unifacial edge attrition is Mercado Site (41TR203) 321 July 2019

visible, polish could not be discerned due to the shiny nature of the material. Specimen 118.01 is another small, thick, crude, seemingly expedient piece manufactured on a small chert cobble with rough sinuous edges and extensive cortex (approximately 40 percent). Bifacial edge attrition was noted on both lateral edges, as well as deep polish, indicating it may have been used to cut soft material. Biface fragment 251.01 is a flake removed from the lip of a biface exhibiting one sinuous bifacial edge which appears to have been re-sharpened into a burin-like point. The lateral edges exhibit bifacial flaking attrition, along with deep polish on the edges and tip, indicating piercing and cutting soft material. The piece was likely broken during re-sharpening. Specimen 228.01 is well-thinned, bifacial, and exhibits one steeply beveled edge that appears to be unifacial and the primary working edge of the tool. The two unifacially modified scraping edges exhibit unifacial flaking attrition, with bifacial attrition on the one bifacial edge. Shallow polish is also present, suggesting the scraping or cutting of harder materials. All of these biface fragments are small and would fit comfortably between the thumb and forefinger during use. Specimen 247.01 is a flake representing the removal of a bifacial edge or lip during rejuvenation. Photo 9.4.

9.3 Utilized Flakes (n = 7) These artifacts are all small, utilized flakes, either intentionally modified or unmodified, for expedient use, and typically exhibit edge damage (Photo 9.5). Uniface 145.01 is a thick flake from a small broken chert cobble, that appears to have been expediently modified resulting in a crude unifacial edge thinned on one side and also with extensive cortex. The artifact was probably used as an expedient cutting or slicing tool. The worked edge exhibits some unifacial attrition, but no polish was observable. Specimen 145.01 may represent a flake from a core altered steeply on one edge for expedient use as a cutting or slicing tool. Specimen 51.01 is lenticular in shale and blade- like, with a distinct dorsal ridge. This artifact is interpreted to represent an unmodified flake blade- tool for expedient use and appears to exhibit edge damage. The one modified edge has unifacial use attrition, but no polish was noted. Specimen 223.01 is a small, thick modified flake with approximately 30 percent cortex and a pronounced unifacial edge on the dorsal side of the flake. Specimen 223.01 may represent a crude flake from a core intentionally modified or nibbled along one unifacial edge for use as an end scraper. The distal and both lateral edges exhibit conforming microscopic attrition, along with shallow polish that may be associated with scraping hard materials. Uniface 89.01 is a small, thin modified flake fragment with a pronounced “nibbled” or worked unifacial edge also on the dorsal face that is not well pronounced. This artifact may represent a recycled flake modified on one edge for use an end scraper. The distal modified edge exhibits unifacial edge attrition and deep polish, possibly indicative of scraping soft material. Uniface 103.01 (not pictured) is a small but thick cortical flake with a distal end that has been trimmed to a steep scraper bevel. It’s microscopic use-wear exhibits unifacial attrition on the distal end and shallow polish, suggesting the scraping of hard material. Uniface 192.04 (not pictured) is a short flake with roughly 75 percent cortex and a unifacially modified distal edge. It also exhibits distal unifacial edge attrition and the shallow polish associated with scraping hard material. Finally, 165.02 is a modified flake fragment with a utilized, slightly concave edge. This worked edge has microscopic attrition, shallow polish, and was likely used as a spokeshave for working hafts or shafts. Similar to the bifaces in the collection, all are small pieces that would be navigable between two fingers for focused scraping activities. All seven pieces exhibit one apparent “worked” edge, from simple observation, but is difficult to determine at this level of analysis whether all of these three represent intentional alteration or more expedient tools with edge damage from use.

These were broken down into four size classes (1-in [Photo 9.6], 3/4-in [Photo 9.7], 1/2-in [Photo 9.8] and 1/4-in) and then further categorized as either complete, broken, or fragmentary flakes, or shatter in accordance with the Sullivan and Rozen (1985) “interpretation-free” typology. Thermal alteration, percent cortex, material type, and other unique attributes were recorded. Minimum Number of Nodules (MNN) are assessed, and platform types are evaluated. Form completeness is addressed, a size-grade analysis is conducted, and percent cortex studied and quantified. The results are then examined for the collection as a whole, by AU, and by feature where appropriate. All studied artifacts were coded with metrics on the TxDOT Core and Debitage recording forms.

The smallest pressure flakes and biface thinning flakes (1/4-in sieve) representing final stage sharpening and re-sharpening predominated in the AU 7 assemblage both in terms of whole flakes and flake fragments (55 whole flakes, 20 broken flakes, 37 flake fragments). Flakes on the 1/2-in sieve were present in relatively small numbers in AU 7 (11 whole flakes, 4 broken flakes, and 9 fragments). Larger flakes (3/4-in and 1- in sieves) were present in the AU 7 assemblage and represented initial-stage thinning and tool manufacture primarily with fist-size or smaller cores (101 whole flakes, 16 broken flakes, and 46 fragments). Many of these larger flakes exhibited extensive cortex (Photo 9.9). A small number of the whole flakes and flake fragments are recorded as thermally altered (Photo 9.10). There was no evidence of larger cores, fist-sized or larger cores, or core fragments in the site as a whole, nor in AU 7. Core reduction occurred with easily transported materials or small cobbles in the immediate vicinity. Mercado Site (41TR203) 327 July 2019

Flakes with cortex remnant were only present in AUs 7 and 8, and in Features 35, 37, 38, 41, 43, and 44 (Tables 9.4 through 9.7). Only Feature 43 is positively identified as a basined hearth. Feature 43 contained only one half-inch flake with cortex. The remainder of these features are loosely categorized as earth oven lid rock/rake-out or discard piles, dumps, or alternatively potentially a small hearth (see Chapter 7). Flakes with cortex were thus common in the sheet midden of cultural debris that represents AUs 6 through 8 (see Chapter 10). A total of 75 larger flakes with cortex (1-in and 3/4-in) versus 35 flakes on the smaller sieves (1/2-in and 1/4-in) with cortex, indicates both initial stage and later stage reduction and manufacture of formal tools from small cobble size or smaller cores (see below). Cortex percentages are recorded in Tables 9.4 through 9.7. Not surprisingly, all of the flakes on the 1/4-in and 1/2-in sieves (n = 35) are 50 percent cortex or less. Perhaps surprisingly, only 9 of the 75 flakes with cortex on the 3/4-in and 1- in sieves exhibit 50 to 100 percent cortex. Approximately 32 percent of the flakes (n = 110 of 347, both whole and fragmentary) in AUs 7 and 8 exhibit cortex. This aspect may indicate that later stage thinning, sharpening in support of tool production and re-sharpening of utilized tools, were more important activities at the site rather than initial stage reduction and preform manufacture.

Per the TxDOT Protocol (2014), “it is difficult to distinguish between purposefully treated materials from those that were incidentally burned” (p. 28). Based on this aspect, “debitage should be recorded as thermally altered, not altered, or indeterminate….and conservatively” (p. 28). Further, “identifying alteration on pieces of insufficient mass is unreliable…all pieces recovered below the 1/2-in sieve should be recorded as indeterminate” (p. 28) (TxDOT 2014). Given the small numbers of identified thermally altered flakes in the collection (n = 29), and over 40 percent collected on the 1/4-in sieve (n = 14), thermal alteration at the site does not represent a significant line of research. A few thermally altered pieces of debitage were identified (Table 9.8), and a small number of these were pot lidded. Alteration was observed in the form of a purple discoloration, cracking, spalling, and pot lidding in these few specimens. All of the thermally altered flakes were identified in AUs 7 and 8, and related features include Features 38, 41, and 44 (see Photo 9.10). Mercado Site (41TR203) 331 July 2019

per AU. In the Late Prehistoric component (AUs 1 through 3), very few flakes with preserved platforms were encountered, but the ones that could be identified were flat, indicating an expedient core flaking technology was utilized. The Transitional Archaic component (AUs 4 and 5) is similar, with the majority of identifiable flake platforms being flat or cortical. However, one faceted platform is present to indicate more careful core preparation. In the Late Archaic component (AUs 6 through 8), far more debitage is present, enabling a better understanding of the knapping activities taking place. Flat and cortical platforms are present in roughly equal numbers compared to abraded and faceted platforms. This duality indicates that expedient flake core knapping and early stage reduction were occurring in conjunction with later stage flake production and biface thinning. As tool production becomes more formalized, and the flaking requirements become more precise, the flintknapper must pay increased attention to the preparation of each flaking platform. As such, preparations such as faceting and abrading are signs of late stage knapping of formal tools, such as bifaces, prismatic blades, and some unifaces. Table 9.9.

The in-situ context of the cultural deposits, especially in AU 7, was excellent based on observed chert material types. Most if not nearly all Lots (proveniences) from unit and feature contexts exhibited flakes all of a consistent chert material type, specific to that unit or feature location, implying flakes were removed off the same nodule. In provenience after provenience, flakes were all of a consistent chert material type that varied between locations.

different chert material types, but within each specific context, flakes were of only one or two material types, and nearly all of the feature-associated flakes were the same parent material. This is highly indicative of an intact context. Raw material analysis was conducted using the MNN technique. For this technique, materials are separated by archeological component then grouped according to similarities that would suggest that they may have been derived from the same cobble. In this respect, it is similar to the “minimum number of individuals” that is assessed in faunal analysis. In this analysis, the first step in grouping the raw material for each component was to observe their reactions under long wave ultraviolet light. Chert from the Edwards Formation of central Texas is known to fluoresce orange under long wave UV light, while most other materials from the Southern Plains do not (Hofman et al. 1991). Thus, the debitage from each component was first sorted into “Edwards” and “Not Edwards” categories. Then, materials were sorted based on visual characteristics under natural light, such as color, mottling, inclusions, and texture. Tables 9.10 through 9.12 give the results of the MNN analysis for each component. Table 9.10.

Even in the artifact-sparse upper two components, the MNN analysis reveals a variety of raw materials in use: a minimum of six nodules for the Late Prehistoric and seven for the Transitional Archaic. In the larger Late Archaic component, a minimum of 25 nodules are represented. However, the most well represented materials in all the components are the gray and tan varieties of Edwards chert. Non-Edwards materials are also notably present in all components but are not as abundant as the Edwards cherts. Additionally, cortex is observed for most of the material types, and in all cases, it is the smooth, dense cortex that is typical of stream cobbles. There has been a question of whether any of the raw materials observed at the Mercado site originated from the outcrops at what is now Fort Hood in Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas. The evidence presented above strongly suggests that none of the materials at this site came from the Fort Hood area. The presence of stream-derived cortex on the vast majority of the materials indicates that river-tumbled cobbles are the primary, and possibly the only, source of knappable stone at the site. Fort Hood is a primary geologic chert source, so any of the materials from there would exhibit either bedrock-derived cortex, or none at all if blanks were knapped at the source. Moreover, the Mercado site materials often exhibit stream-derived cortex on even the smallest flakes, suggesting that relatively small river cobbles were likely used. Although a diversity of raw materials is present at this site, it is possible that they could all derive from a single local riverine source. 9.7 Ground Stone (n = 1) Four fragments of one ground stone artifact were documented in the collection (144.01). The pieces do not refit, but they are of the same material (sandstone), likely part of the same artifact, and were recovered together. The largest piece (approximately 1.5 by 1-in) is a thin slab (1 cm in height), with a thin outer edge and exhibits two very smooth grinding facets, one on each side of the artifact. 9.8 Summary The collection as a whole can be categorized at the bottom of the site deposits (105–145 cmbs) as containing diagnostic projectiles of the Late Archaic Interval in the form of Gary and Ensor/ Ellis projectile points. Figure 9.1 illustrates the distribution of stone tools in AUs 6 through 8 in association with cultural features. The primarily Late Archaic aspect of these projectile point types overlaps the approximate 2700 to 2100 yr Cal BP timeline for the lower site deposits (AUs 6 Mercado Site (41TR203) 336 July 2019

through 8), as established by a series of 2-sigma radiocarbon ages, many in feature context, and by geomorphic studies. The lower assemblage contains all Late Archaic or miscellaneous darts with no admixture from later time periods, small biface fragments, and small utilized flakes, and in small numbers. The assemblage is consistent with limited hunting activities at the site, including projectile point and biface manufacture and re-sharpening. Overall, the site appears to have been an open, seasonally occupied campsite where a limited set of activities occurred, at least in the Late Archaic interval.

10.0 CHAPTER 10 – MUSSEL ANALYSIS By: Traci Popejoy This chapter describes the freshwater mussel fauna from site 41TR203. The species composition of different analytical units is explored. An analysis of the taphonomic processes affecting the assemblage is included to describe potential preservation effects on unionid species representation. Using Dr. Robert Warren’s program UNIO and the relative abundance of mussel species remains, a description of past riverine habitat is provided. Freshwater mussels (hereinafter may be referred to as just mussels) are benthic bivalves within the family Unionidae. These organisms used to be ubiquitous among the eastern United States and have experienced population declines since the early twentieth century (Haag and Williams 2014). Mussel shells were used as spoons and hoes, but more-often represent a “stress food” for hunter and gatherers (Claassen 1998; Parmalee and Klippel 1974). They provide many cultural and provisioning ecosystem services to modern cultures (Vaughn 2017). 10.1 Materials and Methods Mussels leave a chiral pair of calcium carbonate shell per individual. Specimen can be quantified by the presence of “non-repetitive elements” (NRE), which for mussels is an umbo/psuedocardinal teeth pair indicative of either the left or right shell of one organism (Mason et al. 1998; Giovas 2009). Thus, NRE represents the number of individuals in an assemblage and can often be identified to fine taxonomic levels (most often to species). “Number of specimens” (NSP) is used to count identified and unidentified specimens, such as outer shell margins, within the assemblage. NSP is not indicative of a single organism as there may be numerous unidentifiable or identifiable fragments from one shell (unlike umbos, which usually survive intact). For quick enumeration, only NRE will be discussed in this report. While complete identification is ideal when discussing molluscan diversity (Woo et al. 2015), partial identification of assemblages can reveal some information about the community structure. The goal of this analysis was to quantify the community structure among all AUs. As such, lots Mercado Site (41TR203) 340 July 2019

were chosen for identification with the goal to identify an equal number of lots among the analytical units. The number of NRE was different among different lots and among analytical units; lots from the same analytical units tended to be the same size. Assuming lots have similar size and identifiability, we can estimate the number of NRE within this assemblage then estimate the percentage of the shells identified among different analytical units (Table 10.1). AUs 2, 3, and 6 were small and thus almost all lots were identified. AUs 1, 4, 5, and 7 potentially contained many shells and are potentially under-sampled (Woo et al. 2015). In total, there are an estimated 4,344 shells within the assemblage and 981 were counted. Thus, an estimated 23 percent of the total assemblage was sampled. Below is Table 10.1, which is the estimated NRE in each AU and the number actually counted. Estimated NRE in AU was calculated by multiplying the mean NRE per lot by the total number of lots within the AU; then the NRE identified was divided by the estimated NRE to get percentage counted.

Identifications relied on characteristics discussed in the systematic paleontology (below) and in Howells (2013). Modern shells within the Oklahoma Biological Survey’s comparative collection were also consulted, though these specimens are from the Little and Kiamichi Rivers in Oklahoma. Shells were measured for length (the most typical malacological measure of mussel Mercado Site (41TR203) 341 July 2019

size) and pallial line-to-lateral teeth length (highly correlated with shell length, and precise on fragmented shells) (Randklev et al. 2009). 10.2 Freshwater Mussel Diversity Fusconaia sp. is the most abundant species present in site 41TR203 (Figure 10.1, Table 10.2). In total, 15 taxa were identified from the assemblage. Multiple identifiers are used to indicate moderately unidentifiable specimen (Table 10.2); when species could be eliminated, they were. While specimens were identified to the lowest taxonomic level as possible, some could not, especially within the Pleurobemini tribe (see Systematic Paleontology). To address this difference in identification specificity, we address taxonomic shifts among AUs using the taxonomic tribe (Figure 10.2). Figure 10.1. Aggregated Abundance of Mollusk Taxa Table 10.2, below, shows the aggregated abundances of specimen within site 41TR203. Taxa with asterisks denote species of conservation concern; L. satura and F. chunni are listed as threatened by the state of Texas while P. riddelli are state threatened and petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act.

Figure 10.2. Mussel Tribes As depicted in Figure 10.2, there is an abundance of different mussel tribes within each analytical unit. Colors correspond to different mussel tribes based on Haag (2012). If the tribe is listed as NA, the non-repetitive element is either a gastropod or a fossilized marine shell. Percentages represent the estimated proportion of the analytical unit quantified.

As illustrated in Figure 10.3, the tribe follows Haag (2012). Grey boxes delimit analytical units. Numbers above feature bars are the total NRE counted from the feature. It is important to remember that “zooarcheological measures of taxonomic abundance are ordinal scale, at best” (Grayson 1984b; Wolverton 2013; Wolverton et al. 2014). Systematic paleontology is provided to assess data quality, as suggested by Driver (1992) and Wolverton (2013). Specimen were also re-identified to address identification fidelity. Of the two lots re-identified, most identifications were consistent, with a tendency to be more conservative (and identify to a broader taxonomic level) during re-identification. 10.3 Taphonomy When discussing sample fidelity, it is important to address taphonomy or “the study of the transition, in all details, of organics from the biosphere into the lithosphere or geological record” (Lyman 1994). Taphonomic analysis was conducted for the freshwater mussel assemblage using Wolverton et al. (2010)’s conceptual model (Figure 10.4). Different mussel species produce different shells, relating to their habitat conditions; this phenotype is related to habitat preferences with certain substrates favoring lighter, more inflated shells. Thus, different unionid species have shells with distinctive preservation potential. Wolverton et al. (2010) analyzed the preservation potential of freshwater mussel shells based on two physical characteristics: shell sphericity and shell density. The authors found that as shell sphericity increases, preservation potential increases regardless of shell density; as shell density increases so does preservation potential. While they quantified density and sphericity of shell from the Brazos River, we take their density and sphericity values as representative of the Trinity River fauna as well. Based on Wolverton et al.’s (2010) conceptual model, preservation within the assemblage is moderate. The most abundant taxa (Fusconaia spp. and C. mortoni) are of only moderate preservation potential and there are multiple species of low preservation potential (L. teres and L. hydiana) present within this assemblage. For Figure 10.4C, robusticity was estimated by ranking the summed sphericity and density scores of known individuals and then determining where the species with missing density and sphericity would be on this gradient. In this graph, we expect Mercado Site (41TR203) 345 July 2019

the highest abundance for those with the highest preservation potential (P. dombeyanus and A. plicata). The moderate preservation of this assemblage recommends it to full analysis if possible. B C Figure 10.4. Taphonomic Conceptual Model and Analysis Within Figure 10.4, A) depicts the conceptual model described in Wolverton et al. (2010). B) shows the abundance of different mussel species of differing sphericity and density. A) and B) should be directly comparable with the highest preservation potential in the top right corner.

C)shows the preservation potential and abundance of different mussel species. Taxa ID labels are explained in Table 10.2. Preservation can also be quantified through the amount of unidentified material in the assemblage. For the subset sampled: 19.9 percent of NRE are unidentifiable while 39.3 percent could not be identified to a specific species or clade. Of the 1478 specimens counted, 62.7 percent contain non-repetitive elements. 10.4 Paleoenvironmental Reconstruction A paleoenvironmental reconstruction based upon the NRE present in each analytical unit was derived using Warren’s (1991) software program UNIO (Version 3) (Warren 1991) (Figure 10.5). UNIO assesses four habitat variables based on either NTAXA (taxa identified) or NRE: water depth, current velocity, substrate composition and habitat type. Water depth was quantified between 0.0 dm to 46 dm (0 to 4.6 m). Current velocity was categorized as strong “SW,” moderate “MO,” slow “SL,” and standing “ST.” Substrate composition was defined as cobble-gravel “C-G,” gravel “G,” gravel-sand “G-S,” sand “S,” sand-mud “S-M,” and mud “M.” Finally, waterbody type was defined as Large River “LR,” Medium River “MR,” Small River “SR,” Large Creek “LC,” Small Creek “SC,” and Lake “L.” Species were assigned numerical weights (0, 0.5, and 1) based on published habitat preferences; thus, if a species was routinely reported to occur in a gravel-sand substrate, then a score of 1 would be assigned for that environmental variable. In total, UNIO determines the percentage of an archeological assemblage that is adapted to a particular habitat category (see Morey and Crothers 1998; Warren 1991 for an in-depth discussion of UNIO). As the UNIO program was not created for Texas freshwater mussel communities, some Mississippi taxa were used as proxies for endemic Texas species. The following species are not included in the UNIO program: Cyclonaias mortoni, Lampsilis hydiana, Pleurobema ridilli, and Quadrula apiculata. For missing species, the following species were used instead, respectively, because they share similar ecological requirements: Quadrula pustulosa (recently renamed to Cyclonaias pustulosa), L. siliquoidea, P. cordatum, and Q. quadrula (Howells 2013; Howells et al. 1996; Williams et al. 2008; Williams et al. 2017). Species only identified to tribe were grouped with the most abundant species within Mercado Site (41TR203) 347 July 2019

that tribe (for example Lampsilini species were included with L. teres counts). Tables 10.3 and 10.4 show the percentage of assemblage that are found in those habitats by analytical unit, while Figure 10.5 depicts a boxplot of different habitat values, aggregating to a mean habitat variable for site 41TR203 with all analytical units having equal weight. Based on the results generated by the UNIO program, the freshwater mussel assemblage from site 41TR203 was adapted to a small river with shallow waters (<1.5 m). These river reaches exhibited both variable velocity with small gravel and sand substrate. The shallow water depth is expected due to mussel ecology and could be indicative of mussel harvest in shallow waters by native peoples. The abundance of many Pleurobelemini individuals, specifically Fusconaia spp., are indicative of a headwater stream (Haag 2012). Lampsilini species such as L. hydiana and L. teres are most often found within sandbanks, near slow waters. The program UNIO uses modern observations of mussel habitat preference to determine which habitats archeological freshwater mussel shell might have lived in. Each analytical unit was run through the program to produce its own habitat characteristics. Figure 10.5.

10.5 Oxygen Isoptopes As freshwater mussels feed from the surrounding water, assimilate the relevant material, and deposit nacreous shell layers as they grow, the chemical composition of a mussel’s shell should reflect the isotopic signatures of their environment. As mussels are long lived organisms and generally cease growth at low temperatures, their shell represents long term trends in isotopic signatures of water during their growing season (Dettmann et al. 1999). Heavy oxygen isotope ratio within mussel shell is driven by water temperature and stream water isotopic ratio. A stream’s heavy oxygen isotope ratio is a result of the source of water (precipitation or snow melt) and the amount of evaporation occurring within the river. In a metadata analysis, 95 percent of the variation in freshwater mussel shell δ18O was explained by the stream water δ18O, which is often driven by latitudinal differences in precipitation (Pfister et al. 2019). While there are species-specific growth cessation temperatures, freshwater mussels generally stop growth (and thus depositing shell with isotopic signatures) during the winter or at temperatures below 12°C (Dettmann et al. 1999). The heavy oxygen isotope ratios found in shell from 41TR203 exhibit remarkable variation but generally follow the climatic trends found for this region during the late Holocene. Using the time frames presented for each AU in Table 10.5, we find that the mean δ18O increases from - 4.00 o/oo at 2600 BP to -3.71 o/oo at 990 BP (Figure 10.6). Mussel shell from AUs 2, 4, and 5 (time period 1815 BP to 1380 BP) have highly variable δ18O values (Table 10.5). This could be a result of different habitats sampled, or could be indicative of quick climate shifts from dry to wet periods, or could be the result of admixture within the assemblage. Table 10.5.

Temperature modeling for modern shells over-estimated the water temperature by 3 to 5°C; this might represent a calibration issue for paleoclimatic modeling of water temperatures (Van Plantinga and Grossman, 2018). As both source δ18O and temperature shift through time in freshwater, estimating temperatures from δ18O values from archeological freshwater mussel shells is tenuous (Dettman et al. 1999). Thus, temperature is not extrapolated from the δ18O values but instead discussed as larger trends evident within the data. When comparing this analysis with other assessments of paleoclimate in North Central Texas during this region, the heavy oxygen isotopic ratio support that this region underwent slight cooling during the late Holocene. Humphries and Ferring (1992) posit that while middle Holocene temperatures generally match late Holocene and current temperatures, their carbon isotopic data indicate that the middle Holocene was more dry (higher evaporation and thus more negative δ18O values) than the early and late Holocene. Data from site 41TR203 match this conclusion as a general increase in δ18O values is seen, indicating less evaporation or more precipitation was occurring during this period. Brown (1998) found similar δ18O values in mussel shell deposited at site 41DL270 on Denton Creek as those found within site 41TR203 during a similar time span. Denton Creek represents a smaller tributary on the West Fork of the Trinity River, while site 41TR203 is on the mainstem of the East Fork of the Trinity River. This difference in river network position could explain the slightly higher δ18O values; the smaller stream might be more heavily forested (based on the river continuum concept) and thus, might experience less evaporation. While δ18O ratios are slightly different, the general increase in δ18O values would indicate that this region was experiencing more precipitation and/or lower temperatures as the late Holocene continued. 10.6 Systematic Paleontology Class: Bivalvia Family: Unionidae Tribe: Amblemini Mercado Site (41TR203) 355 July 2019

Genus: Amblema Species: Amblema plicata (Threeridge) Amblema plicata is oval to rectangular with three to seven distinctive ridges. This species is thick, moderately inflated with a high, bulbous beak. The pseudocardinal teeth of this species are large, rough, and triangular. The right pseudocardinal tooth is angled toward the middle of the ventral margin. This species is robust (and thus often preserve well) and is moderately tolerant of low water quality and can inhabit both streams and lakes (Howells et al. 1996). Tribe: Pleuroblemini Specimen identified to this group either exhibited characteristics of both Fusconaia and Pluerobema or did not have distinctive enough characteristics to confidently assign to a single genus. Most often the presence of a sulcus and torn pseudocardinal teeth with curved lateral teeth prevented confident identification. This tribe is under current morphological and genetic investigation. While both Fusconaia and Pleurobema are monophyletic (meaning they belong to separate clades genetically; Inoue et al. 2018), the Fusconaia species within the Trinity River are morphologically indistinguishable (Pieri et al. 2018). Genus: Fusconaia spp. The Trinity River possibly contains three Fusconaia species: F. askewi, F. chunii, and F. flava. Shells produced by this genus vary from being triangular with high beaks to very quadrate shells with low beaks. Species were identified to this taxon by the presence of a sulcus to the anterior of the posterior ridge. The pseudocardinal teeth are triangular and torn, meaning they exhibit deep ridges within the teeth and are often divergent compared to Pluerobema ridelli specimen. The lateral teeth of this genus are often straight with a narrow interdentum. This genus is most abundant in headwater streams with sand/gravel substrates. Mercado Site (41TR203) 356 July 2019

Genus: Pleurobema Species: Pleurobema ridelli These shells of this species are triangular to sub-quadrate and are moderately thick. They often contain an inflated beak that is above the hinge line. The posterior ridge is not proceeded by a sulcus. The psuedocardinal teeth are triangular and moderate. The lateral teeth can be curved and are separated from the psuedocardinal teeth with a wide interdentum. This species occurs in small rivers and prefers sand/gravel substrate. Tribe: Lampsilini Genus: Lampsilis Shells identified to this group had small, compressed teeth. Shells are light and fragile; preservation is often low for these species. This genus tends to produce inflated shell which can aid identification. Species: Lampsilis hydiana Lampsilis hydiana have elliptical to oval and moderately inflated shells. They have diagnostic beaks that are above the hinge line, but not as high as L. satura. Psuedocardinal teeth are compressed and triangular, often larger than those of L. teres. This species is often found in shallow waters of rivers, with mud and sand substrate. Species: Lampsilis satura Lampsilis satura have very inflated, oval shells that are fragile. The beak is above of the hinge line and is very inflated. They have a very deep, inflated beak that contains muscle scars within the umbo cavity. The psuedocardinal teeth are generally compressed and triangular. This species is typically found in rivers with low velocity water. This species has not been found within the basin since the earliest surveys in 1920s (Wolverton et al. 2016). Mercado Site (41TR203) 357 July 2019

Species: Lampsilis teres Lampsilis teres produce oblong shells that are generally more elongate than L. hydiana and with psuedocardinal teeth that are the thinnest of the Lampsilis genus. Shells are not very dense, but exhibit moderate sphericity and thus have low preservation potential. These species occur in both rivers and streams and is intolerant of droughts. Genus: Obliquaria Species: Obliquaria reflexa Obliiquaria reflexa’s shell is round and inflated; it contains distinctive knob-sculpturing that are in the middle of the shell and alternate between the right and left shells. The beak is barely over the hinge line and the umbo is not inflated. The psuedocardinal teeth are moderately large and strong. This species occurs in streams, rivers, and lakes with no obvious substrate preference. Genus: Plectomerus Species: Plectomerus dombeyanus Plectomerus dombeyanus produce rectangular shells that are compressed and moderately thick. These shells have a distinctive angle between the posterior and ventral margin that helps differentiate it from M. nervosa. This species has a strong posterior ridge and irregular, ridged sculpturing along the margin of the shell. The beak does not surpass the hinge line. The psuedocardinal teeth of this species are heavy and divergent. On the right valve, the psuedocardinal tooth points towards the junction of the anterior and ventral margin (straight down). This species occurs in streams, rivers, and lakes, with no known water velocity or substrate preferences. Mercado Site (41TR203) 358 July 2019

Genus: Potamilus Species: Potamilus purpuratus This Lampsilini species creates an inflated, ovoid shell with variable shell density. The shell exhibits no sculpturing, and the beak is inflated above the hinge line. This shell can have a moderate posterior wing and the anterior and posterior margins are notably unequal. The psuedocardinal teeth are moderate in size and are compressed. In some individuals psuedocardinal teeth can be flipped towards the umbo and slightly torn. This species is found in streams, rivers, and lakes. Potamilus purpuratus is tolerant of low water quality. Genus: Truncilla This grouping is used for specimen that exhibited the posterior ridge of the Truncilla genus but could not be identified at the species level. Species: Truncilla donciformes Truncilla donciformes creates a suboval to elliptical shell with the distinctive Truncilla posterior ridge. The psuedocardinal teeth are larger than other Lampsilines and are distinct. This species can be differentiated from T. truncata with its more quadrate shape, thinner shell, and less severe posterior ridge. This species is mostly found in large rivers and prefers mud, sand, and gravel substrates. It can often be found in deeper areas of the river in slow to moderate water velocity. Species: Truncilla truncate This species creates an inflated triangular shell with a very distinctive posterior ridge. While there is no sculpturing on this shell, the posterior ridge is sharp and almost turns over on itself. The beak is above the hinge line and the umbo is inflated. The psuedocardinal teeth are strong, divergent, and triangular. This species is often found in stream and rivers. They prefer moderate flows and sand/gravel substrates.

Tribe: Quadrulini This tribe can be identified by their quadrate shape and triangular psuedocardinal teeth. On the left valve, the psuedocardinal tooth closest to the anterior margin is larger and taller than the other psuedocardinal tooth. Genus: Cyclonaias Species: Cyclonaias mortoni Cyclonaias mortoni produces a subquadrate shell that is moderately thick. While not every specimen contains sculpting, the presence of irregular pustules on the shell is indicative of this taxon’s shell. The beak can be above the hinge line and the psuedocardinal teeth are typical of the Quadrulini tribe. These psuedocardinal teeth tend to be curvier than other Quadrulini species. The lateral teeth are short compared to species in the Plueroblemini tribe. This species occurs in streams and rivers, typically in gravel substrate and moderate flows. Genus: Megalonaias Species: Megalonais nervosa This species produces shell that is quadrate to rectangular and compressed. The beak is narrow and barely above the hinge line, distinguishing it from A. plicata. The psuedocardinal teeth are massive, triangular, and rough. The right psuedocardinal teeth points toward the middle of the ventral margin. This taxon’s shell has crosshatching near the umbo and ridges near the posterior margin. This mussel tends to live in rivers with moderate flow and gravel substrates. Genus: Quadrula Species: Quadrula apiculate This species is ovoid to triangular and variable compression. The beak is above the hinge line and is only moderately inflated. This species has distinctive sculpturing: pustules cover the shell in a regular pattern. The psuedocardinal teeth are moderately large and very triangular, helping Mercado Site (41TR203) 360 July 2019

distinguish it from C. mortoni. The anterior psuedocardinal tooth on the left valve is often larger, distinguishing it from other triangular shells. This species is tolerant of low water quality and can be found in rivers, lakes and reservoirs on sandy substrates Genus: Tritigonia Species: Tritigonia verrucose This species of mussel creates a compressed, ellipsoid to rectangular shell with distinctive sculpturing. The shell has a strong posterior ridge and is entirely covered with sculpturing; the posterior margin of the shell has a fluted, wavy edge. The psuedocardinal teeth are large and triangular; the left valve’s teeth generally complete two sides of an equilateral triangle. The umbo is very shallow and barely reaches over the hinge line. The shell also has strong beak sculpturing, making it easier to distinguish from P. dombeyanus. This species is found within streams, rivers, and reservoirs on a variety of substrates. These species are known to lay on the surface of the substrate during the summer season and prefer oxygen-rich riffles (Howells 2013). Class: Gastropoda Group PH Gastropod shells that exhibited conical shapes were identified to this grouping. Group PL Gastropod shells that did not exhibit much variation in the z axis (i.e., the entire coil was flat) were identified to this grouping; might belong to the family Planorbidae.

11.0 CHAPTER 11 – PLANT REMAINS By: Leslie Bush Forty-two flotation samples from the Mercado site (41TR203) were submitted for identification and analysis of plant remains. Thirty-five flotation samples were 2.0 cubic decimeters (cu dm) (“liters”) each; seven samples were smaller, ranging from 1.0 to 1.9 liters (Table 11.1). In total, 78.9 cu dm of soil matrix were processed and analyzed for plant macroremains. Table 11.1.

Vegetation in the site area is currently a mowed field, but a much more diverse floodplain would have been present prior to channelization of the Trinity River. Not surprisingly, plants of riparian zones tend to tolerate flooding and other disturbances better than their upland counterparts. Many species may share the canopy in a floodplain forest, and “dominance is absent or poorly defined” (Lee 1945:163). Common trees of floodplains in the Trinity River area include elms (Ulmus spp.), hackberries (Celtis spp.), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica spp.), various types of oaks (Quercus spp.), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii) (Bezanson 2000:115, 124). Riverbank trees are Mercado Site (41TR203) 363 July 2019

typically willows (Salix spp.), cottonwood (Populus deltoides), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and boxelder (Acer negundo) (Bezanson 2000:115, 124). Wild onions (Allium spp.) and camas (Camassia scilloides) are riverbank species that produce edible bulbs. Floodplains and riverbanks also support useful vines such as grapes (Vitis spp.) and Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia). Oxbows, sloughs, marshes, and other wetlands associated with the Trinity River would have offered plant resources, such as cattail (Typha spp.), and aquatic tubers or rhizomes, including arrowhead (Sagittaria spp.) and spatterdock (Nuphar lutea). Upland vegetation would have been very different from riparian vegetation in prehistoric times, as it is today. Tarrant County lies in the Fort Worth Prairie section of the Cross Timbers and Prairies vegetation area, where upland vegetation protected from modern human impacts is a mixed-grass prairie characterized by grasses such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparius), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) and forbs (Bezanson 2000:115-116, 125; Diggs et al. 1999:52-53). Mean annual precipitation in Tarrant County during the period 1951 to 1980 was 31.3 in (795 mm). Precipitation has a unimodal distribution, peaking in April and May followed by a dry summer. The frost-free season in Tarrant County today averages 230 days and runs from March 26 through November 11 (NFIC 1987:465-466). 11.2 Methods Flotation samples for this project were processed in 2017 (32 samples) and November 2018 (10 samples) in a modified version of the TAS Field School method (Bush 2012, 2013). The manual flotation used heavy fraction mesh with square openings of 1.0 mm and light fraction mesh with triangular openings of 0.3 by 0.4 by 0.5 mm. One hundred carbonized poppy seeds (Papaver somniferum) were added to three of the flotation samples processed in 2017 to assess small seed recovery rates (Wagner 1982). Poppy seeds are used because they are readily available, not native to the study area, and at about 1.0 mm long they approximate the size of many wild seeds in North America. In the laboratory, 81, 90, and 95 seeds were recovered, for an Mercado Site (41TR203) 364 July 2019

average recovery of 88.7 seeds in the 2017 samples. This is slightly higher than the recovery rate of 87.0 for samples from the Mercado site processed in 2013 and comparable to recovery rates reported for the Incinerator (Sunwatch) Machine using 0.59 mm bottom mesh (Wagner 1982), the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) manual system using 0.5 mm bottom mesh (Hunter and Gassner 1998), and the Flot-Tech Machine at Indiana University using 1.0 mm bottom mesh (Bush 2001). Recovery rates for this Project are well above rates reported for IDOT projects and the Incinerator Machine with 1.0 bottom mesh (Wagner 1982). Recovery rates in the 90s have been occasionally reported for manual flotation systems (Bush 2013) and machines with 0.6 mm bottom mesh (Bush 2001, 2013; Hunter and Gassner 1998). Plant material from the light fractions was transferred in March 2017 (32 samples from feature contexts) and November 2018 (10 samples, 8 from non-feature contexts, and 2 from Feature 10) to Macrobotanical Analysis, where sorting and analysis took place in April and May 2017, and November and December 2018. The flotation samples were sorted according to standard procedures (Pearsall 2000). Light fractions were weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200 by 0.01-g electronic balance before being size-sorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh. Carbonized botanical materials that did not pass through the No. 10 mesh (2 mm square openings) were completely sorted, counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized plant parts and non-botanical material in this size fraction consisted of rootlets, grass leaves and stems, gastropods, mussel shell, and bone fragments. It was weighed and bagged but not further sorted. Materials that fell through the 2 mm mesh (“residue”) were examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 7-45 X magnification (2017 samples) or 6-55 X magnification (2018 samples) for carbonized botanical remains other those present in the larger size fraction. Identifiable material was removed from residue, counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized seeds in the light fraction were identified and recorded on a presence/absence basis on laboratory forms. Examined residue smaller than 2 mm was weighted, recorded, and labeled only. For each flotation sample, wood charcoal fragments were selected at random from those larger than 2 mm until 20 fragments were examined, or all fragments were examined in cases where fewer than 20 were present. When fewer than 20 wood charcoal fragments were present in the Mercado Site (41TR203) 365 July 2019

larger size fraction, additional identification was attempted for successively smaller pieces until identification could not be made beyond the division level (“hardwood”) or until identification had been attempted for 20 fragments. Fragments were snapped to reveal a clean transverse section and examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 28-180 X magnification. When necessary, tangential or radial sections were examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting, and other minute characteristics. Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; Martin and Barkley 2000; Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980; Wheeler 2011). Plant nomenclature follows the PLANTS Database (NRCS 2018). 11.3 Results and Discussion Uncarbonized (modern) seeds, stems, and leaves from the Mercado site are shown on a presence/absence basis Table 11.2. Carbonized plant materials are given by AU in Tables 11.4 through 11.19.

11.4 Uncarbonized Plant Remains Most uncarbonized plant parts at the Mercado site appear in the form of rootlets and grass stems that are clearly related to the modern vegetation at the site. Uncarbonized seeds are a common occurrence on most archeological sites, but they usually represent seeds of modern plants that have made their way into the soil either through their own dispersal mechanisms or by faunalturbation, floralturbation, or argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51-52; Miksicek 1987:231-232). In all except the driest areas of North America, uncarbonized plant material on open-air sites can be assumed to be of modern origin unless compelling evidence suggests otherwise (Lopinot and Brussell 1982; Miksicek 1987:231). The seeds at the Mercado site consist primarily of grasses and weedy annuals relating to the current vegetation and recent disturbances on the site. All uncarbonized plant parts, including seeds, are interpreted here as modern. 11.5 Carbonized Plants As shown in Table 11.3, features at the Mercado site flotation samples were taken from eight AUs.

feature contexts in AU 1 were 0.02 g/cu. dm.). With Feature 26 (AU 4), Feature 10 was one of two features where a bulb scale fragment was recovered, indicating that bulbs such as wild onion or camas were exposed to fire (i.e., cooked) during this occupation. Oak wood charcoal is frequently associated with burned rock cooking since oak burns hot and produces excellent coals (Collier and Turner 1981; Marcouiller and Anderson n.d.). Interestingly, oak wood charcoal was not common in Feature 10, represented by only 4 of 74 identifiable fragments. Other, more common, woods in the feature include elm, blackhaw, and plum/cherry. Elm trees (certainly American elm and probably cedar elm) are important for producing large sheets of bark for baskets or roofing material wood for lodge construction and wooden mortars (Gilmore 1934). Blackhaw, a shrub, produces straight shoots that are useful for making arrows. Oak was better represented in the two samples taken from outside feature context in AU 1, where 7 of 11 identifiable wood charcoal fragments were oak. It is possible the elm and blackhaw wood charcoal in Feature 10 represents convenient disposal of craft materials and associated debris by fire. Mercado Site (41TR203) 370 July 2019

All features in AU 4 were shell middens except for Feature 27, a pit feature. Feature 26, one of the mussel shell middens, contained more non-wood remains than any other feature analyzed in this or previous investigations at the site (Tables 11.10 and 11.11). Non-wood remains consisted of a bulb scale fragment, four acorn nutshell fragments, eleven acorn cap fragments, three goosefoot seeds, and a stick-tight seed. The acorn parts recovered are not directly edible, but acorn nutmeats provide starch and fat once the astringent tannins have been leached from the meats or flour (Ortiz and Parker 1991:95-108).

The seeds, flowerheads, and greens of goosefoot are edible. Goosefoot is in the same botanical family as beets and spinach (Chenopodiaceae), and its greens are similar. The immature, edible flowerheads of goosefoot (“huauzontle”) have been compared to broccoli (Glore 2006:57). The stick-tight “seed” from Feature 26 is the remains of a bur with few recorded economic uses (Moerman 1998). It was likely disposed of by fire immediately after being plucked from human clothing or the fur of a dog or game animal. Stick-tight is common in riparian areas of Texas in the spring (February through May), with fruits available March through May (Diggs 2006:962- Mercado Site (41TR203) 376 July 2019

966). All 20 wood charcoal specimens examined for Feature 26 could be identified as some type of oak, with both white group oak (n = 14) and red group oak (n = 2) present. Other features in Analytic Unit 4 contained only wood charcoal and indeterminable carbonized remains (Tables 11.10 and 11.11). Three wood taxa could be identified in Feature 28, including hickory/pecan, elm, and a legume (probably honeylocust or redbud). The other three features contained only one identifiable wood type each. Oak was present in Features 21 and 25, and elm was present in Feature 27. Macrobotanical remains in these features were generally sparse, with an average 0.043 g/cu. dm. When the non-feature flotation samples from this AU are included, the density drops to 0.037 g/cu. dm. 11.10 Analytic Unit 5 (Features 14 through 17 and 31) Average botanical density in AU 5 features is identical to that of AU 4 at 0.032 g/cu. dm. One bedstraw seed was recovered from Feature 16. Otherwise all remains consisted of wood charcoal (Tables 11.12 and 11.13). Oak was present in Features 16 and 17. Feature 17 also included elm. Wood charcoal in other features consisted of plum/cherry (Feature 31), ash and redbud (Feature 14), and boxelder and legume (Feature 15). Mercado Site (41TR203) 377 July 2019

11.12 Analytic Unit 7 (Features 29, 32 through 36, 28 through 41, and 43 through 44) Botanical density in feature contexts averaged 0.070 g/cu dm. in AU 7, and non-feature contexts averaged 0.015 g/cu dm. The only non-wood plant part recovered was a grass stem fragment from Feature 43 (Tables 11.16 and 11.17). Plum/cherry (genus Prunus) was the most common type of wood in AU 7, largely because of 19 fragments in Feature 41 where it was the only wood type identified. Feature 41 was a dense concentration of artifacts and burned earth. Plum/cherry wood charcoal was present in smaller numbers in an additional 6 features from AU 7: Features 29, 32, 38, 39, 40, and 43 (hearths) and Feature 34 (a pit). Mexican plum (Prunus mexicana) is the most common member of the genus Prunus in north-central Texas today, and it grows well in river bottoms (Simpson 1999:250). Mexican plum does not sprout from rhizomes, however, so it appears as single stems in riparian woodlands and other situations in which it grows (Correll and Johnson 1970:759; Diggs et al. 1999:949; Simpson 1999:250). The larger, thicket-forming black cherry (Prunus serotina) is another candidate for the abundant Prunus wood charcoal in AU 6. Although this species is not attested by herbarium specimens for Tarrant County today, it is recorded for Dallas County (Diggs et. al 1999:950), and black cherry has been known to extend its range along streambeds (Simpson 1999:254). After plum/cherry, oaks were the next most common wood type in AU 7, with 29 oak fragments identified from 7 features and 1 non-feature context. Eighteen boxelder fragments were recovered from Feature 43, but it was not recovered elsewhere in AU 7. Other woods identified in AU 7 consisted of hickory/pecan, ash, legume, and blackhaw.

11.13 Analytic Unit 8 (Features 20, 24, and 42) Carbonized plant remains in AU 8 consisted of wood charcoal (all contexts) and a carbonized root fragment from a non-feature context (Tables 11.18 and 11.19). Woods identified were plum/cherry and oak. Features 20 and 24 yielded both oak and plum/cherry woods while the third feature analyzed from the AU, Feature 42, produced only oak. Outside feature context, one sample had plum/cherry and one oak. Botanical density was 0.063 g/cu. dm. for feature contexts and 0.045 g/cu. dm. for non-feature contexts. Table 11.18.

11.15 Wood Charcoal as an Environmental Indicator Wood collection for fuel is a cultural activity governed by cultural rules (e.g., preference for particular fuels in particular circumstances [Metzger and Williams 1966], particular areas of the landscape favored or avoided for fuel collection [Dufraisse 2008]). In wood charcoal assemblages, restrictions on particular species or collecting locations may result in the absence of particular types of woods (Metzger and Williams 1966). Nonetheless, the steady demand for such heavy, bulky material as fuelwood, combined with criteria for “good” fuelwood that frequently emphasizes dryness and diameter over species usually results in a wood charcoal assemblage that reflects trees available in the local environment (Allevato et al. 2012; Asch and Asch 1986; Shackelton and Prins 1992; Smart and Hoffman 1988). At the Mercado site, the wood charcoal reflects a floodplain environment, as evidenced by the presence of tree types that are found primarily along watercourses such as boxelder, plum/cherry, and ash. Floodplains associated with trunk streams, which experience longer periods of inundation, tend to have a slightly different species composition than floodplains of tributary streams or ravines (Table 11.22). The overall taxa composition of wood charcoal at the Mercado site is more like the larger streams than tributary streams or ravines in the region. Hackberry, mulberry, and soapberry, trees that are common on smaller streams and ravines, are absent from the assemblage, and white group oak is more common than red group. Hackberry mulberry, and soapberry have many documented uses among historic Native Americans, none of which suggest particular spiritual power that would result in avoidance of their wood for fuel (Moerman 1998). A local understory including the smaller trees redbud, dogwood, and Mexican plum or black cherry and blackhaw is also indicated. Mercado Site (41TR203) 387 July 2019

11.16 Summary Archeological plant remains from the Mercado site consisted of primarily of wood charcoal. The wood taxa composition is consistent with the floodplain forest of a major stream channel such as the Trinity River. Bulb scale fragments were found in Feature 10 (Late Prehistoric) and Feature 26 (Transitional Archaic), indicating exploitation of bulb plants such as onion and camas that would have grown in the immediate site area. Feature 26 also produced acorn and goosefoot. Mercado Site (41TR203) 389 July 2019

12.0 CHAPTER 12 – FIRE-CRACKED ROCK ANALYSIS By: Richard Thompson Stark 12.1 Introduction Analysis of FCR from site 41TR203, the Mercado site, is helpful in understanding the specific functions of associated features as well as more general trends in subsistence strategies utilized at this locale from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods. Patterns of commonality and difference in archeologically recovered FCR describe the re-use of this specific locale for earth ovens and open hearths from 2740 to 930 yr Cal BP. Beyond the analysis and interpretations herein, this research may be used to generate ideas for other potentially useful archeological analyses, or experimental designs, and to establish commonality in protocols for FCR sampling, terminology, and curation. This chapter defines key terms, methodology and results of analysis of approximately 690 fragments of archeologically recovered FCR from 41TR203. Parameters of analysis include descriptions of rock type(s), size, colors, fracture patterning, cumulative weights, and density distributions. This FCR analysis is feature-focused, in that FCR is discussed in the context of an associated feature, or associated AU for isolates. 12.1.1 Caveats and Context While lipid analysis was not conducted on FCR surfaces, the presence/absence of residues and vugginess was noted and samples with indications of potentially fruitful lipid analysis were curated for future analysis. The presence of vugs presents ideal contexts for the preservation of material directly related to the feature use and FCR production. Any subsequent lipid analysis of the FCR fragments from site 41TR203 must consider that the source of residues may be from fuels, organic packing material, secondary taphonomic processes, or foods. In some cases, determining if encountered FCR is the result of cultural or natural process can be problematic, however this does not appear to be the case at 41TR203, and FCR here are assumed to be culturally derived. FCR produced in non-food processing contexts, such as for sweat baths, ceramic and lime kilns, and sacred rituals is beyond the scope of this research, as all FCR recovered from 41TR203 is assumed to be related to food production. FCR exists as a commonly encountered archeological material with exceptional research potential. While Texas archaeologist have been describing and sampling FCR from middens and Mercado Site (41TR203) 391 July 2019

hearth features for over 100 years, FCR sampling and analysis remains unstandardized, with incipient interpretive potential (Hester 1991). This research is situated with appreciation of the volumes of previous FCR research, and within the incipient hopeful potentials, which stimulate further rigorous sampling with creative and comprehensive analyses. Ethnographic evidence indicates that FCR utilized for food processing may be produced in a variety of feature types, including open hearths and earth ovens. Middle Range Theory and specifically ethnographic analogy is used here as an interpretive model building device to frame questions and ideas about archeological recovered materials, not serve as a direct analogy for the archeological record. Similarly, the accretion models and statistical analyses are to be utilized to magnify the data, for context and the generation of ideas and questions. 12.1.2 Definitions Hearth: The place where the fire and its combustion related components rests; archeologically visible as charcoal, scorched earth, and/or thermal elements. Although hearths are defined here as the surface upon which a fire is built, they may or may not include stone thermal elements. The nature and quantity of thermal elements in a hearth feature is indicative of the intensity (i.e., time, temperature) of the desired cooking environment. FCR fractures found within hearths are diagnostic to the general heating and cooling histories that they experience. Open hearths create a roasting/drying cooking environment. Any fuel added resides stratigraphically above stone thermal elements and the original fuel used to heat the thermal elements burns to ash. While open hearths vary, they imply an informal social setting of daily mundane food rituals. Open hearths, which present a dry/roasting cooking environment are observed ethnographically as site nuclei, with human behavior and artifacts discard in predictable patterns surrounding open hearths. Open hearths are also observed to heat stone boiling elements and as ancillary to earth ovens, used for expedient food preparation during the construction and use of an earth oven. That is, smaller ancillary hearth features are expected immediately adjacent to earth oven hearths, representing the preparation or re-heating of food consumed by the earth oven specialists themselves, on site, as opposed to the food prepared in the earth oven, which is consumed by the extended group in a different social setting. Archeological signatures of open hearths include roasting platforms of FCR and ash on Mercado Site (41TR203) 392 July 2019

unprepared ground and FCR features with shallow to flat basins. Unless extinguished, fuels in open hearths tend to burn to ash, with limited charcoal remaining. Earth Oven: A closed hearth feature utilizing radiant heat in a moist environment. Components of earth ovens include a hearth, thermal elements, and some form of lid/cap to retain the heat, making the combustion environment oxygen-reduced. Earth ovens exist as hearths with earthen or organic lids and utilize layers of moist organic packing material to produce a steamy slow- cook environment. Maintaining prolonged food temperatures hovering near 100 degrees Centigrade requires high initial temperatures of the thermal elements as well as water in the packing material. In earth ovens radiant heat from the thermal elements is sealed by an earthen/ organic lid, providing heat convection throughout the oven, flowing between the thermal element, packing material, and food. Earth ovens represent behavior surrounding either bulk processing of resources or festive food processing, or a combination of both (Stark 2002a). Bulk processing of food in earth ovens is often seasonal, relating to the time of the year when plants have stored up their maximum amount of energy or when meat from a nearby kill is butchered, quartered, and bulk processed in earth ovens bone-in (Brink and Dawe 1989). FCR from earth ovens exhibit both expansion fractures, from the rapid expansion of the stones during initial heating events, and contraction fractures which occur as the stones cool slowly. Earth ovens create oxygen-poor cooking environments, and if hardwoods are used as fuel, then earth ovens will produce abundant charcoal, typically underneath the FCR. That said, because earth ovens make use of stored energy in hot rocks, hardwood fuel is not necessary, and lightweight, fast-burning fuels may be used in earth ovens, thus impacting the amount of archeologically observed charcoal. Social settings for earth oven use include 1) during a plant harvest, when subsistence strategies organize around bulk-processing of plants with seasonal high energy stores; 2) during the preparation of a feast, when an animal is slaughtered for immediate consumption by an extended family group; 3) in fuel-poor environments, as a means to maximize fuel resources when a large amount of food is cooked; 4) in fat-poor subsistence strategies, as a means to render fat throughout animal flesh cooked bone in; and 5) to transform inedible plant tissues into a nutrient packed edible form (for example, prior to the harvest of ripe plants to make edible food from hard to digest greens, or during seasonal periods of food scarcity Mercado Site (41TR203) 393 July 2019

[i.e., famine] to transform otherwise unused toxic plant tissues into a palatable and nutritious form) (Wandsnider 1997). Wandsnider (1997) (Figure 12.1) has identified seven significant trends with earth oven foods: 1) plant tissues are earth oven cooked more often than meat tissues; 2) the plant tissues most often earth oven cooked are inulin-rich; 3) the meat tissues most often cooked are fat-rich; 4) meats are earth oven cooked for a short time compared with plant cooking; 5) often, meats are earth oven cooked for social aggregations and immediate consumption; 6) earth oven cooking creates food tissues which are then more palatable and nutritious; and 7) earth ovens are often used to bulk process large amounts of food. Figure 12.1. Trends in Earth Oven Foods (Adapted from Wandsnider 1997) Fire-cracked rock middens: FCR middens exist as collections of discarded thermal elements. FCR middens provide opportunities for lithic sourcing, refit analysis, and accretion modeling, with implications for interpreting site intensity values, iterations of use, and composite values for represented food loads. FCR middens relate to hearths in the immediate vicinity and are utilized for artifact caching. FCR encountered in middens represents patterned discard and is relatable as Mercado Site (41TR203) 394 July 2019

discard from specific hearth features. FCR middens accrete as hearth features, which are cleaned out and prepared for the next use. The exact relationship between FCR midden accretion and intensity/iterations of hearth use is not clear; however, one observed limestone FCR midden related to bulk plant processing accretion occurred at approximately 0.125 cm³ per use (Stark 2002b). Differentiation between middens, open hearths, and earth ovens, and isolating the hearths related to FCR discard is critical to interpreting the associated artifacts of site 41TR203. Ethnographic evidence indicates social patterns for earth oven use, with each categorical social setting corresponding to a distinct archeological artifact suite. Ethnographic observations of FCR discard indicate that it is related to thermal failure, manifesting in fractures and increased inability to retain heat after re-use. FCR fragmentation is the result of brittle deformation of the rock structure across natural cleavage and bedding planes. Cleavage planes are internal surfaces within a stone which are determined by the crystal lattice, while bedding planes exist as former depositional surfaces within sedimentary rocks. During and prior to the production of FCR, as rocks are heated in open fires, thermal stresses act upon the rocks as they are heated for energy transfer to another medium, often food (Jackson 1998; Thoms 1989). The term FCR is applicable to all thermally altered stone, as micro-fissures are present in stones which have not experienced visually obvious fracturing. Fractures may be described as meandering, conchoidal (curvilinear), hackly (angular), stepped, and dendritic or branching. FCR fracture patterns exist in several forms. FCR fractured during the heating process can exhibit expansion related fracturing which produces fragments with conchoidal/curvilinear profiles. As the stones inter-granules heat-up and differentially expand at the micro-level, potentially producing elastic limit failures within the stone, manifesting in the explosion of curvilinear fragments. FCR fractures which occur as the rocks cool exhibit contraction fractures, producing hackly joints and polygonal fragments. Contraction fractures follow a model of elastic limits reached from implosion, similar to the production of mud cracks and perma-frost fissures. Contraction fractures in FCR are generally associated with stone cooling and could be precipitated from rapid cooling experienced upon earth oven closure or when hot stones are placed inside of an animal cavity. Although more research is required, it appears that polygonal contraction fractures created during slow-cooling differ from stone dissolution resulting from the Mercado Site (41TR203) 395 July 2019

dendritic curvilinear pattern observed in micro-fissures after water-quenching and immediate cooling (Stark 2002a). FCR fractures naturally manifest as a reduction series in halves and thirds, further reducing in patterns which appear generally similar and yet infinitely different, exhibiting visual tendencies which are symmetrical, chaotic, or Fibonacci-like. It remains uncertain as to the best statistical model in which to describe FCR, and particularly how to delineate and describe anomalies in the data, we examine the fractal dimension here. Many naturally created fractures and fragments exhibit a fractal dimension, including geological erosional processes and the disaggregation of coal, gneiss, granite, pumice, sand, and glacial till (Barton 1995; Borodich 1997; Brown 2001; Turcotte 1997; Turcotte and Huang 1995). Rock fragmentation creates size/frequency fragment distributions in a fractal (power law) pattern, which obeys the following: N(>r) = rˉ ͩ , where N(>r) equpals the number of fragments with a long axis greater than r, and d, which measures the relative abundance of fragments of varying sizes, is the fractal dimension (Brown 2001:620; 2005; Turcotte 1986; 1997). The natural fragmentation of stone produces straight regression lines of size/frequency distributions, exhibiting a power law or fractal dimension. With this effort as a baseline, future research may find value in the investigation of patterned anomalisms to the power law, and how these differences in the expected natural straight-line regressions relate to patterns of human discard and reuse, secondary taphonomic processes, and archeological sampling bias. 12.2 Methods of Analysis This FCR analysis for site 41TR203 is grouped by feature, with the intent to describe the patterns of details related to groups of thermally fractured stone and situate any interpretive statements regarding the human actions responsible for these patterns (Table 12.1; Figure 12.2). These interpreted human actions, represented by data clouds of fragmented FCR, related to inferred past behavior, and may identify both ancient action and the more recent actions of the archaeologists, particularly related to sampling bias. Data was analyzed from the following domains of relevance: 1. Size: longitudinal axis (mm) 2. Weight: scaled measurements (kilo grams) Mercado Site (41TR203) 396 July 2019

Feature 10 FCR fragments appear as rectilinear spherical polygons with a micro-topography of ridges and linear craters. Many of the FCR from Feature 10 include curvilinear flakes scars which remove cortex on the distal portions of tabular FCR. The curvilinear fractures appear to have occurred prior to polygonal fractures in Feature 10. These FCR fracture scar signatures indicate rapid expansion from heating the rocks quickly in a roaring fire followed by implosion fractures from cooling. This sequence of fractures is consistent with hearth preparation and use of an earth oven. Micro-charcoal appears clinging to some of the Feature 10 stones, indicating an oxygen reduced environment consistent with what would be expected from earth oven combustion matrix. Feature 10 FCR include iron nodules and concretion occurrence in bedding planes and within vugs (Photos 12.1 through 12.11). While Feature 10 is dominated by limestone FCR, one FCR fragment from Feature 10 is sandstone, one FCR fragment from Feature 10 is sandstone. Feature 14, Figure 3 illustrates multi-modality in the size distribution of FCR, centered upon 30 mm and 50 mm for Feature 10. Although the exact cause(s) for the multiple peaks in the size distribution analysis is uncertain, our initial interpretation is that it related to either sampling techniques or a cultural practice of selecting certain size classes of FCR for use or discard elsewhere. The rapid exponential, fractal, and cumulative regression expressions of size/frequency distributions are presented for FCR from Feature 10 in Table 12.2. In the Power Law expression of the fractal dimension, the regression does not follow the expected linear trajectory of natural rock fragmentation. Anomalies on both ends of the Power Law curve could represent cultural, taphonomic, and sampling bias. Further interpretation of these results could be approached through a middle range theoretical approach which reconstructs an analogous FCR data set mimicking Feature 10 with experimental replication, followed by statistical analysis, coupled with a review of ethnographic and archeological examples of selective FCR discard.

12.3.2 Feature 12 Fire-cracked Rock FCR from Feature 12 is comprised of six fragments. FCR surface coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with blotches of light red (7.5 R 6/6) and adhering black charcoal flecks (Photo 12.12). FCR from Feature 12 is comprised of tabular limestone, with curvilinear and hackly fractures, and cortex present in all fragments. FCR fragment sizes included two fragments less than or equal to 50 mm, two fragments less than or equal to 60 mm, and two fragments less than or equal to 70 mm. No fragment sets appear to refit. While the analysis of Feature 12 is limited by sample size, the trimodal size distribution may be the result of hearth cleaning, or selected stones for use within an animal cavity or represent an open hearth. Ancillary hearths are often located to earth ovens, representing food consumed by the cooks during the construction and use of the earth oven. The curvilinear and hackly nature of fractures within Feature 12 support this interpretation, as this type of fracturing is observed to be related to expansion fracturing manifesting from rapid rock expansion. 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 10mm 20mm 30mm 40mm 50mm 60mm 70mm 80mm 90mm Figure 12.4.

12.3.3 Feature 15 Fire-cracked Rock Analyzed FCR from Feature 15 (which includes all of the FCR from the feature) consists of 24 kg of 94 fragments. FCR surfaces occasionally include vugs and coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with blotches of light red (7.5 R 6/6). FCR fragment sizes included 4 fragments less than or equal to 30 mm, 5 fragments less than or equal to 40 mm, 24 fragments less than or equal to 50 mm, 29 fragments less than or equal to 60 mm, 17 fragments less than or equal to 70 mm, 10 fragments less than or equal to 80 mm, and 5 fragments less than or equal to 90 mm (Figure 12.5, Photos 12.13-12.16). Fragments appear as rectilinear spherical polygons with a micro-topography of ridges and linear craters. Size distribution for Feature 15 FCR generally follows a bell curve centered upon 60 mm. Statistical analysis indicates the rapid exponential, fractal, and cumulative regression expressions of size/frequency distributions for FCR from Feature 15 (Table 12.3). In the Power Law expression of the fractal dimension, the regression does not follow the expected linear trajectory of natural rock fragmentation; however, the isolation and elimination of select variables produced a highly liner power law regression. The nature of FCR fragmentation suggests that Feature 15 may represent an intact FCR collection of an earth oven hearth. This hypothesis could be tested through experimental replication. 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 10mm 20mm 30mm 40mm 50mm 60mm 70mm 80mm 90mm 100mm Figure12.5.

12.3.4 Feature 16 Fire-cracked Rock Feature 16 is represented by three FCR collected from a 50-cm diameter prepared basin (Figures 22 and 23). No cortex is present and the fragments do not appear to re-fit. FCR surface coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with some adhering charcoal flecks. The FCR fragments recovered in Feature 16 are multi-sided polygons, with linear fractures suggesting implosion and contraction. While interpretation of Feature 16 is limited by sample size, fracture patterns suggest a contraction consistent with slow cooling in an earth oven. If this FCR accumulation represents anything more than random discard, the isolated nature of Feature 16 FCR may indicate a special purpose, such a use within an animal cavity, or possibly as a small isolated and out of the way accumulation around the temporary shelter posts. Use as prop stones is not ruled out; however, we would expect more curvilinear fracturing for limestone FCR created in an open-hearth environment. 2.5 2 1.5 1 0.5 0 10mm 20mm 30mm 40mm 50mm 60mm 70mm 80mm 90mm 100mm Figure 12.6.

12.3.5 Feature 18 Fire-cracked Rock Feature 18 is represented by 16 FCR, with size distributions ranging in size from 30 mm to 70 mm (Figures 24 through 26). Cortex is present on some samples and one set of FCR refit. FCR surface coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with some adhering charcoal flecks. The fragments are multi-sided and tabular polygons, with some curvilinear fracture scars present. Curvilinear fracturing can occur during rock expansion as the limestone is heated and expands beyond its elastic limit, it does so in curves. The inclusion of both curvilinear scaring and linear polygonal fracturing suggests that the limestones were heated in a very hot fire and then cooled slowly, producing both types of fracturing in the collection. Fracture patterning and size distribution analysis suggest that Feature 18 FCR was created from both explosion during expansion and an implosion during contraction, consistent with fracturing in an earth oven environment. 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 10mm 20mm 30mm 40mm 50mm 60mm 70mm 80mm 90mm 100mm Figure 12.7.

12.3.6 Feature 19 Fire-cracked Rock Feature 19 is represented by a collection of seven FCR (Photo 12.20), burnt earth, charcoal, and shell 35 cm diameter. FCR fragment sizes included three fragments less than or equal to 1 cm, two fragments less than or equal to 6 cm, and two fragments less than or equal to 7 cm (Figure 12.8). Coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with blotches of light red (7.5 R 6/6). The fragments appear as roughly cubic polygons, some with cortex. The fragmentation on the FCR from Feature 19 is consistent with contraction fracturing through implosion, suggesting an earth oven environment. While the fragments do not appear to refit, it is probable that the smallest fragments derived from the two other parent FCR, and that the size distribution bimodal variance may represent post-depositional weathering of micro-fissures set up during heating, or some cultural practice which would encourage micro-fragmentation.

12.3.7 Feature 20 Fire-cracked Rock Feature 20 represents 22 FCR fragments ranging in size from 30 mm to 60 mm (Figure 12.9). Statistical analysis indicates the rapid exponential, fractal, and cumulative regression expressions of size/frequency distributions for FCR from Feature 20 (Table 12.4). In the Power Law expression of the fractal dimension, the regression does not follow the expected linear trajectory of natural rock fragmentation. Anomalies on both ends of the Power Law curve could represent cultural, taphonomic, and sampling bias. 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 10mm 20mm 30mm 40mm 50mm 60mm 70mm 80mm 90mm 100mm Figure 12.9.

12.3.8 Feature 20.1 Fire-cracked Rock Feature 20.1 is represented by a collection of approximately 90 limestone FCR fragments. Coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with blotches of light red (7.5 R 6/6). Several fragment sets refit in meandering, angular fractures which appear to overly curvilinear fractures. The FCR of Feature 20.1 are both tabular, with curvilinear expansion fractures and hackly/angular fractures producing polygons (Photos 12.21 through 12.23). Some cortex is present. Feature 20.1 includes FCR fragments, with fracturing consistent with both rapid expansion and subsequent contraction cooling. Photo 12.21.

Three fragments from Feature 20.1 refit in arcs which transverse the entire face of the stone, meandering as hackly, angular fractures which divide a tabular stone in thirds (Photo 12.24). A curvilinear expansion fracture scar extends along the distal face of each of these three fragments, which refit and thus, pre-dates them. The stones appear to have experienced an explosive fracturing upon heating and subsequent contraction fragmentation occurred upon cooling. Other fragments appear as rectilinear spherical polygons with a micro-topography of ridges and linear craters. The linear craters contain deep meandering troughs at the location of the original micro- fissures within the deep fabric of the stone. Coupled with FCR refit analysis, FCR reduction scar descriptions and the interpreted sequencing of this type of prehistoric lithic reduction provides a potentially fruitful avenue for further research.

12.3.11 Feature 30 Fire-cracked Rock Feature 30 is represented by a collection of 24 limestone FCR fragments, bison, and shell, from a prepared basin, 50 cm in diameter. FCR fragment sizes included three fragments less than or equal to 10 mm, nine fragments less than or equal to 20 mm, and five fragments less than or equal to 30 mm (Figure 12.10). Feature 30 FCR appears as two or three stones which have broken in half, and those halves have broken in half again, etc. Two fragment sets refit in meandering, angular fractures. The fragments appear as rectilinear spherical polygons with a micro-topography of ridges and linear craters (Photo 12.27). The linear craters contain deep meandering troughs at the location of the original micro-fissures within the deep fabric of the stone. These meandering joints intersect in roughly perpendicular confluences of primary, or original, troughs with secondary fissures (Photo 12.28). Three of the fragments include the invertebrate fossils bivalves Gryphaea navia, and Inoceramus sp from the Kimamitia, Fort Worth, or Duck Creek limestone formations (Photo 12.29). Cortex is present on some examples, and the general FCR surface coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with blotches of light red (7.5 R 6/6). Anomalies on both ends of the Power Law curve are naturally inexplicable and could represent cultural, taphonomic, and sampling bias (Table 12.5). 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 10mm 20mm 30mm 40mm 50mm 60mm 70mm 80mm 90mm100mm Figure 12.10.

12.3.12 Feature 35 Fire-cracked Rock Feature 35 is represented by a collection of seven limestone FCR fragments collected from a ring within a prepared basin, 50 cm in diameter. FCR fragment sizes included five fragments less than or equal to 50 mm, one fragment less than or equal to 60 mm, and one fragment less than or equal to 70 mm (Figure 12.11, Photo 12.30). Feature 30 FCR appears as rectilinear spherical polygons created from contraction fractures, with no cortex visible. While the fractures appear consistent within a slowly a reducing temperature environment in an earth oven, the isolated nature of Feature 35 and mono-modal size distribution suggests intentional selection for a specific culinary task. Lipid analysis may be helpful in future research to facilitate interpretations of isolated small and mono-modal clusters of FCR such as Feature 35. 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 10mm 20mm 30mm 40mm 50mm 60mm 70mm 80mm 90mm 100mm Figure 12.11.

12.3.13 Feature 42 Fire-cracked Rock Feature 42 is represented by a collection of 42 limestone FCR fragments. FCR fragment sizes included six fragments less than or equal to 30 mm, five fragments less than or equal to 40 mm, four fragments less than or equal to 50 mm, seven fragments less than or equal to 60 mm, eight fragments less than or equal to 70 mm, ten fragments less than or equal to 80 mm, and two fragments measured less than or equal to 100 mm (Figure 12.12). The bi-modal FCR size distribution may indicate multiple firings, a hypothesis which could be tested through experimental replication of Feature 42. Statistical analysis indicates the rapid exponential, fractal, and cumulative regression expressions of size/frequency distributions for FCR from Feature 42 (Table 12.6). While the Power Law expression does not follow the expected linear trajectory of natural rock fragmentation, the removal of anomalies on both ends of the Power Law curve would better model the natural fracturing of stone. The anomalies could represent cultural selection such as discard and re-use, error from secondary taphonomic processes, and/or sampling bias. FCR from Feature 42 appears as rectilinear spherical polygons created from contraction fractures consistent with an earth oven environment, and may represent an intact earth oven hearth, used multiple times. 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 10mm 20mm 30mm 40mm 50mm 60mm 70mm 80mm 90mm 100mm Figure 12.12.

12.4 Summary and Conclusions Archeological sampling at site 41TR203 included all observed thermally altered rocks, which were catalogued by lot, feature, and analytical unit. The FCR was weighed, measured and counted by lot number. Eight rock features were sorted by size, with sizes ranges from 1 to 10 cm at the long axis. Data from natural rock fracture produce linear regression lines within the fractal dimension of their size/frequency distributions (Figures 12.13 through 12.15). Patterned data from defined FCR parameters for specific features at site 41TR203 indicate anomalies, and the probable interplay between sampling bias, discard patterns, and selective re-use of FCR for particular culinary tasks. Fracture patterns consistent with implosion during a reducing temperature environment were most commonly seen in the FCR collection at site 41TR203, suggesting that earth oven cooking was commonly employed here to steam shellfish and mammals. Socio-economic implications of earth oven utilization include general broadening of the dietary spectrum and intensification of forager interaction on the Archaic cultural landscape. While earth oven cooking does allow for more types of foods to be rendered nutritious and delicious, in this situation, the predominant use of earth ovens may be the result of the foragers utilizing one type of preparation to cook both shellfish and venison together. Earth oven clambakes are well known in the ethnographic literature and for lean meats such as venison, bone-in earth oven preparation provides an Archaic substitute to bone marrow extraction, effectively rendering bone lipids throughout the fabric of the meat, making it succulently palatable, more nutritious, and deliciously tender. Feature 10, within AU 1, was a basin-shaped burned rock cluster of 426 pieces of FCR (weighing 61.93 kg) that was 1.5 m in diameter and 30 cm deep, dating to approximately 1280 to 1050 yr Cal BP. Feature 15, within AU 5, contained 94 rocks, weighing approximately 24.36 kg. FCR use at site 41TR203 appears to have increased exponentially over time. If volumetric FCR is a measure of subsistence intensity, then subsistence regimes appear to pulse and to intensify over time, with the most energetically intense episode represented by Feature 10.

In all but a few examples, the FCR appear to represent one limestone outcrop, probably the Kimamitia, Fort Worth, or Duck Creek limestone formations; however, without microscopic or XRD confirmation, this is uncertain. Mineral inclusions within the FCR fragments include iron, limonite, and pyrite nodules. An outcrop of the Fort Worth/Duck Creek interface exists immediately across the Trinity River from site 41TR203, in between the river and what is now Bluff Street. One example of sandstone from an unidentified source is also present Refit analysis allows for description of the form and sequencing of fractures scars. Refit analysis was limited to stone from within individual features. A potentially fruitful future avenue of research would be to attempt to refit FCR fragments between features of suspected co-terminus activity. Although beyond the scope of this research, refit analysis of FCR amid features could determine direct connections on the landscape between various hearth features and area of discarded. Four features, with more than 20 FCR fragments each, were subjected to statistical analysis to evaluate the fractal dimension of their size/frequency distributions (Table 12.9). What, if anything, may we conclude from the results of the statistical analysis of the fractal dimension for FCR from Features 10, 15, 30, and 42? The analysis indicates that the archeological sample of FCR is not fully fractal in its size/frequency distributions. While it is beyond the scope of this research, a fractal analysis of waste fragments from controlled FCR experiments designed with graduated thermal variances could perhaps isolate the differences, identify the pattern, and help frame further questions. Experimentally testing the size/frequency distributions related to the predicable physical process of thermal weathering may help explain the phenomenon. It also may be fruitful to conduct further statistical analysis of the cumulative distributions of the different AUs against each other, in pairs, to see if they are statistically indistinguishable or if the difference is statistically significant. Utilizing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) 2-sample test to measure the maximum distance between two cumulative distributions, we discern if the distributions are the same or different (Tables 12.7 and 12.8). Further use of this type of test in FCR analysis, coupled with further experimental replication of specific features could perhaps lead to isolation of behavioral and/or physical processes within the regression patterns. In this case we are able to determine that FCR Mercado Site (41TR203) 437 July 2019

13.0 CHAPTER 13 – SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS By: Julie Shipp, James W. Karbula, and Mary Jo Galindo 13.1 Research Design The Mercado site provides the opportunity to investigate settlement patterns and subsistence strategies within the Upper Trinity River basin in north-central Texas, and how those strategies may have changed throughout the Late Archaic period. The research questions were approached from a Historical Ecological perspective. Historical Ecology is a general theoretical framework that focuses on human relationships with a particular environment over the long term and considers the landscape as a part of human ecology. This approach provides a practical context in which to combine archeology with ecological studies and allows for humans to both affect and be affected by ecology rather than simply being set into the backdrop of a static environment (Balée 1998; Crumley 1994a, 1994b). The Historical Ecological approach is well-suited for the study of hunter-gatherer behavior at site 41TR203, because it relies on the subsistence data. The primary archeological assemblages from the site are faunal remains and FCR; only a handful of lithic artifacts have been recovered. However, the botanical remains extracted from the soil were an important contribution to a balanced perspective on the broad-spectrum diet and subsistence strategies employed by Late Archaic hunter-gatherers in the Upper Trinity River Valley (Ferring and Yates 1997). The Historical Ecology approach is also relevant because of the repeated occupations of the site. The late Holocene landscape was evolving from both natural and cultural processes during these episodic occupations by humans. The ecology of the site certainly changed over the course of the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, and data may be available for a Late/Transitional Archaic period in the region, which remains poorly defined. This Research Design includes the five main topics: 1) Paleoenvironment; 2) Regional Chronology; 3) Subsistence Strategies; 4) Lithic Technology; and 5) Geoarcheological Analysis of Burned Earth. Each topic heading contains completed analyses and research questions that were addressed. Mercado Site (41TR203) 441 July 2019

13.2 Paleoenvironment The Late Archaic period is marked by numerous fluctuations in climate (Abbott 2011; Ferring and Yates 1997). Human adaptations are often related to creating stability in an unpredictable and suddenly changing climate (Butzer 1982; Rosen 2007), and a significant amount of climate data has been compiled for the Late Holocene in north-central Texas (Ferring 1994; Ferring and Yates 1997). However, much work remains to be done in Texas to create linkages between climate and the availability of resources for prehistoric peoples and the subtle variability with which these relationships changed temporally and spatially (Abbott 2011). The climate data from site 41TR203 assists in refining our understanding of the nature of the climate from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods, which also provided information about the seasonal use of the site and insight into the continued use of the site during this time, including the apparent periods of abandonment between occupations. 13.2.1 Stable Carbon Isotopes Stable carbon isotopes analysis is an invaluable tool for which to measure changes and identify patterns in environmental fluctuations. There are a few other sites in the Upper Trinity River Valley where stable carbon isotopes have been reviewed, but most of these studies are incomplete compared to the profile at site 41TR203. The existing data from these sites do, however, reflect a climate shift around the same time, despite some variations (see Chapter 6). Additional paleoclimate work remains to be done in order to help refine the climate shift in the region during the Late Archaic period. Site 41TR203 was a good candidate for this due to the wide chronological range in sample dates and good preservation at the site. Stable carbon isotopes analysis is possible because most plants during photosynthesis discriminate less against 13CO than tropical grasses (Nordt et al. 1994). The Calvin–Benson 2 metabolic pathway (C3) is typical of most plants, while the Hatch–Slack metabolic pathway (C4) is typical of tropical grasses (Abbott 2011). The difference in carbon isotope fractionation during photosynthesis results in a characteristic carbon isotope ratio that serves as a diagnostic indicator for the occurrence of C3 and C4 plants. The two types of plant species have distinct, non- overlapping values. The δ13C values of C3 plants range from approximately -32 to -20 percent Mercado Site (41TR203) 442 July 2019

with a mean of -27 percent, while C4 plants range from approximately -17 to -9 percent with a mean of -13 percent (Nordt et al. 1994:109). Humphrey and Ferring (1994) studied a series of 58 lacustrine, spring and pedogenic carbonate samples from site 41DN479, the Aubrey Clovis site about 52 miles north-northeast of site 41TR203 (Figure 13.1) (Ferring and Yates 1997:43). At the Aubrey site, the early Holocene samples are depleted in δ13C, while those from the middle Holocene (8000 to 4000 yr Cal BP) are enriched, followed by a return to lighter compositions in the late Holocene. The analyses demonstrated a discrete episode with depleted isotopes in the latest Pleistocene, indicating temperatures colder than at present. Alternatively, this trend could signify an influx of depleted meltwaters to the Gulf of Mexico. Either way, the depletion is followed by a rapid warming trend into the Holocene. No evidence for warmer temperatures is indicated for the middle Holocene, Instead, annual average temperatures apparently remained stable after minor fluctuations during the early Holocene (Ferring and Yates 1997:43). Carbon isotope trends indicate colder and drier late Pleistocene climates, followed by wetter conditions in the early Holocene, and a marked shift to drier climates in the middle Holocene. The late Holocene appears to have been moist, but with a dry period ~2000 to 1200 yr Cal BP (Ferring and Yates 1997:43). Correspondingly, rapid alluviation is indicated by the climate during the Early Holocene (11,000 to 7500 yr Cal BP), until the slow alluviation pedogenesis of the Middle Holocene. The Late Holocene is characterized by moderate to rapid alluviation (4500 to 2000 yr Cal BP) except for alluviation pedogenesis during dry period ~2000 to 1200 yr Cal BP (Ferring and Yates 1997). The results of this carbon isotope study from the Aubrey site comport well with those from site 41TR203. Mercado Site (41TR203) 443 July 2019

Similarly, the organic carbon from Late Quaternary alluvial deposits and soils from along three streams at Fort Hood Military Reservation (about 150 miles south-southwest of site 41TR203) was subjected to stable carbon isotope analysis by Nordt et al. (1994). The analysis revealed significant shifts in the ratio of C3 to C4 plant biomass production during the past 15,000 years. Results suggest that environmental conditions were the coolest and wettest between 15000 and 11000 yr Cal BP (Nordt et al. 1994), followed by a transitional period between the late Pleistocene and the warmer and drier Holocene (11,000 to 8000 yr Cal BP), based on a slight increase in the abundance of C4 plant biomass. Although it should be noted that it is possible for C4 plants to grow in humid environments. During the middle Holocene (6000 to 5000 yr Cal BP) mixed C3/C4 plant communities were nearly replaced by C4-dominated ones, indicating prairie expansion and warmer/drier climatic conditions (Nordt et al. 1994). By 4000 yr Cal BP, the ratio of C3 to C4 productivity was similar to the transitional period, suggesting a return to a cooler/wetter climate. Nordt et al. (1994) detected no other significant shifts in the C3/C4 ratio since that time, except for a brief increase in the abundance of C4 plant biomass around 2000 yr Cal BP during a warmer and drier period. The results of this study from Fort Hood comport well with those from site 41TR203. Fredrick and McKee (see Chapter 6) propose a regional signature in the shift toward a drier climate ~2000 yr Cal BP, and data from both the Aubrey site and Fort Hood support this assertion. Fredrick and McKee (see Chapter 6) provided a source of paleoenvironmental information for site 41TR203 by examining the stable carbon isotopic composition from bulk soil organic matter. They determined that the overall trend at site 41TR203 is for a slight increase in organic carbon from C4 plants from the start of the record around 2700 yr Cal BP to about 1900 yr Cal BP, when the maximum contribution from C4 plants occurred (48 percent). After this point, the trend shifted toward a decreasing contribution from C4 plants to minimum values of approximately 20 to 25 percent. Fredrick and McKee (see Chapter 6) demonstrated that this shift can be modeled in all profiles from site 41TR203 as a second order polynomial, suggesting a maximum C4 concentration at 1897 yr Cal BP.

When compared to data from site 41TR170, which is 11.5 km southwest of site 41TR203, a nearly identical trend in carbon isotopic signature is evident (Hall et al. 2011). The isotopic data from site 41TR170 suggests relative stability within the Pilot Point alluvium with a 64 percent contribution from C4 plants. Near the top of the West Fork Paleosol, Hall et al. (2011) notes a shift toward C3 plant community dominance after around 1000 yr Cal BP. The values of δ13C within the Pilot Point alluvium were interpreted as representing tall grass prairie vegetation within a wet meadow floodplain. Conditions then shifted near the top of the West Fork Paleosol to a drier climate with lower water tables, channel incising, and the invasion of dry floodplain trees (Hall 1982, 1990; Hall et al. 2011). This shift occurs 900 to 1,000 years earlier at site 41TR203, and proceeds at a more gradual pace than was described at site 41TR170 (see Chapter 6). A slightly older record is preserved at site 41TR203, and the shift in absolute δ13C values may be a consequence of 4site 1TR203 occupying a lower position in the valley below the major confluence of the Clear Fork and West Fork, while site 41TR170 is positioned more than 5 miles upstream from this confluence and along the Clear Fork Trinity River. Fredrick and McKee (see Chapter 6) propose that the shift toward a drier climate is present as a regional signature beginning at around 2000 yr Cal BP. However, a regional δ13C signature is not as evident when compared with other studies in the Upper Trinity River Valley, including sites 41TR198, 41DL203, and 41COL172 (see Figure 13.1). Of the three, the most directly comparable site is 41TR198, which is about 3.4 km (2.1 mi) southeast and represents a much shorter time frame than site 41TR203. It is situated along the West Fork in a similar setting as site 41TR203, except that a small tributary (Sycamore Creek) has contributed sediments to the site (Peter and Harrison 2011). The isotopic signature from site 41TR198 was interpreted as an increase of C3 vegetation during the period of West Fork Soil formation and then slightly drier conditions afterwards. When examining the overall trends at the two sites, there may be a comparable subtle shift in δ13C at site 41TR198 within the West Fork Soil, but a local signature is reflected in the Recent Alluvium capping the site, indicative of Sycamore Creek inputs (see Chapter 6).

Site 41DL203 (see Figure 13.1) is located along Rowlett Creek, a medium-sized tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity River (Frederick 2009). The analyzed δ13C at this site extends back to approximately 3,100 years, demonstrating a gradual increase of C3 plants from the start of the record until around 500 years ago. While comparable to results at site 41TR203, the shift at site 41DL203 is much more gradual and it begins earlier in time than at site 41TR203. Frederick (2009:102) attributed this discrepancy to pedogenic processes having more of an influence on smoothing the record rather than on reflecting the regional depositional processes. Site 41COL172 (see Figure 13.1) is located along Muddy Creek, another tributary of the East Fork Trinity River (McKee 2010). The analyzed δ13C at this site does not quite stretch back 1,000 years and results were highly variable from sample to sample. There is overall a general trend of decreasing C4 vegetation from the start of the record until around 400 years ago followed by a trend back toward increasing C4 vegetation within the Recent Alluvium, which is similar to observations at site 41DL203 (Fredrick and McKee; see Chapter 6). Research Design questions included: 1. Were there any major climate shifts that occurred near the end of the Late Archaic? Palynological data from the Weakly Bog suggest that from 2400 to 1500 yr Cal BP vegetation in central Texas probably consisted of open woodland dominated by oaks with some open grassland areas. Around 1500 yr Cal BP, near the end of the Late Archaic, a prolonged period of drier and warmer climatic conditions existed in central Texas, according to this fossil pollen record (Bryant and Holloway 1985:62). Wetter conditions were evident at the Aubrey site during the early Holocene, followed a marked shift to drier climates in the middle Holocene (8000 to 4000 yr Cal BP) (Ferring and Yates 1997:43). The late Holocene appears to have been moist, but with a dry period ~2000 to 1200 yr Cal BP. The stable carbon isotopes analysis at Fort Hood indicates that during the middle Holocene (6000 to 5000 yr Cal BP) the prairie expanded amid warmer and drier climatic conditions, only to return to a cooler and wetter climate by 4000 yr Cal BP, the beginning of the Late Archaic (Nordt et al. 1994). Conditions have remained relatively stable, except for a brief increase in the abundance of C4 plant biomass around 2000 yr Cal BP along with relatively Mercado Site (41TR203) 447 July 2019

warmer/drier conditions (Nordt et al. 1994). These results at the Aubrey site and Fort Hood resonate with findings at 41TR203, and together indicate a perceptible climate shift during the last quarter of the Late Archaic period to more xeric conditions. 2. Do the climate shifts and C3/C4 patterns at site 41TR203 correlate to other contemporary sites in the region? 3. What is the pattern of shifting C3 and C4 faunal and floral specimens? Does the pattern correlate with the AUs at the site? Fredrick and McKee (see Chapter 6) propose that this shift toward a drier climate is present as a north Texas regional signature (at sites 41TR170 and 41TR203) beginning at around 2000 yr Cal BP, based on stable carbon isotopes analysis. Whereas, at two other comparative sites (41DL203 and 41COL172; see Figure 13.1), the correlating shift occurs 400 to 500 years ago, but these discrepancies may be attributed to local pedogenic processes. These findings suggest that while the central Texas palynological record provides an approximate framework for the paleoenvironment of north Texas, the studies of stable carbon isotopes at sites 41TR170 and 41TR203, along with prior studies in the Upper Trinity River Valley region and at Fort Hood, have produced a more refined sequence with regional implications (Table 13.1). At site 41TR203, AU 6 dates to 2760 to 2145 yr Cal BP, when C4 plant communities are near their maximum and approaching the threshold identified by Frederick and McKee (see Chapter 6) for the onset of warmer and drier conditions and decreasing C4 plant communities (Table 13.2). This comports with central Texas fossil pollen data (Nordt et al. 1994). AUs 1 and 3 (1280 to 970 yr Cal BP and 1055 to 930 yr Cal BP, respectively) correspond to a xeric period increasingly dominated by C3 plant communities such as dry floodplain trees (Hall et al. 2011) and more open oak-savanna (Holloway et al. 1987). Conversely, AUs 7 and 8 (2720 to 2350 yr Cal BP and 2740 to 2355 yr Cal BP, respectively) correspond to mesic conditions increasingly dominated by C4 plant communities (see Chapter 6.)

Models for each profile were produced by using radiocarbon ages that were calibrated according to a published radiocarbon calibration curve, standard deviations, and depth measurements. The age-depth models were calculated, making the sole assumption in each case that the sediments were deposited with the oldest deposits at the bottom and youngest at the top.

and the probability distributions of each sampled date were then plotted and an image file created (see Chapter 6, Figure 6.12). This method allowed for the sedimentation rates of each of the profiles to be compared. Research Design questions included: 1. Do sedimentation rates correlate with occupations? 2. Does the sedimentation at the site reflect a steady deposition, or were there variations in flood plain aggradation rates? 3. What is the relationship between the paleosol and AUs 6 through 8? Did the slower sedimentation during this period affect the context of the cultural material, and to what degree? 4. Are the variations in sedimentation rates attributed to rainfall, channel migration, channel incision, or a combination of these factors? Although each block contained a comparable stratigraphic profile, there were differences in age- depth projections for the upper portion of the profile (between approximately 20 and 60 cm) that varied by up to 500 years. Thus, it was concluded that the most reliable approach was to aggregate all the radiocarbon ages for the site and use the combined data set to compile an age- depth model for the entire site (see Chapter 6). This approach was useful for assessing temporal variations in sedimentation rate at the site and estimating the probable age of the different occupations. The results suggest that the sedimentation rate at site 41TR203 has varied through time, between periods of relatively rapid sedimentation and periods of slower sedimentation (Tables 13.3 and 13.4). The pattern at the Mercado site is more complicated than what Ferring and Yates (1997) describe for the Upper Trinity River Valley, where rapid alluviation is indicated during the Early Holocene (11,000 to 7500 yr Cal BP), until the slow alluviation pedogenesis of the Middle Holocene. Further, the Late Holocene is characterized by moderate to rapid alluviation (4500 to 2000 yr Cal BP) except for alluviation pedogenesis during dry period ~2000 to 1200 yr Cal BP (Ferring and Yates 1997).

Conversely, during AU 2 (~1200 to 1450 yr Cal BP) sedimentation at the Mercado site proceeded at a relatively fast rate during the tail end of an 800-year dry period in the Upper Trinity River Valley. Importantly, seven of the eight AUs defined at site 41TR203 correspond to periods of slower sedimentation, which may have contributed to their overall integrity. Three of these, AUs 6, 7, and 8, are preserved within the Paleosol that occurs at the site below the West Fork Soil at depths greater than 1 m. Frederick and McKee (see Chapter 6) conclude that the presence of the Paleosol at site 41TR203 is most likely related to the mechanics of sedimentation within or adjacent to the meander belt of the Trinity River channel. Stable Carbon Isotopes data (see Table 13.2) indicate the period from 2700 to 1900 yr Cal BP was dominated by C4 plant communities (see Chapter 6), which is indicative of higher rainfall and more mesic conditions. Thus, a combination of environmental factors including slower sedimentation rates likely contributed to the formation of the Paleosol preserving AUs 6, 7, and 8 at site 41TR203.

5. What are the post-depositional disturbances? 6. Do sedimentation rates correlate with the other environmental data? For both questions 5 and 6, Frederick and McKee (see Chapter 6) identified two areas of probable post-depositional disturbance. The top 35 cm of site 41TR203 exhibited evidence of disturbance by cultivation and portions of AU 7 appear to represent multiple occupations over a long period of time and may exhibit some evidence of overprinting. Tables 13.5 and 13.6 include isotopic and paleoclimatic data, which demonstrate that AUs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are associated with overall xeric conditions, while AUs 6, 7, and 8 occurred during mesic conditions of the Late Archaic.

vertebrate remains at the site lack the isotopic resolution to provide detailed data on small fluctuations in climate. However, there is a clear distinction in the assemblages from the upper and lower portions of the site, which reflect a change in C3 and C4 environments. In addition, bison are only present in the lower portion of the site. Some questions regarding paleoenvironment that the faunal assemblage can address are: 1. What are the differences between the faunal assemblages from the upper portion (AUs 1 through 5) and the lower portion (AUs 6 through 8) of site 41TR203? 2. Do the changes in faunal assemblages indicate changes in C3 and C4 plants? 3. What are the results of the stable carbon isotope analysis on the rabbit specimens? Do they correlate to the other isotope subsets? The overall faunal assemblage is dominated by deer-sized and larger mammals, with bison specimens present from 2645 to 2000 yr Cal BP throughout AUs 6, 7, and 8. The main difference between the upper and lower portions of the site is that bison remains are not found in any AUs that are radiocarbon dated to after 2000 yr Cal BP. Isotopic data indicates that climate conditions during AUs 1 through 5 were xeric and dominated by C3 plant communities, while during AUs 6 through 8, conditions were more mesic and C4 plants dominated. Results of the faunal analysis comport with the isotopic data. Based on the dominance of grassland species (bison, rabbit, pocket gopher, etc.) in AU 8 and the presence of aquatic/wetland species, Jacobson (see Chapter 8) interpreted the paleoenvironment during 2645 to 2430 yr Cal BP as open grassland prairie or potentially grassland floodplain with a reliable water source that was shallow, slow moving, and had a muddy bottom like that of an oxbow, slough, or slow meander. Within AU 8, the presence of reptiles (mainly turtles) was the lone indicator of seasonal occupation during March to November (based on historic and modern daily temperature averages). The types of both bison and deer skeletal parts recovered indicated that these animals were processed and consumed at site 41TR203, with some long bones exhibiting spiral fractures associated with marrow extraction.

The faunal bone in AU 7 was the most diverse of any analytical unit with grassland and prairie species dominating the assemblage. Jacobson (see Chapter 8) interpreted the paleoenvironment during 2660 to 2210 yr Cal BP as an early-stage successional environment with grassland transitioning to scrub brush chaparral and riparian woodland with an aquatic habitat. The presence of reptiles and Canadian geese, the latter of which would have been in residence during October to March (based on known daily temperature averages), suggests year-round occupation of site 41TR203 during AU 7. Bison and deer skeletal parts continue to indicate that they were processed and consumed on-site, including long bones with spiral fractures. AU 6 also contained bison and rabbit, but no deer specimens among a sparse faunal bone assemblage (n = 67). Jacobson (see Chapter 8) tentatively interpreted the paleoenvironment at 2345 to 2145 yr Cal BP as an open grassland or woodland edge habitat. AU 5 dates from 1815 to 1570 yr Cal BP and contained deer and rabbit specimens along with turtles, but no bison were in the assemblage. Another shell midden is represented in AU 4, dating from 1710 to 1415 yr Cal BP. The faunal bone assemblage from AU 4 included dog, coyote, and other unidentified medium- to large-sized mammals, exclusively. No bones from aquatic or bird species were in the assemblage from AU 3, which dates from 1055 to 1025 yr Cal BP. Jacobson inferred a late September to November occupation and interpreted the paleoenvironment during AU 3 as mixed scrub brush and woodland or woodland edge habitat. No seasonal indicators were discernable for AUs 1 and 2, and both assemblages contained minimal deer and other mammal bone. Preservation in AU 2 was indicative of the bone being rapidly buried, comporting with the rapid soil sedimentation rate during 1530 to 1200 yr Cal BP (see Chapter 6). Table 13.7 illustrates how isotopic and faunal analyses complement each other to provide paleoenvironmental reconstructions that span all but AU 2. Mercado Site (41TR203) 454 July 2019

Bayesian chronological models are statistical models that interpret both relative and absolute chronological information for archeological projects (Buck and Juarez, 2017:2). These Bayesian techniques are developed over the last 30 years by statisticians and software developers capitalizing on a revolution in our ability to implement simulation-based models, as opposed to an exact calculation approach (Buck and Juarez, 2017:2).

methods, stratigraphic information and the Bayesian solution equation can now be applied to very large stratigraphic sequences using widely available Bayesian radiocarbon calibration packages such as OxCAL (Black and Juarez 2017:13). The current version of OxCAL v 4.3.2 online was utilized for the current analyses (Bronk Ramsey 2017), using the r:5 IntCal 13 atmospheric calibration curve (Reimer et al. 2013). All of the collected radiocarbon dates which have been assigned to an AU, including bone collagen isotopic radiocarbon dates from specially collected samples, were subject to a modeling export in OxCAL. This has resulted in more precise date estimates that otherwise would be obtained by individual calibrations. This work is greatly assisted by following Millard’s (2015) introduction to model building in OxCAL. A total of 28 radiocarbon dates were utilized to develop phase-based models of AUs (see Table 7.2). Each of these individual dates is assigned to an AU through multiple lines of other archeological data, including conventional radiocarbon ages, depth below surface, archeological content, and correlations to the Mercado site geoarchaeological age-depth model. Of these, seven dates are bone collagen dates more recently analyzed (Beta 494143, 494144, 494147, 494149, 494150, 494151, 494152). From Table 10.1, AUs 1 through 3 date at 2-sigma calibrations to a range of 930 to 1530 yr Cal BP (Late Prehistoric), AUs 4 and 5 to a range of 1415 to 1815 yr Cal BP (Transitional Archaic), and AUs 6 through 8 to 2145 to 2740 yr Cal BP (Late Archaic). In OxCal, individual radiocarbon dates, sequences of dates, or cultural phases, or more complex sequences with phases, or multiple sequences can be modeled. And other information can be incorporated such as phase boundaries based on the presumed age of a collection of archeological materials, without having actual radiocarbon sample ages that distinguish the boundary. For the Mercado site modeling, each group of AUs (n = 3), was modeled as a potential phase of occupations that occurred at the site. The model for each group of AUs (AUs 1 through 3, 4, 5, and 6 through 8) was asked to assign a beginning and ending boundary, based on the statistical calculations. The calibrated conventional ages of specific point-plotted and dated charcoal samples were entered into the model for each phase. Results are available in single plots of each radiocarbon age showing the highest probability modeled in actual calendar ages (BC/AD), and also a modeled radiocarbon determination in yr Cal BP, and as multiple plots that Mercado Site (41TR203) 457 July 2019

illustrate the modeled calendar ages relationally to one another within the phase. Results are also available as curve plots that exhibit the modeled range of radiocarbon years in yr Cal BP, and the specific calendar dates relationally to one another. In these plots, outlier dates that do not fit the modeled data are easily observed and isolated. 13.3.2 AUs 6 through 8, Oldest Occupation Zone Consider that the 2-sigma calibrated age range of the oldest prehistoric occupation at the site (2145 to 2740 yr Cal BP, Late Archaic) is approximately 595 years. From Figures 13.2 and 13.3, a much narrower modeled range of 120 years is predicted, from approximately 2360 to 2480 yr Cal BP, still well within the Late Archaic time frame. The model utilized 12 calibrated radiocarbon ages, including bone collagen dates. Five bone collagen dates are represented, which fit perfectly into the age range for the Late Archaic model (Beta 494144, 494149, 494150, 494151, 494152). One is a piece of bison bone from Feature 20.1 in AU 8 (Beta 494149). Feature 20.1 is identified as an earth oven with an associated rake-out or discard pile. A second bison element with a closely equivalent date was recovered in Feature 32 during a trench expansion. Feature 32 is identified as a small basined hearth in AU 7 containing numerous faunal and charred elements, including bison, deer, and rabbit. A third is identified as Bovidae in Feature 41 in AU 7 (Beta 494152). Feature 41 is a rock cluster not readily assigned to a feature type. Deer bone collected from AUs 7 and 8 in non-feature contexts (Beta 494151, 494144) also support the modeled date ranges (see Table 7.3). There is clearly one outlier that is not included in this predicted age range. The outlier is a piece of charred hardwood collected in Feature 18 (Beta 396632, 396634), recorded as a small burned rock hearth in Block A, Zone 3, in AU 6, at approximately 124 cmbd (Table 7.2). Feature 18 exhibits clearly earlier conventional dates at 2210 and 2250 +/- 30 yr Cal BP than the rest of the model and may represent an earlier more isolated campsite that occurred some 200 years before the bulk of the occupation in AUs 7 and 8 at approximately 2400 yr Cal BP; and yet Feature 18 is dated well after Features in AUs 4 and 5 at approximately 1700 to 1800 yr Cal BP. In calendar dates, without the outlier and ignoring the modeled boundaries, looking only at the specific modeled dates, this oldest occupation at the site is modeled at Mercado Site (41TR203) 458 July 2019

700-380 BC, a span of approximately 320 calendar years. With the phase boundaries as predicted by the model, the phase is dated in calendar years from 800 to 380 BC (approximately 540 years). Predominantly, in terms of diagnostic projectile points, Gary projectiles were recovered in AUs 6 through 8. Thus, the Gary occupation at the Mercado site may have occurred from 2360 to 2480 yr Cal BP based on Bayesian statistical modeling analyses conducted in OxCal.

13.3.3 AUs 4 and 5, Late/Transitional Archaic Occupation Zone The actual 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages for AUs 4 and 5 indicate a range of 1415 to 1815 yr Cal BP, a range of approximately 400 years. From Figures 13.4 and 13.5, again, a much more narrowed, modeled range of 1620 to 1780 yr Cal BP is predicted covering a span of 160 years. The model utilizes 5 calibrated radiocarbon ages. One outlier is excluded from the model and Figures 13.5 and 13.5; a bone collagen date that does not support the proposed range is a piece of rabbit bone (Sylvilagus sp.) from Feature 14, from 49 to 60 cmbd. The 2-sigma calibrated age range is much younger than expected at 1172 to 956 yr Cal BP (Beta 494147, see Table 7.3). Feature 14 was a midden-like mussel shell scatter. One explanation for the younger date on this rabbit bone in this zone of relatively good context, from 45 to 75 cmbs in all of the block excavations at the site, would be intrusion of the rabbit bone. In calendar dates, also without the outlier, this transitional prehistoric occupation at the site is OxCal modeled at 200 to 450 AD, a 250-year time span. The boundaries of the Phase are modeled at 50 to 650 AD (approximately 600 years). Mercado Site (41TR203) 462 July 2019

13.3.4 AUs 1 through 3, Late Prehistoric Occupation Zone The actual 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages for AUs 1–3 indicate a range of 930 to 1530 yr Cal BP, just over 600 years. From Figures 13.6 and 13.7, a third much more narrowed, modeled range of 1060 to 1260 yr Cal BP is predicted covering a span of 200 years. The model utilizes six calibrated radiocarbon ages. One outlier is excluded from the model and Figures 13.6 and 13.7; a bone collagen date that does not support the proposed range is a piece of deer bone collected from non-feature contexts in AU 3 (Beta 494143), from 22 to 30 cmbd. The 2-sigma calibrated age range is much older than expected at 1376-1528 yr Cal BP (see Table 7.3). Again, there is a potential issue with a bone collagen date from a non-feature context, although AUs 1 through 3 appear to exhibit relatively good sediment context from 10 to 50 cmbs at the site. In calendar dates, also without the outlier, this Late Prehistoric occupation at the site is OxCal modeled at 700 to 1025 AD, a 325-year time span. The boundaries of the Phase are modeled at 550 to 1175 AD (approximately 625 years). Mercado Site (41TR203) 465 July 2019

13.4 Mussel Shell Artifacts Mussel shell is an excellent proxy indicator of paleoenvironmental factors. Species identification of mussel shell can reveal where habitat shell was harvested from (i.e., the nature of the local water source). The stable carbon isotope analysis on the mussel shell provides data regarding the environmental changes at the site during the eight described occupations. Mussels (Anodontidae and zebra mussels) can live only one year and those that do typically live in ponds or ephemeral streams. However, those mussels are highly unlikely to arrive in archeological deposits because they produce thin shells that easily fracture. The majority of the mussels found in site 41TR203 live >10 years but less than 80. Based on their size it is estimate that most were around 4 to 5 years old. Thus, the shell isotope data are accurate measures of the weather during the correlating occupations. Mussel shells contain a record of the oxygen isotope ratios of the water bodies in which they grew (Abell 1985:184). In general, most mussels grow in isotopic equilibrium with their aqueous environment (Fritz and Poplawksi 1974). The ratio of oxygen-isotope concentrations, δ18O, is one of the most widely recognized paleoenvironmental proxies, although more commonly used in ocean contexts (Caran 1998). The oxygen isotopes are found within the carbonate radical in calcium carbonate, which is the main compound in mussel shell composition. The ratio is considered to be directly related to water temperature because the rate of evaporation of water generally increases with temperature, resulting in the depletion of 16O and the relative enrichment of the heavier isotope 18O in the remaining water. In this scenario, temperature is assumed to be the only factor capable of affecting the rate of evaporation, ignoring cloud cover, humidity, water turbidity, and other variables. Paul Abell (1985) used oxygen isotope ratios of 80 modern gastropod shells from throughout Africa to demonstrate a correlation with rainfall patterns as indicated by permanent vegetative cover. Negative oxygen isotope ratios corresponded closely with these vegetated areas that received substantial rainfall (Abell 1985:192). Mercado Site (41TR203) 468 July 2019

All the oxygen isotope ratios from site 41TR203 are in the negative range (Table 13.9), indicating ample rainfall while the site was occupied. Within each AU, variation among the samples is evident (Table 13.10). Notably, within Feature 14 in AU 5 the samples varied by - 2.48 percent, while Feature 21 samples from AU 4 varied by -1.31 percent, and Feature 10 samples from AU 1 varied by -0.85 percent. The degree of variation in Feature 14 samples (AU 5) and in those from AU 2 suggests a possible mixture of shells of different ages and environments, although discrepancies in the oxygen isotope ratios may result from temperature effects on precipitation and the evaporative isotope enrichment of rainfall and water bodies (Abell 1985). The smallest variation occurs in AU 8 samples, suggesting that Lot 144 may be closely associated with Feature 20, along with Lot 169. Table 13.9.

Thus, ancient shells with evidence of recrystallization should not be sampled. • The reworking of the sediments in which mussel shells were embedded can produce a mixture of shells of different ages and environments. Rolled and weathered shells must remain suspect and not be sampled. • The isotopic content of a body of water is not necessarily an accurate reflection of the total local environment. For example, the oxygen isotope ratios of mussels that can successfully aestivate will reflect the highly evaporative conditions in ephemeral streams or lakes, and their isotopic ratios will vary significantly from mussels growing in the same locality, but in permanent water bodies. • Differentiating between temperature effects and evaporation effects on oxygen isotope ratios is complex. Abell (1985:183) attributed discrepancies in the oxygen isotope ratios to temperature effects on precipitation and evaporative isotope enrichment of rainfall and Mercado Site (41TR203) 470 July 2019

water bodies. Grossman (1982) calculated a temperature-oxygen isotope ratio relationship for the precipitation of aragonite. At 25°C, an increase of 1°C in water temperature produces an oxygen isotope ratio roughly 0.2 percent more negative. Mussel shell preservation at site 41TR203 was evaluated as moderate (see Chapter 10), in part because the most abundant taxa (Fusconaia spp. and C. mortoni) are of only moderate preservation potential and there are multiple species of low preservation potential (L. teres and L. hydiana) present within the site’s assemblage. Lampsilini species are most often found within sandy banks near slow waters. L. teres are intolerant of drought, while Fusconaia spp. are indicative of headwater streams. Overall, the mussel assemblage from site 41TR203 was adapted to a small river with shallow water (less than 1.5 m deep), exhibiting variable velocity, and with small gravel and sand substrate (see Chapter 10). 13.5 Research Questions 1. What are the changes in temperature and rainfall in AUs 1 through 8? Based on the relatively consistent oxygen isotope ratios from AU 1 through AU 8, there does not appear to be significant change in temperature and rainfall reflected in the mussel shell composition. Average 18O ratios for AUs range from -2.92 percent for AU 2 to -4.51 percent for AU 4, a difference of -1.59 percent. Average ratios for all other AUs cluster around -4 percent (Table 13.11). Thus, there does not appear to be a correlation between oxygen isotope ratios and mesic or xeric climatic conditions as derived from other sources (see Chapter 6; Hall et al. 2011; Holloway et al. 1987). Marked variation within samples from the same AU, such as between Lots 50 and 65 in AU 2 and Lots 121 and 128 in AU 5 (see Table 13.10), suggests a possible mixture of shells of different ages and environments, or possibly higher temperatures affecting the evaporative isotope enrichment of rainfall and water bodies (Abell 1985). AU 2 represents 330 years, and AU 5 is a 40-year interval, while a mussel shell can at most represent a single year, providing but a glimpse into its paleoclimate.

What is the nature of the river over the course of the site’s occupations? The West Fork of the Trinity River during the occupation of site 41TR203 was a small river with a gravel and sand substrate and shallow water that exhibited variable velocity, as evidenced by the diversity of mussels in the assemblage (see Chapter 10). The consistently negative values for oxygen isotope ratios of mussel shell during all AUs indicate ample rainfall that would have supported permanent vegetative cover (Abell 1985). 3. Do the shifts in mussel species correlate with changes in C3 and C4 plants? Similar to the lack of correlation with climatic condition, there does not appear to be shifts in mussel species that correspond to changes in C3 and C4 plants. This may be a consequence of the less than ideal preservation of the mussel shell assemblage, or of the relatively short span of time that is reflected by a mussel shell compared to the length of an analytical unit at site 41TR203. Also there could be multiple changes in isotopic signatures within an AU. Mercado Site (41TR203) 472 July 2019

13.6 Regional Chronology The Mercado site is located in the Upper Trinity River Basin, which begins at the northern end of the Trinity basin, from the headwaters of the four branches of the Trinity River, Clear Fork, West Fork, Elm Fork, and East Fork, down to the southern end of Dallas County. Significant comparable sites within the Upper Trinity River Basin that contain Late Archaic components were identified, and the archeological assemblages compared with those at site 41TR203 in an attempt to further refine the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods in north-central Texas. The goal was to compare the Mercado site with the other sites in relation to our research topics of paleoenvironment, subsistence strategies, and the geoarcheological burned earth analysis. 13.7 Radiocarbon Dating In order to compare site 41TR203 with other Late Archaic sites in the Upper Trinity River Basin, additional radiocarbon samples were collected from all features and from within all defined cultural zones to refine the chronology at the site. Radiocarbon dating is especially important given the paucity of diagnostic artifacts recovered from the site. Research questions regarding radiocarbon dating included: 1. What are the date ranges for the AUs? 2. Do these ranges match other sites in the region for Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations? 3. Are there date ranges in the AUs for cultural periods that have not been previously defined? Analysis of the detailed AUs 1 through 8 using multiple lines of archeological, geoarchaeological and zooarchaeological evidence indicates prehistoric cultural occupations at the Mercado site (41TR203) can be meaningfully evaluated in terms of three main prehistoric periods in the north-central Texas regional chronology. These are the Late Archaic, Late/Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods in the north-central Texas regional archeological record. Per 2, the Archaic period in north-central Texas extended from approximately 8500 to 1250 yr Cal BP with three subdivisions, early (8500 to 6000 yr Cal BP), Mercado Site (41TR203) 473 July 2019

middle (6000 to 3500 yr Cal BP), and late (3500 to 1250 yr Cal BP), distinguished mainly by projectile point types and inferred climate changes and shifting subsistence strategies (Prikryl 1990). Based on the definition of Analytical Units 3 and 4 at site 41TR203, a Late/Transitional Archaic period for the West Fork of the Trinity River is proposed (1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP), overlapping the early Late Prehistoric period. Finally, the Late Prehistoric period can be divided into Late Prehistoric I (1250 to 750 yr Cal BP) and Late Prehistoric II (750 to 250 yr Cal BP) (Prikryl 1993). Multiple lines of archeological evidence indicate there is considerable overlap in cultural components between three different groupings of AUs, which basically correspond to their locations in the terrace sediment profiles. Lines of evidence include 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages from feature contexts, faunal and stone tool associations, depth below surface, and feature morphology within the context of the intact and nearly pristine terrace sediments, and the presence of the deeply buried paleosol. There is considerable overlap observed in cultural content, feature morphologies, organics, and stone tool assemblages between different groupings of AUs. These lines of evidence are discussed below within the context of the AUs, by the associated features and artifacts recorded within AUs, and within the overall framework of the geoarchaeological model. Geoarchaeological data in the form of micro-stratigraphic studies and the age-sedimentation model support this analysis. The meaningful groupings of AUs to be examined are AUs 1 through 3 (Late Prehistoric), AUs 4 and 5 (Late/Transitional Archaic), and AUs 6 through 8 (Late Archaic). Frederick and McKee’s analysis (see Chapter 6), which included bulk physical properties, radiocarbon dating, micro-artifacts, and soil micromorphology, revealed 13 identifiable occupations (A through M) within a 1.5-m alluvial profile containing approximately 2,700 years of cultural deposition. The 13 occupations vary significantly in terms of length, intensity, integrity, and cultural features. However, per Frederick and McKee (see Chapter 6), some of the more ephemeral or minor occupation zones have “very small artifact occurrences and either are occupations for which the blocks are on the edge of the occupation surface or very short duration stays.” Thus, assigning each of the occupation zones to AUs may be a too literal interpretation of Mercado Site (41TR203) 474 July 2019

the micro-artifact depths, in light of other evidence, and some of the occupations represented as distinct events in different blocks may be the same event owing to small vagaries in sedimentation.” The inferred geoarchaeological age of AUs 1 through 3 (Occupations B through E) is 1400 to 600 yr Cal BP. The actual 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages for AUs 1 through 3 indicate a range of 1530 to 930 yr Cal BP, a relatively close correlation (Table 13.1). The feature related radiocarbon ages from AUs 1 through 3 emanate from charred Cherry and Oak wood embedded in rock Features 10 and 13 (Betas 39610 to 39613, Betas 39615 and 39616) (see Table 7.2). This series of Late Prehistoric occupations is recorded from 10 to 50 cmbs in the block excavations correlating to the West Fork Soil of the Upper Point Alloformation in the terrace setting. This is a sediment range of only 40 cmbs in depth. A bone collagen date from the general occupation zone on deer bone (Odocoilus virgianus) yielded an overlapping 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon range of 1528 to 1376 yr Cal BP (Beta 494143) (see Table 7.3). The inferred geoarchaeological age of AUs 4 and 5 is 1730 to 1350 yr Cal BP. The actual 2- sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages for AUs 4 and 5 indicate a range of 1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP, another relatively close correlation. The feature-related radiocarbon ages from AUs 4 and 5 emanate from charred red and white oak, ash and elm and other hardwood associated with Features14, 21 and 26 (Betas 396617, 396618, 396629, 396635, and 396636; see Table 7.2). Features 14, 21, and 26 are three midden-like mussel shell scatters (see Chapter 7). This series of Late/Transitional Archaic prehistoric occupations is recorded from 40 to 75 cmbs in the block excavations at the lower contact of the West Fork Soil transitioning into the Lower Pilot Point Alloformation in the terrace setting. This is a sediment range of only 35 cm in depth. One bone collagen date that does not support the proposed range is a piece of rabbit bone (Sylvilagus sp.) from Feature 14. The 2-sigma calibrated age range is younger than expected at 1172 to 956 yr Cal BP (Beta 494147) (see Table 7.3). The inferred geoarchaeological age of AUs 6 though 8 is 2600 to 2033 yr Cal BP. The actual 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages for AUs 6 through 8 indicate a range of 2740 to 2145 yr Cal BP, a third relatively close correlation. The feature-related radiocarbon ages from AUs 6 through 8 emanate from charred white oak, cherry, pecan, and other hardwoods associated with Mercado Site (41TR203) 475 July 2019

Features 20.1, 24, 32, 41, 42, and 43 (Betas 396625, 396626, 396620, 396633, 396624, 396637, 396622, and 396623, respectively; see Table 7.2). Feature 20.1 is identified as an earth oven with an associated rake-out or discard pile. Feature 24 is identified as a cooking pit of ash and burned earth. Features 32, 42, and 43 are identified as small basin-shaped hearths. Feature 41 is only loosely categorized as a possible a small hearth, earth oven lid remnant, or discard pile (see Chapter 7). This Late Archaic occupation is recorded from 90 to 145 cmbs located within the Paleosol identified within the Lower Pilot Point Alloformation in the terrace setting. This is a sediment range of only 55 cmbs in depth. Bone collagen radiocarbon ages are in support of the charred wood sample ages for AUs 6 through 8. Bison bone from Feature 20 and Feature 32 yielded 2-sigma calibrations of 2536 to 2351 yr Cal BP and 2723 to 2383 yr Cal BP, respectively (Betas 494149, 494150; see Table 7.3). A third specimen of probable Bison (Bovidae) from Feature 41 yielded a supportive 2-sigma radiocarbon age of 2703 to 2360 yr Cal BP (Beta 494152), remarkably enough. Deer bone (Odocoilus hemionus) from the general cultural layer was 2-sigma radiocarbon dated at 2489 to 2337 yr Cal BP (Beta 494151). A second specimen of deer bone (Odocoilus sp.) from the general occupation zone was dated at 2688 to 2350 yr Cal BP (Beta 494144). The bone collagen dates exhibit considerable overlap, indeed. Prikryl’s (1990) cultural sequence for the North Central Texas range of dates for the Late Archaic period is 3500 to 1250 yr Cal BP and best correlates to the three deepest AUs (6, 7, and 8) at site 41TR203 (Late Archaic, 2740 to 2145 yr Cal BP). Prikryl’s 2,250-year span for the Late Archaic contains what is categorized at the Mercado site (41TR203) as a Late/Transitional Archaic period (1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP). The Late/Transitional Archaic period date range is associated with AUs 4 and 5. Following in the sequence, Prikryl’s Late Prehistoric I date range spans for 500 years (1250 to 750 yr Cal BP) and would compare to 41TR203’s AUs 1, 2, and 3 (1530 to 930 yr Cal BP). There is reasonable correlation between the well documented and cited chronological sequence by Prikryl (1990) in the Elm Fork investigations to the sequence observed at site 41TR203, offset by a couple hundred years.

Two dart point styles that are featured at 41TR203, Gary and Ellis, were introduced in the Late Archaic period in Northeast Texas and were continued to be utilized into the Early Ceramic period dating from 200 BC to AD 800 (Story 1990; Turner et al. 2002). This was a temporal period when Gary points were common (Turner et al. 2002). Johnson (1962) concludes that the Gary manufacturing changed through the course of time between the Late Archaic and transitioning into the Early Ceramic period. The primary way the Gary points changed, was in size (reduced) as the technology transitioned from the Late Archaic period into the Early Ceramic period. The end of the Archaic Period is generally thought to coincide with the appearance of the bow and arrow, which heralded lifeway changes that altered the dynamics of human adaptive strategies (Carpenter et al. 2013). Johnson and Goode (1994) describe this transitional period as the most difficult and complex of all the period boundaries. They suggest that the Archaic may have ended 400 years earlier when smaller dart points such as Darl appear, or even 400 years later with the adoption of ceramics during the Toyah phase in central Texas (Johnson and Goode 1994:40). The issue of when these changes occur and what to call the interval is part of a larger research problem, beyond the scope of this discussion, that would address the nature of cultural change and continuity across north-central Texas. An additional comparison was made with site 41DL270 (see Figure 13.1), which has interpolated dates for their Gary like points found within the collection of being 2950 yr Cal BP and being associated with the Late Archaic period, although one should caution that only one of the Gary points was recovered from excavation and the rest were from a collector’s assemblage (Anthony and Brown 1994). In addition, site 41DL270 was approximately 200 years older the site 41TR203. These concerns aside, similarities between sites 41DL270 and 41TR203 exist as they appear to have a similar faunal assemblage, shell middens, hearths, and other associated cooking features. A total of 251 deer remains were recovered from site 41DL270, making up 22.4 percent of their faunal collections with the remains being more abundant in top cultural zones. Bison faunal remains are scarce in lower zones but present and represent 14.6 percent and found in the Late Mercado Site (41TR203) 477 July 2019

Archaic zones. Other faunal remains found within the assemblage consist of small mammals, rabbits, turtle, birds, snake, vertebrata, rodents, and carnivores (Anthony and Brown 1994). The faunal collection at site 41DL270 has many similar species that were also excavated from site 41TR203. Numerous sites including but not limited to sites 41DL270, 41DL12, 41DL148, and 41DL199 (see Figure 13.1) in the North-Central Texas archeological record have presence of mollusk lenses with associated faunal and lithic assemblages. Shell middens are geographically located near floodplains and lower terraces, as the freshwater mussels were exploited as a food source. Sites with shell lenses are most commonly dated to the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric I period. Site 41DL270 had two unionid bivalves identified. Of the two mollusks (Plectomerus dombeyanus) is a possible manuport from the Trinity River system (Anthony and Brown 1994: 265–273). The Plectomerus dombeyanus is one of the common mollusks found at site 41TR203. Other common species of mussel shells are found at both sites such as Amblema plicata, Quadrula mortoni, Tritogonia verrucosa, Lampsilis teres, and Lampsilis hydiana. The morphology of the features and the basic function of the site at 41DL270 are similar enough for comparisons for the excavations at 41TR203 but lack the chronological indicators that would help better interpret the sites. The one Late Archaic point (a possible Gary-like point) was positioned stratigraphically in the consistent cultural zone that aligned with its temporal framework but was older in age than what was found at 41TR203. The other six Gary points found at site 41DL270 were analyzed within the Bill Young Collections and do not have any context to dating the site or if the points were associated with any feature. Gary points recovered from the Mercado site present a curious case for several reasons: they are situated on the western frontier of the Gary landscape, they are knapped of chert as opposed to the typical quartzite and fossilized wood, and they come from one of the better-dated and stratified contexts documented to date (2740 to 2355 yr Cal BP), which suggests that some of these artifacts may have been crafted nearer the onset of the Gary tradition. Additionally, at the Mercado site, Gary points are not related to typical artifact assemblages consisting of ceramics. Mercado Site (41TR203) 478 July 2019

Gary points, which are prolific across the Red River Basin of present-day East Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas beginning about 2,500 years ago, predominate the lithic assemblage at the Mercado site. The Mercado site demonstrates that Gary points are found in the Tarrant County area around this period, possibly suggesting a westward foray of eastern occupants out onto the southern Plains. Further, the chronometric analysis detailed in this report, as well as the age-depth modeling by Oksanen (2018), suggests that this collection of Gary points in the western portion of the traditional region date to approximately 2700 yr Cal BP. Not only is this collection found farther west than usual, but it may represent the onset of the Gary tradition. In questioning the material type of this small assemblage of Gary points from the Mercado site, Oksanen (2018) asserts: The selection of locally available material, chert, quartzites and silicified wood (petrified wood) from stream load and upland gravel sources was a determinate for the size of the finished product. Occasionally, they were made from other chert sources–the Mercado site points are unusual as they are all made from chert. In contrast, only four of the 35 Gary points and preforms at site 41DL203, along Rowlett Creek, are chert. At 41HS915, the Hawkwind Site, in East Texas, approximately half of the Gary points were chert and most of these were from gravel sources. One of the largest collections of Gary points is from the Houston area Diamond Knoll Site-41HS796, demonstrating the range and diversity within the type. Examining the breakage and fracture patterns of the 41DL203 Gary points suggests that quartzite may have been a preferred material. The broken chert points exhibited catastrophic fractures from impact to the extent they were discarded at a larger size than many of the quartzite points. It appears the quartzite points were less prone to complete failure, and when breaks occurred, the points could be rejuvenated effectively and efficiently. The use of chert may be the result of at- hand material rather than the preferred choice. The basic shape of the Gary point allows for the variability in workmanship [and] accommodates the inherent limitations in the lithic material, while maximizing its toughness.

This suggests that the Gary point knappers may have been choosing more reliable materials (non-chert) if they were readily available, because the tools would not break easily upon impact and they would last longer because quartzite is a durable material suitable for resharpening. The Mercado site inhabitants either lacked access to quartzite or petrified wood resources or using chert may have been a cultural preference. A better understanding of how Central Texas chert resources and culture influenced this northern region would shed light on this question, which is beyond the scope of the current work. Understanding the variability of Gary points has long been a topic of study and debate. Oksanen (2018) examined collections from across the region and demonstrated a range of diversity within the type. Not only are there morphological differences regionally, there can be diversity within a site as illustrated by the Diamond Knoll (41HS796) Gary point collection (Oksanen 2018). Factors affecting this variability include the individual skills of those knappers, quality of the raw resources, use and re-use over time, and social identity (tribal or kin affiliation). The workability and poor quality of resources would limit the ability to create design standards let alone the inherent differences between point makers. The use-life of a point can imply that the repeated sharpening reduces the size; however, other issues may be at play such as introduction of new technologies. Even with the advent of the bow and arrow, Gary points persisted temporally. As Oksanen (2018) points out: Gary points may have been produced to be smaller and lighter, a local adaptation as arrow points. Without well-stratified archeological deposits and a rich chronological record, the technological differences cannot be discerned. While there have been some compelling studies on type variation (e.g., Foxe et al. 2018), it appears to remain inconclusive on fully understanding the factors behind this vast variability. Considering the regional issues with variability, mobility, resource availability, and chronological detail, the Gary occupation at site 41TR203 contributes greatly in understanding transitional Archaic peoples. Despite the modest sample size of points, the stable, intact nature of Mercado Site (41TR203) 480 July 2019

the archeological components at the Mercado site allows a detailed chronology of the type, resulting in one of the best-dated Gary point assemblages. Whether the occupants of the site represent local populations, those from the northeast, or people from more central areas of Texas, they successfully subsisted on large game and mussels on the banks of the West Fork of the Trinity River for more than a millennium. 13.8 Subsistence Strategies Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups returned to site 41TR203 to procure and process resources for more than 1,500 years. However, while it is clear these activities were taking place, the resources that were being exploited and the way they were processed may have shifted according to seasonality, climate, or as a result of human adaptation in the form of technological innovations that occurred throughout the site’s occupational history. Considering how subsistence strategies shifted or remained static at site 41TR203 over time has the potential to provide important insight into the lives of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric peoples living in north-central Texas. Previously recorded sites located along the West Fork Trinity River do not typically contain many lithic artifacts, and this is the case at site 41TR203. However, in the absence of large quantities of lithic artifacts, data pertaining to subsistence strategies can be ascertained through other methods of analysis, particularly through the analysis of floral and faunal remains. Floral and faunal remains, both of which are found at macro and micro scales at site 41TR203, were used to identify what resources were procured and processed at the site over time. Additionally, the excavation and analysis of burned rock cooking features provided information about how these resources were being processed. Analysis of FCR from site 41TR203, the Mercado site, was helpful in understanding the specific functions of associated features as well as more general trends in subsistence strategies utilized at this locale from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods. Patterns of commonality and difference in archeologically recovered FCR describe the re-use of this specific locale for earth ovens and open hearths from 2740 to 930 yr Cal BP.

herein, this research may be used to generate ideas for other potentially useful archeological analyses, or experimental designs, and to establish commonality in protocols for FCR sampling, terminology, and curation. This chapter defines key terms, methodologies and results of analyzing approximately 690 fragments of archeologically recovered FCR from site 41TR203. Parameters of analysis included descriptions of rock type(s), size, colors, fracture patterning, cumulative weights, and density distributions. The FCR analysis was feature focused, in that FCR was considered in the context of an associated feature (or associated AU for isolates). Archeological sampling at site 41TR203 included all observed thermally altered rocks, which were catalogued by lot, feature, and analytical unit. Feature 10 within AU 1 was a basin-shaped burned rock cluster of 426 pieces of FCR (weighing 61.93 kg), that was 1.5 m in diameter and 30 cm deep, dating to approximately 1280 to 1050 yr Cal BP. Feature 15, within AU 5, contained 94 rocks, weighing approximately 24.36 kg. FCR use at site 41TR203 appears to have increased exponentially over time (see Chapter 12, Figures 12.33 through 12.35). If volumetric FCR is a measure of subsistence intensity, then subsistence regimes appear to pulse and to intensify over time, with the most energetically intense episode represented by Feature 10. In all but a few examples, the FCR appear to represent one limestone outcrop, likely the Kimamitia, Ft. Worth, or Duck Creek. Mineral inclusions within the FCR fragments include iron, limonite, and pyrite nodules. An outcrop of the Ft. Worth/Duck Creek interface exists immediately across the Trinity River from site 41TR203, in between the West Fork of the Trinity River and present-day Bluff Street. One example of sandstone from an unidentified source is also among the FCR assemblage. Social settings for earth oven use include 1) harvesting and bulk-processing of plants with seasonal high energy stores; 2) preparing a feast for immediate consumption; 3) maximizing fuel resources by cooking a large amount of food; 4) rendering fat throughout animal flesh cooked with bones intact; and 5) transforming inedible plant tissues into a palatable and nutritious form (see Chapter 12).

1. What were the resource opportunities at the site, in addition to mussel shell and hardwood? 2. Did the available resources differ between occupations? 3. During what seasons was the site inhabited? 4. Did the seasonality change from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric? There are noted environmental changes represented by the shifting ratios and presence of identified taxa in AUs 3, 7, and 8, with AU 8 representing the Late Archaic. Their assemblage is dominated by grassland species such as bison, but with a shift to a more diverse assemblage during AU 7, which is slightly later during the Late Archaic. There are indicators of nearby prairie with a successional ecotone of scrub brush and riparian habitats overlapping or adjacent to the site. By the time of AU 3, representing the Late Prehistoric at 1055 to 930 yr Cal BP, taxa presence shifted to those species that prefer woodland and some scrub brush and mixed open habitats. Seasons represented throughout the occupations at the Mercado site span spring, summer, and fall and tend to exclude winter. 13.9 Faunal Analysis Faunal remains were the most abundant artifacts recovered at the site. Of these, the diversity was limited, with a predominance of bison and deer in AUs 6 through 8. The recovery of bison remains at site 41TR203 is interesting given that, to date, the degree to which bison was a part of the Late Archaic people’s subsistence strategy in this region of north-central Texas is not yet well defined (Peter and Harrison 2011). Excavations at site 41DL203 (see Figure 13.1) identified bison remains in scant quantities within all observed Late Archaic components; however, at site 41TR198, located approximately 3.4 km (2.1 mi) downstream from site 41TR203, no bison remains were identified within the Late Archaic assemblage (Peter and Harrison 2011; Tinsley and Dayton 2011). Bison availability may have been a factor, but the faunal assemblage at nearby site 41TR203 contained a significant number of bison as well as white-tailed deer. Zooarcheological studies conducted during the data recovery phase were designed to determine species variability, human subsistence strategies, taphonomic processes, and cultural use of bone.

The faunal analysis was conducted by Dr. Jodi Jacobson. Research design questions posited by Shipp and Jacobson include: 1. Do the changes in faunal assemblages reflect changes in C3 and C4 ecosystems? 2. Are there a significant number of bison remains? 3. How does the number of bison compare to other open prairie style species? 4. Do grassland changes appear to have affected the presence of bison? 5. Do any of the specimens exhibit cut marks? 6. Do the cut marks or other data indicate that the animals were butchered on site or that they were brought in from elsewhere? 7. Do the various species reflect a broad-spectrum diet? 8. Does the faunal material reflect a specialized use of the site? 9. Are there young animals or teeth that may suggest seasonal occupation of the site? If so, is there a change in seasonality in the AUs? 10.Do the concentrations of faunal remains reflect different processing activities? 11.Is there evidence of a bone grease processing? 12.Were some of the rock features used for boiling bones to produce bone grease? 13.Was the site near the kill sites of the animals and used as initial processing site, or does the evidence suggest a post-processing site? Does this differ between AUs? 1. Do the changes in faunal assemblages reflect changes in C3 and C4 ecosystems? Environmental conditions and species availability within the catchment area of the site altered over time. The vertebrate faunal assemblages recovered from AUs 1 through 8 provide collaborative evidence in conjunction with the radiometric dates of paleoenvironmental habitats that were exploited by the Late Archaic, Late/Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric inhabitants of site 41TR203. Regarding the radiometric dated geomorphic levels at the site, stable carbon isotopes reported as δ13C values, provide information on local vegetation. It has been recognized for a long time that different groups of plants have significantly diverse Mercado Site (41TR203) 484 July 2019

pathways of photosynthesis, resulting in a unique chemistry in plant tissues. The two main pathways are called C3 and C4. C3 plants are woody; most trees and shrubs are C3. C4 plants are mostly grasses. The C3 and C4 pathways produce different δ13C signatures. C3 woody plants have δ13C values that are less than -19 percent (more negative), and C4 grasses have δ13C values that are more than -19 percent (less negative) (O’Leary 1998). Seven AMS radiocarbon dates of bone collagen from AUs 1 through 8 yielded δ13C values ranging from -9.1 to -20.5 percent spanning the period 2723 to 956 yr Cal BP (774 BC to AD 994) (see Table 7.5). Based upon δ13C values, the earlier Late Archaic components (AUs 7 and 8) had local vegetation consisting of mixed shrubs-grasses vegetation as evidenced by δ13C values clustering around - 9.1 to -9.5 and also -20.0 to -20.5 from bison and deer collagen. The Late/Transitional Archaic period vegetation was likely dominated by grassland with deer collagen yielding a δ13C value of -20.2. More recently, during the Late Prehistoric, the local vegetation was grassy shrubland as evidenced by cottontail collagen yielding a δ13C value of -18.2. The vertebrate faunal assemblages corraborate these paleoenvironments. 2. Are there a significant number of bison remains? All of the bison remains were recovered from the Late Archaic components comprised by AUs 6 through 8. The total bison and cf. bison NISP (n = 49) is the largest meat-producing identified taxon from this component. Its absence in the assemblages for the Late/Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods is indicative of its importance in the subsistence of the Late Archaic period occupants of the site. 3. How does the number of bison compare to other open prairie style species? The bison NISP (n = 49) compared to other grassland taxa include pronghorn (n = 5) and deer (n = 67) during the Late Archaic period. The presence of bison and pronghorn are indicative of predominately grassland habitats while the deer supports a grassland and forest ecotone environment being present nearby the site during the Late Archaic.

4. Do grassland changes appear to have affected the presence of bison? There are noted environmental changes represented by the shifting ratios and presence of identified taxa noted in the AUs where the amount of bone present exceeds 100 specimens, which includes AUs 3, 7, and 8. AU 8, representing the Late Archaic, is dominated by grassland species such as bison, but with a shift to a more diverse assemblage during AU 7 which is slightly later during the Late Archaic. There are indicators of nearby prairie with a successional ecotone of scrub brush and riparian habitats overlapping or adjacent to the site. By the time of AU 3, representing the Late Prehistoric at 1055 to 930 yr Cal BP, taxa presence shifted to those species that prefer woodland and some scrub brush and mixed open habitats. The occupation of the Mercado site (until 1050 yr Cal BP) ends just prior to the earliest occupation of a well-preserved nearby site, Fish Creek Slough (site 41DL436) (see Figure 13.1). The earliest occupation at Fish Creek Slough is dated to 1270 AD, or approximately 800 yr Cal BP. In that earliest occupation at the site, bison was present, but minimally (n = 2), with an increase in the presence of bison by AD 1405 to 1650 and a decreasing in their presence after AD 1650. The two well-preserved and nearby sites can give a fairly holistic picture of bison presence and shifting grassland availability from 2645 yr Cal BP to the 19th century. The faunal evidence suggests a shift or transition from predominately a grassland habitat to a mixed grassland and forest or ecotone habitat during the end of the Late Archaic into the Late/Transitional Archaic period. This change from predominately grassland to mixed grassland and forest appears to have affected the presence of bison and a shift in the subsistence economy as represented by the later Late/Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric cultural components. 5. Do any specimens exhibit cut marks? Butchery evidence was limited, although dirt adhering to unwashed bone likely obscured some cut marks. Regardless, cut marks, minimal chops, and breakage of bone with a hammerstone (percussion points) were evident, and browning at some break points may have indicated localized heating of bone with hot rocks to make breakage of the bone easier. Spiral fractures were predominantly noted on long bones consistent with breakage for the extraction of marrow. Mercado Site (41TR203) 486 July 2019

## Page 518

There was no pattern suggesting an increase or decrease in marrow extraction overtime, and there is no direct evidence of processing bone to extract grease at the site. 6. Do cut marks or other data indicate that the animals were butchered on site or were brought to the site from elsewhere? Skeletal part frequencies for AU 8, Late Archaic, indicate nearby kill and onsite consumption. However, skeletal part frequency analysis for both bison and deer for AU 7, Late Archaic, and for deer for AU 3, Late Prehistoric, would indicate that while the animal was killed near the site, and some initial processing for meat removal and marrow extraction occurred at the site, elements with high and middle meat utility may have been transported to the site from other kill loci through schlepping. 7. Do the various species reflect a broad-spectrum diet? The diverse faunal assemblage recovered from the Late Archaic (AUs 6 through 8) component suggests a broad-spectrum subsistence strategy. However, the paucity of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds suggests these taxa are likely intrusive to the cultural deposits or were acquired opportunistically if readily available by the site’s occupants. It likely that many of these smaller remains were simply not recovered in the ¼-inch screen. In contrast, the larger game that includes bison, deer, and pronghorn, appear to reflect a focal hunting strategy of large game, with hunting forays on short trips to surrounding areas, and the kill sites being elsewhere. The presence of most of the site’s lagomorph (n = 39) remains also from the Late Archaic component suggests these smaller game animals were probably acquired opportunistically. 8. Do the vertebrate faunal remains reflect a specialized use of the site? The vertebrate faunal assemblage from the Mercado site strongly suggests the site was used as a semi-permanent seasonal camp by its prehistoric occupants, spanning the Late Archaic, Late/Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. The Late Archaic component, represented by AUs 6 through 8, represents a base camp where the high-meat yielding elements from large game (bison, deer, and pronghorn) that were killed elsewhere were being returned for Mercado Site (41TR203) 487 July 2019

further processing and consumption. The Late/Transitional Archaic occupation, represented by AUs 4 and 5, is characterized by shell middens (see Chapter 10). The vertebrate faunal assemblage is indicative of a focal subsistence centered on the harvesting and processing mollusks from the West Fork of the Trinity River. The Late Prehistoric component, represented by AUs 1 through 3, has a limited variety of taxa, with an emphasis upon deer (n = 86). The deer elements are indicative of hunting forays into the nearby deciduous forests and schlepping the higher meat yielding elements back to the Mercado site for further processing and consumption. 9. Does the assemblage suggest seasonal occupation of the site? If so, do the AUs reflect changes in seasonality? The occurrence of amphibians and reptiles in the Late Archaic assemblage, AUs 6 through 8, is indicative of spring through fall use of the site when these taxa would have been active. There is no direct evidence of a winter or cold weather occupation of the site. Indirect evidence of a fall occupation is illustrated by the dominance of bison, deer, and pronghorn. Traditionally, among Plains Tribes, fall hunting forays were pursued prior to the winter months, when the large game animals were most fit with regards to their meat value and condition of their hides for making clothing and shelters. Consequently, an apparent focus on hunting large game animals indirectly supports a fall occupation of the site. 10.Do the concentrations of faunal remains reflect different processing activities? The vertebrate faunal remains do not reflect different processing activities. A large part of the assemblage is fragmented as a result of probable processing of bone marrow. The fragmentation of predominately the long bones appears to have occurred during both the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations of the site. The paucity of vertebrate faunal remains from the Late/Transitional Archaic period occupation of the site does not permit reflecting upon this, since the component is dominated by shell middens. Mercado Site (41TR203) 488 July 2019

11. Is there evidence of bone grease processing? The types and amount of fragmentation of bones were examined and recorded. Extensive fragmentation of larger bones is typically indicative of heavy processing for marrow and bone grease. Smashing of long bones of medium mammals and larger was common amongst most Great Plains groups for the extraction of marrow and bone grease (Kehoe and Kehoe 1960; White 1953, 1954, 1955). General observations during analysis were that for bison, deer, and pronghorn, some long bones with higher utility based on marrow content had been fractured, but the bone does not appear to have been smashed for bone grease extraction. In addition, while most of the long bones such as femurs, humeri, tibias, radii, and metapodials have been broken for marrow, phalanges had not been intentionally broken. 12. Were any of the rock features used for boiling bones to produce bone grease? Some of the rock features may have been used to prepare bone grease; however, general observations during analysis were that for bison, deer, and pronghorn. Some long bones with higher utility based on marrow content had been fractured, but the bone does not appear to have been smashed for bone grease extraction. 13. Was the site near the kill sites of the animals and used as an initial processing site, or does the evidence suggest a post-processing site? Does this differ between AUs? The general absence or paucity of low-meat yielding elements of bison, deer, and pronghorn suggests the kill sites were likely near the Mercado site and the highest meat-yielding elements of the butchered game was returned, or schlepped, back to the site for further preparation for consumption. Differences in the processing of the larger game animals between the Late Archaic (AUs 6 through 8) and the Late Prehistoric (AUs 1 through 3) do not appear. The paucity of vertebrate faunal remains from the Late/Transitional Archaic period (AUs 4 and 5) does not permit comparisons with the preceding Late Archaic or the subsequent Late Prehistoric period occupations.

13.10 Paleoenvironment Table 13.12 summarizes the preferred habitats of the identified taxa recovered from AUs 6, 7, and 8, which represent the Late Archaic occupation at site 41TR203. The identified taxa represent all available local habitats and environs that include aquatic, riparian, grassland, deciduous forest, and culturally modified landscapes. Since the Late Archaic occupants of the Mercado site unlikely were engaging in agricultural activities, agricultural fields are unlikely to have existed as a habitat for those taxa, but they are mentioned and included as a basis for possible early agricultural pursuits along the West Fork of the Trinity River. Bison, deer, and pronghorn, the largest game animals, also having the highest meat value, were undoubtedly the focal subsistence taxa hunted by the site occupants during this period. Based on the elements present in the assemblage, local individuals were likely hunted opportunistically while more oftentimes the animal kill sites were some distance from site 41TR203, and the high meat value elements were returned, or schlepped back, to the site for further processing. Expansive grasslands with deciduous forests along the river would be expected to be dominant during this period. Precipitation and temperatures were ideal for maintaining the grassland and mixed deciduous forest habitats and ecotones, which has supportive evidence in the presence of aquatic and riparian taxa also represented in the assemblage.

This major shift in subsistence and procurement strategies may be associated with climatic events that altered the preferred habitats of grazers and browsers such as the bison, deer, and pronghorn. Or, there was a shift in subsistence preferences that emphasized exploitation of mollusks in the West Fork of the Trinity River. Given the presence of the shell middens, the river must have had a reliable water flow that provided an ideal habitat for large numbers of mollusks. Table 13.14 summarizes the identified taxa and their preferred habitats for AUs 1, 2, and 3 which represent the Late Prehistoric occupation of site 41TR203. The limited taxa indicate habitats consisting of mixed deciduous forest and grassland with riparian also represented. There are no aquatic vertebrate taxa and only medium-large (i.e., deer) and small (i.e., cottontail, cotton rat, wood rat) are represented. The cottontail and deer would have been attracted to agricultural fields if they existed. These taxa were likely hunted opportunistically when they entered the vicinity of the Mercado site.

After a very minimal presence of bison represented by fragmented teeth in AU 6 at approximately 2345 to 2145 yr Cal BP, there is a complete absence of bison, bovid, or even large artiodactyl bone in any of the AUs 1 through 5 assemblages. Given the dominance of bison in the diet when available, this absence suggests bison no longer occurred within the site catchment area for the site after 2000 yr Cal BP represented by AU 7, there is an absence of any vertebrate aquatic habitat species, which is interesting given the proximity of the West Fork of the Trinity River. This coincides with the introduction of shell midden assemblages and may simply signify a shift from vertebrate to invertebrate aquatic resources. Most of the aquatic species utilized, such as beaver, ducks, turtles, and catfish, would tend to prefer slower moving or ponded waters such as a slough, oxbow, or slow meander. The shift in subsistence at this time may also indicate a change in the riverine environment as well, and the mussel shell assemblage provides information pertinent to the type of aquatic environment represented by those species during later occupations (see Chapter 10).

13.11 Subsistence Strategies It is hard to discuss accurate usage of aquatic resources without the complimentary information on findings regarding the mollusk analysis, but it appears only the earliest assemblage, AU 8 of the Late Archaic period, focused on the use of aquatic resources. Additionally, those resources seem to either have been hunted (e.g., beaver and ducks) or gathered (e.g., turtles), with only minimal fishing occurring as only one catfish bone was identified in the assemblage. Shifts after 2,000 years ago suggest a reliance on deer after which there is little diversity in the Late/Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric assemblages. 13.12 Taphonomy The preservation of bone at site 41TR203 is unique for North Texas assemblages of its age. A few factors likely contributed to the site’s preservation, including rapid sedimentation and burial of material, likely from flood events of the West Fork of the Trinity River, and the substantial use of mussel shell which, due to its calcareous nature, can alter soils to be less acidic and allow for better bone preservation. There was substantial dry bone breakage at the site, but most bone was not heavily weathered, and fragments tended to be larger than smaller, still in good condition, and not brittle. There was some evidence for rodent gnawing and carnivore consumption (puncture and digestive erosion), but its presence is minimal considering the amount of bone recovered. Overall, few sites in Texas could come close to a similar level of preservation as the Mercado site. 13.13 Cultural Use of Bone North Texas and the region surrounding Tarrant and Dallas Counties tend to be poor in high quality lithic resources. Expedient bone tools have been noted at other sites in the region, such as Fish Creek Sough (site 41DL436) (see Figure 13.1), and were noted here at the Mercado site (41TR203) as well. When processing bone for marrow, breaks tend to be sharp. Although they may become dull over time and deposition, the working edges generally are retained with an angled edge, yet some bones in the assemblage exhibited both a polish from being held, used, and worn, with abraded edges being sharp as they should be. Bone unlike stone, cannot easily be Mercado Site (41TR203) 494 July 2019

re-sharpened, so once becoming dull through use, most bone tools would have been discarded. In addition to the expedient bone tool presence, there were a couple of long bone fragments that had been incised, although the bone was too fragmentary to better identify the taxon or the tools function. Sites should be more closely assessed to look at seeming raw bone for potential cultural modifications to glean a better picture of expedient bone tool use in addition to other cultural use of bone. The unique preservation and large faunal assemblage from the Mercado site have provided knowledge about cultural lifeways, prehistoric human ecology, and environmental conditions spanning approximately 2740 to 930 yr Cal BP at the Mercado site in north-central Texas along the West Fork of the Trinity River. This information helps to fill a void where there has been little direct knowledge of subsistence and paleoenvironmental data for this region of Texas during this timeframe. 13.14 Mussel Shell Mussel shell was present within all AUs at the site but was by far the predominant artifact category in AUs 4 and 5. This phenomenon is addressed below in regards to resource availability and climatic factors. Mussel shell represents a non-repetitive element that can be identified to the lowest taxon possible (often species in well-preserved assemblages). This reveals the mussel community structure harvested. Using the program UNIO by Robert Warren, the riverine habitat the shell was harvested from was estimated. When possible, shell lengths were measured as a proxy for age, enabling species-specific age histograms to be generated. Depending on the stratification of the assemblage, potential harvest pressure though time can be assessed by evaluating shifts in the age structure. While identifying the shell, signs of burning, raccoon predation, and tooling were also noted. By quantifying the shell, the relative abundance of the mussel community being harvested can be determined in addition to the likely habitat of the river from which these mussels were collected., and potentially the harvest pressure on this mussel community.

Approximately 50 percent of the total mussel shell assemblage was analyzed by Traci Popejoy, who was guided by the sampling strategies of Woo et al. (2015) and Cambell (2017). Research questions that she sought to address include: 1. Are the mussel species in AUs 4 and 5 different than the other AUs? 2. Is there tooling evidence on the shells? 3. Where the shells harvested on a regular basis? 4. What was the riverine habitat the shells were collected from, and did it change between AUs? 5. Do changes in stable carbon isotopes correlate with changes in grassland types? Popejoy utilized Dr. Robert Warren’s program, UNIO, to determine the volume of mussel species remains. UNIO also helped to recreate the prehistoric riverine environment by looking at what species prefers water depth, current velocity, substrate composition, and the preferred habitat of the mussels. Additionally, while analyzing the freshwater mussels, tooling evidence was a subject of identification; however, no quantifiable tooling evidence was discovered during the analysis of the mussels. The UNIO program generated results for the freshwater mussel assemblage that was analyzed from site 41TR203. The analysis concluded that the mussels were adapted to a small river with shallow waters that are less than 1.5 m in depth. The primary substrate composition relating the mussel assemblage preferred small gravel and sand substrates with a variable current velocity. The shallow depth of where the mussels occupy within the river may have been an indicator of an opportunistic subsistence strategy performed by prehistoric people. The four tribes (Pleurobemini, Quadrulini, Amblemin, and Lampsilini) outlined in the analysis were commonly found within all the AUs. Of the eight AUs that were defined at site 41TR403, AU 4 (1710 to 1415 yr Cal BP) had the highest concentration of shell. A comparison between AU 5 (1815 to 1570 yr Cal BP) and AU 4 shows a dramatic increase of shell represented within AU 4. The variety of tribes found within AU 4 and AU 5 is relatively consistent, with Pleurobemini being the most prevalent tribe, followed by Quadrulini, Amblemini, and then Lampsilini with the lowest volume within site 41TR203.

Mussel harvesting was practiced on a recurrent basis throughout all AUs at site 41TR203, indicating that the riverine habitat stayed consistent throughout the prehistoric cultural occupations. Although, the spike of exploiting mussels within AUs 4 and 5 may indicate a climatic shift in the surrounding area to a more arid grassland environment. The shift would have modified the larger fauna patterns and in turn would have resulted in the necessity to exploit the mussels on a larger scale for sustenance. Thus, mussels fit the definition of a “stress” food that was exploited in times of necessity. The analysis had no definitive evidence supporting seasonal occupation. 13.15 Botanical Remains The botanical analysis was conducted by Dr. Leslie Bush, who helped define the subsistence strategies of the prehistoric people at the archeological site 41TR203. No charred seeds were recovered, only wood charcoal and two charred bulb fragments. The research questions regarding botanical remains and subsistence strategies are: 1. What plants were processed at the site? The light fraction remains of the flotation process brought several species of plants that were harvested and prepared from the local area by the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric hunter- gatherer groups. The notable species of organic materials that were identified during the analysis consisted of goosefoot seed (Chenopodium sp.), stick-tight seed (Galium sp.), acorn caps (Quercus sp.), and acorn nutshells (Quercus sp.). Goosefoot seeds and the acorns found within features may indicate a food resource that was harvested and baked within the features. The stick-tight seeds are commonly known to have burs and were most likely taken from clothing or animals during the preparation phase of the baking and thrown into the feature to be disposed. The stick-tight “seed” is common in modern vegetation throughout riparian zones and produce fruits between March and May (Diggs 2006). Inferring the month range of when stick-tight is most commonly occurring seasonally may give an indication of what months the camp site may have been occupied in the past.

2. What type of wood was burned as fuel in hearth features? 3. Are these wood types present in the modern vegetation? A side-by-side comparison of the fuel sources throughout the AUs demonstrate that the wood charcoal remains stay consistent throughout time and that the likelihood of the vegetation was the same throughout the different occupational zones from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. The fuel types present within the analysis listed are common species found in the modern vegetation of the site that consists of primarily oaks (Quercus sect. Quercus; Quercus spp; Quercus sect. Lobatae), elm (Ulmus spp.), plum/cherry (Prunus spp.), blackhaw (Viburnum cf. rufidulum), hickory/pecan (Carya spp.), boxelder (Acer negundo), ash (Fraxinus spp.), and the legume family (Fabaceae; most likely honeylocust or redbud). The species of wood described above are used as fuel for the earthen ovens and oak wood is regularly linked with burned rock cooking due to oak producing hot temperatures and ideal coals for baking (Collier and Turner 1981; Marcouiller and Anderson n.d.). 4. What types of vegetation were located at the site throughout the Late Archaic occupation to the Late Prehistoric occupation, and do these differ? 5. Do the plants reflect seasonal use of the site? 6. How does this floral assemblage compare to other regional sites? Two important conclusions were found through the botanical analysis that demonstrate the use of the burned rock features and support the activity areas of the occupational zones of the site. The example comes from AU 1 (1280 to 970 yr Cal BP) of Feature 10, where a charred plant bulb scale fragment was recovered in the flotation sample. The plant bulb was most likely wild onion or camas that was baked in the large earthen oven that is described as Feature 10. The other valued supporting evidence comes from AU 4 (1710 to 1415 yr Cal BP) of Feature 26. Feature 26 was an anomalous defined feature of mostly shell. However, the botanical remains included another charred bulb fragment, 4 acorn nutshell fragments, 11 acorn cap fragments, 3 goosefoot seeds, and a stick-tight seed, all of which may indicate a portion of the prehistoric people’s diet.

can be extrapolated to understand the functions of the other burned rock features found within other AUs at the site. 13.16 Burned Rock Features Rock features were the most common feature type at the site and ranged from small basin hearths to burned rock middens. The ways in which people were processing plant and animal resources using burned rock features provide insight into subsistence strategies beyond simply identifying what resources were being exploited. The rock features potentially provide information concerning what level of effort and innovation went into processing the resources and help further our understanding of plant and animal processing in this region during the Late Archaic period. Burned rock feature analysis focused on questions such as: 1. What types of resources were processed in each feature? 2. What types of burned rock features are present? 3. What sorts of scenarios occurred to create the archeological remains? 4. Were both plants and animals processed at the site in these features? 5. Are some of the rocks boiling stones? 6. Are the rock features typical of other Late Archaic rock features both inside and outside of the region? 7. Do rock sizes indicate feature use? Burned rock feature morphology, technology and utilization was consistent throughout the Late Archaic and Late/Transitional Archaic periods but may have been more focused during the Late Prehistoric Interval. During the Late Archaic Interval at site 41TR203, (approximately 2700 to 2100 yr Cal BP), broad spectrum exploitation of available resources is indicated centered on hunting of large mammals including bison and deer, as well as of numerous small mammals, and included riverbank and riverine resources. AUs 6 through 8 appear to represent a relatively stable or slowly aggrading landform where multiple aboriginal groups camped throughout an approximate 600-year time span, leaving a sheet midden (Feature 20) of subsistence debris including FCR, mussels, animal bone, stone tools, and charred fuel woods. Several elements of Mercado Site (41TR203) 499 July 2019

bison and deer bones were located in feature contexts. Faunal studies may indicate that bison kills were conducted off site and portable portions were brought back to site 41TR203 for further processing and consumption. Mussel shell was common in the sheet midden. Burned rock features included earth oven basal and lid rock elements, small basin-shaped hearths, rockless pits, and simple discard piles, all abandoned on a stable occupation surface resulting in the mix of cultural deposits. At least one large earth oven is identified in the AU 8 sediments based on multiple lines of archeological data, including feature forms, test unit data, photographs, drawings, rock size and weight information, and associated artifacts. Feature 20.1 appears to represent the remnant of a basal heating element to an earth oven, and associated rake-out or discard pile (see Chapter 7). Larger rocks in a relatively tight concentration are present at the south end of the documented extent of the feature, in association with bison teeth. The rocks present as a dense layer of larger, less fractured FCR in a compact arrangement. These exhibit the appearance of the rock lined basal elements of an earth oven (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and Thoms 2014), and the rocks to the north a possible oven lid rock or rake-out pile. The lid rock or rake-out pile consisted of smaller, more highly fractured rocks, in a scattered arrangement, both at the same elevation. Feature 20.1 was excavated from Block A within Units 18, 19, 22, and 23 at 110 to 117 cmbs (99.06 to 98.99). Feature 20.1 measured approximately 135 cm north-south, 115 cm east-west, and 10 cm thick. Feature size, rock size, and rock weight information suggest a possible earth oven. This is supported by the fact that the larger and heavier rocks are present in the tight cluster. A total of 22 FCR weighing 1.25 kilograms was collected from the feature. Most of the rocks were in one layer, some in two layers, and varied from 3 to 12 cm in size and were flat to subangular. Some of the rocks were fractured in-situ. The profile was a very shallow basin, almost flat. From the Feature 20.1 drawing, mussel shell and bone are present in the lid rock scatter, and bone in the tight cluster, but no mussel is observed within the larger rock cluster. Additionally, 63 faunal specimens from large mammals (bison or elk size) were recovered and analyzed. Mercado Site (41TR203) 500 July 2019

Numerous smaller basin-shaped hearth features are documented in the Late Archaic deposits (AUs 6 through 8). Features 32, 42, and 43 represent small circular clusters of larger, less fractured rocks, dug into basins often consisting of 2 to 3 rock layers, with the largest rocks typically at the bottom (see Chapter 7). Photographs and plan and profile drawings (see Chapter 7) indicate Features 42 and 43 consist of tight clusters of FCR with several layers and the largest rocks in a shallow basin at the bottom the features. In both features, charcoal and/or clay or mussel are embedded in the matrix of the feature, between and under the rocks. Select features were subject to collection and burned rock size and weight measurements. Feature 42 feature contained 42 FCR weighing 12.72 kg. While FCR size and weight data are unavailable, Feature 43 consisted of approximately 50 pieces of FCR arranged in a rough circle measuring approximately 50 cm north-south, 50 cm east-west, and 15 cm thick. The base of the feature was basin-shaped, with a dense layer of burned earth and charcoal at the bottom. Feature 32 is interpreted to represent a small basin-shaped hearth feature. It included 64 FCR weighing 13.72 kg. Feature 32 and Feature 42 contained some of the largest numbers of the largest rocks (7 to 10 cm in size), and largest weight of rocks of features at the site. Numerous FCR features in the Late Archaic deposits are ambiguous to morphology or function. These consist of loose scatters of smaller, highly cracked, and fractured FCR that are only roughly circular in shape, or not circular, do not exhibit any basin shape in profile view, are typically one layer of rocks thick, and that contain numerous types of artifacts and faunal remains. In the Late Archaic zone, this includes Features 18, 30, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, and 44. These types of FCR features are posited as possible scattered hearth remnants, or rake- out/discard piles from earth ovens, or simply dumps of nearby cultural activities, and which contribute to the overall sheet midden effect. Additional rock feature types in the Late Archaic occupations (AUs 6 through 8) include unlined, charcoal-stained, ash and baked clay cooking pits, and scatters of mussel shell and FCR. Feature 19 was a dense concentration of burned earth, some in nodules and some in large angular pieces, as well as charcoal, and FCR (see Chapter 7). Feature 6 was a cluster of FCR with smears of charcoal and baked earth identified in BHT 2 during the testing phase. Mapped materials Mercado Site (41TR203) 501 July 2019

included FCR, mussel shell, baked earth, and charcoal. Feature 24 was a dense concentration of ash and burned earth that appeared to be a cooking pit. The feature was excavated from Block C in Units 43, 47, and 58 at 131 cmbs. The feature was excavated on its 90-cm-long north-south axis and measured approximately 30 cm wide and 30 cm thick. There was a burned rim around the top of the feature, and several large chunks of ash within, and numerous faunal remains. Feature 40 was an amorphous concentration of shell and small FCR (less than 5 cm) located adjacent to areas of charcoal staining and burned earth. Late/Transitional Archaic burned rock features are basically the same, only with no positive rock evidence of large earth oven construction and use. Yet there are some indications of earth oven use and plant food processing in the recovered macrobotanical remains from AU 4. In addition, there appears to be more of an emphasis on mussel exploitation, still within a broad-based resource exploitation system. The Late/Transitional Archaic deposits (AUs 4 and 5) are of a much lesser density than the Late Archaic occupations (AUs 6 through 8) and appear to represent an approximate 400-year time span (1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP). The Late/Transitional Archaic occupation zone also accumulated during a period of slower sedimentation, according to the age-sedimentation model, but over a shorter period of time. Thus, the features in the Late/Transitional Archaic are likely to be less culturally overprinted and more representative of short periods or short-lived events. Stable carbon isotope ratios from radiocarbon assays on sediment samples indicate a trend toward a more xeric environment and dominated by C3 plant communities, with increased sediment aggradation and good preservation of the buried cultural deposits. Feature 15 was a dense concentration of rocks that was possibly a hearth, oven remnant, or oven lid rock pile. Only scant information is available on the feature. Feature 15 exhibited one of the highest rock counts and weights in the deposits, with 94 FCR weighing approximately 24.36 kg. The count and weight are suggestive of an earth oven basal remnant, but there is no other information about the size, shape, rock layering, and rock types/sizes. Earth ovens are typically associated with plant food processing, although well understood to have processed a broad spectrum of resources. One ground stone metate fragment (in four non-conjoining pieces) was Mercado Site (41TR203) 502 July 2019

recovered in the AU 4 deposits. Metates are typically associated with the grinding of plant foods and plant food processing in earth ovens (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and Thoms 2014). There are also several examples of ambiguous FCR features also in the Late/Transitional Archaic deposits. These include Feature 1 and Feature 5, and are identified only as a range of possible feature types including displaced hearths, small ovens, lid rock/rake- out piles, or discard heaps, containing various lithics, faunal materials, and mussel shell (see Chapter 7). Similar to the deeper, Late Archaic occupation zone, the Late/Transitional zone exhibited a variety of rockless cooking pits and features consisting of charcoal stained earth and baked sediment (Features 16, 17, 27, and 31). In the Late/Transitional Archaic sediments, Features 14, 21, 25, 26, and 28 are mussel shell middens, mussel shell concentrations, mussel shell scatters depending upon, size, density and depth. All were ubiquitous with numerous different types of mussel, mammal bones and charcoal (see Chapter 7). Feature 26 is notable for containing a charred bulb scale fragment along with other charred plant food remains (4 acorn nutshell fragments, 11 acorn cap fragments, 3 goosefoot seeds, see Appendix B). With preparation, some of these represent possibly utilized plant foods. The bulb is an indication that wild onions or camas were processed and consumed during this occupation. Camas bulbs were often prepared in Late Archaic, Late/Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric contexts in an earth oven (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and Thoms 2014, see below). Thus, Feature 26 may represent the spilled out or dumped contents of an earth oven, complete with mussel shell. Feature 14 was a midden of mussel shells and other artifacts measuring approximately 3 m east–west by 1.5 m north–south and 20 cm thick. Assuming an adequate sample of the Late Prehistoric deposits (AUs 1 through 3), burned rock midden technology was focused on the manufacture and use of earth ovens and earth oven cooking (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and Thoms 2014), supplemented with small basin-shaped hearths for food processing, warmth, and other utilities. The Late Prehistoric zone lacked mussel shell features, and based on faunal remains, was heavily focused on hunting deer, and other mammals, small and large, within a broad-based generalized exploitation system.

Late Prehistoric interval was a period of more xeric conditions (C3 plant communities), more rapid sedimentation, increased aggradation of the terrace deposits, and excellent site preservation. Feature 10 resembles an oval basin pit that is approximately 140 cm north-south by 120 cm east-west, and 15 cm thick. This feature had the most collected burned rock specimen of all the features excavated with 426 specimens, weighing approximately 61.93 kg. Feature 10 is also the largest burned rock feature excavated at site 41TR203. The feature was bisected along its middle axis and the cross-section showed the feature to consist of a shallow basin containing a dense, compact layer of large burned rocks representing the basal rock heating elements of an earth oven (see Chapter 7). Burned rock and burned earth nodules in adjacent Units 30 and 31 may represent the partial clean-out of the feature. Charcoal flecking was ubiquitous, and large pieces of charred branches were located at the bottom of the basin. Two sediment matrix samples were processed from Feature 10 to recover macrobotanical remains (see Appendix B). At 0.14 grams per liter (g/l), the density of plant material was relatively high in this feature (site average = 0.06 g/l). It is one of two features where a bulb scale fragment was recovered, indicating that bulbs such as wild onion or camas were cooked during this site occupation (see Feature 26 above). Ten faunal remains from small mammals were collected from the feature. The density, size, arrangement, and presence of a rock-lined basin of larger unfractured rocks, along with organic remains, suggest that Feature 10 is a larger earth oven with its lower heating elements still intact (see Chapter 7). Features 8 and 12, in the Late Prehistoric deposits, fit into that amorphous category of possibly a hearth remnant, oven remnant, lid rock/rake-out pile, or simply a dump/discard pile. Feature 13 is a well-documented small basin-shaped hearth or small earth oven. The feature was in a figure 8 shape, approximately 80 cm in diameter, and 15 cm thick (Unit 10, AU 3). A dense cluster of approximately 50 FCR was fractured in-situ in two and three flat layers. The basin-shaped nature, the bed of larger rocks in the lower basin, and the loose smaller FCR covering the lower bed are suggestive of a small earth oven. The loose smaller rocks may represent lid rocks from Mercado Site (41TR203) 504 July 2019

the upper elements of a small-sized oven. Alternatively, the remains of a small hearth feature may be indicated. The same feature types are present throughout the terrace deposits during the Late Archaic, Late/Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods, only in differing densities, and states of cultural overprinting or preservation. Archaic burned rock cooking, burned rock technologies, earth oven cookery, small hearths, and rockless pits (from which foodstuffs, fuel, and FCR were removed) were all utilized to process a great variety of resources, including bison and deer, a diversity of smaller mammals, and river margin and riverine resources, including numerous species of mussels and plant foods (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and Thoms 2014). The presence of a metate fragment and the morphology of Feature 10, and the recovery of a charred bulb scale fragment (potentially wild onion or camas) are robust indications of the processing of plant foods as well as the presence of other charred plant remains. Plant food processing can be inferred if not demonstrated by the presence of similar FCR features in different contexts at the site (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and Thoms 2014). Stone boiling is possible and cannot be eliminated at the site, but there is no direct evidence of this. Detailed rock size, rock type, and rock weights within the context of plan and profile feature drawings, photographs, mapping, and sampling can definitely be interpreted to determine feature use, type, and function. But these data sets are lacking consistency in the site records and do not represent a robust and reliable data set from which to make these inferences at site 41TR203. The different types of features and cultural remains were variably dispersed in well-preserved archeological contexts as sheet middens, shell middens, earth oven and hearth feature remnants, lid rock/rake-out piles, dumps, and discard piles (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and Thoms 2014). The types of features observed at site 41TR203 are common and not unique in the north-central Texas archeological record. 13.17 Lithic Technology The amount of lithic material recovered from the Mercado site was sparse, as is the case with most of the sites in the region during these periods. However, there were lithics recovered from Mercado Site (41TR203) 505 July 2019

all AUs, including 12 projectile points. The lithics were analyzed according to TxDOT protocols. Research questions regarding lithic material include: 1. Are there distinct lithic assemblages within each AU? How do they vary? 2. What types of stone tool are present within each AU? 3. What types of raw material were being used? 4. What percentage of the lithic material was heat-treated? Overall, the Mercado site (41TR203) exhibits a low-density stone tool collection with few formal tools consistent with several other sites in the north-central Texas archeological region (Prikryl 1990; Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner et al. 2002). There is very little basis for comparison between the three different occupation zones (Late Prehistoric, Late/Transitional Archaic, Late Archaic) due to the sparse nature of the uppermost assemblages. Recovery is sparse in the Late Prehistoric period (1250 to 250 yr Cal BP). A total of eight flakes and one unifacial fragment were recovered from AUs 1 through 3. These consist of three whole flakes and five flake fragments. From direct observation, chert material types in AUs 1 through 3 include fine-grained gray, dark gray, tan, tan and gray banded, and dark tan/brown. These are all very similar in nature with little variation in material type, only slight variations in color. Also present is one very small flake on coarse grained black material. The presence of a uniface tool is consistent with the significant recovery of deer bone and other mammal bone in Late Prehistoric feature contexts and may reflect hide scraping, although the tool is small and seemingly expedient in nature. No flakes were recorded as exhibiting cortex. None of the flakes are recorded as thermally altered. Twenty-two pieces of debitage were recovered in the Late/Transitional Archaic collection. This small number is likely partly due to sample size and the targeting of the rich Late Archaic zone at the site during the course of the field investigations. One ground stone metate fragment was recovered in four small pieces. Although the pieces do not conjoin, the material of the four elements is identical in terms of abrasive surface, likely sandstone, and the presence of a grinding facet on one side, in the same location; therefore, these may represent the same artifact. The presence of a grinding stone is unique in the site assemblage and consistent with the use and Mercado Site (41TR203) 506 July 2019

construction of earth ovens and plant food processing that is presumed to have occurred throughout the site history. Debitage is counted as 10 whole flakes and 12 flake fragments. Represented are several different chert material types. These include fine grained tan, brown, tan/brown, tan/brown banded, gray and pink. Fine grained tans and grays were most common. Also present are coarse grained gray and brown chert material types. The similarity in material types is suggestive of utilization of local, small cobbles for bifacial thinning. The small collection is equally divided between large 1-in and 3/4-in size flakes (sieves), and small pressure flakes (1/4-in sieve). Though only a few flakes, initial stage reduction and later stage sharpening and resharpening of probable bifacial tools and projectile points is indicated. The occupations in AUs 4 and 5 include broad spectrum small mammal and riverine resource exploitation (mussel shell). No flakes are recorded as exhibiting cortex. None of the flakes are recorded as thermally altered. A significant lithic assemblage was collected from the Late Archaic occupation in AUs 6 through 8. The assemblage contains 20 of the 22 stone tools and 349 of the 390 flakes recovered at the Mercado site (41TR203). Gary projectile points are considered diagnostic of the Late Archaic period and are consistent in age with the proposed 2700 to 2100 yr Cal BP timeframe of AUs 6 through 8 (see Chapter 9). Five projectile points in the collection are considered Gary darts. One is an unidentified Late Archaic point. One projectile resembles an Ensor or Ellis dart with an associated time range of 2200 to 1400 yr Cal BP which is consistent with the Late Archaic site deposits. Five dart points are unidentified, two of which are broad-bladed, which is a trait of Late Archaic lithic technology. One of these may represent a projectile broken during the later or last stages of manufacture and thinning. All of the other darts are utilized, heavily resharpened projectiles (see Chapter 11). Six small bifaces and four small unifaces are present in the collection. The biface fragments are small, crude, and trend toward indicating the expedient use of available materials. The unifaces are all small, flake unifaces. Similar to the bifaces in the collection, all are small pieces that would be navigable between two fingers for focused scraping activities. All four unifacial pieces exhibit one apparent “worked” edge, from simple observation, and is difficult to determine Mercado Site (41TR203) 507 July 2019

whether these four represent intentional alteration or more-so expedient tools with edge damage from use. In terms of debitage, larger flakes (1-in, 3/4-in sieves) were present in the Late Archaic assemblage and represent initial-stage thinning and tool manufacture primarily with fist-size or smaller cores. In addition, the smallest pressure flakes and biface thinning flakes (1/4-in sieve) representing final stage sharpening and resharpening predominated in the Late Archaic assemblage both in terms of whole flakes and flake fragments (see Chapter 9, Table 9.2). Many of these larger flakes exhibited extensive cortex. Flakes with cortex were common in the sheet midden of cultural debris that represents AUs 6 through 8 (approximately 30 percent). Only a very small number of the whole flakes and flake fragments are recorded as thermally altered. There was no evidence of larger cores, fist-sized or larger cores, or core fragments in the site as a whole, nor in the Late Archaic interval. Core reduction occurred with easily transported materials or small cobbles in the immediate vicinity. These aspects may indicate that later stage thinning and sharpening in support of tool production and the resharpening of utilized tools were more important activities at the site rather than initial stage reduction and preform manufacture. A high number and diversity of chert material types were recorded. Numerous chert material types and parent materials were present, including a variety of fine-grained grays, tans, and browns, some banded, and a few coarse-grained gray and tan material types, as well as cryptocrystalline materials, possibly quartzite. This variation reflects a number of different sources for siliceous materials and may represent use of the site by a number of different groups over a longer period of time (AUs 6 through 8). The in-situ context of the cultural deposits, especially in the Late Archaic was excellent, based on concentration of specific observed chert material types at different, specific hearth feature locations. Clusters of the same material were consistently found together at feature locations, implying removal from the same core (at a specific location). One potentially important lithic feature was recorded in AU 7 (Feature 29). Feature 29 was a cache of more than 50 large primary flakes in a dense cluster. A photo is presented in Chapter 7. The flakes were tightly clustered together, all large flakes, and many exhibited cortex indicating Mercado Site (41TR203) 508 July 2019

initial stage reduction off of a larger core. This is a unique find at the site in comparison to the remainder of the lithic collection. Unfortunately, no further information is available on the cache, in terms of feature forms, mapping, sampling, or collection (see Chapter 7). The collection represents significant data primarily in AUs 6 through 8 representing a Late Archaic long-lived, relatively stable surface for approximately 600 years (2700 to 2100 yr Cal BP). Although there are many identifiable differences between AUs 6 through 8, there are more similarities, especially when compared with the other periods at the site. The tools and debitage from AUs 6 through 8 indicate a fair degree of initial stage tool manufacture and reduction, and to a larger degree, predominantly the later and final stages of formal tool manufacture, with considerable evidence of used or expended tool resharpening or rejuvenation, prior to discard (see Chapter 9). The lithic assemblage was limited in variability and contains only a few stone tool forms and types. Present are a limited variety of small, expedient knives, cutting and slicing tools, hide scrapers, immediate-use tools, and hunting implements in the form of projectile points. Overall, the site appears to have been an open, seasonally occupied campsite where a limited set of tool production activities occurred, at least in the Late Archaic interval. Yet occurring within the context of broad-spectrum resources exploitation of the local environment in terms of faunal and riverine resources, from very small mammals to bison sized prey, including an impressive array of resources available in the West Fork of the Trinity River. From the lithic assemblage, the Late Archaic occupation of the site was a seasonally occupied, temporary hunting camp where dart points were manufactured, used and resharpened, along with the use of a few supportive tools. This is consistent with the faunal data from AUs 6 through 8, which contains extensive evidence of the hunting and processing of bison- and deer-size mammals as well a variety of smaller mammals. Deer and bison were hunted off site and transportable portions brought back to the camp for processing. There is also evidence of the processing of whole specimens of deer and bison on site (see Chapter 8) during the Late Archaic Interval. From additional lines of archeological evidence in the form of mussels, hearth feature morphology, and associated artifact content, the Late/Transitional Archaic occupations (AUs 4 Mercado Site (41TR203) 509 July 2019

and 5) were temporary camps oriented around mollusk collection and consumption, along with variable and broad-spectrum hunting and collection activities. Plant food processing probably in earth-type ovens is indicated within this Late/Transitional Archaic set of occupations on the West Fork terrace. In the later history of the site, during the Late Prehistoric, site 41TR203 was a hunting encampment focused on deer and broad-spectrum small mammal, amphibian, and reptilian exploitation and a riverine focus, with small hearth features and significant evidence of plant food processing in earth type oven. 13.18 Burned Earth Synthesis The analysis of the artifact assemblage of the materials recovered by the excavation of site 41TR203 identified two morphological variants of burned clay in the artifact assemblage: 1) platy fiber impressed fragments; and 2) irregular rounded objects. The geoarchaeological study (see Chapter 6) documented three forms of burned earth: 1) in-situ thermal rubified rims associated with thermal features; 2) small fragments of burned earth presumed to have been detached from the baked earth of thermal features (presumably scatted by cleaning out hearths and other features); and 3) platy, apparently sand-tempered objects. The first two categories are thought to be related and were noted in the soil micromorphological analysis (see Chapter 6, Figures 6.26 and 6.22) as well as in the microartifact study. The last category, platy burned objects, was incidentally sampled by a micromorphological sample from Feature 20, Unit 28. Although it was not apparent that the latter was a fiber-impressed burned object, the appearance of this material in thin section indicated that it was not incidentally fired site matrix material, but rather contained considerably more sand, and was most likely a sand-tempered earthen object of some form. Research topics included: 1) background research; 2) documentation of the burned earth assemblage in basic terms; 3) characterize the materials using various analytical methods, specifically using thin section petrography and computer tomography; and 4) experimental replication and subsequent analysis of resulting objects in a manner similar to that used to characterize the burned earth artifacts.

The burned earth assemblage was comprised of approximately 3,300 specimens and was examined by Dr. Charles Frederick (see Appendix D). The specimens were collected from the features found within the excavation blocks and the geoarcheology trench. The frequent observation made from the analysis was the specimens were reddened (rubefaction), expressed by a 7.5 YR Munsell hue and hardened (sintered). An alternative observation made of the burned earth specimens was that some of the specimens exhibited a carbon core that would have been developed by the material being thermally altered and the oxidation of the organic material not being burned completely. Burned earth has been linked in the archeological record to representing an applied mud plaster that would have been spread over thatched roofing as a means of fire and leak proofing. When the mud plaster is applied the imprint of the thatch grass roof would be imprinted onto the mud plaster and then when thermally altered it would keep the impression. Site 41TR203 showed no significant evidence to support that the burned earth was from a mud plaster for a prehistoric structure. Another rarity in the archeological record is “baked clay balls” that were used expediently for hot rock cooking when rocks were not locally available. Even though sources site the north- central Texas being one of the geographic areas where the baked clay balls were used, site 41TR203 showed no evidence of this activity within the assemblage. The conclusion was the burned earth specimens excavated at site 41TR203 were accidental byproducts of human occupation and their activities on the landscape (see Appendix D). 13.18.1 Comparative Settlement Patterns Summary Using four area sites with similar chronographic spans, the settlement pattern at site 41TR203 is compared and contrasted in the following section using stratigraphy, sedimentation rate, features, and assemblages. 13.19 Site 41CO150 13.19.1 Stratigraphy and Sedimentation Rate Site 41CO150 (Gemma site) is in the floodplain of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River about 50 miles north-northeast of site 41TR203. Within its complicated stratigraphy, hearths with Mercado Site (41TR203) 511 July 2019

faunal remains and artifacts were recorded in the fill of two separate, old river channels. The assemblage dates to ~2900 to 1700 yr Cal BP during the Late Archaic, which makes it a good candidate for comparison with the slightly younger assemblage from site 41TR203 that dates to ~2600 to 500 yr Cal BP. The Gemma site is considered one of the best series of stratified Late Archaic occupations in the region because it revealed features and charcoal in discrete occupation surfaces, most of which were separated by sterile alluvium within a chute cut-off channel (Ferring and Yates 1997:61). However, one should note that only approximately six radiocarbon dates were obtained for site 41CO150. The Late Prehistoric deposits at site 41CO150 were within a neck cut-off channel associated with an oxbow lake, and similarly well-stratified, consisting of finely laminated silts in couplets of courser flood-stage silt overlaid by post-flood clay suspension (Ferring and Yates 1997:58). The Late Prehistoric assemblage consisted of hearths and shell-tempered ceramic sherds and demonstrated the continued use of abandoned river channels for occupation as the Late Archaic groups had done. These deposits indicate slow floodplain aggradation after ~1700 yr Cal BP with little change since; whereas, several meters of late Holocene floodplain accretion are documented at the Aubrey site (41DN479) about 10 miles south-southeast of site 41CO150 and also along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Thus, highly variable sedimentation rates are indicated in various parts of the Upper Trinity River Valley during the same periods in prehistory. Variation in sedimentation rates is also evident at the Mercado site at ~1700 yr Cal BP, which falls within a period of slower sedimentation (~1880 to 1450 yr Cal BP), but another interval of more rapid sedimentation follows at ~1450 to 1200 yr Cal BP. 13.19.2 Features and Assemblages Late Archaic occupation at 41CO150 was evidenced by 44 features, most of which were unlined or clay-lined hearths with ash, indicating complete fuel burning in shallow pits with good air circulation. The highest densities of mussel shell were associated with unlined hearths in Stratum B2 at the site. The rock-lined hearths tended to have more charcoal. Hearths in Stratum B2 contained a considerable range of small mammals, fish, turtle, birds, and deer remains, indicative of grassland, aquatic, and woodland environments.

site 41CO150, 7 are Gary points (contrary to Prikyrl [1990]), with the remainder including Darl, Marcos, Ellis-Ensor, Godley, Yarborough, and Trinity (Ferring and Yates 1997:67-72). Overall, the lithic assemblage suggested an intensive occupation with 14 bifacial tools exhibiting frequent resharpening. The occupation in Stratum A3 at site 41CO150 overlays Stratum B2 and is about 500 to 600 years younger. While A3 had a high density of artifacts, bone, and mussel shell, there were only a few small hearth features. The untyped projectile points were corner-notched to short-stemmed shapes and stylistically distinct from those in Strata B2 or A2 (above A3). Interestingly, Gary points were within B2, absent from A3, and appeared again in A2 (Ferring and Yates 1997:75). Site 41CO150 was interpreted as a record of repeated occupations by apparently mobile groups who exploited local resources from habitats surrounding the site (Ferring and Yates 1997:99). 13.20 Site 41CO144 13.20.1 Stratigraphy and Sedimentation Rate Site 41CO144 is about 4 miles south of 41CO150 and was recorded along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River within the fill of cut-off channels, in contexts similar to site 41CO150. Two radiocarbon assays from 2 m below the surface date that portion of the site to ~2300 yr Cal BP. Unlike site 41CO150, sediment accrued at site 41CO144 at a moderate rate until ~800 to 750 yr Cal BP when slower deposition began (Ferring and Yates 1997:103). Similar sedimentation rates are also evident at the Mercado site at ~800 to 750 yr Cal BP, which falls within a period of slower sedimentation (~1200 to 620 yr Cal BP) corresponding to AUs 1 and 3, after which no subsequent interval of more rapid sedimentation was recorded at the Mercado site. 13.20.2 Features and Assemblages Seven features consisting of rock-lined and unlined hearths were encountered along with an assemblage of burned rock, burned bone, burned clay, charcoal, mussel shell, debitage, and bison remains. Besides Feature 5, which was intrusive and dated to ~500 yr Cal BP, there was no other evidence of a Late Prehistoric occupation at site 41CO144. Features 1, 2, and 3 were in the same stratigraphic context that was radiocarbon dated to ~2300 yr Cal BP. Overall, 13 projectile points Mercado Site (41TR203) 513 July 2019

were recorded in Late Archaic context, including Dallas, Gary, Godley, and Ellis types. The Mercado projectile points included 5 Gary points (in AUs 6-8 dated to ~2700 to 2100 yr Cal BP) and an Ellis-Ensor point (in AU 4 dated to ~2200 to 1400 yr Cal BP), all in Late Archaic contexts. Evidence of whole deer carcasses being processed at the site was encountered along with indications of the exploitation of multiple habitats typical of bottomland environments, such as grassland, woodland edge, and riparian (Ferring and Yates 1997). Less burned rock and mussel shell than at site 41CO150 was noted, but the two sites shared a Late Archaic record indicative of repeated occupations, stratified artifact assemblages and features, and the foraging of local food resources (Ferring and Yates 1997:127). 13.21 Site 41CO141 13.21.1 Stratigraphy and Sedimentation Rate Site 41CO141 is about 0.62 mi south of site 41CO144 and along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River at its confluence with Spring Creek. Early excavations revealed a Late Archaic human burial along with three hearth features and a knapping event ranging in time from ~1750 to 965 yr Cal BP (Yates and Ferring 1997:129-131). Later excavations produced more radiocarbon assays, and overall at site 41CO141 the assemblage ranges from Late Archaic (~1750 yr Cal BP) to Late Prehistoric (~1300 to 760 yr Cal BP). As at sites 41CO144 and 41CO150, there was good geomorphic evidence of channel shifts in the vicinity of 41CO141 during ~3000 to 2000 yr Cal BP. Otherwise, detailed information about sedimentation rates was not provided in the report, perhaps, because site 41CO141 lacked detailed stratigraphic resolution. The later, more extensive excavations at site 41CO141 suffered from widespread surface disturbances that were a consequence of the site being encountered during construction of an adjacent bridge. Disturbed soils were removed prior to controlled excavations, resulting in some degree of truncation. 13.21.2 Features and Assemblages Besides the human burial, Late Archaic occupations are poorly represented at site 41CO141, but evidence is present in the deepest level excavated (Gary and Ellis projectile points). Likewise, the Mercado projectile points included multiple Gary points and an Ellis-Ensor point during the Mercado Site (41TR203) 514 July 2019

Late Archaic. Late Prehistoric assemblages at site 41CO141 immediately overlay the Late Archaic component, and are considered important evidence of the age and character of the transition from the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods (Yates and Ferring 1997:135). Similarly, AUs 4 and 5 at the Mercado site are dated to ~1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP during a proposed Late/Transitional Archaic Period for the West Fork of the Trinity River. The Late Prehistoric assemblage was comprised of relatively few lithic artifacts, but included projectile points typed as Gary, Fresno, Scallorn, Alba-Catahoula, and Washita. One of the Washita points was crafted from Edwards chert, while all other lithic artifacts were made of quartzite or local chert. Intense cultural activity is indicated at the site, but lithic reduction was not represented, and no ceramic artifacts were encountered. Site 41CO141 is interpreted as a hunting and collecting station that was repeatedly occupied by mobile groups (Yates and Ferring 1997:154). Food was prepared and consumed at his location, although seasonally or periodically, and the site may be associated with more permanent settlements nearby. Seven features were defined, yielding abundant burned rock and substantial samples of bone and mussel shell. Rock-lined hearths were common and associated with the mussel shell. The cultural deposits resembled a midden. While turtle remains were the most numerous, deer contributed the major meat component to the diet of residents at site 41CO141, and whole carcasses were apparently processed at the site (Yates and Ferring 1997:148). Twelve deer metapodials were used as tools (grinders), and other deer bones exhibit cut marks and spiral fractures indicative of butchery and marrow extraction. Other animals such as rabbits, rodents, turkey, quail, raccoon, and beaver were hunted along with a variety of fish and aquatic turtles. Thus, the Late Prehistoric subsistence pattern at site 41CO141 was comparable to other Late Archaic sites in the Upper Trinity River Valley, with the exploitation of riparian, woodland, and grassland habitats and with small game and aquatic resources complimenting deer in the assemblage (Yates and Ferring 1997:154).

13.22 Site 41TR198 13.22.1 Stratigraphy and Sedimentation Rate Like the Mercado site, discrete occupational components with datable material were encountered at site 41TR198, which is about 3.4 km (2.1 mi) southeast along the West Fork of the Trinity River. Its components range from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods (Peter and Harrison 2011). The sedimentation rates calculated for site 41TR198 do not comport with those from the Mercado site. In fact, some of the fastest rates (35 cm/year at 1700 yr Cal BP and 22.3 cm/year at 1750 yr Cal BP) coincide with a much slower sedimentation rate of 3.24 cm/year during ~1880 to 1450 yr Cal BP at site 41TR203. Likewise, the slowest sedimentation rate at site 41TR198 (5.14 cm/year at 1360 yr Cal BP) occurs when sedimentation at site 41TR203 is proceeding nearly twice as fast (9.87 cm/year during ~1450 to 1200 yr Cal BP). 13.22.2 Features and Assemblages The components at site 41TR198 contained a significant amount of well-preserved faunal remains, burned rock features, and bone and shell lenses. Late Archaic Feature 25 contained onion or camas bulbs (AD 140 to 340) along with deer, turtle, and bird remains. Another bulb from a non-feature context was dated to AD 300–350. Feature 10 in AU 1 dates to ~1280 to 970 yr Cal BP, while Feature 26 in AU 4 dates to ~1710 to 1415 yr Cal BP. Notably, no bison remains were identified within the Late Archaic assemblage at site 41TR198. Likewise, bison remains are not found in any AUs that are radiocarbon dated to after 2000 yr Cal BP at the Mercado site. The most intensive occupation at site 41TR198 was at the end of the Late Archaic (AD 140 to 350) and contained Yarborough, Trinity, and Axtell projectile points. The occupation continued into the Late Prehistoric (AD 700 to 1040) with four grit-tempered ceramic sherds, but the component lacked arrow points. The hearth features at site 41TR198 were similar to those at the Mercado site and sites 41CO144 and 41CO150 along the Upper Trinity River Valley. Except while Ogalla chert dominates the assemblage at sites 41CO144 and 41CO150, local Uvalde gravel and central Texas chert are common at sites 41TR198 and 41TR170.

quartzite is the material of choice along with some central Texas chert. A small cache of central Texas Edwards chert primary flakes (Feature 29) was documented at the Mercado site, but most of the lithic material appears to be locally sourced chert, with some quartzite present. The variety of molluscs at the site indicates a medium-sized river with slow-moving waters to a depth of 0.9 m and primarily mud with some sand as substratum. Before AD 900, the site contains rock features and ground stone artifacts, but after that point rock features are not well- represented and ground stone is non-existent. This is interpreted as an emphasis on plant resources in the Late Archaic (though deer were hunted) and a preference for smaller game during the Late Prehistoric. 13.23 Site 41TR203 The Late Archaic component at Mercado site (principally AUs 6 through 8) formed on a relatively stable surface during about 600 years (~2700 to 2100 yr Cal BP). The lithic assemblage was limited in variability, containing only a few stone tool forms and types, but the tools and debitage indicate a fair degree of initial-stage tool manufacture and reduction, and more commonly the later and final stages of formal tool manufacturing. There was also considerable resharpening or rejuvenation of tools before they were discarded. The site is interpreted as an open, seasonally occupied (spring to fall) campsite in the context of a local environment with a broad spectrum of resources, including riverine, woodland, and grassland habitats. Their prey ranged from small mammals and aquatic life to deer and bison. The larger prey were commonly killed and processed off-site, but there were some examples of whole specimens of both deer and bison being processed at the camp. During the Late/Transitional Archaic at the Mercado site, mussels become a more prominent food source, but the subsistence strategy continued to include variable and broad-spectrum hunting and collection activities. Plant processing within earth ovens is evident during this transitional period. The Late Prehistoric component at the site is indicative of a hunting encampment focused on deer, broad-spectrum small mammals, amphibians, and reptiles. Small hearth/earth oven features also preserved significant evidence of plant food processing. Mercado Site (41TR203) 517 July 2019

There are discernible trends in the subsistence data that indicate changes in occupational intensity, subsistence, and inferentially group size. At the same time, the technological consistency of burned rock features suggests a long-lived subsistence pattern, stretching from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric, and perhaps made possible because site 41TR203 is situated on a relatively stable surface at the convergence of riverine, woodland, and grassland habitats.

1785 The University of Georgia Center for Applied Isotope Studies RADIOCARBON ANALYSIS REPORT September 11, 2009 Dr. Jim Abbott Environmental Affairs Division Texas Dept. of Transportation 125 E. 11" St. Austin, TX 78701 Dear Dr. Abbott Enclosed please find the results of 'C Radiocarbon AMS analyses and Stable Isotope Ratio 5'°C analyses for the samples received by our laboratory on August 18, 2009 [| _SampleiD_—[|_—Material_| 3"°C,% | “Cage, years BP | + _| 5 4980 4981 4982__| _41TR203-14336.5-13 | bonecollagen | -205 | 204025 | 4983 4984 4985 The bone was cleaned by wire brush and washed, using ultrasonic bath. After cleaning, the dried bone was gently crushed to small fragments. The crushed bone was treated with 1N HC at 4° for 24 hours. The residue was filtered, rinsed with deionized water and under slightly acid condition (pH=3) heated at 80°C for 6 hours to dissolve collagen and leave humic substances in the precipitate. The collagen solution is then filtered to isolate pure collagen and dried out. The dried collagen was combusted at 575°C in evacuated/sealed Pyrex ampoule in the present CuO. The charcoal sample was treated with 5% HCl at the temperature 80°C for 1 hour, then it were washed and with deionized water on the fiberglass filter and rinsed with diluted NaOH to remove possible contamination by humic acids. After that the sample was treated with diluted HCL again, washed with deionized water and dried at 60°C. The cleaned sample was combusted at 900°C in evacuated/sealed quartz ampoule in the present CuO. The resulting carbon dioxide was cryogenically purified from the other reaction products and catalytically converted to graphite using the method of Vogel et al. (1984) Nuclear nN Hainan jyaayan

Instruments and Methods in Physics Research B5, 289-293. Graphite '*C/13C ratios were measured using the CAIS 0.5 MeV accelerator mass spectrometer. The sample ratios were compared to the ratio measured from the Oxalic Acid I (NBS SRM 4990). The sample '°C/'*C ratios were measured separately using a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer and expressed as 8'°C with respect to PDB, with an error of less than 0.1%o. The quoted uncalibrated dates have been given in radiocarbon years before 1950 (years BP), using the '*C half-life of 5568 years. The error is quoted as one standard deviation and reflects both statistical and experimental errors. The date has been corrected for isotope fractionation. If the dates are to be published, please quote the UGAMS numbers, as it identifies our laboratory as having produced the dates. If we can be of further assistance, or you wish to discuss these results, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Dr.Alexander Cherkinsky

September 23, 2013 Dr. Julie Shipp ACI Consulting 1001 Mopac Circle Suite 100 Austin, TX 78746 USA RE: Radiocarbon Dating Results For Samples 41TR203.L13.02, 41TR203.L16.01, 41TR203.L22.04, 41TR203.L28.05, 41TR203.L33.06 Dear Dr. Shipp: Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for five samples recently sent to us. They each provided plenty of carbon for accurate measurements and all the analyses proceeded normally. The report sheet contains the dating result, method used, material type, applied pretreatment and two-sigma calendar calibration result (where applicable) for each sample. This report has been both mailed and sent electronically, along with a separate publication quality calendar calibration page. This is useful for incorporating directly into your reports. It is also digitally available in Windows metafile (.wmf) format upon request. Calibrations are calculated using the newest (2009) calibration database. References are quoted on the bottom of each calibration page. Multiple probability ranges may appear in some cases, due to short-term variations in the atmospheric 14C contents at certain time periods. Examining the calibration graphs will help you understand this phenomenon. Calibrations may not be included with all analyses. The upper limit is about 42,000 years, the lower limit is about 250 years and some material types are not suitable for calibration (e.g. water). We analyzed these samples on a sole priority basis. No students or intern researchers who would necessarily be distracted with other obligations and priorities were used in the analyses. We analyzed them with the combined attention of our entire professional staff. Thank you for prepaying the analyses. As always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Digital signature on file Page 1 of 8

March 18, 2014 Dr. Julie Shipp ACI Consulting 1001 Mopac Circle Suite 100 Austin, TX 78746 USA RE: Radiocarbon Dating Result For Sample 41TR203.F23 Dear Dr. Shipp: Enclosed is the radiocarbon dating result for one sample recently sent to us. As usual, specifics of the analysis are listed on the report with the result and calibration data is provided where applicable. The Conventional Radiocarbon Age has been corrected for total fractionation effects and where applicable, calibration was performed using 2013 calibration databases (cited on the graph pages). The web directory containing the table of results and PDF download also contains pictures, a cvs spreadsheet download option and a quality assurance report containing expected vs. measured values for 3-5 working standards analyzed simultaneously with your samples. The reported result is accredited to ISO-17025 standards and all pretreatments and chemistry were performed here in our laboratories and counted in our own accelerators here in Miami. Since Beta is not a teaching laboratory, only graduates trained to strict protocols of the ISO-17025 program participated in the analysis. As always Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per the conventions of the 1977 International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce sigmas lower than +/-30 years, a conservative +/-30 BP is cited for the result. When interpreting the result, please consider any communications you may have had with us regarding the sample. As always, your inquiries are most welcome. If you have any questions or would like further details of the analysis, please do not hesitate to contact us. The cost of the analysis was charged to the American Express card provided. Thank you. As always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Digital signature on file Page 1 of 3

December 1, 2014 Dr. Julie Shipp ACI Consulting 1001 Mopac Circle, Suite 100 Austin, TX 78746 USA RE: Radiocarbon Dating Results For Samples 41TR203.1, 41TR203.3, 41TR203.4, 41TR203.5, 41TR203.6, 41TR203.7, 41TR203.8, 41TR203.9, 41TR203.10, 41TR203.11, 41TR203.12, 41TR203.13, 41TR203.15, 41TR203.16, 41TR203.17, 41TR203.18, 41TR203.19, 41TR203.22, 41TR203.23, 41TR203.25, 41TR203.26, 41TR203.27, 41TR203.28, 41TR203.29, 41TR203.30 Dear Dr. Shipp: Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for 25 samples recently sent to us. As usual, the method of analysis is listed on the report with the results and calibration data is provided where applicable. The Conventional Radiocarbon Ages have all been corrected for total fractionation effects and where applicable, calibration was performed using 2013 calibration databases (cited on the graph pages). The web directory containing the table of results and PDF download also contains pictures, a cvs spreadsheet download option and a quality assurance report containing expected vs. measured values for 3-5 working standards analyzed simultaneously with your samples. Reported results are accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 standards and all chemistry was performed here in our laboratories and counted in our own accelerators here in Miami. Since Beta is not a teaching laboratory, only graduates trained to strict protocols of the ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 program participated in the analyses. As always Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per the conventions of the 1977 International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce sigmas lower than +/-30 years, a conservative +/-30 BP is cited for the result. When interpreting the results, please consider any communications you may have had with us regarding the samples. As always, your inquiries are most welcome. If you have any questions or would like further details of the analyses, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you for prepaying the analyses. As always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Digital signature on file Page 1 of 33

September 23, 2013 Dr. Julie Shipp ACI Consulting 1001 Mopac Circle Suite 100 Austin, TX 78746 USA RE: Radiocarbon Dating Results For Samples 41TR203.L13.02, 41TR203.L16.01, 41TR203.L22.04, 41TR203.L28.05, 41TR203.L33.06 Dear Dr. Shipp: Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for five samples recently sent to us. They each provided plenty of carbon for accurate measurements and all the analyses proceeded normally. The report sheet contains the dating result, method used, material type, applied pretreatment and two-sigma calendar calibration result (where applicable) for each sample. This report has been both mailed and sent electronically, along with a separate publication quality calendar calibration page. This is useful for incorporating directly into your reports. It is also digitally available in Windows metafile (.wmf) format upon request. Calibrations are calculated using the newest (2009) calibration database. References are quoted on the bottom of each calibration page. Multiple probability ranges may appear in some cases, due to short-term variations in the atmospheric 14C contents at certain time periods. Examining the calibration graphs will help you understand this phenomenon. Calibrations may not be included with all analyses. The upper limit is about 42,000 years, the lower limit is about 250 years and some material types are not suitable for calibration (e.g. water). We analyzed these samples on a sole priority basis. No students or intern researchers who would necessarily be distracted with other obligations and priorities were used in the analyses. We analyzed them with the combined attention of our entire professional staff. Thank you for prepaying the analyses. As always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Digital signature on file Page 1 of 8

May 21, 2018 Ms. Katie Canavan aci Consulting 1001 Mopac Circle Austin, TX 78746 United States RE: Radiocarbon Dating Results Dear Ms. Canavan, Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for seven samples recently sent to us. The report sheet contains the Conventional Radiocarbon Age (BP), the method used, material type, and applied pretreatments, any sample specific comments and, where applicable, the two-sigma calendar calibration range. The Conventional Radiocarbon ages have been corrected for total isotopic fractionation effects (natural and laboratory induced). All results (excluding some inappropriate material types) which fall within the range of available calibration data are calibrated to calendar years (cal BC/AD) and calibrated radiocarbon years (cal BP). Calibration was calculated using one of the databases associated with the 2013 INTCAL program (cited in the references on the bottom of the calibration graph page provided for each sample.) Multiple probability ranges may appear in some cases, due to short-term variations in the atmospheric 14C contents at certain time periods. Looking closely at the calibration graph provided and where the BP sigma limits intercept the calibration curve will help you understand this phenomenon. Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per the conventions of the 1977 International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce sigmas lower than +/- 30 years, a conservative +/- 30 BP is cited for the result. All work on these samples was performed in our laboratories in Miami under strict chain of custody and quality control under ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 accreditation protocols. Sample, modern and blanks were all analyzed in the same chemistry lines by qualified professional technicians using identical reagents and counting parameters within our own particle accelerators. A quality assurance report is posted to your directory for each result. Our invoice will be emailed separately. Please forward it to the appropriate officer or send a credit card authorization. Thank you. As always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact us. Sincerely , Page 1 of 15

No sub-contracting or student labor was used in the analyses. All work was done at Beta in 4 in-house NEC accelerator mass spectrometers and 4 Thermo IRMSs. The "Conventional Radiocarbon Age" was calculated using the Libby half -life (5568 years), is corrected for total isotopic fraction and was used for calendar calibration where applicable. The Age is rounded to the nearest 10 years and is reported as radiocarbon years before present (BP), “present" = AD 1950. Results greater than the modern reference are reported as percent modern carbon (pMC). The modern reference standard was 95% the 14C signature of NIST SRM-4990C (oxalic acid). Quoted errors are 1 sigma counting statistics. Calculated sigmas less than 30 BP on the Conventional Radiocarbon Age are conservatively rounded up to 30. d13C values are on the material itself (not the AMS d13C). d13C and d15N values are relative to VPDB-1. References for calendar calibrations are cited at the bottom of calibration graph pages. Page 2 of 15

1 Introduction Seven flotation samples and one radiocarbon sample from Site 41TR203 were submitted for identification and analysis of plant remains. The seven flotation samples represent 20.65 cubic decimeters of soil matrix from six excavation units. Site setting Site 41TR203 is located on the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity River east of the current I-35W bridge. Despite disturbance in the upper 30 centimeters, three distinct prehistoric components were observed in testing (THC Site Forms 5/3/2005 and 6/22/2009). Vegetation in the site area is currently a mowed field, but a much more dynamic floodplain vegetation would have been in place prior to channelization of the Trinity River. Not surprisingly, plants of riparian zones tend to tolerate flooding and other disturbances better than their upland counterparts. A great many species may share the canopy in a floodplain forest, and “dominance is absent or poorly defined” (Lee 1945:163). Common trees of the Trinity River area include willows (Salix spp.), cottonwood (Populus deltoides), elms (Ulmus spp.), hackberry (Celtis spp.), ashes (Fraxinus spp.), various types of oaks (Quercus spp.), pecan and other hickories (Carya spp.), roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii), boxelder (Acer negundo), sedges, grasses, and forbs (Bezanson 2000:115). Floodplains also support useful vines such as grapes (Vitis spp.) and Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia). Oxbows, sloughs, marshes, and other wetlands associated with the Trinity River offer plant resources such as cattail (Typha spp.) and aquatic tubers or rhizomes including arrowhead (Sagittaria spp.) and spatterdock (Nuphar lutea). Upland vegetation would have been very different from riparian vegetation in prehistoric times. Tarrant County lies in the Fort Worth Prairie section of the Cross Timbers and Prairies vegetation area, where upland vegetation protected from modern human impacts is a mixed-grass prairie characterized by grasses such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparius), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) and forbs (Bezanson 2000:115-116; Diggs et al. 1999:52-53). Mean annual precipitation in Tarrant County during the period 1951-1980 was 31.3 inches (795 mm). Precipitation has a unimodal distribution, peaking in April and May followed by a dry summer. The frost-free season in Tarrant County today averages 230 days and runs from March 26 through November 11 (NFIC 1987:465-466). Methods Flotation samples were processed in a modified version of the TAS Field School method (Bush 2012, 2013). The manual (bucket) flotation used bottom (heavy fraction) mesh with square openings of 1.0 mm and top (light fraction) mesh with triangular

2 openings of 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.5 mm. Light fractions were skimmed from the water surface rather than poured off. As recommended by Gail Wagner, 100 carbonized poppy seeds (Papaver somniferum) were added to two of the seven flotation samples prior to processing to assess small seed recovery rates (Wagner 1982). Poppy seeds are used because they are readily available, not native to the study area, and at about 1.0 mm long they approximate the mean size of wild seeds in North America. In the laboratory, 86 poppy seeds were recovered from one sample and 88 from the other. This is comparable to recovery rates reported for the Incinerator (Sunwatch) Machine using 0.59 mm bottom mesh (Wagner 1982), the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) manual system using 0.5 mm bottom mesh (Hunter and Gassner 1998), and the Flot-Tech Machine at Indiana University using 1.0 mm bottom mesh (Bush 2001). Recovery rates for this project are well above rates reported for IDOT projects and the Incinerator Machine with 1.0 bottom mesh (Wagner 1982). Recovery rates in the 90s have been occasionally reported for manual flotation systems (Bush 2013) and machines with 0.6 mm bottom mesh (Bush 2001, 2013; Hunter and Gassner 1998). Plant material from the light fractions was transferred to Macrobotanical Analysis in December 2013, where sorting and analysis took place in December 2013 and January 2014. The flotation samples were sorted according to standard procedures (Pearsall 2000). Light fractions were weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic balance before being size-sorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh. Carbonized botanical materials that did not pass through the No. 10 mesh (2 mm square openings) were completely sorted, counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized plant parts and all non-botanical material in this size fraction are referred to as “contamination”. At Site 41TR203, contamination consisted of rootlets, gastropods, grass leaves, and bits of modern plastic. Materials that fell through the 2 mm mesh (“residue”) were examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 7-45 X magnification for carbonized botanical remains other than those present in the larger size fraction (in this case, wood charcoal). Identifiable material was removed from residue, counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized seeds in the light fraction were identified and recorded on a presence/absence basis on laboratory forms. Contamination and residue were weighed, recorded, and labeled only. For each flotation sample, wood charcoal fragments were selected at random from those larger than 2 mm until 20 fragments were examined (or all fragments in cases where fewer than 20 were present). When no wood charcoal was present in the larger size fraction, identification was attempted for smaller pieces (Lots 7, 24, and 27), but these could usually be identified only as “hardwood”. The softwood from Lot 7 could be assigned to the genus Juniperus (juniper, also called cedar) because there are only two reasonable softwood possibilities for Tarrant County, one coarse-textured (Taxodium; baldcypress) and one fine-textured (Juniperus). Fragments were snapped to reveal a clean transverse section and examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 28-180 X magnification. When necessary, tangential or radial sections were examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting, and other minute characteristics that can only be seen at the higher magnifications of this range.

3 All samples were subject to radiocarbon protocols during identification to retain suitability for radiocarbon dating. Samples were sorted on freshly washed glassware and handled only with vinyl gloves and metal forceps. Contact with paper and other plant products was avoided Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; Martin and Barkley 1961; Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980). Plant nomenclature follows the PLANTS Database (USDA, NRCS 2014). Results and Discussion Plant materials recovered from Site 41TR203 samples are given in Tables 11.2- .18. The tables include count and weights of carbonized plants from the flotation samples as well as identification of the radiocarbon sample. Weights for the residue and contamination fractions of the flotation light fractions are provided, and uncarbonzied seeds are shown on a presence/absence basis. Uncarbonized plant remains Most uncarbonized plant parts at Site 41TR203 appear in the form of rootlets and grass stems and are clearly related to the modern vegetation at the site. Uncarbonized seeds are shown on a presence/absence basis in Table 11.2. Uncarbonized seeds are a common occurrence on most archeological sites, but they usually represent seeds of modern plants that have made their way into the soil either through their own dispersal mechanisms or by faunalturbation, floralturbation, or argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51-52; Miksicek 1987:231-232). In all except the driest areas of North America, uncarbonized plant material on open-air sites can be assumed to be of modern origin unless compelling evidence suggests otherwise (Lopinot and Brussell 1982; Miksicek 1987:231). The seeds at Site 41TR203 consist primarily of grass seeds almost certainly relating to the current vegetation on the site. The four other seed taxa present are weedy colonizers that are common in modern lawns and grassy fields. All uncarbonized plant parts, including seeds, are interpreted here as modern. Carbonized plants Wood charcoal was the only plant type found that was not clearly related to modern vegetation or methods testing. (As discussed above, carbonized poppy seeds were added to two flotation samples to assess flotation processing.) Seventy-eight wood charcoal fragments were recovered (3.37 g), with identification attempted for 63 fragments, of which 45 could be identified to the level of the botanical genus or species. Identifiable wood consisted mostly of genus Ulmus (n=16; probably cedar elm, U. crassifolia) and genus Acer (n= 15; probably boxelder, A. negundo). A legume (n=6; probably honeylocust [Gleditsia triacanthos] or redbud [Cercis canadensis]) and various

4 oaks (Quercus spp.; n=6) were present, with elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens; n=1), and juniper (Juniperus sp.; n=1) also represented. Most of these trees are typical floodplain species and would have been readily available in the site area during most of the Holocene. Juniper is associated with upland habitats today, but in prehistoric times it would have been more common in canyons and along rivers where it was protected from fires. One of the oaks, Quercus fusiformis (plateau live oak), is more typically an upland species but can often be found on river terraces. Summary Archeological plant remains from Site 41TR203 consisted of solely of wood charcoal. The trees represented are almost exclusively floodplain species (boxelder and cedar elm) that would have been present in the immediate site area.

March 3, 2015 Ann M. Scott Cultural Resources Division aci consulting 1001 Mopac Circle Austin, TX 78746 Re: Results of Faunal Analysis, 41TR203 Testing, ACI consulting project number 12-13- 027, Task Order 1 Dear Dr. Scott, TRC provides this letter report of the Faunal Analysis of Site 41TR203 material recovered during Archeological Testing by aci consulting (ACI) in keeping with Task Order 1. The site was discovered during environmental review of the North Tarrant Expressway (NTE) Project in Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas. Archeological site 41TR203 was located along the West Fork Trinity River. Testing efforts at the site confirmed that the site is National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and State Archeological Landmark (SAL) eligible. Cultural materials were encountered to a depth of 150 centimeters below the surface (cmbs), and at least three occupation zones were identified to a depth of approximately 120 cmbs. Results Animal bones recovered from 41TR203 during testing by ACI were analyzed. All bones were identified through use of the analyst’s private faunal collection, use of loan specimens from the University of Tennessee’s Department of Anthropology’s Vertebrate Comparative Skeletal Collection, and assorted identification manuals (Balkwill and Cumbaa 1992, Jacobson 2004). Taxonomic classification for mammals follows Schmidly (1994). As not all of the animal bone was identifiable beyond class, size categories were used to differentiate the various bones for analytical purposes. The categories included large mammal (e.g., bison, cattle, horse, etc.), medium-large mammal (e.g., deer, antelope, pig, etc.), medium mammal (e.g., dog, raccoon, etc.), small mammal (e.g., rabbit, prairie dog, opossum, etc.), and

The total vertebrate number of identified specimens (NISP) recovered from the site during testing was 1073, of which 1060 (98.8%) were identifiable to class. The dominate class of vertebrate represented in the assemblages was mammal accounting for 1059 (99.9%) of the bones identifiable to class. Amphibians, with 1 bone (0.1%) identifiable to class, accounted for the only other class of remains present. A detailed account of taxa identified and the NISP for each taxa are listed in Table 1. The minimum number of individuals (MNI) for most taxa recovered from the site is 1. The only exception is Odocoileus sp. (deer) with an MNI of 3. Table 1. Species Distribution for 41TR203.

Data collected in addition to identification of element and species included any human modification to the bone (i.e., cuts, chops, other modification such as percussion points for bone fracturing, or thermal alteration) and any taphonomic alterations (i.e., carnivore or rodent gnawing or evidence for consumption, root etching, and degree of weathering of the bone) Additionally, any characteristics on the bone identifying an animal’s age (e.g., epiphyseal union, tooth eruption or wear, etc.) or sex (e.g., antlers, morphometric characteristics, etc.) were recorded if present. Overall, cut marks were identifiable on 4 bones, chop marks on 1 bone, 4 bones had evidence for other human modification such as percussion points for bone fracturing, and a total of 53 bones had been thermally modified. Of the burned bone, 34 had some browning, 9 were blackened, and 10 had been calcined. Brown discoloration is indicative of short-term and lower heat burning, such as exposure to a grass fire or camp fire for less than 6 minutes (Lyman 1994). Blackened bone has been carbonized and would indicate prolonged exposure to a grass fire or camp fire. Grey and white bone has been fully calcined, which means that it has lost all organic matter and become plastically deformed. Some of the brown thermal alteration is similar to that the analyst has seen on other assemblages such as 41DL436. The browning in that instance was indicative of an indirect heat source, such as a heated rock, that had been placed on green bone searing it and causing micro-fractures while weakening the bone. The hypothesis was that this facilitated easier bone breakage for marrow extraction on long bones. There was only minor evidence for carnivore modification (n=5) and no evidence for rodent gnawing of the bone. Some human and animal modifications, however, may have been obscured due to high root etching on the bone. While specific numbers were not recorded, the majority of the bone exhibited extensive root etching. The bones were examined for signs of breakage and weathering. Fifteen bones (1.4% of the assemblage) were complete and unbroken. The degree of weathering to which a bone had been subjected was recorded for each bone. Degree of weathering was recorded following Lyman’s (1994) synthesis of Behrensmeyer (1978), Andrews (1990), and Johnson (1985). The weathering scale consisted of rankings from 0 to 5 where 0 equals a bone with some flesh still attached and 5 would be a bone with large splinters which is disintegrating. Typically, all archeological material would be minimally assigned a 2 or 3 ranking. The majority (n=1052, 98%) of the bone recovered from 41TR203 was assigned a ranking of 3. Only 31 bones were assigned to a ranking of 4. Additionally, while most of the bone exhibited a break of some kind, the fragments were in general larger and more identifiable as is evidenced by the low ratio of bones assigned as indeterminate vertebrate Recommendations Given the preservation and overall ability to identify and quantify the remains, further research at the site is recommended. While species diversity at the site was very low, with a high concentration of focus on deer-sized and bison-sized artiodactyls, there is still research potential

at the site. The presence of bison, and the timeframe for its availability and use are still relatively unknown in the North Texas area due to poor preservation in the region. While not diverse, the preservation of the bone is good and the potential to identify the presence of bison and antelopewithin a stratified and datable context could supplement recent information from other nearby sites, such as the Fish Creek Slough Site (41DL436) in Dallas County. Notably, while bison and antelope (grassland species) were identified, none of the deer bone identifiable to species was mule deer. Only white-tailed deer, a riparian and woodland species, was present. The data would provide information on regional shifts in environmental conditions and regional subsistence strategies, especially with regards to the presence of prairie versus woodland species. Furthermore, the presence of browning on some of the bone at spiral fracture locations on the bone is potentially indicative of intentional localized heating of the bone to facilitate breakage and marrow extraction. Further research and larger samples may provide additional support for this butchering technique. Therefore, additional knowledge could be gained through further recovery and analysis of faunal material from the site.

APPENDIX D BURNED EARTH REPORT

## Page 705

Analysis of the Burnt Earth Assemblage Recovered from 41TR203 Charles D. Frederick In most archeological reports one would expect that a report with this title would discuss ceramics. That would be appropriate given that the English word “ceramic” derives from the Greek word keramos which means “burnt earth” (McLaren and Cao 2009). But pottery is not the subject of this chapter. Instead this section delves into the more mundane but substantially murkier issue of burnt earth that is a common constituent of prehistoric occupation excavations, especially common at sites situated on clayey sediment surfaces, which are debatable of human agency. These objects, which may comprise a substantial collection all by themselves, are rarely examined and reported in detail because they are often thought not to be intentional artifacts, but rather incidental byproducts of human occupations. They are commonly counted and weighed, and then summarily lumped into the category of things created by accident when using hearths or other thermal features. A few studies plotted the spatial distribution of burned clay with respect to other artifacts (e.g., Gaddus et al. 2006) but this treatment is uncommon. Indeed, the background literature search for this project identified almost no studies that described and interpreted these burnt earth objects. The objects in this assemblage are the subject of examination here in part because of petrographic observations made during the geoarchaeological study conducted by Frederick and McKee (n.d.). Of the few micromorphology samples examined during that study, one examined a fragment of burnt earth in Feature 20 that upon microscopic evaluation appeared to not simply be burnt site matrix, but rather tempered clay, which implies human agency in construction, not merely incidental heating of the substrate as the object was anticipated to be when observed in the field. The presence of baked clay with a clearly coarser textured temper resembled in some ways fiber impressed fragments of burnt clay found at 41DL203 (Tinsley et al. 2011), although examination of the morphology of the micromorphology sample was not possible. The original research design for this study called for an assessment of the assemblage, comparison with similar material from sites in Tarrant and surrounding counties, and then petrographic and computer assisted tomographic (CAT scans) examination of a small number of specimens. Owing to an advanced reporting timeline, the petrographic and CAT scans could not be completed. What follows is a review of the effects of heat on earthen materials and substrates, a brief discussion of types of burnt earth objects commonly found in Texas archaeology, and an interpretive summary of the types of materials observed in the assemblage from 41TR203. THE EFFECTS OF HEAT ON CLAYEY SEDIMENTS The effects of heat on earthen materials, especially clay, are well understood. In a discussion of the evidence of fire in the distant past, Aldeias (2017) differentiates between direct and indirect combustion residues. Direct residues consist of those that are created by burning and comprise things like ash, charcoal, siliceous aggregates of phytoliths, calcined bone or dung spherules. Indirect combustion residues consist of things, artifacts or sediments, altered by elevated temperatures associated with fire. Typical indirect proxies of fires include thermally altered artifacts (lithics, bones, shells, seeds, etc.) or deposits (earthen materials mixed with fuel, or the substrate beneath a fire that was heated by it). Granted, Aldeias’ goal was to closely examine what

## Page 706

types of evidence can be used to identify human use of fire in the distant past (the Paleolithic), and so she did not consider artifacts made by thermal alteration such as pottery. But one can easily expand to include a third category, artifacts intentionally and directly exposed to heat, such as pottery vessels and other nonvessel burnt clay objects such as figurines, pipes, and earspools. The effects of heat on earthen materials have been widely and extensively documented, largely in association with the production and analysis of pottery. Although it is possible to go into considerable detail on this subject the two principal attributes worth considering here are changes in color and changes in hardness. It is well known that heating of earthen materials often results in color changes, be they rocks (e.g., Lintz 1989), concrete (Hager 2014), clay (Rice 2015) or earth under hearths (Aldeias et al. 2016). The changes in color are typically either the development of red color, black or both. Color Changes: Reddening (aka Rubification) It is widely accepted that the development of red color is due to the oxidation of iron-rich minerals, specifically the transformation of goethite which is typically brown or yellow colored, to hematite which is red (Canti and Linford 2000; Röpke and Dietl 2017), but as Mentzer (2014) notes, in certain situations common iron minerals like goethite may transform to other minerals like maghemite, which is black or brown, and substrates lacking iron minerals may not discolor at all. Reddening (or Rubification) is one of the most common effects of heat on earthen materials and as such it is often considered a proxy for the location of a fire when found in a deposit, be the source of the fire a burnt tree stump, or a hearth. The development of a reddened layer under a hearth is thought to be a function of the sediment texture, the maximum temperature and duration of the fire, and the organic matter content of the deposit (Aldeias 2017; Aldeias et al. 2016; Canti and Linford 2000; Mallol et al. 2013). The development of black color in some heated materials is thought to be due to incomplete oxidation of organic matter (Backhouse et al. 2005; De Atley 1980; Lintz 1989), but as noted earlier it could also indicate the production of maghemite. Changes in Hardness Beyond changes in color, heating induces hardening of the earth by sintering, and melting. Detailed discussions of these changes can be found in numerous books on pottery (e.g., Rice 2015). Röpke and Dietl (2017:174) define sintering as “the formation of a solid mass from a fine-grained aggregate at temperatures below the melting point” and this occurs at lower temperatures than melting which generally happens above 1300˚C (5432°F). It is hardening that undoubtedly draws the attention of excavators who are often confronted with soil that will not pass through the screen easily, and if an increase in hardness is accompanied by a color change, such materials are generally declared to be burnt clay, regardless of the actual particle size of the material.

BURNT CLAY OBJECTS COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED IN TEXAS ARCHAEOLOGY As noted in the introduction, there are generally few details to be found on this class of possible artifact in the literature. The exception to this generalization are burnt clay balls that were used as a proxy for rock as thermal storage devices in cooking features in rock poor regions. Clay Balls (aka Burned Clay Nodules, Burnt Clay Lumps, Baked Clay Balls) There appear to be two regions of Texas where faux rocks such as these appear: the coast, and near Dallas. The best known of these are along the Texas coast (Campbell 1976; Dockall and Black 2006; Patterson 1996; Ricklis and Albert 2005; Turpin 2004, 2014) where large numbers of fist sized and smaller rounded burnt clay balls are found on occupation surfaces and in features. Curiously, such objects are also known from the Dallas region, albeit perhaps less than the coastal variety (Crook 2009; Lorrain 2012; Tinsley et al. 2011). The Texas version of this cooking technology pale in comparison to those found at Poverty Point in Louisiana, where this approach to cooking without rock approached an art. There, burnt clay was formed into distinct geometrical shapes referred to as Poverty Point Objects that were then used to cook food (Hunter 1976). Burnt Mud Plastered Thatch A much less common form of burnt clay, and still very debatable are objects of burnt clay that are fiber or grass impressed on one side. Such objects have been reported by Thurmond and Kleinschmidt (1979:26–27) at the George C. Davis Site and by Tinsley et al. (2011) at 41DL203. Although the origin of such objects is not entirely clear, it is likely that they represent burnt mud plaster that had been applied to a grass thatched roof. Mud applied in this manner is intended to make the roof resistant to leaking, and often had the side benefit of reducing the fire hazard of such structures. Vernacular houses with mud plastered thatch roofing have been described from various cultures such as the Mojave in Arizona (Shufeldt 1892), Mississippian groups at Bynam Mounds (USDOI 2018), and as far afield as the Cholistan in Pakistan, and East India. Shufeldt (1892) described houses made by the Mojave in Arizona that were timber framed houses with roofs thatched with long prairie grass and plastered with a thick coat of mud. Gilchrist (1825:232–235) describes the plastering of grass thatch roofs with mud as a protection against heavy rain as well as providing protection from fire. Closer to Texas, the prehistoric houses documented at Bynam mounds near Tupelo Mississippi have been described as circular timber houses with willow or reed stems woven into them and then plastered with mud. And the Mill Creek Culture of Iowa lived in timber houses with thatched grass roofing and clay/mud plaster (Larsen 2010). THE BURNT EARTH ASSEMBLAGE AT 41TR203 The entire assemblage consisting of 144 lots, and slightly more than 3300 specimens was examined in order to form an impression of the range of items present. The vast majority of these objects were reddened, typically expressing a 7.5 YR Munsell hue, and some exhibited a carbon core (only visible on those that had been broken or abraded; samples were not broken to check the interior color). A few samples presented an achromatic gray color (clearly hardened but not red) but such

specimens were rare. All were fairly hard (no attempt was made to examine their resistance to rupture). While examining the burnt clay, notes were made on their shape and surface features. The vast majority of these objects were variations on the form of blocks, with the most common shapes resembling the soil structural form called subangular blocky. A few specimens exhibiting angular blocky forms were present as well, but were less common. The second most common form was rounded or subrounded blocks, and the third most common shape was plates. The resemblance of many of these to soil pedology is undoubtedly more than a coincidence, and it is likely that these features result from thermal alteration of the substrate and preserved the natural soil aggregates present at the time of the occupation. The rounded forms are a bit more perplexing. None of the soil structure at the site presented such forms, and perhaps these are either less-well hardened fragments, or alternatively, items that were removed from features like hearths when removing ash and were then rounded while exposed on the occupation surface. Although the shape of the objects was often telling, the surface features of the objects were much more tantalizing yet mysterious. Many specimens exhibited one or more relatively flat facets. These could be divided into those facets that were abraded, flat ped faces, flat faces striated with linear impressions (presumed to be either roots or grass), and more enigmatic forms that were typically quite smooth. The smooth surfaces were often either concave (most common) or convex, and on rare occasion complete fragments made clear the ultimate origin of some of these features. The clearest of these were abraded facets that are the result of screening. Some of the flat facets were most likely pedologic faces perhaps made flat by shrink-swell processes in the soil. The smooth surfaces, typically either convex or concave, are suspected to be trace fossils of insect activity, associated with insects that resided in the soil underground (see Genise 2017 for a variety of examples). One ellipsoidal internal cast is most likely a wasp cocoon; it appeared to match the smooth concave surface also found in the same lot. Exceptions to this generalization are the nests of mud daubers, which were most likely attached to fuel wood that was combusted in a thermal feature, thereby firing the earth and preserving the nest for perpetuity. The facets with parallel linear grooves, presumed to be impressions of plants, are most enigmatic. These fragments were uncommon, typically very thin (<1 cm) which would be quite thin for a plaster, especially over what one assumes would be a fairly irregular surface. In the literature, most authors cite the presence of a temper as evidence of human agency and none of the items appeared to be tempered. The evaluation of temper within the specimens is an ongoing process. SUMMARY The majority of the burnt earth assemblage at 41TR203 consists of material burned in place, an accidental by-product of human occupation. Some of the more enigmatic features are most likely associated with insect activity, but the most curious are those with parallel linear grooves that resemble grass impressions. But most of these are quite thin and appear to be improbable candidates for plaster over a thatch surface, which would have undoubtedly been somewhat rough and undulatory, requiring a relatively thick cover of mud to render it waterproof. Somewhat surprisingly, the context from which a fragment of burnt earth was petrographically examined during the first phase of work recovered very little burnt earth. It was from this context that it was

hoped that the external morphology of those materials could be examined. Unfortunately that was not the case. Following examination of the entire assemblage, there appears to be no solid evidence of burnt earth artifacts associated with earthen plaster applied to prehistoric structures, and for this reason, the analytical work aimed at analyzing such features was aborted. This is not to say that identifying attributes of enigmatic natural features (such as those created by insects) are not worth documenting in detail, but rather that this was not the goal of this analysis. It would be useful to see more in depth analysis of assemblages such as this as a means of better understanding such assemblages, and hopefully this analysis can be a first step in that direction.
