It formed 2300 to 1000 yr BP and is a local equivalent of the Copan paleosol that is present throughout the southern US Great Plains. Stable carbon isotopes indicate that the paleosol and underlying gray clay formed under vegetation dominated by C species (mean δ13C: −18.3 ± 0.3‰). Diverse paleoenvironmental 4 studies indicate that the period of paleosol formation was cool and wet and that alluvial water-tables were high, resulting in broad wet meadows across alluvial valleys, characterized by communities of grasses. Present-day wet meadows and bottomlands with Mollisols with A-C profiles along streams in the Great Plains are dominated by C tallgrass species and may serve as analogues to wet-meadow environments during the late Holocene. A shift in 4 climate to warm-dry conditions about 1000 yr BP was accompanied by deep channel cutting, low alluvial water-tables, and colonization of abandoned floodplains by trees and other C species, as indicated by a change in carbon isotopes to lower values (mean δ13C: −20.8 ± 0.5‰) and correlating with 3 the ‘Medieval Warm Period’. Other stable carbon isotope studies from late-Holocene alluvium in Texas have been mistakenly interpreted as evidence for paleoenvironmental conditions opposite to those presented in this investigation. We conclude that interpretations of stable carbon isotopes from alluvium based on broad patterns of upland C grasses and climate can be in error, especially in cases where wet-meadow deposits and soils are present. 4 Keywords alluvium, Copan paleosol, late Holocene, ‘Medieval Warm Period’, stable carbon isotopes, US Great Plains, wet meadows Introduction In the southern US Great Plains, Holocene alluvial deposits are that relationship, high (less negative) values of δ13C have been thick and contain a variety of buried soils.

The gravel is not directly dated although the overlying yellow clay is c. 3000 14C yr BP; the gravel is probably middle Holocene. Yellow clay. The yellow clay (yellowish brown, 10YR 5/6) is about 1 m thick and rests directly on the cemented gravel with which it has a sharp boundary. It is silty and sandy, massive with no bedding, calcareous with faint carbonate filaments in the lower 30 cm, and contains occasional small isolated rounded limestone pebbles. Bulk sediment from the lower 12 cm of the yellow clay has a conventional radiocarbon age of 2910 ± 60 14C yr BP, the earliest age in the geomorphic study (Table 2). The yellow clay may have been more extensive in the local late-Holocene valley fill but is now eroded. West Fork paleosol and gray clay The West Fork paleosol was named from exposures along the West Fork of the Trinity River, central Tarrant Co., Texas (Ferring, 1986). Subsequent studies along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River show that the West Fork paleosol is a prominent basin-wide soil- geomorphic feature (Ferring, 1987). In our investigation along the Clear Fork of the Trinity River, the West Fork paleosol is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy to clayey silt (Figure 2). Its dark color distinguishes it from older and younger floodplain alluvium in the field. Its thickness ranges from 59 to 152 cm and averages about 85 cm. The paleosol has 37–45% silt and 25–28% clay (Table 1). High amounts of organic carbon are found in the paleosol, ranging from 0.79 to 1.10%, with higher percentages occurring in the upper 40 cm. The upper 40 cm is slightly darker in the field, probably related to higher organic carbon content. The paleosol is massive, lacking any evidence of primary bedding. The slow sedimentation rate, estimated about 0.80 mm/yr from its thickness and radiocarbon age, coupled with bioturbation by burrowing insects, snails, and earthworms, has resulted in the obliteration of primary microsedimentary layers; earthworm traces are especially common. The cumulic paleosol is largely devoid of pedogenic features, such as clay films and peds. The paleosol lacks a B horizon. Also, redoximorphic features, such as mottles and iron concentrations, are absent from the lower part of the paleosol and underlying gray and yellow clays. The paleosol sediments are strongly calcareous, ranging from 31 to 41%, repre- senting carbonate particles derived from local limestone and marl bedrock in the drainage basin. A slight increase in percentages of carbonate occurs with greater depth in the paleosol, indicating an early stage prior to Bk development. However, visible secondary carbonates in the form of filaments along root traces are rare Figure 2. Buried West Fork paleosol, Clear Fork of the Trinity to absent and carbonate nodules are completely absent. Weak River floodplain, Tarrant County, Texas; white specks in paleosol are large shells of land snails; thin zone of granule-pebble gravel in the carbonate filaments can be abundant in the lower 15 cm of the gray clay beneath the paleosol; 1 m scale paleosol and in the underlying gray alluvium. The gray clay alluvium in which the West Fork paleosol formed is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clayey to sandy silt. 2360 ± 40 and 1630 ± 40 14C yr BP; the latter age may be a few The alluvium is massive with no primary bedding features. It is hundred years too young for the age of the clay. Occasional thin, strongly calcareous and commonly includes numerous carbonate discontinuous beds of gravel are present in the gray clay.

However, we propose that paleosol were collected for stable carbon isotope analysis. The wet meadows and associated Mollisols with A-C profiles along results from the two sections are identical (Figure 4). From both streams in the central Plains represent a modern analogue for the sections, the gray clay and West Fork paleosol have a mean late-Holocene West Fork paleosol.
