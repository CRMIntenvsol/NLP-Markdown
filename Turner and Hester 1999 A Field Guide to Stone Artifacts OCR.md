� 2. THE MANUFACTURE � AND USE OF STONE TOOLS Crucial to the study of projectile points and other stone tools is an awareness of the manufacturing techniques used to produce them. Similarly, we must ask questions about how cer­ tain stone tool forms functioned in the daily life of ancient Indian cultures. Both areas of inquiry play a major role in modern archaeology. Lithic technology is the study of stone tools, from the initial stages of manufacture through completion, use of the tool in various ways and its eventual discard. A great deal of atten­ tion has been given to tool manufacture; archaeologists now ana­ lyze the thousands of waste flakes found at occupation sites, look­ ing for clues to the manufacturing process; others have become experts at replication, the experimental production of stone tools using ancient techniques. Stone tool function is another major concern within lithic tech­ nology. Archaeologists formerly labeled tools "knives" or "scrap­ ers" based on a subjective appraisal of their shape or form. Now, we have developed sophisticated techniques of microscopic analysis that reveal minute traces of wear-and these wear pat­ terns are often diagnostic of specific tool functions. Coupled with microwear studies are experiments in actual tool use-the butchering of a deer with stone flakes, making a spearthrower with a stone scraper--designed both to see how a specific tool form actually works under "primitive" conditions and to exam­ ine the microscopic traces of wear produced under controlled experimentation. 11

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians Making Chipped Stone Tools The manufacture of stone tools is a subtractive process, a sys­ tematic reduction of a piece of stone designed to achieve a desired shape. The sequence of events that results in a finished stone tool leaves a great deal of waste debris in the archaeo­ logical record; however, even this material can be analyzed as a source of information on the ancient tool-making process. The raw material for stone tool making varies across the state, although the most common is chert or "flint." Other rocks and minerals that can be fractured so that shapes and sharp edges can be produced include chalcedony, quartz and quartzite, jasper, basalt and petrified wood. Obsidian, a volcanic glass, does not occur in artifact-quality form in Texas, and its presence on archaeological sites is indicative of ancient trade. Hester et al. Figure 2 1.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians (1985, 1991a) have documented obsidian from Mexico, New Mexico, Idaho, and \Vyoming at Texas sites, utilizing techniques such as X-ray fluorescence and neutron activation analysis. Once the geologic source has been chemically characterized, the obsidian of which an artifact is made can be "fingerprinted" and linked back to its source. Hester et al. ( 1985) found that a Clo­ vis-age biface from Kincaid Rockshelter ( 41U V2) was made of El Paraiso obsidian, from the Mexican state of Queretaro 600 miles to the southwest. As Hester et al. ( 1991 a) have noted, obsidian from the Malad source in southeastern Idaho is wide­ spread in Texas, especially at Late Prehistoric sites along the Balcones Escarpment. This may be reflective of a north-south trade network out of the Plains. Sites along the Colorado River in San Saba and Llano counties have also yielded pieces of obsidian, many of these linked to the Obsidian Cliff source at Yellowstone Park, Wyoming. New Mexico obsidian is scat­ tered across the state. Hester et al. (1991b) documented Late Archaic obsidian artifacts at Arenosa Shelter ( 41 VV99) in the Lower Pecos. The obsidian was from the Cerro de Toledo source in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico. Another source in that same area, Cerro del Medio, is also widespread in Texas. Obsidian artifacts are particularly common in the Texas Panhandle and most are attributable to interaction between Pueblo and Plains Native American groups in Late Pre­ historic times. Cherts and other cryptocrystalline materials occur in the form of seams, ledges, nodules and cobbles at various outcrops in different parts of the state. The serious lithic researcher should obtain a copy of Banks (1 990), the only available comprehen­ sive study of stone tool resources in Texas and adjacent states (see also Holliday and Welty 1981). Fig. 2-2 shows the location of some of the major lithic resources in Texas, as described by Banks (1990). Some of these resources are widespread, such as the Catahoula Formation, with quartzites and petrified woods (from the overlying Fleming Formation). The Uvalde Gravels, usually small lag gravels of chert, quartz, quartzite, jasper, limestone and silicified wood, occur widely in the state and are especially common in South Texas, where they cap the hills and high terraces (Hester 1975). Along the Rio Grande, the "Rio Grande Gravels" con- 14

·Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians cherts, often a fine-grained grey to brown material, and there are many quarry locales where these were procured by the ancient peoples of that region (McGraw and Valdez 1978; Katz 1987; Daniel R. Potter, personal communication). In the Georgetown area, there is a dark gray to blue chert of exceed­ ingly good quality, used extensively in prehistoric times and sought today by flintknappers. In the Junction area, a "root-beer colored translucent chert" (Banks 1990:60) is often found in archaeological sites and ancient quarry exposures. The Llano Uplift, or Central Mineral Region, of central Texas contains some distinctive cherts, but was also used in ancient times for the procurement of serpentine and soapstone and granites used locally for milling implements. The Trans-Pecos, including the Big Bend, has several chert sources. One of the best known is the "Burro Mesa" material (Banks 1990:84), a colorful chert with variegated red, brown, white colors, often striped or mottled. The Caballos Novaculite (lbid.:85) of West Texas yields a chert, glassy in texture, and blue, gray to green in color. A white novaculite is also present, and Banks (1 990:86) reports that it encompasses the whole 1200-ft high north face of Caballos Mountain. On the Llano Estacado, the most famous raw material source is Alibates, found along the Canadian River. Many of the major quarries are now part of a national monument. This "chert" (agatized dolomite) ranges in color from white, yellow, red or purple--often mottled or striped combinations. It is known to have been procured for stone tools beginning in Paleo-Indian times, and widely traded in the Plains and in Texas (e.g., Mallouf and Wulfkuhle I 991 report a cache of Alibates cores and bifaces in southwestern Kansas). The Tecovas cherts or jaspers occur near Quitaque and into Oldham County, not far from Alibates, and are sometimes con­ fused with it. They have color combinations or ranges of white, yellow, red, and brown-often characterized by white speckles (A. J. Taylor, personal communication). In north central Texas, the Callahan Divide, just north of the Edwards Plateau, is the source of high quality light gray to blue­ gray cherts. These occur in lenses and nodules in that area (Banks 1990). 16

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians chert and quartzite gravels in the San Angelo area (Banks 1990). In some areas, where chert or quartzite was not of the best quality for faking, the prehistoric Indians would subject the cob­ bles to heat treatment. This could consist of baking the mate­ rials in the coals of a campfire for up to 48 hours. Most often, the chert would change in microcrystalline structure, making it easier to chip; heat treating is evident in some areas of the state: ¾ actual size Figure 2-4. Cores.

The Manufacture and Use of Stone Tools it produces a pink to purple discoloration of the chert, along with a vitreous "greasy" appearance (Hester and Collins 197 4) . Thus, in order to initiate the making of a stone tool, the pre­ historic knapper had to find the right type of stone, and some­ times had to alter it through heat treatment, before beginning to work it. The subsequent reduction process that resulted in the manufacture of a tool could take several different trajectories (Patterson 1977; Tunnell 1978; Fox et al. 1974).

The Manufacture and Use of Stone Tools in the manufacture of a bijace (especially a dart point), a core was formed by strikingflakes off a cobble using a hammerstone percussion technique (see figs. 2-l and 2-4 through 2-8). The first flake removed from the cobble created a plaiform, and by directing percussion blows at the edge of the platform, additional flakes were detached from the sides of the core. Ideally, the knapper was looking for a flake of appropriate size and thickness for fur­ ther reduction into a bifacial point. First, however, the exterior surface (cortex) of the core had to be faked away, creating dis­ tinctive primary cortex flakes. Further chipping produced sec ondary flakes, showing both earlier flake removals and traces of remaining cortex (fig. 2-9). Finally, interior flakes, with no remaining surface cortex, could be struck off, and one of appropriate size selected for further work. Bifacial chipping·� removing small flakes on both sides by striking at the edges of the flake�proceeded using hammerstone or billet percussion. It was then a question of continued thinning and shaping of the flake, leading to final completion of a point. Very often, the knapper would make a mistake or would encounter a flaw in the chert. The partly completed specimen would be discarded. These abortive efforts at tool-making are, of course, preserved shape flake into biface by percussion complete point by (blank and preform) pressure flaking Figure 27 continued. 21

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians in archaeological sites and represent "fossilized" stages in bifa­ cial reduction. Archaeologists once simply described these as "knives" or put certain shapes into specific "point" types, not reaiizing that they were looking at part of a process. The larger, thick bifaces at the beginning of the process are often called blanks ( or quarry blanks; fig. 2-10). They often have cor­ tex on one or both surfaces, particularly instead of reducing a core and picking proper-sized flakes, the knapper chose to reduce a tabular cobble with the intention of chipping it into a finished product (fig. 2-7). The "quarry blanks" (fig. 10), which are often large and crudely flaked, are characteristic of quarry and lithic process- ¾ actual size Figure 2-10.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians ing sites found at raw material outcrops. Sometimes, the thin­ ner, better made blanks were collected and buried in "caches"-­ items perhaps hidden away for future use or being transported as part of a trade network. These "cache bifaces" (fig. 2-1 often in groups of 30 or more specimens-are intri ing, as their gu reasons for their deposition in caches reflects ancient behaviors which we know little about (Miller, ms.; Bement 1991a). Cur­ J. tis D. Tunnell and Robert Mallouf, of the Texas Historical Commission, have been doing studies of such caches through­ out the state, as has Kevin Miller at The University of Texas at Austin (see also Fields et al. 1991a , 1991 b). Sometimes, the large, thin blanks occur as single specimens found at a considerable distance from the raw material source. These can be described as "trade blanks" (fig. 2-l 2), having entered into other areas through prehistoric trade (see Hester and Barber 1990). Such large bifaces also sometimes end up in mortuary offerings, as documented by Taylor and Highley (ms.) at the Loma Sandia (4 lLK28) Archaic cemetery in South Texas. If, however, the biface blank continued to be thinned and reduced in a lithic reduction sequence, it entered a stage that we call a preform (fig. 2-l 0). While preforms may themselves go through several stages, they are generally fairly thin and approach the shape and size needed for the final artifact. Indeed, when the preform has been thinned as much as possi­ ble by hammerstone percussion (or, in some areas, by percus­ sion with antler cylinder-hammers or billets), pressure-flaking with a deer antler tine (fig. 2-l) is used to finish and straighten the edges and to form the notches and stem that serve to com­ plete the projectile point. The classification of preforms presents a number of problems. Some of the projectile point types that we describe in a following section of the book are probably pre­ forms (the Almagre specimens may be unfinished Langtry points; Pandora and Refugio may not be valid types at all, but rather pre­ forms for several different point styles!). Thus, in assigning types when sorting a large stone tool collection, the archaeol­ ogist has to view the whole range of chipped stone lithics with an eye to the tool-making process. Specimens that may be pre­ forms have to be examined for evidence as to why they were 26

See fig. 2-13). Additionally, the archaeologist learns to recognize spe­ cific types of breakage patterns that are the result of fractures caused during the reduction process.

A f"ield Guide to Stone Artifacts, Second Edition flakes known as blades (figs. 2-9 and 2-14), yet some go through a preform phase. And, if the point is never completed, the archaeologist recovers tiny, arrow point-sized preforms at the prehistoric camp site (fig. 15). Again, if the reduction process is not kept in mind, some of these preforms may erroneously be classified as arrow point "types" (for example, the "Granbury" type defined in central Texas in the 1960s, or perhaps the Cliffion and Young points described below). Making a uniface, a stone tool chipped on one face (see chap­ ter 5), is not as complex as biface reduction. A core is reduced and selected flakes used for uniface manufacture. Some unifaces, typically called scrapers, are fairly casually made, with an edge formed by chipping along one side of a flake. Others reflect much more care, both in the selection of a proper flake and in careful chipping to form the working edges and to achieve a desired shape. End scraper unifaces are particularly character­ istic of this kind of careful treatment, often being made on long flakes or blades. On occasion, unifaces or blades destined for uni­ face manufacture have been found, like biface blanks, stored or hidden away as caches (for example, the Gibson cache in Coke County, reported in Tunnell 1978, and the Brookeen Creek cache in Hill County, described in Mallouf 198 la).

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians The finished artifact, be it point or scraper, has a "life span" during which it may undergo modifications that will significantly alter its shape. Some specimens which we classify as projectile points may, like the Kinnry type, actually have been used as knives. Use of the cutting edge causes dulling, and the edge then has to be rechipped or beveled, often giving the specimen a dif­ ferent shape. (A bevel is a steeply angled edge, usually on a biface edge, that usually results from resharpening of that edge.) See also Patterson and Sollberger 1990. Examples of reworking or resharpening of formal lithic tools are common in Texas. For example, the two-and-four beveled knives (pp. 274-276) were extensively resharpened during use, often causing changes in overall outline. The so-called Meserve points (p. 154) may be little more than Plainview, Golondrina or Dalton points that have been extensively reworked, either because of breakage or because they were used as knives and resharp­ ened. Goodyear (1974:29) has done a study of Dalton points and records the different shapes that they take as they are resharp­ ened and modified during use. Sometimes a projectile point was broken by impact when it hit a bone in an animal carcass or missed its target, striking the ground. Perhaps rather than removing the point from the shaft, the broken tip was rechipped, producing a distinctly different shape for the distal end (see the examples under Pedernales, p. 171-173). The projectile point stems often were fractured or bro­ ken and could have conceivably been reworked. Flenniken and Raymond ( 1986) and Flenniken and Wilke ( 1989) have used experimental data on stem breakage and subsequent stem reworking as an argument against the utility of point types as time markers in the Great Basin (Bettinger, O'Connell and Thomas (1991) present a very different view, arguing that these experimental data do not change the archaeologically observ­ able evidence that point forms do indeed change through time.) Our experience in excavating and analyzing projectile point forms, especially in central Texas, indicates that stem shapes were important (for whatever reason) to the prehistoric peoples and that a great deal of attention was given to stem detail. When stems were broken and reworked, the ancient craftsman seemed intent on restoring their original shape (the "mental template" concept that we discussed earlier in terms of our typological 31

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians approach). Of course, in the analysis of hundreds of points from a site, there are always a number whose stems or other attrib­ utes do not permit classification; these may either be unrecog­ nized types, unique specimens, or the reworking of a stem in a casual fashion. As is clear on preforms from central Texas, the careful shaping of the stem-on a biface or large flake blank-preceded the completion of the point (see Hester 1988a). This certainly suggests that standardized stem shape or form was important in prehistoric Texas point-making technologies. ¾ actual size Figure 2-16.

The Manufacture and Use of Stone Tools The completed artifact was often hafted for use. This is obvious with the projectile points; the shape of their stem often reflects how they were inserted and bound on a spear or arrow shaft. Archaeologically, we can see examples of hafting from pre­ served specimens found in lower Pecos caves. Figure 2-16 shows a hafted Langtry point and a hafted T(!Y ah point. Hafting the specimen on a shaft may require binding with cordage or application of a gummy resin (as with the Langtry point in fig. 2-16) or use of natural tar or asphaltum. The latter is seen on the bases of lvforhiss dart points from Victoria and Goliad coun­ ties. Some large, thin, triangular bifaces were hafted as knives, as in the illustrated example from the Cueva de la Candelaria burial cave in southwest Coahuila, Mexico (fig. 2-1 7). The biface base was set into a shallow notch in the wooden handle and secured in place with pine resin. Of course, some bifaces were hand-held during use; an example is the butted knife, chipped so that it would fit easily in the palm of the hand. Unifaces, too, were usually hafted, although some large gouges and scrapers may have been hand-held. We often see efforts at thinning the end of the uniface, such as an end scraper, opposite the thick working end, suggesting that it was to be inserted into a haft. Tiny end scrapers had to be hafted, especially those used in such tasks as working bison hide. Many of these may have been inserted in L-shaped handles of the kind used by Plains Indians in early historic times (Wedel 1970; Met­ calf 1970). Others may have been placed at the end of long straight handles, as is the example in figure 2-18 from a south­ west Coahuila, Mexico, cave. Casually chipped unifaces or edge-trimmed flakes were, somewhat surprisingly, also hafted at times. There are surviving examples from the dry caves of the lower Pecos region, including a tiny flake hafted in a split sotol stem and a pointed, trimmed uniface set into a socket in the middle of a short wooden handle (see fig. 2-19). Some haft­ ing may have been informal, simply wrapping the end of a flake or uniface with a strip of leather or a plant leaf, to keep it from cutting one's hand during use.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians parts of Texas, where preservation is usually poor, we have to keep in mind that tools were probably hafted in a variety of ways (for further examples from the western United States, see Heizer 1970; Hester 1970b, 1974). Some further comments are offered here regarding the occur­ rence of blades and blade cores in Texas archaeological sites. Exam­ ples are illustrated in figs. 2-20, 2-21 and 2-22. A blade is a long, parallel-edged flake resulting from intentional removal (by per­ cussion) from a specially prepared blade core. Blade-like flakes sometimes occur in the flake technologies so common in Texas, but here we are describing a specialized core-blade technology. Such a technology can be seen in the Late Prehistoric in Texas, along the coast (Hester and Shafer 1975) and in the Toyah Phase of central Texas (Green and Hester l 973; see fig. 2). On the coast, blade-making may have been an efficient way to use scarce chert resources. In the Toyah Phase, blades were used in making Perdi;:, points (Green and Hester 1973: Fig. 2) and uni­ facial end scrapers (Ibid.:Fig. 5). However, recent studies have shown that core-blade tech­ nology was important in Clovis times, l l ,200 years ago. Green (1963) initially reported a cache of Clovis blades from Black­ water Draw, the Clovis type site. In addition, Young and ½ actual size Figure 2-19. Hqfied Unifacial Toolfiom the Lower Pecos.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians Collins ( 1989) describe a cache of Clovis blades found near the Trinity River in Navarro County (fig. 2-21 ). The specialized blade cores from which these have been removed are noted by Collins (1990) from the Kincaid rockshelter (41UV2), 41LL3 in Llano County, and 4lGLl 75 in Gillespie County. Another Clovis blade core was excavated by Hester and Collins in 1991 at the Gault site (4 lBL323) in central Texas (fig. 2-22). The dis­ tinctly curved Clovis blades (fig. 2-2 l) and the polyhedral, prepared-platform blade cores are traits of the Clovis cultural pattern that will surely be recognized at more and more sites across the state. 0 2cm Figure 2-21.

stone Artifacts of Texas Indians Determining the Function of Stone Tools Over the past two decades, there has been intensive archae­ ological research directed at scientific determination of tool func­ tion. Many early typologies of stone tools were based largely on tool shape and the function such shape suggested (knife, scraper, chopper, gouge). Spurred largely by the pioneering efforts of Semenov ( 1964), archaeologists have developed ways of ascer­ taining the actual function of a prehistoric tool. Most investi­ gations have combined microscopic examination of tool edges with experimental use of tools in various tasks required of pre­ historic cultures. Microscopic investigations, called wear pattern studies, have led to the recognition of specific traces of ancient tool use-­ polish resulting from cutting meat or soft plants, scratches or striations linked to scraping hides and crushing of the edges from cutting bone or scraping wood. Some of this wear can be observed under low-power microscopes (up to 7 5X); some can only be seen or interpreted under high-power microscopes (I ,OOOX). Some research has even been done with powerful scan­ ning electron microscopes (10,000X). \Vear pattern research indi­ cates that some tools had specific tasks, while others were used for many activities, as a pocket-knife would be used today. \Ve have learned that some artifacts thought to be projectile points were actually used as knives and vice versa. Some "scraper" uni­ faces were used as cutting and slicing tools. "Gouge" bifaces sometimes functioned as adzes in woodworking. In many cases, we cannot immediately interpret the observed wear patterns; this requires controlled experiments with stone tools on wood, hide and plants, with subsequent microscopic study of the experi­ mental edge to see what kind of wear resulted. Although great progress has been made in this type of study in recent years (Keeley 1980), it still remains more an art than a science and requires many hours of intensive microscopic research. Still, it provides a way for archaeologists to understand better how tools were actually used and to sort them into meaningful func­ tional categories. Another avenue of determining tool use is through residue analysis. Shafer and Holloway (1979) have applied this technique 40

The Manufacture and Use of Stone Tools to flake tools from Hinds Cave in Val Verde County, Texas. Using analyses of organic residues still adhering to chert flakes from this d cave, they were able to determine what the flakes ry were being used for (mostly cutting and processing plants) and what types of plants were being used. Studies like this indicate that many of the stone tools of aboriginal groups were the so­ called waste flakes- the debris from tool-making. If a casual knife or scraper was needed, it seems likely that a flake was picked up, used one or twice and then discarded. Little visible evidence of use is left on the tools, although microscopic study of flake edges, and the rare and fortunate preservation of organic residues, can give us clues as to their actual function. Residues identified as asphaltum are often seen on the stems of ,\1orhiss points and on other lithics from the Texas coast. This refects the use of this natural tar in hafting the artifact. More recent studies have focused on fatty acids, or lipids, that have survived as residues on ancient artifacts. Marchbanks ( 1989) was able to recover and identify, as plant or animal, such residues from Caddoan ceramic vessels, and has done similar research with residues on stone tools. Some residues have been identified as human or animal blood (Loy 1983), although a recent review of some of these analytical procedures has raised serious question as to their validity (Manning 1991) . Needless to say, archaeological lithics from d caves are prime candidates ry for residue preservation and should not be handled or washed. It is even possible that certain kinds of residues are preserved on lithics from open sites and some archaeologists are careful not to handle or to wash stone tools as they come into the lab­ orato . The coming decade should shed much new light on this ry potentially exciting avenue of research. Obviously, if the reader encounters a stone artifact with residue, great care should be taken to preserve it. Detailed wear pattern research is desperately needed for Texas stone tools. Some good studies have been done, but more intensive work is necessary. For example, there are only a few wear pattern studies of corner-tang bifaces. These specimens elicit much interest, but six decades after they were first pub­ lished, we still do not know how they were used. Similarly, the "butted knife" bifaces of Late Archaic central Texas exhibit vis- 41

Later in the book we present a whole series of biface types (Frid , Hare, San Gabriel); are these ay "knives" as some have suggested or are they preforms? Only wear pattern research can offer a solution. The various "gouges" ( Clear Fork, Erath, Nueces) might have been used to gouge, to scrape, to adze we simply do not know (there has been sub­ stantial wear pattern study of some varieties of Clear Fork tools; see Hester, Albee and Gilbow 1973; Howard I 973; Shiner 1975; Chandler 1974).

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians shall be forced to make inferences, based on limited studies and guesswork, about the role of these tools in ancient lifeways until detailed use-wear research is carried out and published. Some prehistoric tool forms are perplexing from the stand­ point of both technology and function. Perhaps most intrigu­ ing in this regard is the burin (fig. 2-24), a form first recognized in the Texas area by Epstein (l 963). Burins had long been known in Europe (see Pitzer 1977). They are tools formed by the removal of long, narrow, sliver-like flakes (burin spalls), which create a chisel-like edge. The term burin also refers to the chip­ ping technology that forms the burin edge-·precise percussion blows often directed perpendicular to the long axis of the spec­ imen. Burins can be formed on flakes, on broken bifaces or on projectile points. Often, we do not understand why a burin was created; for example, why some Paleo-Indian points have burins at the corners of the base. Another type of burin is seen on Olmos bifaces, apparently a technique to resharpen a dulled working edge. Burins probably designed to serve as engraving or incis­ ing tools have been made on flakes found in lower Pecos caves and in central Texas (Epstein 1963; Sorrow, Shafer and Ross 1967). However, in many cases, microscopic examination of a burin indicates no evidence of use. Indeed, in many cases, the burin is actually a "core"; the knapper was after the burin spall detached during this process. Such spalls make excellent drills, especially for boring shell and other tough materials. We have not included burins in our formal descriptions, because they are found on such a wide variety of lithic artifacts, are of uncer­ tain function and may have been formed primarily for the pro­ duction of the spalls and not the burin edge itself. This is another area of stone tool technology in Texas that needs much more research. 44

� 3. CONTEXT AND CHRONOLOGY � I Stone tools occur at a variety of prehistoric archaeological sites. Just how they occur provides information on the function of the site and on the ancient activities that were carried out there. This is what we call context-the relationship of the arti­ facts to one another and to the site deposits within which they are found. In addition to contextual information, stone tools can also pro­ vide data on the age or antiquity of a site. Although they can­ not be directly dated, associated organic remains (such as wood charcoal from a hearth) can be assayed by the radiocarbon method, yielding a date for the points and tools at the same level of the hearth. Excavations can also provide relative dates, by determining which styles of artifacts are earlier or later than oth­ ers. Once a chronology is established at several regional sites, types of known dates can then be related to the same type at other sites. Gradually, a framework of prehistoric cultural pat­ terns can be built up in a sequential fashion. Many of the types described in this book are "time-sensitive"; excavation and subsequent analyses have shown that they change through time, making them valuable chronological aids for archaeological research. Context An archaeological site is, technically, any spot on the land­ scape that has been modified by humans. Common among these 45

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians are campsites, where daily life took place; quarries or lithic processing areas, the locales of stone•chipping; temporary campsites, representing brief hunting or gathering forays; killsites, where bison or other mammals were slaughtered and butchered; rock art sites, over­ hangs or shelters with pictographs (rock paintings) or petrogl hs yp (rock carvings); caves and rockshelters, protected overhangs in canyon walls, which some Indian groups, particularly in west Texas, used for daily occupation; mound sites, purposeful accu­ mulations of earth, found in east Texas, used as platforms for dwellings or for burials; burned rock middens, incidental accumu• lations of fire-cracked rock, often in a moundlike fashion, found associated with campsites in central and west Texas; shell middens, accumulations of shellfish collected as food, principally of oyster shell on the central coast and Rangia clam on the upper coast; cemetery sites, specific areas for the disposal of the dead, found in the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric eras in central, coastal and east Texas. This is by no means an exhaustive catalog of site types in Texas, but serves to suggest the diverse ways in which the ancient populations utilized the terrain and took advantage of its plant and animal resources. At many of these sites, the only surviv­ ing cultural remains are stone tools. If we are to understand the prehistoric use of the site, and indeed specific activities within the site boundaries, it is important that we know the context of the stone tools. For example, at kill sites, proper excavation will usually dis­ cover projectile points and cutting or butchering tools in asso­ ciation with the animal bones. The most common type of kill­ site in Texas is the bison-kill of Paleo-Indian times, from 9200 to 6000 B.C. For example, at Bonfire Shelter near Langtry in Val Verde County, excavations revealed a mass of bison remains associated with Folsom and Plainview points, accompanied by mis­ cellaneously shaped flakes and bifaces used for processing the slaughtered animals (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). At quarries or lithic processin,g areas, controlled surface collection will often yield great numbers of large, crudely chipped bifaces, the early stage of tool-making known as the quarry blank (Kelly and Hester 197 5 ). Rarely are projectile points or other finished tools found, since this is a locality where the basic lev- 46

Context and Chronology els of stone-working took place-securing good chipping mate­ rials, removing cortex flakes from the cobbles and roughing-out the blanks for further reduction elsewhere. These are important sites for archaeological study, though they have long been ignored, as they shed a great deal of light on a fundamental activity in prehistoric cultures (Lukowski 1987). Campsites are, throughout the state, found along streams or other water sources; most are "open occupation" sites, though caves and rockshelters were themselves often used for habita­ tion. Many represent the villages of hunters and gatherers, the main way of life throughout ancient Texas, until late times, when farming was introduced in east Texas and in parts of the Pan­ handle and far west Texas. They were the locales of daily life and were perhaps occupied for a few weeks or months, before the group moved on to exploit the plant and animal foods of another area. These are the most common sites and contain great quantities of stone tools, flakes and other debris. Context is particularly important in these sites. Even the surface collecting of an eroded campsite can ruin fragile patterns of tool distrib­ ution which, under controlled conditions, might tell the archae­ ologist a great deal about site function and the ways in which different parts of the site were used. Excavation presents an even larger challenge. Test pits can plumb the depths of the site, sometimes giving us information on the sequence of occupations by recovering stone tool types from different levels. However, to understand the behavior of the ancient inhabitants and the activities they carried out, a fairly large block or open area exca­ vation is usually required. In this fashion, we can plot in place the projectile points, scrapers, choppers and flakes and study the patterns of their horizontal distribution. This often shows the archaeologist where tool-making took place, where animals were being skinned and butchered, where bone tools were being made or wooden spear shafts fashioned-the relationships of the tools to the area of the site and to other stone tools pro­ vides, then, contextual information vital to archaeological inter­ pretation. We hope these comments serve to demonstrate that not only are the artifacts important, but their relationships within a site are even more crucial. Casual collecting and indiscriminate dig- 47

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians ging destroy these vital links. Thus, a cigarbox of points dug out of a site by an untrained person may make an interesting col­ lection to show friends, but it has little or no scientific value in the study of ancient Texas Indians. Only through proper recording and documentation in the field, and follow-up cata­ loging once back from the site, will the materials have any last­ ing meaning. It is beyond the scope of this book to detail the procedures of recording and cataloging. We have included as Appendix 6 a Projectile Point Analysis Form that may be of use. A number of books and manuals are available through local archaeological societies or through bookstores. A partial list of these includes Hester (1 980), Hemion (l9 83), Jo ukowsky (1 980), Dancey (1981), Fladmark (1978), Barker (1982), Hester, Heizer and Graham (1975) and Hester, et al. (in preparation). Proper field and laboratory methods cannot be fully learned from a book, and we encourage interested readers to join the Texas Archeological Society and their local or regional archaeologi­ cal societies in order to take advantage of the training oppor­ tunities these organizations provide. Chronology In this section, we have two objectives: first, briefly to describe some of the dating methods used to ascertain the age of stone tools; second, to review the general cultural sequence as it is known statewide. There arc basically two types of archaeological dating: absolute and relative. Absolute dating provides calendrical dates for archaeological remains. The most widely used tech­ nique in this regard is radiocarbon dating. It can only be used for organic remains (charcoal, wood, plant parts, etc.) that have been preserved in archaeological sites. A date obtained through this method has little significance unless the archae­ ologist is certain of its association with distinctive cultural remains. One date often means very little; we generally need a series of dates in order to ascertain the age of a particular cul­ tural level which might contain diagnostic kinds of stone tools. Radiocarbon dating is also expensive, with most laboratories charging around $200 per sample. Samples of ideal size are 48

Context and Chronologr around IO grams or more of charcoal; even then, the resulting date is expressed with a possible range of error, perhaps 50-100 years earlier or later than the central date. Still, this is the most widely applied and most useful of the absolute dating techniques in North America. Other methods of absolute dating can be used in some areas, but most are still experimental in their applica­ tion; good general archaeology texts, such as Fagan (1981) , pro­ vide a review of such techniques as thermoluminescence, archaeomagnetic dating, dendrochronology and obsidian hydra­ tion dating. Thermoluminescence, the measurement of alpha particles emitted from ceramics or other fired or burned mate­ rials, and archaeomagnetic dating, the study of remanent mag­ netism in heated clays (such as firepits or hearths), have been used for some Texas sites and materials, but their application is still limited. Relative dating provides the archaeologist not with calendar dates, but with approximate ages based on the vertical context of archaeological specimens. In an excavation, a certain point type may be found at a level deeper than another style; thus, we can date it as older than this latter type on a relative basis. Stratigraphy plays the key role in relative dating. If excavations reveal a sequence of occupational deposits, we can assume that materials in the bottom zone are the earliest, those in the middle come later and so on. Stratigraphic data from a series of sites allow cross-comparison of site sequences and permit the archaeologist to build a chronology of cultural patterns for a region. In some central Texas and lower Pecos sites, where there are deep middens representing repeated occupations over thou­ sands of years, a detailed chronology can be developed, based on relative dating established through stratigraphy. In other areas, as in the campsites of south Texas, archaeological remains are more scattered, and constructing a sequence of artifact forms based on excavations can be a long, slow process Hall, Black and Graves 1982; Hall, Hester and Black 1986). Cross-dating is an important technique for establishing the age of archaeological sites in some parts of the state. This involves comparison of artifacts of the same type among sites within a region or between regions. For example, as excavation of stratified sites continues in central Texas, and as some cul- 49

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians tural patterns and their diagnostic artifacts are radiocarbon dated, it is then possible to cross-date artifacts of known date with sites in areas less well known or where stratigraphy and radiocarbon dating have not established a firm sequence. If Bell points are found in deposits stratified at the base of sites at Still­ house Hollow, central Texas (Sorrow, Shafer and Ross 1967), and placed in an Early Archaic time frame, we can assume that similar points found in another part of central Texas (for exam­ ple, in Bexar County) are of the same age. And, carrying the cross-dating further, if Bell points that are typologically and tech­ nologically identical to those of central Texas are found in adja­ cent south or east Texas, we can speak of occupations of sim­ ilar age at sites in those regions. Archaeological Sequences in Prehistoric Texas Archaeological work has continued in parts of Texas for more than sixty years. Some areas, such as central Texas, have been intensively studied, and detailed archaeological sequences have been established. In other regions, such as the southern part of the state, research has intensified only in the last decade, and much remains to be learned about the history of prehistoric cultures. In this section, we provide a general chronological framework for the state, designed primarily to per­ mit readers to understand better the temporal position of the projectile points and tool forms defined below. Obviously, cul­ tural change proceeded at somewhat different rates over this vast area; in some regions, there were hunting and gathering cultures throughout prehistory, while in others, cultures with farming and settled village life appeared. A detailed study of Texas prehistory is being assembled by Thomas R. Hester and Dee Ann Story, with contributions from scholars from around the state. Four volumes published in the Arkansas Archeological Sur­ vey Research Series in 1989 and l 990 are the result of "regional overviews" done for the Southwestern Division of the Corps of Engineers. Hofman, et al. ( 1989) synthesize north Texas, the Llano Estacado and Panhandle; Simmons et al. (1989) examine the Trans-Pecos; Story et al. (1990) summarizes East Texas, and 50

While some claims have been made for greater antiquity, the earliest known inhabitants of the state, dur­ ing the late Pleistocene (Ice Age), can be linked to the Clovis Complex around 9200 B.C. The distinctive Clovis futed point is widespread and was, at least in some cases, used in mam­ moth-hunting. A mammoth kill-site, Miami, is found in Roberts County in the Texas Panhandle. The Gault site (4 lBL323) in central Texas has a Clovis occupation that includes incised peb­ bles, a blade core, and several Clovis points, including one made of Alibates material (Collins et al. 1991). Ferring (1990) has exca­ vated a deeply buried Clovis campsite at the Aubrey site in Den­ ton County; a Clovis point, Clovis blades, and thousands of flakes were found.

Context and Chronology this period. Although fluting ceases to be an important trait of Paleo-Indian points after Clovis and Folsom, later Paleo-Indian points maintain an overall lanceolate, parallel-sided form, often with careful parallel-flaking and with the basal edges dulled to facilitate hafting. There is a great diversification of point types, several of which we still cannot precisely date. Dalton and San Patrice points may date around 8000 B.C. in east Texas; Plain­ view points are found from the Panhandle into south Texas at around 8200�8000 B.C., and associated with kills of Pleistocene bison at Plainview and Bonfire. By around 8000 B.C., the end of the Pleistocene, remnants of the animals of that era�mam­ moth, bison, camel, horse, sloth··-have disappeared. Climates became more like those of modern times, yet in some regions, projectile point traditions continue to follow the patterns of ear­ lier times. In east Texas, there are Scottsblujf points from around 6500 B.c.; in the lower Pecos and south Texas, hunters and gath­ erers used Golondrina points, radiocarbon dated at 7000 B.c. While we are still learning more about the lifeways of these late Paleo-Indian cultures, we can trace their presence and distrib­ ution with these time-sensitive point styles. Archaic. Much of Texas prehistory is subsumed within a long time span of hunting and gathering cultural patterns known col­ lectively as the Archaic. It begins around 6000 B.C. and is notable for changes in the style of projectile points and tools, the distribution of site types and the introduction of grinding implements and ground stone ornaments, all reflecting a grad­ ually increasing population utilizing the abundant plant and ani­ mal resources of environments similar to that of modern times. The details of the Archaic sequence vary from region to region within the state. In general, it can be divided into Early, Mid­ dle, Late and Transitional eras. Each period is represented by specific point styles, and in some regions, each can be subdi­ vided into several segments, sometimes called phases. The Early Archaic (6000-2500 B.C.) is poorly known in its earliest phases, though a number of point and tool types can be linked to that era (fig. 3-7). In general, settlement appears more scat­ tered, and there are broader relationships among several regions, as indicated by the widespread occurrence of distinctive points, such as Martindale, Uvalde, Ear!J Triangular and Bell (McKinney 55

Context and Chronology 1981) . The Middle Archaic (2500 B.C.-1000 B.C.) marks a time, throughout the state, of si ificant population increase, large num­ gn bers of sites and abundant lithic artifacts of various forms. It, too, can be divided into segments in some areas. Certain regions appeared to be typified in the Middle Archaic by one or two dis­ tinctive points; for example, Gary and Kent points in east Texas, Pedernales in central Texas, Langtry in the lower Pecos and Tortu gas in south Texas. In some regions, specific types of sites are rec­ ognized, especially the burned rock middens of central Texas and shell middens on the Texas coast. Additionally, cemeter­ ies with large numbers of interments begin to appear late in the period, perhaps reflecting territoriality on the part of some hunt­ ing and gathering societies. Similarly, trade connections are established, bringing in artifacts of stone and shell from distant areas. The Late Archaic (1000 B.c. 300 B.C.) sees the continuation of hunting and gathering lifeways in most of Texas, again dis­ tinguished by certain types of projectile points and stone tools (fig. 3-7). In east Texas, pre-Caddo ceramic sites mark the begin­ ning of settled village life shortly after 500 B.C. Cemeteries are more notable in some regions, as in southeast Texas (Hall 1981) . Bison appear to be an important game resource in cen­ tral Texas and in the lower Pecos, where another bison-kill occurs at Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain l 968). Other bison-kills are known in the Texas Panhandle and southern Plains at this time (Hughes 1976). The Transitional Archaic (300 B.C.-A.D. 700) marks an inter­ val which in some ways is little more than a continuation of the Late Archaic. Still, there are distinctive point styles. While this time period is an important one in the Archaic sequences of cen­ tral and lower Pecos Texas, it is not part of the east Texas archaeological record, where village sites (such as the George C. Davis site of the Gibson Aspect) make their initial appear­ ance. These often have large mounds, with flat-topped exam­ ples sometimes used to support structures and conical mounds for burials. The Late Prehistoric 700 to historic times) is particularly noticeable in the archaeological record throughout the state. The bow and arrow is introduced, along with other distinctive types 57

Context and Chronology of stone tools. Pottery is also present, even among hunters and gatherers in central, south and coastal Texas. Bison hunting appears to be very important in most regions. The occurrence of tiny arrow points, such as Scallorn, Perdi:;,, Cun , Fril and Cata­ ey ey houla, marks the spread of the bow and arrow throughout the state. Many local types develop: Livermore in the Trans-Pecos, Lott and Garza in the Llano Estacado and McClain and Bulbar Stemmed on the coast. In some areas, we can discern distinct shifts in arrow point styles through time, especially with Scallorn (Austin Phase) and, later, Perdi:;, (Toyah Phase) in central Texas. Although a hunting and gathering lifeway continues, as in the Archaic, the material culture, hunting patterns, settlement types and other facets of Late Prehistoric times mark a fairly distinctive break with the past. In east Texas, around A.D. 1200 the Gib­ son Aspect gives way to the Fulton Aspect, which continues into the Historic era and is linked with the Caddo. In the Panhan­ dle and Llano Estacado, settled villages are found in the Ante­ lope Creek Phase on the Canadian River around A.D. 1400, and in Andrews County, village sites with links to southeast New Mexico appear around the same time. In the far west Trans­ Pecos area, a sequence of settled horticulturalists, with strong ties to the Southwest, commences in the early centuries A.D., developing more fully around A.D. 600 (Whalen 1980), marked especially by pithouse dwellings. Down the Rio Grande, near Presidio, another center of agriculturally based villages, the Bravo Valley Aspect dates to around A.D. 1200-1400 (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954; Kelley 1986). The Historic era (after ca. A.D. 1600) marks the beginning of the end for the native Indian cultures of the state. Some pro­ jectile points in east Texas continue into historic times (e.g., Tur­ ney, Cun ey ). Similarly, such types as Toyah and Fresno certainly date in part to historic times in parts of the state. With the advent of the Spanish mission system, the Indians who adopted mission life continued for a while to make stone tools (Fox 1979a, 1983; Hester 1989b), and a distinctive point type, Guerrero, is often found in missions, ranchos and Indian campsites of that era. However by the late eighteenth century, stone tools give way to glass, and brass and iron points replace those chipped from stone, ending an 11,000-year tradition. 61

� 4. PROJECTILE POINTS: � TYPE DESCRIPTIONS Introduction Projectile points are the most familiar single diagnostic ar· tifact of North American Indians and the principal tool utilized by ancient cultures for the last 11,000 years that shows distinct attribute variability. The majority of these specimens possess the same general morphological traits when considered from the standpoint of the manufacturing process (see chapter 2). Both the large, thick dart point and the tiny, thin arrow point are bilaterally symmetrical, bifacially flaked artifacts which are thinned and pointed at the distal end. Usually they possess a haft element distinguished from the body by means of edge· grinding, basal and/or laterally opposed notches or other modifications for the apparent purpose of attachment to the haft. Points often have morphological "styles" such as side- and corner-notching in common with types in widely scattered areas; yet, they may be thousands of years apart in time. Thus, it is essential to acquire a working knowledge of the technology, dating and distribution of a type (see chapter 3). Site reports, guides (such as this one) and archaeological journals are a good way to gain access to this knowledge. Studying actual collections of points will always be the best way to familiarize oneself with the variability of forms. In order for types to serve as a useful means of communica tion, it is important that readers and authors attach the same 64

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions meaning to the terminology used in the type descriptions. Fi re 20 graphically describes the nomenclature used in this gu ide. The dart and arrow points follow and are listed separately gu in alphabetical order with the descriptive data for each type. The illustrations are usually at actual size unless a scale is in­ dicated. We have minimized the description, choosing to let the drawings portray most of the features. The extent of grinding and smoothing on Paleo-Indian points, for example, is indicated with dots. Within the description, numerous references are usually listed, and additional detailed information can .be obtained from these publications. We have made an effort to select sites that show the known distribution of the type and have been excavated under controlled conditions vvith associated tool assemblages carefully recorded (readers should be aware that these sites are on private property and not open to the public). Additional references that contain relevant studies or pertinent information useful to the type description are also included. The site desi ations used here are based on the Smithsonian trino­ gn rnial �ystem, adopted in the 1950s by The University of Texas at Austin, where it continues in use in the central archaeological data files of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. In this system, 41 indi­ cates Texas, the county is denoted by a two-letter abbreviation (see Appen­ dix 3), and the site is numbered in sequential fashion. The estimated age, based on known carbon-14 dates and stratigraphic time estimates, is included with the cultural affil­ iation (Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, Historic), and a general distributional range of reported specimens is indicated on an index map of Texas. 65

Prominent, massive barbs extend downward and are narrowest at the juncture with the body ( resulting in high breakage frequency). They are closely related to Bell mor­ phologically, but are distinguishable by their greater size, stem length and barb length (Bell stems are usually more expanding and rarely exceed 16 mm in length).

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions ANGOSTURA This long, slender, leaf-shaped point has oblique parallel-faking, a narrow, concave or irregularly straight base and ground basal edges. Angostura was originally defined for the Plains; specimens attributed to the type in Texas vary widely in shape and fl�king, causing prob­ lems in definition. Kelly ( 1983a) suggests two other types of this point which he labels "Texas Angostura" and "Zella." Distribution: Throughout much of Texas./Period: Late Paleo-Indian. An AMS C-14 date on wood charcoal of 8805±:75 B.P. (6855±:75 B.C.) came from a deposit associated with an Angostura point at 41 BX83 l. An addi­ tional date (5484 5328 B.C., Beta 14733, 13C adjusted, dendocorrected) closely associated with an Angostura point from Baker Cave is also known, but seems unex­ pectedly recent.

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions AXTELL This medium-sized stemmed point is thicker than most dart points (7-10 mm) and generally has a crude appearance. The straight to gen­ tly convex lateral edges are commonly lightly serrated and many have light edge-beveling. The shoulders are slight to moderate in size and rarely barbed. They have been called "Penny Points" because of the distinctive, generally rounded stem, which is sometimes heavily ground. There is considerable variation in the outline of the stem. It is similar to Palmillas but rounding of the Axtell stem begins closer to its shoulders. Distribution: East and Central Texas./Period: Middle to Late Archaic./Sites: Navarro Mills Reservoir, Nava­ sota Reservoir, 4 ILT65, Limestone Co.; Jewett Mine; Charles Cox; White Oak Bayou ( 41H R269) 75

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions BAKER The body of this point is thick in cross-section, and it has straight to slightly convex lateral edges, and shoulders or strong barbs. The stem is expanding, and the base is bifurcated. A second variety is less commonly barbed, and the convex sterns have a "bowlegged" ap­ pearance; the notches in the base are more open and the base of the notch is rounded. It is similar to the Uvalde type in central Texas. Distribution: Lower Pecos./Period: Early Archaic, ca. 6000 B.C. 4000 B.c./Sites: Baker Cave; Hinds Cave .

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians BANDY The lateral edges on this point vary from gently convex to slightly recurved, and corner-notching produces strong barbs with narrow or V-shaped notches. The stem is slightly expanding, and the base has a "fishtail" appearance. It is thin in cross-section and very well made. It may be the lower Pecos equivalent of the Martindale type of central 4?Texa's .

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions BARBER A long, thick, parallel-flaked, lanceolate point that expands near mid-body and is similar to Golondrina and Plainview. It has the deep basal concavity of Golondrina, but rather than flaring, recurved basal edges, it has edges that contract more than Plainview (Kelly 1983b). The basal concavity and edges are ground, and the deep, recurved or bell-shaped concavity (up to 12 mm) is the deepest of any Texas Paleo-Indian point. Distribution: Williamson, Bexar, Gillespie and Hamilton counties./Period: Paleo-Indian./Sites: Wilson-Leonard; Gillespie County • References: Weir 1984; Kelly 1982, 1983b 79

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians BELL The distinctive attributes of this point are its wide, thin, triangu­ lar body and long narrow barbs formed by basal-notching. It is sim­ ilar to Andice, but smaller in size. Bell points also share typological similarities with Calf Creek and Cossatot River points of Oklahoma and Arkansas; the dimensions for Calf Creek appear to fall between the larger Andice and the smaller Bell.

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions BIG SANDY This type has been long known in the southeastern United States and has only been recognized fairly recently in Texas. Texas spec­ imens are usually somewhat smaller than Big Sandy artifacts illustrated by Perino ( 1985). They are more compatible with those published by Justice (1987: Fig. 13). The specimens are side notched with the cor­ ners of the stem often squared. Serrations are sometimes found along the lateral edges of the point. G. Perino (personal communi­ cation), believes that the points shown here arc probably Cache River points that are found in Arkansas, where they were named, in south­ east Oklahoma, in Louisiana and in east Texas. tvluch more research needs to be done on the Big Sandy type in Texas, and identification of these points should be done with caution. Distribution: In Texas, from east and southeast regions into the Edwards Plateau./Period: Late Paleo-Indian to Early Archaic? Justice ( I 987:62) dates them between 8000-6000 B.C. in the southeastern United States, while Story et al.

Projectile Points: Type Descnpaon,. COSSATOT Cossatot points are described as "Cossatot River" by Perino ( 1985:88). He illustrates specimens with deep corner notches and a broad expanded stem, often with a notch in the center of the base. G. Perino (personal communication) says that the specimens found without basal notches are more common in some areas (Texoma Lake for exam­ ple) than the notched type. Perino's examples are also serrated, although this trait does not occur on all Cossatot points. Typological and distributional studies of this type are badly needed for Texas. q Distribution: Southwest Arkansas, eastern Oklahoma and into northeast Texas./Period: Perino ( 1985) states that they are affiliated with Calf Creek (Bell) poi�ts.

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions DALTON Distinctive features of this point are beveled, lateral cutting edges, often serrated, and a roughly parallel-sided stem or basal section that is distinguished from the body by grinding or a change in outline. The base is deeply concave and thinned by one or more relatively large flake scars on both faces. Story ( 1990: 190) thinks that Dalton is a sometimes fluted, lanceolate, projectile point/knife which prob­ ably developed out of an eastern form of Clovis. Considerable vari­ ation in the point probably reflects morphological changes as well as use, resharpening, and probably temporal and/or geographical vari­ 0 ations (Johnson 1989b: 18). Distribution: Similar points found in Arkansas, Missouri, Nebraska and northeast Te�as./Period: Paleo-Indian, ca. 8500 B.C.-7900 B.C.(accordmg to Goodyear 1982:382)./ Sites: Dalton (MO); Rodgers Shelter (MO); Brand (AR); Medicine Creek sites (NE) 99

At the \\Tilson-Leonard site seven specimens of a thick, notched point tentatively termed "'Wilson" were radio­ carbon dated at 94 70± 1 70 B.P. (TX-4 787) and 9650 ± 120 B.P. (TX- 4793) (Weir 1985). At sites in southeastern Texas, specimens have been found of early side- or corner-notched points usually exhibit­ ing ground stems and/or bases, and beveled/resharpened lateral edges. Data from the Devil's Mouth site suggest association with Golon­ drina and other Late Paleo-Indian points. Distribution: Lower Pecos, central, south and south eastern Texas./Period: Late Paleo-Indian./Sites: 41 WM235, 4 IBPI 9; Devil's Mouth, Stillhouse Hollow; 41HR206; 41W H 19 References; Weir 1985; Patterson 1976; Patterson and Hudgins 1985; Sor­ row 1968a; Sorrow, Shafer and Ross 1967; Ensor and Carlson 1991 106

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions EARLY STEMMED LANCEOLATE Projectile points in this category have lanceolate outlines with weak shoulders forming ill-defined stems, the edges of which have been dulled. They have been found in loose association with other Paleo­ Indian projectile points and are thought to date from that era. Much typological research is needed to defne this group further; Kelly (1983a) has tentatively included them in his Victoria type.

Stone Artifaets of Texas Indians EARLY TRIANGULAR These are triangular points usually characterized by careful parallel- oblique flaking, straight to slightly concave and alternately- beveled lateral edges (which may also be slightly serrated). Because there has been considerable confusion in the typology of triangular points, we have used this descriptive name for those triangular forms that occur in the Early Archaic. They are chronologically earlier than Tortugas points in southern Texas. In cen­ tral Texas, such specimens have been called (by Kelley 1947) Baird Beveled Blade and Taylor Thinned Base ( or Taylor and Baird; Sorrow 1969). However, no specific attributes for clearly separating these two groups have yet been published. Indeed, Black and McGraw ( 1984) postulate that these specimens are knives, with the shapes changing through use and subsequent beveling (resharpening) of the lateral edges. Distribution: North and south central, south and southwest Texas./Period: Early Archaic, ca. 3700 B.C.-3600 B.C./Sites: Panther Springs Creek; Landslide; Lajita; Dan Baker; Wounded Eye; 41BN!07 108

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions EPPS These specimens closely resemble the Motl type and Justice ey (1987: 199) suggests that Epps represents resharpened or reworked Mot- points. However, Webb et al. (ms.) have recognized more than 250 specimens that they separate from iifotley, noting that they are thicker (average: 9 mm) than the latter. Webb et al. (ms.) further describe Epps as "relatively narrow . . . w ith triangular blades . . . (and) wide, deep curving notches into the corners." Further traits include lenticular cross sections and distinct medial ridges on one or both faces of most specimens. Distribution: Southeast Texas, and perhaps elsewhere in east Texas (Webb et al. ms., note them as "infre­ quent" in Texas)./Period: possibly contemporary with Afotl (Y; Poverty Point Phase, 1500 500 B.c./Sites: McFaddin Beach ( 4 !JF50); Poverty Point (LA) tions); Poverty Point (LA) References: Justice 1987; Webb et al.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians EVANS This thick, medium sized point has mildly convex lateral edges, well-defined shoulders and a straight to expanded to bulbous stem. The base is sometimes lightly smoothed. Its distinguishing feature is a second set of notches cut into the lateral edges a short distance above the shoulders, usually by the removal of single, deep flakes, bifacially, leaving sharp edges. Some have finely serrated lateral edges above and below the notches. Distribution: Louisiana, Arkansas and occasionally east Texas./Period: Middle Archaic, ca. 2600 B.C.

Stou Aitifaels of Texas Indians KENT This type has some similarity to Pontchartrain, but it is not as slen­ der and is poorly made. The triangular body is often asymmetrical, usually with a prominent medial ridge, the shoulders are squared to indistinct, there is no fine ripple-flaking and the stems often have cor­ tex at the base. Distribution: Central portion of the coastal area, east and central Texas and Louisiana./Period: Middle to Transitional Archaic, ca. 2000 B.C.-A.D. 500./Sites: Kent-Crane; San Jacinto River Basin; George C. Davis; Poverty Point (LA) References: Campbell 1952; Shafer 1968, 1973; Weir 1956; Webb 1982, per­ sonal communication; Suhm and Jelks I 962; Patterson I 990a; Story el al. 1990 136

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions KINNEY This unstemmed, triangular to elongate-triangular point has a slight­ ly to deeply concave base. Weir and Doran ( 1980) named a similar form found at the Anthon site "Anthon," but a subsequent analysis by Glen Goode suggested that "Anthon" is really a knife in the last stage of thinning (F. Weir, per­ sonal communication). Distribution: Central and south Texas and the lower Pecos./Period: Middle Archaic./Sites: La Jita; Morhiss; Damp Cave; Anthon 137

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions KIRK The "Kirk" label has been applied to several point types in the southeast and midwest parts of the United States (see Justice 1987). Story et al. ( 1990:2 I 9) recognizes "Kirk" points in northeast Texas and adjacent parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas. The specimens illus­ trated here approximate the "Kirk Serrated" style as defined in Jus­ tice (1987:82 85). The lateral edges are strongly serrated, while the stems are slightly expanded with bases concave or straight. Much more research has to be done on the occurrence of this type in Texas; some may simply be reworked and serrated versions of other types. q Distribution: Northeast and southeast Texas;/Period: Story et al.

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions LANGTRY This point is thin and well made with straight to concave, or recurved, lateral edges and strong shoulders. It is characterized by a tapered stem, sometimes with alternately-beveled edges, that ter­ minates in a straight or slightly beveled, concave base. There is much variation within the group in proportions, base shape and develop­ ment of shoulders. One variation, perhaps a separate type, has been called Arenosa (Bement 1991h ). Arenosa is similar to both Langtry and Val Verde points. Its shoulders are square and occasionally have incipient barbs. The stems contract but the base is convex to pointed, and usually the stems and base are not beveled as in Langtry points. Distribution: Very common in the lower Pecos; occurs infrequently in south and south central Texas, the Big Bend region and Coahuila, Mexico./Period: Middle Archaic, ca. 2500 B.C. 1000 B.c./Sites: Devil's Mouth; Baker Cave; Roark Cave; Hinds Cave; Fate Bell; Arenosa Shelter 143

Projec:tlle Points: Type Descriptions LERMA A slender, bi-pointed outline, usually thinned on one end, is char­ acteristic of these points. They have longitudinal symmetry and thus it is sometimes difficult to determine which is the proximal and which is the distal end. They have been assumed by some to be Paleo­ Indian in age; indeed, some evidence exists to suggest the presence of a small, bi-pointed form of projectile point in Mexico and south Texas in Paleo-Indian times. However, points resembling Lerma are generally found in Archaic contexts in south Texas.

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions MARTINDALE This point has prominent shoulders and short barbs formed by corner-notching. Its most distinguishing feature is the base, which is formed by two convex curves meeting in a depression in the center; this gives the base a "fishtail" appearance. Martindale, as a type, was first proposed by Suhm, Krieger and Jelks (1954) and dated in the Archaic (ca. 4000 B.C.-A.D. 1000). In the early l 970s, similar specimens were reported from earlier Archaic contexts, and in some cases were called "Early Barbed" (lower Pecos) or "Early Corner-Notched" (south central Texas). Prewitt redefined Martindale as an Early Archaic type with considerable variation in form, and in­ cluded "Early Barbed" and "Early Corner-Notched." Bandy is a mor­ phologically similar form and probably a lower Pecos equivalent. Some of the specimens on the following page illustrate the diminu­ tion and changes in shape of these points as they are repeatedly reworked.

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions MATAMOROS This small, often thick, triangular or subtriangular, unstemmed point is similar to Tortugas, but markedly smaller. Studies done on Choke Canyon artifacts (Hall, Black and Graves 1982) demonstrated that the average length of Tortugas was 4.9 mm-6.7 mm; Matamoros specimens ranged from 3.2 mm to 4. 7 mm in length. Like Catan and Abasolo, Matamoros and the larger Tortugas type may represent a continuum.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians MESERVE This lanceolate to triangular point has a concave, well-thinned base created by the removal of one or more flakes from both faces. The lateral sides are essentially parallel for approximately one-third of the length; the upper portion is unifacially beveled and the distal tip pointed. The base has lateral and basal grinding. lvfeserve sometimes resembles the Dalton type and is also similar to Plainview and Golon­ drina points; many may simply be reworked lanceolate points of those types. Indeed, Goodyear (1982:382) maintains that specimens classified as Meserve are nothing more than reworkings of lanceolate points such as Plainview. Myers and Lambert (1983) believe it is a west­ ern variant of Dalton, and Story et al. (1990:90) thinks that it prob­ ably is not a valid type.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians PALMER This small, corner-notched point has a straight, thinned and heav­ ily ground base. The shoulders are barbed and vary from being greater to less than basal width. The lateral edges tend to be straight but may be slightly concave or convex and most examples are ser­ rated. It is also known as a small variety of Kirk Corner .Notched, the o0nly observed morphological difference is the heavy basal grinding typical of Palmer (Justice 1987).

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians PEDERNALES The size and body dimensions vary greatly in this narrow to broad, or often leaf-shaped, triangular point depending on how it has been reworked. While the body is highly variable, the type is char acterized by a more or less rectangular, bifurcated stem. The basal concavity is often thinned by a broad, flute-like flake on one or both sides. Distribution: Extremely common in central Texas and into the lower Pecos. Found also at some south Texas sites./Period: Middle Archaic, ca. 2000 B.C. 1200 B.C./Sites: Centipede Cave; Oblate; Smith Rockshelter; Oulline; Bull Pen 171

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions SANDIA Wormington (1957) divided these lanceolate points into two forms, both with a characteristic slight shoulder on one side of the base. San­ dia "Type I" has a rounded outline and a bluntly pointed base and is lenticular in cross-section. Use-marks are said to be common along one side, indicating that they may have been used as knives. Sandia "Type II" is more carefully made, has parallel sides, is diamond-shaped in cross-section and has a straight or slightly concave base. Both have ground basal edges. Originally, specimens from Sandia Cave, New Mexico, were reported as pre-dating Clovis points; further excavations, however, revealed that they are later in date. Broken and reworked Archaic stemmed points in Texas are sometimes mistaken for Sandia points by artifact collectors. Distribution: Known mainly from eastern New Mexico; perhaps into the Llano Estacado./Period: Paleo-Indian./ Sites: Sandia Cave (NM); Lucy (NM); Torrance County (NM) 179

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions SAN PATRICE This point is characterized by a concave, usually deep and ground base that has been thinned by the removal of one to three channel flakes to produce a fluting that extends to mid-point or beyond. Weak to well-defined shoulders are found at the juncture of the basal sides and tip edge. Somewhat similar points of Paleo-Indian date have been found in the Brazos River Valley at Horn Shelter #2 (and termed "Brazos Fishtail"), and in the Texas Panhandle at the Rex Rodgers bison-kill site ("Rodgers Side-Hollowed"), suggesting that variants of this form may have been widely distributed in Paleo-Indian times. C. Webb (personal communication) believes that the San Patrice point and culture is one of a series (lvfeserve, San Patrice, Dalton, Van Lott and local variants) that extends from the Rockies to the south Atlantic coast,, and, in Louisiana, is the first locally based, endemic culture. Webb further suggests two variants: "Hope" (four of the spec­ imens illustrated here) and "St. Johns." There is a considerable range in size and commensurate variability in thickness and width even within the two variants "Hope" and "St. Johns"(Johnson I 989b). Distribution: East and northeast Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas./Period: Paleo-Indian, ea. 8000 B.C. ·6000 B.c./Sites: John Pearce (LA); Jake Martin; Wolfshead; 41WHl9; 4IHR233; 41SF20 181

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions SCOTTSBLUFF Initially defined in the Plains, these are fairly large points typified by excellent workmanship, fine parallel-flaking and a "fat feel" due to their biconvex cross-sections. The broad stem edges and base are ground smooth. Texas specimens are usually smaller than their Plains counterparts. "Red River Knives" (Johnson 1989b), found in the oak savanna/ Cross Timbers area, are refurbished Scottsbluff points, unifacially resharpened and edge-beveled on one face to create a long, oblique, cutting, scraping and sawing edge which was longer than the oppo­ site edge. Often the edge was concave and may have functioned as a spokeshave.

Stone Artifads of Texas Indians SHUMlA A triangular point with straight to convex lateral edges that are often slightly serrated. Basal notches form a more or less rectangular stem and short to long barbs. They are usually well-made.

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions SINNER These projectile points have multiple notches or deep serrations along the lateral edges. Stems are squared to slightly expanded. The type was named by Webb et al. (1969:52 53), and they report that it is "related to the Evans type." Evans is distinguished by a single deep notch in each lateral edge, while Sinner points have two to five notches or deep serrations. Three specimens below are from Louisiana; the much reworked specimen illustrated on the lower right is from t..·· h . •· ·. e Resch site (Harrison Co.) by Webb et al. I 969: Fig. 14. q1969: Fig·. 14.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians TORTUGA.S This large, unstemmed, triangular point has an approximately straight to concave base and alternately beveled edges. It is often thick and crudely faked in the midsection and well-thinned basally. There are typological problems (see Matamoros and Early Triangular), but there is growing evidence that points of this form are characteristic of the Late Middle Archaic in south Texas. 122 Tortuga:; points were found with the burial site at Loma San­ dia; it was the most numerous point associated with the burials, which were radiocarbon dated at 850 B.C.-600 B.C. (Lynn Highley, personal communication). Distribution: Characteristic of south Texas and the lower Rio Grande, but occasionally found in central Texas and the lower Pecos./Period: Late Middle Archaic, and perhaps earlier./Sites: Oulline; Choke Canyon; La Perdida; San Miguel Creek sites; 41L K28 References: Hester, White and White 1969; Hall, Black and Graves 1982; Weir 1956; Hester 1968; Suhm andjelks 1962; Taylor and Highley n.d. 188

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions UVALDE This is a broadly defined type that varies considerably. Generally, it has a triangular to lanceolate body with rounded shoulders or barbs, an expanding stem and a concave base. It was originally defined as a Middle to Late Archaic type; however, recent research has shown these points to be Early Archaic in date. Some of the specimens of this general shape have been called "Early Corner-Notched." Baker, in the lower Pecos, is probably a regional equivalent.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians CATAHOULA The lateral edges of this point are straight to concave or recurved, and they frequently flare at the shoulders to form distinctive, large, rounded or squared barbs, producing a relatively broad shoulder area. The expanding stem is short, wide and normally convex. "Class A-1" and "Class A-2" (Aten 1967, 1983) in southeast Texas are somewhat similar forms with straight-sided or small, contracting stems that are commonly found on the upper Gulf coast and have usually been misclassified as Catahoula. Patterson ( 198 7) describes a drill-like variant of the Catahoula arrow point from Site 41 HR l 82, which he calls the Catahoula per­ forator. The bases have straight stems and the shoulder barbs are squared like the Catahoula arrow point inferring that the tool was hafted for use as a drill/perforator. Examination under magnifica­ tion showed tip smoothing and polish indicating possible use as a rotary tool. Distribution: Northeast and southeast Texas and Loui­ siana./Period: Late Prehistoric, ca.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians LOZENGE A distinctive point that is characterized by an elongated, oval to diamond-shaped outline. One-half of the point is bifacially worked, resulting in a lenticular cross-section; the opposite end is alternately beveled, usually on the right. It is not always clear which end is the distal, and which the proximal, or if the beveling is the result of resharpening.

� I 5. CHIPPED STONE ARTIFACTS I 44,U,4 Introduction The wide array of stone tools often found in association with projectile points are usually more difficult to categorize, but they constitute an equally important component of the material culture of a group of people related in time and space. Utilitarian household implements such as knives, scrapers, drills and chop­ pers can be used by the archaeologist to study the behavioral patterns of populations. Generally, the largest class of tools in an assemblage are the bifaces -artifacts with flaking on both sides or on two opposite faces (see chapter 2). In addition to the projectile points, these include artifacts often called knives, choppers and "gouges." The other larger class of tools are the unifaces -flakes altered on one side or on one face only. Unifaces are usually piano-convex in cross-section; the ventral surface is the flat side, and the dorsal surface is the raised (piano) side. These include artifacts that are often labeled scrapers, gravers, fake tools and unifacial "gouge" forms. Characteristics of chipped stone tools that have functional im­ portance come in a variety of forms, shapes and disguises, and the average tool may have been utilized in a number of different ways; thus, it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish a knife from a projectile point or a scraper from a knife. Since form is often simply the by-product of expedience or resharpening or 239

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians other modification in a tool's life, the most direct sort of evidence appears to be wear left on the tool while it was being used (chapter 2). Hence, classification and names must be used with caution and only in a general fashion; when used, they should ideally be based on an analysis of manufacturing techniques, shapes, wear patterns and context. Some of the best-known and most intensively studied speci mens have been named in the past, and a function suggested as a result of experiments, studies or hypotheses ( or all of these). These are described, together with general morphological classifications (scrapers, choppers, perforators, gravers, etc.), and alphabetically ordered within the two categories of bifaces and unifaces. Readers are once again warned that we have assembled these from the existing literature; some of these categories are tentative or represent groupings or functions that have not been fully tested through archaeological research. Furthermore, many are very restricted in time and space, and should be used for comparative purposes based on the data provided here, and through consultation of the references listed for each. 240

Chipped Stone Artifacts Bifaces BRISTOL BIFACE This relatively small, oval to subtriangular artifact was originally described by Duffield (1963b). The workmanship varies from good to crude; it is usually percussion-flaked, and specimens retain cortex on one or both faces. However, marginal retouching and continuous edg­ ing or smoothing are visible on some of the specimens. Its function is unknown.

Chipped Stone Artifacts "BUTTED KNIFE" BlfA CE These generally oblong or pear-shaped artifacts are often called "fist axes" or "carcass cleavers." Specimens have a rounded natural cobble surface on one end (providing the handgrip); the opposite end is pointed, with a worked edge that often exhibits extensive, glossy polish, perhaps from cutting meat or soft plants. They seem ideally fitted for butchering tools; the ends are too thin and delicate for heavy chopping.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians CARROLLTON AXE These notched, often crudely bifaced artifacts were defined by Crook and Harris (1954), who attributed them to their Earl Archaic y Carrollton Focus. However, more recent studies indicate that they are Late Archaic in date (Prikryl 1990; Galm 1978). They arc usu­ ally made of quartzite, with one end percussion-flaked into a cutting "bit" and the opposite end often blunt and battered, perhaps through hammering use. The double notches certainly suggest that these were hafted tools.

Chipped Stone Artifacts CHOPPER The term "chopper" is often applied to cobbles or a large piece of stone with a few flakes removed from one end. The opposite end is usually rounded, and the chopper edge can be unifacial or bifacial. Battering and dulling of the edge are usually indicative of heavy wear-perhaps in grubbing, hacking, woodworking and heavy butch­ ering and food-processing. Sometimes cores can be mistaken for "chop­ pers,'' although cores were, on occasion, reused as chopping tools (see chapter 2).

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians CLEAR FORK BIFACE AND UNIFACE The Clear Fork tool form was originally defined by Ray ( 1941) . Often called "gouges," these artifacts have triangular to subtriangular outlines, though some vary to lanceolate, rectangular and ovate. The wide end is considered the working edge or bit; it is usually steep and beveled and may be convex, straight or slightly concave ("scooped out"). In cross-section, the tools are plano-convex and at times almost pyramidal. Edge-wear can sometimes be detected visually or with the aid of a microscope; it is likely that they were utilized in woodworking tasks, as scrapers or adzes, rather than "gouges." The edge angle of the bit end varies from 60° to 75° in most cases. The outlines of the unifacial and bifacial forms are generally the same. Large Clear Fork bifaces occur in some Paleo-Indian contexts (e.g., St. Mary's Hall, Baker Cave). Large Clear Fork unifaces often appear in the Early Archaic. The unifacial and bifacial forms of smaller size are very common in south Texas and in the Abilene area, primarily during the Middle Archaic. Clear Fork tools need intensive typological study in order better to distinguish, temporally and spatially, distinctive groups within this broad category. Distribution: Found widely in Texas, especially south Q Texas, north central Texas and parts of northeast Mex­ ico./Period: Some forms begin in the Paleo Indian and Early Archaic and continue into the Middle Archaic./Sites: Choke Canyon; Granberg II; Oulline; Granite Beach 246

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians CORNER-TANG BIFACE This relatively rare biface has several body and tang variations; the most common form has a tang notched into one corner of the base (Patterson 1936). Most specimens have been found in central and south central Texas and westward in counties along the Balcones Escarpment. Function is unknown; some have edge-wear indicating hafting for use as a knife (Mitchell and Orchard 1984), others have been reworked as drills (as illustrated), and some perhaps had no utilitarian use as they are occasionally found as grave furnishings.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians DALTON ADZ This biface has an oval to triangular outline, with steep bit. The lateral edges arc usually heavily dulled and haft polish is observed on the poll end. Most appear to have been made from flat, peb- bles or small cobbles, and traces of cortex illustrated arc found on many specimens. It is hypothesized that they were used as adzes.

Chipped Stone Artifacts GAHAGAN BIFACE This long, narrow, triangular artifact has a base that is generally straight or moderately concave and thinned to about the same degree as the lateral edges. It is characterized by recurved edges between the base and mid-point of the lateral edges. Edge-wear suggests possible use for cutting vegetal substances or meat (Shafer 1973). Specimens from burials indicate that some were elite items. Distribution: East central and east Texas into Louisiana./Period: Late Prehistoric./Sites: George C.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians GUADALUPE BIFACE This unique artifact is thick and percussion-flaked and has an abruptly truncated distal end or bit that angles from the dorsal edge toward the proximal end. The bit is usually unifacially worked, often by the removal of narrow, blade-like fakes around the curved distal bit, and the working-edge angles are generally steep, ranging roughly from 55° to 85°. Obvious damage, scarring and frequent evidence of resharpening are visible on this working edge. The tool may be biconvex to piano-convex, keel-shaped or nearly triangular in cross­ section. Black and McGraw (1984) have done an extensive study of the Guadalupe biface and have provided a formal definition of this form.

Chipped Stone Artifacts GUNFUNTS Gunflints occur commonly in m1ss10n collections in Texas and northern Mexico. They are also found in historic Indian sites throughout the state as well as at sites of early settlers. :Many are prob­ ably of European origin (18th-century English and French) and are of musket, carbine and pistol sizes. Aboriginally made gunflints of local material are generally similar in size and outline to the Euro­ pean specimens. Some are shaped from thin bifaces and others are trimmed flakes and chips.

Chipped Stone Artifacts NUECES BIFACE AND UNIFACE These distally beveled bifaces ( or occasionally unifaces) were originally described by Hester, White and White (1969: 148-149) and Wakefield (1968:26). They are trapezoidal to roughly lunate (or crescentic) in outline with piano-convex cross-sections. The widest "bit" edge is steeply beveled, and use-marks along this edge indicate that it may have been employed in scraping or cutting activities.

Chipped Stone Artifacts OLMOS BIFACE These small, distinctive artifacts were first defned by Hester (1969a) and analyzed by Shafer and Hester ( 1971 ). They are triangular in outline and bifacially worked and have a beveled-edge bit at the broad end (usually at an angle of 60° or more). The thickest part of the specimen occurs along this edge, which often shows wear in the form of heavy dulling, battering and striations. Typically, the bit is much resharpened by flakes removed from the ventral edge, and there are often burins on the corners of the bit.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians PERfORATORS/DRILLS This tool form is characterized by a long and tapered bit that is diamond-shaped in cross-section. The bit and proximal end are bifacially flaked and sometimes exhibit retouching; the tips of drills are often blunted or dulled. The bases of Archaic drills are frequently the same as those of projectile points, suggesting that they probably began as points and were later reworked into drills. Late Prehistoric perforators are smaller than the large Archaic bifaces, and are most commonly made on flakes.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians 1WO-AND FOUR-BEVELED BIFACES Diamond-shaped, four-edged bifaces sometimes called "Plains Knives" or "Harahey Knives," occur widely in Late Prehistoric sites in the southern Plains and Blackland Prairies and occasionally in the central and eastern parts of the state. They are often made of Ali­ bates-agatized dolomite in the Plains. They are usually characterized by steep bevels on all four alternating edges. Restricted almost entirely to south Texas is a different, two-beveled form with a shorter, convex-edged proximal segment (see item "C" below and illustrations on following page. The tool form is a regional variant of the better-known four-edged form; the distinctive shape is due to patterned resharpening (Brown et al. 1982). Both forms are fre­ quently associated with bison remains. Distribution: Southern Great Plains and widespread locations in Texas./Period: Late Prehistoric and possi• bly into Historic, ca.

Chipped Stone Artifacts Unifaces ALBANY UNIFA Cf/BIFACE These artifacts appear to be hafted spokeshaves or beveled scrap­ ers. Two characteristic features are side-notching, producing an expanded haft with a typically concave or straight base, and a sin­ gle, concave, beveled lateral edge. They may be fat, water-worn peb­ bles altered only by chipping of the beveled edge and side-notches with some thinning of the base, or they may be chipped over the entire surface. Most of the latter specimens appear to be reworked from projectile points and are typically found in sites with San Patrire points in northwest Louisiana and southeast Texas (41 HR233; 41 HR624; 41 HR1 82; 41 HR64 perhaps reworked from points of that type. The diagonal placement and convexity of the bevel plus the gen­ erally rough and dull edge suggest a scraping, rather than cutting, tool.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians SCRAPERS There is much variation as to form and quality of workmanship in this category of unifacially flaked artifacts that are traditionally referred to, and presumably functioned, as scrapers. They are found in a wide range of shapes and forms; most are made on large flakes or blades and are characterized by a steeply flaked working edge. They are often categorized by archaeologists according to the position of the edge, its location and the nature of the retouch: end scrapers are trimmed to a steep and convex bit at the end of the longest axis ( opposite the bulbar or proximal end); side scrapers are trimmed on one or two edges and have side-and-end trimming in combination on one specimen; convergent scrapers have edges which meet in a pointed fashion; concave scrapers have one edge trimmed in a concave shape; and transverse scrapers have a trimmed edge transverse, or obliquely oriented, to the proximal end. Functional studies of specimens (independent of morphological categories) are necessary to determine the usage of a particular arti­ fact; microscopic analysis of edge-wear has shown that some unifacially flaked artifacts were used for cutting, so all unifaces cannot automatical­ ly be called scrapers.

Chipped Stone Artifacts SEQUENT FLAKE UNIFACES These are highly distinctive artifacts, made on oval flakes detached sequentially from a tubular chert nodule. Epstein ( 1962) first described them as "oval cortex scrapers" and Shafer ( 1986) attributes them to the Baker Interval in the Lower Pecos between 8500 5000 years ago. They are generally oval in outline, with cortex around a portion of the edge. The edge opposite the cortex has been chipped unifacially for use as a scraper or knife. They have an unusual cross section, with a positive bulb of percussion on one face and a negative bulb (from an earlier flake removal) on the other the profile drawn below). Distribution: Lower Pecos and into Terrell County and the Big Bend (H.J. Shafer, personal communication)./ Period: Early Archaic./Sites: Centipede and Damp Caves; Hinds Cave; Devils Mouth site (all in Val Verde � County); Sanderson Canyon sites, Terrell County. References: Epstein 1963; Johnson 1964; Shafer 1986. 285

,U• ..t..,U, 6. GROUND, PECKED AND AAAAA POLISHED STONE ARTIFACTS Introduction This category includes ground, pecked and polished stone tools that were shaped and altered intentionally or through use. Im­ plements that have one or more surfaces modifed by pecking and grinding and were shaped in the course of food preparation are metates/milling stones, manos, pestles and pitted stones. Utilitarian tools used in the process of sharpening, grinding or honing different tools are described, and stones used for straightening arrow shafts. Other stones evidence use in saw­ ing, reaming, polishing or hammering. Polished stone artifacts include celts, plummets, boatstones, Waco "sinkers," gorgets and pipes. Some are relatively crude, but others are beautifully ground, polished and occasionally decorated. Most of these are ornaments, but others served utilitarian tasks. 286

Ground, Pecked and Polished Stone Artifacts ABRADING STONES Irregular fragments of sandstone and limestone often exhibit dif­ ferent kinds of wear patterns, such as V-shaped, longitudinal grooves at various angles, surface-faceting or edge-faceting. These may result from the use of the abrasive stone for smoothing the edges of bifaces during the tool-making process; other stones may have been utilized to shape, sharpen, smooth and polish a number of different imple­ ments, such as bone awls and needles. Altered quartzite cobbles called "Edge-Preparation Tools" (Perino 1972) are found throughout the country and may have been used to grind and dull the edges of preforms in the bifacing process. Their specific purpose is not known but their natural water worn shapes were probably being utilized and modified in various pecking, strik­ ing, polishing, abrading, food grinding and flint preparation activi­ ties (Chadderdon 1976). Distribution: \Vidcly found in Texas. /Period: Archaic to Late Prchis­ toric./Sites: George C. Davis; Oblate; Choke Canyon; Big Pine Lake; Chopek; Wheeler; Ellis County; 41V T 15; 41 VT30 _J 287

Ground, Pecked and Polished Stone Artifacts BANNERSTONES Bannerstones are found infrequently in Texas. Their function is debatable but the winged, center-drilled, and "hourglass" varieties were probably used as atlatl weights. They would have been an improvement on the art of spear throwing because they could be moved on spear-thrower shafts with relative ease compared to boat­ stones that had to be secured (Duke 1989:14). Adjustment of weight has been demonstrated by modern atlatl experts to be very impor­ tant in obtaining greater range and accuracy (Annual World's Atlatl Contest, Saratoga, Wyoming) (Duke 1985). Materials vary widely and range from sandstone to jaspar and basalt. The holes drilled are relatively uniform, 1.1 cm. to 1.4 cm. (which could indicate that the size of the atlatl shafts were fairly stan­ dqard to fit holes in the bannerstones). Weights of the three illustra­ tions on page 292 range from 42 gm. to 90 gm.

Gmund, Pecked and Polished Stone Artifacts BOATSTONES The basic form of "boat-shaped" stones is primarily rectangular in plan and piano-convex in longitudinal cross-section with rounded ends. The base (flat side) is frequently pecked and ground to form a hollow or cavity and may have a central groove. More complex specimens may have a "keel" of varying width extending along the convex sur­ face from one end to the other. This keel may be hollowed-out to pro­ duce a V-shaped groove that in certain perforated types connects two holes. Specimens are sometimes notched at the ends, with the bottom faceted; others exhibit some form of incising or decoration. The ma­ jority of these artifacts are made of local materials, but obvious cases of importation are commonly found of cryptocrystalline rocks, i eous gn rocks and slate. This unique artifact is thought by some to be a weight attached to an atlatl to make it more controllable and hence more accurate, but replicative experiments have produced mixed results. Other authors hqave sugges ted use. as a charm stone, a fetish or a ceremonial object. They are sometimes found as grave goods. Distribution: Primarily northeast Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana, extending in a southwest direction well into cen­ tral Texas; scattered in other areas./Period: Archaic to Prehistoric./Sites: Ernest Witte; Fall Creek sites; Jonas Short Mound; George C. Davis; Smith Rockshelter 293

Stoae Artifacts of Texas ladaas CB.TS Ungrooved, or slightly grooved, axe-like stone implements that have been shaped by pecking and extensive grinding and polishing on the cutting end. They are usually round or oval in cross-section at the middle, and one end narrows into a slightly convex bit. The distinc­ tion between an adze and a celt is sometimes based on bit morphology; cqelts have b ifacially beveled bits, while adzes are unifacially beveled (Shafer 1973).

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians CRUCIFORMS Cruciform artifacts are found across the Southwest and into north­ ern Mexico. These specimens are occasionally found in far west Texas, usually made of obsidian, ground and smoothed to a matte surface. Their function is unknown. Trace element analysis of a cruciform found by Robert]. Mallouf at Indian Hot Springs, Hudspeth County, linked the obsidian to the Grants Ridge source, New Mexico.

Ground, Pecked and Polished Stone Artifacts METATES AND MANOS Metates, or milling stones, are usually made of sandstone and may have one or more grinding facets on one or both sides of the slab. They were used to process and grind wild plant foods, or in later cultures in parts of Texas (east Texas, especially) for grinding agricultural plants (maize). Krieger (Newell and Krieger 1949) believes that a distinc­ tion should be made between "milling stones," which are grinding slabs upon which a mano was moved in a rotary motion, and "metates," upon which a back-and-forth motion was used, in the Pueblo and Mid­ dle American manner. Manos are small, oval handstones of sandstone, quartzite or other stone shaped to match the style of the milling stone on which they were to be used. The basin shape of the milling-stone surface required a rotary-grinding motion or one in which sweeping arcs were made around the perimeter of the basin. Distribution: Widely found in Texas./Period: Archaic to Late Prehistoric./Sites: George C. Davis; Choke Canyon; Kyle; Oblate Mano 301

Discoidals are round stones with a centrally drilled perforation that were probably used in a game of skill. Gorgets found in burial con­ texts indicate that they were worn on the neck or on the chest, although other functions have been suggested (e.g., atlatl weights, arrow wrist­ guards ). Possible uses for plummets are as net weights, ornaments or weights for bolas for capturing small animals or waterfowl (Ford and Webb 1956).

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians PITTED STONES These are tabular pieces of sandstone or pitted cobbles having one or more pecked-out circular pits chipped into the grinding the worked underside or both, and generally of a size that could easily be carried in the hand. They are often called "nutting stones" and are at times difficult to distinguish from manos; probably they were used interchangeably for milling and for nut-cracking platforms. Honea (1965) and Johnson (1962b) suggest that they were possibly used as anvils in the bipolar-flaking technique the soft anvil giving the flint-knapper better control.

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians SHAFT STRAIGHTENERS These loaf-shaped artifacts are distinguished by the following characteristics: made on oblong, piano-convex cobbles, usually of lime­ stone; a deep transverse groove, which may or may not have per­ pendicular incised lines adjacent to or running through the groove (sometimes on(y the incised lines are present); and pinkish to red dis­ coloration of the limestone due to heating (indeed, some specimens appear to have been fractured through heating). Similar artifacts are found in the Southwest and in California. The examples from southern California are much like those from Texas and their function in arrow shaft straightening has been described by Kroeber ( 1925:530, Pl. 49): "the joints cane arrows) were warmed in the groove and bent by hand or on the ridge after the stone had been heated." Since most grooved stones found in Texas have uncertain contexts, it is not clear whether they have been used for dart shafts or arrow shafts. Distribution: South, central Texas./Period: Late Pre­ historic, perhaps Late Archaic./Sites: 41B X228; Choke Canyon; Edwards, Uvalde, Terrell, Dimmit and Zavala counties. 310

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians WACO "SINKERS" These are medium-sized stone artifacts generally fashioned from some form of quartz, or quartzite, water-worn pebble. Specimens range from thin, small and comparatively flat natural pebbles with worked notches in the ends, through crudely chipped and ground, to skillful­ ly shaped objects of highly specialized forms. Their use is undetermined; some have hypothesized that they were intended to function as "sinker weights" or as "bolas" stones. Distribution: Central Texas, but also found in adjacent areas./Period: Archaic./Sites: Yarbrough and Miller; Scor­ pion Cave; Wheeler and Lake Dallas; Fort Hood ) ·1,Jf� }?}t J'i! . .·. . . � ·. .: .. ·. . : : . : ..: \/._\:_:/_;:_:"::.:::-//. . ···:'·tT'.IITE0 .t . ," . · ...... ·: .... .. 316
