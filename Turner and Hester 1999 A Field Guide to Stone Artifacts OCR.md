AND USE OF STONE TOOLS

Crucial  to  the  study  of  projectile  points  and  other  stone
tools  is  an awareness  of the manufacturing techniques used to
produce them. Similarly, we must ask questions about how cer­
tain stone tool forms functioned in the daily life of ancient Indian
cultures.  Both  areas  of  inquiry  play  a  major  role  in  modern
archaeology.  Lithic  technology is the study of stone tools, from the
initial stages of manufacture through completion, use of the tool
in various ways and its eventual discard.  A great deal of atten­
tion has been given to tool manufacture;  archaeologists now ana­
lyze the thousands of waste flakes found at occupation sites, look­
ing for clues to the  manufacturing  process;  others have become
experts at replication, the experimental production of stone tools
using ancient techniques.

Stone tool function is another major concern within lithic tech­
nology.  Archaeologists formerly labeled tools  "knives"  or  "scrap­
ers" based on a subjective appraisal of their shape or form.  Now,
we  have  developed  sophisticated  techniques  of  microscopic
analysis that reveal minute traces of wear-and these wear pat­
terns are often diagnostic of specific tool functions.  Coupled with
microwear  studies  are  experiments  in  actual  tool  use-the
butchering of a  deer  with  stone  flakes,  making  a  spearthrower
with a stone scraper--designed both to see how a  specific  tool
form actually works under  "primitive"  conditions and to exam­
ine  the  microscopic  traces  of wear  produced  under controlled
experimentation.

Making Chipped  Stone Tools

The manufacture of stone tools is a subtractive process, a sys­
tematic  reduction  of  a  piece  of  stone  designed  to  achieve  a
desired shape.  The sequence of events that results in a finished
stone  tool  leaves  a  great  deal  of waste  debris  in the  archaeo­
logical record;  however,  even  this  material can  be  analyzed as
a  source  of information  on the  ancient  tool-making  process.

The raw material for stone tool making varies across the state,
although the most common is  chert or "flint."  Other rocks and
minerals  that  can be fractured  so that  shapes and sharp  edges
can  be  produced  include  chalcedony,  quartz  and  quartzite,
jasper, basalt and petrified wood. Obsidian, a volcanic glass,  does
not  occur  in artifact-quality form in  Texas,  and its  presence on
archaeological sites is  indicative  of ancient  trade.  Hester  et  al.

(1985,  1991a)  have  documented  obsidian  from  Mexico,  New
Mexico,  Idaho, and \Vyoming at Texas sites, utilizing techniques
such as X-ray fluorescence and neutron activation analysis.  Once
the  geologic  source  has  been  chemically  characterized,  the
obsidian of which an artifact is made can be  "fingerprinted" and
linked back to  its  source. Hester  et al.  ( 1985) found that  a  Clo­
vis-age biface from Kincaid  Rockshelter  ( 41 UV2) was made of
El  Paraiso obsidian, from  the  Mexican state of Queretaro 600
miles  to  the  southwest.  As  Hester  et  al.  ( 1991 a)  have  noted,
obsidian from the Malad source in southeastern Idaho  is wide­
spread  in Texas,  especially  at  Late  Prehistoric  sites along  the
Balcones  Escarpment.  This may  be  reflective  of a  north-south
trade network out of the Plains.  Sites along the  Colorado River
in  San  Saba  and  Llano  counties  have  also  yielded  pieces  of
obsidian,  many  of these  linked  to the  Obsidian  Cliff source at
Yellowstone  Park,  Wyoming.  New  Mexico  obsidian  is  scat­
tered  across  the  state.  Hester  et  al.  (1991b)  documented  Late
Archaic obsidian artifacts  at Arenosa Shelter  ( 41 VV99) in the
Lower Pecos. The obsidian was from the Cerro de  Toledo source
in  the  Jemez  Mountains  of  northern  New  Mexico.  Another
source in  that same  area,  Cerro del  Medio,  is also  widespread
in  Texas.  Obsidian  artifacts  are  particularly  common  in  the
Texas  Panhandle  and  most  are  attributable  to  interaction
between Pueblo and Plains Native American groups in  Late  Pre­
historic  times.

Cherts  and  other  cryptocrystalline  materials  occur  in  the
form of seams,  ledges, nodules and cobbles at various outcrops
in different parts of the state. The serious lithic researcher should
obtain a  copy  of Banks  ( 1990),  the  only available comprehen­
sive  study  of stone tool resources  in  Texas  and adjacent states
(see  also  Holliday and Welty  1981).

Fig.  2-2  shows  the  location  of  some  of  the  major  lithic
resources in Texas, as described by Banks (1990). Some of these
resources are widespread, such as the Catahoula Formation, with
quartzites  and  petrified  woods  (from  the  overlying  Fleming
Formation).  The  Uvalde  Gravels,  usually  small  lag  gravels  of
chert,  quartz,  quartzite,  jasper,  limestone  and  silicified  wood,
occur  widely  in  the state  and  are  especially  common  in  South
Texas,  where  they  cap  the  hills  and  high  terraces  (Hester
1975).  Along the Rio  Grande,  the  "Rio  Grande  Gravels" con-

The Edwards Plateau is, according to Banks ( 1990:59),  "one
of  the  largest  sources  of  chert  in  the  United  States."  The
Edwards limestone formation contains seams, ledges, beds and
nodules  of high quality chert.  For example, on  the north side
of  San  Antonio,  there  are  extensive  exposures  of  Edwards

cherts,  often a f ine-grained grey  to brown material,  and  there
are  many  quarry  locales  where  these  were  procured  by  the
ancient  peoples  of  that  region  (McGraw  and  Valdez  1978;
Katz  1987;  Daniel R.  Potter,  personal communication).  In the
Georgetown area,  there is a dark gray to blue chert of exceed­
ingly  good  quality,  used  extensively  in  prehistoric  times  and
sought  today  by flintknappers.  In the Junction  area,  a "root-beer
colored  translucent  chert"  (Banks  1990:60)  is  often  found  in
archaeological  sites  and  ancient  quarry  exposures.  The  Llano
Uplift,  or  Central  Mineral  Region,  of central  Texas  contains
some distinctive  cherts,  but was  also used  in ancient times  for
the procurement of serpentine and soapstone and granites used
locally  for milling  implements.

The  Trans-Pecos,  including the  Big Bend,  has several  chert
sources.  One of  the  best  known is  the  "Burro  Mesa"  material
(Banks  1990:84),  a  colorful  chert with  variegated  red,  brown,
white colors,  often striped or mottled.  The Caballos Novaculite
(lbid.:85)  of  West  Texas  yields  a  chert,  glassy  in texture,  and
blue, gray to green in  color. A white novaculite is also present,
and  Banks  ( 1990:86)  reports  that  it  encompasses  the  whole
1200-ft  high north face of Caballos  Mountain.

On the L lano Estacado, the most famous raw material source
is  Alibates,  found  along  the  Canadian  River.  Many  of  the
major  quarries  are  now  part  of  a  national  monument.  This
"chert" (agatized dolomite) ranges in color from white, yellow,
red  or  purple--often  mottled  or  striped  combinations.  It  is
known  to  have  been  procured  for  stone  tools  beginning  in
Paleo-Indian times,  and widely traded in the Plains and in Texas
(e.g.,  Mallouf  and  Wulfkuhle  I 991  report  a  cache  of  Alibates
cores and  bifaces in southwestern  Kansas).

The Tecovas cherts or jaspers occur near Quitaque and into
Oldham County, not far from  Alibates,  and are sometimes con­
fused with it.  They have color combinations or ranges of white,
yellow,  red,  and brown-often characterized  by white speckles
(A. J.  Taylor,  personal communication).

In north central Texas,  the Callahan Divide, just north of the
Edwards Plateau, is the source of high quality light gray to blue­
gray  cherts.  These  occur  in  lenses  and  nodules  in  that  area
(Banks  1990).

1he Manufacture and Use of Stone Tools

A sampling of other  Texas  lithic  resources,  studied in detail
by Banks ( 1990), include  Manning  Fused Glass (formed by the
"fusion  of  volcanic  ash  as  a  result of burning  lignite  underly­
ing the ash itself"  [Ibid.:53]) found in east and southeast Texas
(see Brown  1976;  it is often a light grayish blue,  used from  San
Patrice times up through Caddo  [Shafer  1973]); the Yegua Grav­
els-quartzites and petrified woods in East Texas  (fig.  2-3);  the
Pisgah  Ridge Cherts,  in the  Corsicana-Richland  Creek areas  of
north  Texas;  the  "ironized  sandstone"  of  the  ·woodbine  For­
mation  in  the  Eastern  Cross  Timbers,  used for metates, axes,
and choppers  (Banks  1990); the Markley Conglomerates,  in the
Brazos River area near Graham, where workshops of chert and
quartzite  are  found;  and  the  Antlers  Formation,  exposures  of

chert  and  quartzite  gravels  in  the  San  Angelo  area  (Banks
1990).

In  some  areas,  where chert  or quartzite  was  not  of the best
quality for faking, the prehistoric Indians would subject the cob­
bles  to  heat  treatment.  This  could consist  of baking the mate­
rials in  the  coals  of a campfire for up to 48  hours.  Most often,
the chert  would change in microcrystalline structure,  making it
easier to chip; heat treating is evident in some areas of the state:

it  produces  a  pink  to  purple  discoloration  of the  chert,  along
with a vitreous "greasy"  appearance (Hester and Collins  19 7 4 ).
Thus, in order to initiate the making of a stone tool, the pre­
historic knapper had to find the right type  of stone,  and some­
times had to alter it through  heat  treatment,  before beginning
to  work  it.  The subsequent reduction  process  that  resulted  in
the manufacture of a tool could take several different trajectories
(Patterson  1977;  Tunnell  1978;  Fox et al.  1974).  Most typically,

The Manufacture and Use of Stone Tools

in the manufacture of a bijace (especially a dart point),  a core was
formed by strikingflakes off a cobble using a hammerstone percussion
technique  (see figs.  2- l  and  2-4  through  2-8).  The  first  flake
removed from  the  cobble  created  a plaiform,  and  by directing
percussion blows at  the edge of the platform,  additional flakes
were detached from the sides of the core.  Ideally,  the knapper
was looking for a flake of appropriate size and thickness for fur­
ther reduction into a bifacial point.  First,  however,  the exterior
surface  (cortex)  of the core  had  to  be f aked  away,  creating  dis­
tinctive  primary  cortex  flakes.  Further  chipping  produced  sec
ondary  flakes,  showing both earlier flake removals and traces of
remaining  cortex  (fig.  2-9).  Finally,  interior  flakes,  with  no
remaining  surface  cortex,  could  be  struck  off,  and  one  of
appropriate size selected  for further work.  Bifacial  chipping·�
removing small flakes on both sides by striking  at  the edges of
the flake�proceeded using  hammerstone  or  billet percussion.
It was then a question of continued thinning  and shaping of the
flake,  leading  to final  completion  of a  point.  Very  often,  the
knapper  would  make  a  mistake  or  would  encounter  a  flaw  in
the chert. The partly completed specimen would be discarded.
These abortive efforts at tool-making are,  of course,  preserved

in  archaeological  sites  and  represent  "fossilized"  stages in  bifa­
cial  reduction.  Archaeologists  once  simply  described  these  as
"knives"  or put  certain  shapes  into  specific  "point"  types,  not
reaiizing  that  they  were  looking  at  part  of  a  process.  The
larger,  thick  bifaces  at  the  beginning of the  process  are  often
called blanks  ( or quarry blanks; fig.  2- 1 0).  They often have cor­
tex on one or both surfaces,  particularly
instead of reducing
a  core  and  picking  proper-sized  flakes,  the  knapper  chose  to
reduce  a  tabular  cobble  with  the  intention  of  chipping it  into
a  finished product  (fig.  2-7).
The  "quarry  blanks"  (fig.

crudely  flaked,  are characteristic  of quarry  and lithic process-

ing sites  found  at  raw  material  outcrops.  Sometimes,  the  thin­
ner, better made blanks were collected and buried in "caches"-­
items perhaps hidden away  for  future  use  or  being transported
as part of a  trade  network.  These  "cache  bifaces"  (fig.  2 - 1
often in  groups of 30 or more  specimens-are intriguing, as their
reasons for their deposition in caches  reflects  ancient behaviors
which  we  know little  about  (Miller,  ms.;  Bement  1 99 1 a).  Cur­
tis  D.  Tunnell  and  Robert J. Mallouf,  of the  Texas  Historical
Commission,  have  been  doing  studies  of such caches through­
out  the  state,  as  has  Kevin  Miller  at  The  University  of Texas
at Austin  (see  also  Fields  et  al.  1 99 1  a,  1 9 9 1  b).

Sometimes,  the  large,  thin  blanks  occur  as  single  specimens
found at a  considerable  distance from  the raw material source.
These  can  be  described  as  "trade  blanks"  (fig.  2- l 2),  having
entered  into  other  areas  through  prehistoric  trade  (see  Hester
and Barber  1 990).  Such large bifaces also  sometimes end up in
mortuary  offerings,  as  documented  by  Taylor  and  Highley
(ms.) at the  Loma Sandia (4 l LK28) Archaic cemetery in South
Texas.

If,  however,  the  biface blank  continued  to  be  thinned  and
reduced in  a  lithic reduction  sequence,  it entered  a  stage  that
we  call a preform (fig. 2- l 0). While preforms may themselves go
through  several  stages,  they  are  generally  fairly  thin  and
approach  the  shape  and  size  needed  for  the  final  artifact.
Indeed,  when  the  preform has  been  thinned  as  much  as possi­
ble  by  hammerstone  percussion  (or,  in  some  areas,  by  percus­
sion  with  antler  cylinder-hammers  or  billets),  pressure-flaking
with a  deer antler tine (fig.  2- l )  is used to finish and straighten
the edges and  to  form the notches and  stem  that serve  to com­
plete the projectile point.  The classification of preforms presents
a  number of problems.  Some  of the projectile  point  types that
we  describe in a following section of the book are probably pre­
forms (the Almagre specimens may be unfinished Langtry points;
Pandora and Refugio may not be valid types at all,  but rather pre­
forms  for  several  different  point  styles!).  Thus,  in  assigning
types  when  sorting  a  large  stone  tool  collection,  the  archaeol­
ogist  has  to view the whole  range of chipped  stone  lithics with
an eye to  the tool-making process.  Specimens  that may be pre­
forms  have  to  be  examined  for  evidence  as  to  why  they  were

flakes known as blades (figs.  2-9  and  2- 1 4), yet some go  through
a  preform  phase.  And,  if  the  point  is  never  completed,  the
archaeologist recovers  tiny, arrow point-sized preforms  at  the
prehistoric camp site (fig.
1 5). Again,  if the reduction process
is not  kept  in  mind,  some  of these  preforms  may erroneously
be classified as arrow point "types" (for example, the "Granbury"
type defined in central Texas in the  1 960s, or perhaps  the  Cliffion
and  Young  points described below).

Making a  uniface,  a  stone  tool  chipped  on  one face (see chap­
ter 5), is not as  complex  as  biface reduction. A core is reduced
and selected flakes used for uniface manufacture. Some unifaces,
typically  called  scrapers,  are  fairly  casually  made,  with  an  edge
formed  by  chipping  along  one  side  of a  flake.  Others  reflect
much more  care,  both  in the selection of a  proper flake and in
careful  chipping  to form the working edges  and  to  achieve  a
desired shape.  End  scraper u nifaces are  particularly character­
istic of this kind of careful treatment,  often being made  on  long
flakes or blades.  On occasion, unifaces or blades destined for uni­
face manufacture have  been  found,  like  biface blanks, stored or
hidden away as caches (for example, the  Gibson cache in Coke
County,  reported  in  Tunnell  1 9 78,  and  the  Brookeen  Creek
cache  in Hill  C ounty,  described  in Mallouf 1 98 l a).

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians

The  finished artifact, be it point or scraper,  has  a  "life  span"
during which it may undergo modifications that will significantly
alter  its  shape.  Some  specimens  which  we  classify  as  projectile
points  may,  like  the  Kinnry  type,  actually  have  been  used  as
knives. Use of the cutting edge causes dulling,  and the edge then
has  to  be  rechipped or beveled,  often giving the  specimen  a  dif­
ferent shape.  (A bevel is a  steeply  angled edge, usually on a biface
edge,  that usually  results  from  resharpening of that edge.)  See
also  Patterson  and  Sollberger  1 990.

Examples of reworking or resharpening of formal lithic tools
are common in Texas. For example, the two-and-four beveled
knives (pp.  2 7 4-276) were extensively resharpened during use,
often  causing changes in overall outline.  The  so-called Meserve
points  (p.  1 54)  may  be  little  more  than Plainview,  Golondrina  or
Dalton points that have been extensively reworked,  either because
of breakage  or  because  they were  used  as knives  and resharp­
ened.  Goodyear ( 1 974:29) has done a  study of Dalton points  and
records  the different  shapes  that they take as they are resharp­
ened  and  modified  during use.

Sometimes  a  projectile  point was  broken  by impact when it
hit a bone in an animal carcass or missed its target,  striking the
ground.  Perhaps rather than removing the point from the shaft,
the broken tip was  rechipped,  producing  a  distinctly  different
shape  for the  distal  end  (see  the  examples under  Pedernales,  p.
1 7 1-1 73). The projectile point stems often were fractured or bro­
ken  and  could  have conceivably been  reworked. Flenniken  and
Raymond  ( 1 986)  and  Flenniken  and  Wilke  ( 1 989)  have  used
experimental  data  on  stem  breakage  and  subsequent  stem
reworking  as  an  argument  against  the  utility  of point types  as
time  markers  in  the  Great  Basin  (Bettinger,  O'Connell  and
Thomas ( 1 99 1 )  present a very different view, arguing that these
experimental  data  do  not change  the  archaeologically  observ­
able  evidence  that  point forms do indeed change through time.)
Our  experience  in  excavating  and  analyzing  projectile  point
forms,  especially  in  central  Texas,  indicates  that  stem  shapes
were important (for whatever reason) to the prehistoric peoples
and that a great deal of attention was given to stem detail. When
stems were broken and reworked, the ancient craftsman seemed
intent on restoring their original shape  (the  "mental template"
concept  that  we  discussed  earlier  in  terms  of our  typological

approach).  Of course, in  the  analysis of hundreds of points from
a  site, there are always a  number whose stems or other attrib­
utes do  not permit classification; these  may  either be unrecog­
nized  types,  unique  specimens,  or  the  reworking  of a  stem  in
a  casual  fashion.  As  is  clear  on  preforms  from  central  Texas,
the  careful  shaping  of the  stem-on  a  biface  or  large  flake
blank-preceded the completion of the point (see  Hester  1988a).
This certainly suggests that standardized stem shape or form was
important in prehistoric Texas point-making technologies.

The Manufacture and Use of Stone Tools

The  completed  artifact  was  often  hafted  for  use.  This  is
obvious with the projectile points; the shape of their stem often
reflects how they were inserted and bound on a spear or arrow
shaft. Archaeologically, we can see examples of hafting from pre­
served  specimens  found  in  lower  Pecos  caves.  Figure  2 - 1 6
shows  a hafted Langtry point and  a  h afted  T (!Yah point. H afting
the  specimen  on  a  shaft  may  require  binding  with  cordage  or
application  of a  gummy  resin (as with  the  Langtry  point  in  fig.
2- 1 6)  or  use  of natural  tar  or  asp haltum.  The  latter  is  seen  on
the bases of lvforhiss  dart points from Victoria and Goliad coun­
ties.  Some large,  thin, triangular bifaces were hafted as knives,
as  in  the illustrated example  from  the Cueva de la Candelaria
burial  cave  in  southwest  Coahuila,  Mexico  (fig.  2 - 1 7).  The
biface  base was  set into a  shallow notch in  the wooden  handle
and secured in  place with  pine  resin.  Of course,  some  bifaces
were  hand-held  during  use;  an  example  is  the  butted  knife,
chipped  so  that  it  would  fit easily in  the palm  of the h and.

Unifaces,  too,  were  usually  hafted,  although  some  l arge
gouges  and  scrapers  may  have  been  hand-held.  We o ften  see
efforts  at  thinning  the  end  of  the  uniface,  such  as  an  end
scraper, opposite  the  thick working end,  suggesting that  it was
to be inserted into  a  haft.  Tiny end  scrapers had to be  hafted,
especially those used in such tasks as working bison hide. Many
of these may have been inserted in L-shaped handles of the kind
used by Plains Indians in early historic  times (Wedel  1 970; Met­
calf  1 970).  Others  may  have  been  placed  at  the  end  of long
straight handles, as is the  example  in figure 2- 1 8  from  a south­
west  Coahuila,  Mexico,  cave.  C asually  chipped  unifaces  or
edge-trimmed flakes were, somewhat surprisingly, also hafted at
times. There are surviving examples from the dry caves of the
lower  Pecos  region,  including  a  tiny  flake  hafted  in  a  split
sotol stem and a  pointed,  trimmed uniface set into  a  socket in
the  middle of a short wooden handle  (see  fig.  2- 1 9).  Some haft­
ing may have  been  informal,  simply wrapping the  end of a flake
or uniface with  a strip of leather or a  plant leaf,  to keep  it from
cutting  one's  hand  during  use.  At  the  Witte  Museum  in  San
Antonio,  the  lower  Pecos  collections  include  a  sharp-edged
flake  set  in  a  "handle"  or  sheath  made  of woven  basketry
(Shafer  1 986: 1 23).  Thus, when we look at stone  tools from most

parts of Texas, where preservation  is  usually poor,  we  have  to
keep  in mind that  tools were  probably hafted in a variety of ways
(for  further  examples  from  the  western  United  States,  see
Heizer  1 970; Hester  1 97 0b,  1 974).

Some further comments are offered here regarding the occur­
rence of blades and blade cores in Texas archaeological sites. Exam­
ples are illustrated in figs. 2-20, 2-2 1  and  2-22. A blade is a long,
parallel-edged flake  resulting from intentional removal (by per­
cussion)  from  a  specially prepared  blade  core.  Blade-like  flakes
sometimes occur in the flake  technologies so common in Texas,
but here we are describing a specialized core-blade technology.
Such a technology can be  seen in the Late Prehistoric in  Texas,
along the coast (Hester and Shafer  1 975) and in the Toyah Phase
of central  Texas  (Green  and  Hester  l 9 7 3;  see  fig.  2).  On  the
coast,  blade-making  may  have  been  an  efficient  way  to  use
scarce  chert  resources.  In  the  Toyah  Phase,  blades  were  used
in making Perdi;:, points (Green and Hester  1 973: Fig.  2) and uni­
facial  end  scrapers  (Ibid.:Fig.  5).

However,  recent  studies  have  shown  that  core-blade  tech­
nology was important in Clovis times,  l l ,200 years ago.  Green
( 1 963) initially reported  a  cache  of Clovis blades from Black­
water  Draw,  the  Clovis  type  site.  In  addition,  Young  and

Collins ( 1 989) describe a cache of Clovis blades found  near the
Trinity River  in  Navarro  County  (fig.  2-2 1 ).  The  specialized
blade cores from which these have been removed are noted by

Clovis blade core was excavated by Hester and Collins in  1 99 1
at the Gault site ( 4 l BL323) in central Texas (fig.  2-22). The dis­
tinctly  curved  C lovis  blades  (fig.  2-2 l )   and  the  polyhedral,

pattern  that will  surely  be  recognized  at more  and  more  sites
across  the  state.

Determining the  Function of Stone  Tools

Over  the  past two  decades, there has been intensive archae­
ological research directed at scientific determination of tool func­
tion. Many early typologies of stone tools were  based  largely  on
tool shape and the function such shape suggested (knife, scraper,
chopper,  gouge).  Spurred  largely  by  the  pioneering efforts  of
Semenov ( 1 964),  archaeologists have  developed  ways of ascer­
taining the  actual  function  of a  prehistoric  tool.  Most investi­
gations  have  combined  microscopic  examination of tool edges
with experimental use of tools in various tasks required of pre­
historic cultures.

Microscopic  investigations,  called  wear  pattern  studies,  have
led  to  the  recognition  of specific  traces of ancient  tool  use-­
polish  resulting  from  cutting  meat  or soft  plants,  scratches  or
striations linked to scraping hides and crushing of the edges from
c utting  bone  or  scraping  wood.  Some  of  this  wear  can  be
observed under low-power microscopes (up to 7 5X); some can
only  be  seen  or  interpreted  u nder  high-power  microscopes
(I ,OOOX). Some research has even been done with powerful scan­
ning electron microscopes ( 1 0,000X). \Vear pattern research indi­
cates that some tools had  specific tasks, while others were  used
for many activities, as a pocket-knife would be used today. \Ve
have learned that some artifacts thought to  be projectile points
were actually used as knives and vice versa. Some "scraper" uni­
faces  were  used  as  cutting  and  slicing tools.  "Gouge"  bifaces
sometimes functioned as adzes in woodworking.  In many cases,
we cannot immediately interpret the observed wear patterns; this
requires controlled experiments with stone tools on wood, hide
and plants, with  subsequent  microscopic  study  of the  experi­
mental edge to see what kind of wear resulted.  Although  great
progress  has  been  made  in  this  type  of study  in  recent  years
(Keeley  1 980), it still  remains  more  an  art  than  a  science  and
requires many hours of intensive microscopic research.  Still, it
provides a way for archaeologists to understand better how tools
were  actually  used  and  to  sort  them  into  meaningful  func­
tional categories.

Another avenue  of determining tool use  is  through  residue
analysis. Shafer and Holloway  (1 979) have applied this technique

40

The Manufacture and Use of Stone Tools

to  flake  tools  from  Hinds  Cave  in  Val  Verde  County,  Texas.
Using analyses  of organic residues  still adhering to chert  flakes
from this dry  cave,  they were able to determine what the flakes
were being used for  (mostly  cutting  and processing plants) and
what types  of plants  were being used. Studies like  this indicate
that  many  of the stone  tools of aboriginal groups were  the  so­
called  waste  flakes- the  debris  from  tool-making.  If  a  casual
knife  or  scraper  was  needed,  it  seems  likely  that  a  flake  was
picked up, used one or  twice and then discarded.  Little visible
evidence of use is left on the tools,  although microscopic study
of  flake  edges,  and  the  rare  and  fortunate  preservation  of
organic  residues,  can  give  us  clues as  to  their  actual function.
Residues identified as asphaltum are often seen on the stems
of ,\1orhiss points and on other lithics from the Texas coast. This
refects  the  use  of this  natural  tar in  hafting  the artifact.

More recent studies have focused on fatty acids, or lipids,  that
have  survived  as  residues  on  ancient  artifacts.  Marchbanks
( 1 989) was able to recover and identify, as plant or animal,  such
residues  from Caddoan ceramic  vessels,  and has  done  similar
research with  residues  on stone  tools.  Some  residues have been
identified  as  human  or  animal  blood  (Loy  1 983),  although  a
recent review of some  of these  analytical procedures has raised
serious question as to their validity (Manning  1 99 1  ). Needless to
say,  archaeological  lithics from  dry  caves are prime candidates
for residue preservation and should not  be handled or washed.
It  is even  possible  that  certain  kinds  of residues  are  preserved
on  lithics  from  open  sites  and  some  archaeologists are  careful
not  to handle or to wash stone  tools as they  come into the lab­
oratory. The coming decade should shed much new light on this
potentially exciting avenue of research.  Obviously,  if the reader
encounters  a  stone  artifact  with  residue,  great  care  should  be
taken  to  preserve  it.

Detailed  wear  pattern  research  is  desperately  needed  for
Texas  stone  tools.  Some good studies have been done, but more
intensive work  is  necessary.  For example,  there are only a  few
wear  pattern  studies  of corner-tang  bifaces.  These  specimens
elicit much  interest,  but  six  decades  after  they were  first  pub­
lished,  we still  do not know how  they were used.  Similarly,  the
"butted knife"  bifaces of Late Archaic central Texas exhibit vis-

ible polish on the tips; it might result from cutting meat or slic­
ing up soft plants, but no detailed wear research has been done
to shed light on this situation. Later in the book we present a
whole series of biface types (Friday, Hare, San  Gabriel ); are  these
"knives"  as  some  have  suggested  or are  they  preforms?  Only
wear pattern research can offer a solution. The various "gouges"
( Clear  Fork,  Erath,  Nueces)  might  have  been  used  to  gouge,  to
scrape,  to adze we  simply do  not know  (there  has  been  sub­
stantial wear pattern study of some varieties of Clear Fork tools;
see  Hester,  Albee  and  Gilbow  1 97 3 ;   Howard  I 9 7 3;  Shiner
1 975; Chandler  1 9 74). (Sequences of gouge-like bifaces and uni­
faces  can  be  demonstrated for  some  areas.  See fig.  2-23.)  We

shall be  forced to  make inferences, based on limited studies and
guesswork, about the role of these tools in ancient lifeways until
detailed  use-wear research  is carried  out and published.

Some  prehistoric  tool forms  are  perplexing  from  the  stand­
point  of both  technology  and  function.  Perhaps most intrigu­
ing in this regard is the burin  (fig. 2-24),  a  form first recognized
in the Texas area by Epstein  (l 963).  Burins had long been known
in  Europe  (see  Pitzer  1 9 7 7).  They  are  tools  formed  by  the
removal  of long,  narrow, sliver-like flakes (burin spalls),  which
create a  chisel-like  edge. The term burin  also refers to the  chip­
ping technology that forms the burin edge-·precise percussion
blows often directed perpendicular to the long axis of the spec­
imen. B urins can be formed on flakes, on broken bifaces or on
projectile points.  Often, we do not understand why a burin was
created; for example, why some Paleo-Indian points have burins
at the  corners of the base. Another type of burin is seen on  Olmos
bifaces,  apparently a  technique  to  resharpen  a  dulled working
edge.  Burins  probably  designed  to  serve  as  engraving or incis­
ing tools have been  made on flakes found in lower Pecos caves
and  in  central Texas  (Epstein  1 963; Sorrow,  Shafer and  Ross
1 967).  However,  in  many cases,  microscopic  examination  of a
burin indicates no evidence  of use.  Indeed,  in  many cases,  the
burin is actually a  "core"; the knapper was after the burin spall
detached during this process.  Such  spalls  make excellent drills,
especially for boring  shell  and other  tough materials. We have
not included burins in our formal descriptions,  because they are
found  on  such  a  wide  variety  of lithic  artifacts,  are  of uncer­
tain function and may have been formed primarily for the pro­
duction of the spalls and not the burin edge itself. This is another
area  of stone  tool  technology  in  Texas  that  needs  much  more
research.

3.  CONTEXT AND CHRONOLOGY  �  I

Stone  tools  occur  at  a  variety  of prehistoric  archaeological
sites. Just how they occur provides information on the function
of the  site  and  on  the  ancient activities  that were carried  out
there.  This is what we call context- the  relati onship of the arti­
facts to one another and to the site deposits within which they
are found.

In addition to contextual information, stone tools can also pro­
vide  data on the  age  or  antiquity of a  site.  Although they can­
not be directly dated,  associated organic  remains (such as wood
charcoal  from  a  hearth)  can  be  assayed  by  the  radiocarbon
method, yielding a date for the points and tools at the same level
of the  hearth.  Excavations  can  also  provide  relative  d ates,  by
determining which  styles of artifacts are earlier or later than oth­
ers.  Once  a  chronology  is  established  at several  regional  sites,
types  of known  dates  can  then be  related  to  the  same  type at
other sites.  Gradually, a  framework of prehistoric cultural pat­
terns can be built up in a sequential fashion.  Many of the types
described  in  this  book  are  "time-sensitive";  excavation  and
subsequent  analyses  have  shown  that  they  change  through
time, making them valuable chronological aids for archaeological
research.

Context

An  archaeological  site  is,  technically,  any  spot  on  the land­
scape that has been  modified by humans.  Common among these

45

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians

are campsites,  where d aily life  took place;  quarries or lithic processing
areas,  the locales of stone•chipping;  temporary campsites,  representing
brief hunting or  gathering for ays;  kill sites,  where bison  or other
m ammals  were  slaughtered  and  butchered;  rock  art  sites,  over­
hangs or shelters with pictographs (rock  paintings)  or petroglyphs
(rock  c arvings);  caves  and  rockshelters,  protected  overhangs  in
can yon  walls,  whic h  some Ind ian  groups,  particularly  in  west
T ex as,  used  for  daily occupation;  mound sites,  purposeful  accu­
mulations of earth,  found  in  east Texas,  used  as platform s for
dwellings or  for  burials;  burned rock middens,  inc iden tal acc umu•
lations  of  f ire-cracked  r ock,  often  in  a  m oundlike  fashion,
found  associated  with c ampsites in central and  west Tex as;  shell
middens,  accumulations of shellfish c ollected  as food,  princ ipally
of oyster  shell on  the central c oast and Rangia clam  on  the upper
c oast;  cemetery  sites,  specific  areas for  the  d isposal of  the dead,
found in the Late Archaic  and Late Prehistoric  eras in c entr al,
c oastal and  east Texas.

This  is  by  no  m eans  an  exhaustive  c atalog  of site  types  in
Texas,  but serves to  suggest the d iverse ways in  which the anc ient
populations utilized  the terrain  and  took advantage of its plan t
and  an imal resourc es.  At man y  of these  sites,  the only surviv­
ing cultural remains are stone tools. If we are to understand  the
prehistoric  use of the site,  and  indeed  spec ific  activities within
the  site  boundar ies,  it  is  importan t  that  we  know the  c ontext
of the  ston e  tools.

For  example,  at kill sites,  proper  exc avation  will  usually d is­
c ov er  proj ectile points and  cutting  or  butcherin g tools  in  asso­
c iation  with the  animal  bones.  The m ost c ommon  type of kill­
site in Texas is the  bison-kill  of P aleo-Ind ian  times,  from 9200
to 6000 B.C .   For  example,  at Bonfire S helter  n ear  Lan gtry in
Val Verde C ounty,  excav ations revealed  a mass of  bison  remains
associated  with Folsom and Plainview  points,  acc ompanied  by mis­
c ellaneously shaped  flakes  and  bifaces  used  for  processin g  the
slaughtered  an im als (D ibble  and  L orrain  1968) .

A t  quarries  or lithic processin,g areas,  c ontrolled  surface c ollec tion
will often  yield  great numbers of large,  crudely chipped  bifaces,
the  early  stage  of  tool-makin g  known  as  the  quarry  blank
(Kelly  and  Hester  197 5 ) .   Rarely are  proj ectile  points or  other
finished  tools  found,  since this  is a locality where the  basic  lev -

46

Context and Chronology

els  of stone-working took place-securing good chipping mate­
rials, removing cortex flakes from  the cobbles and roughing-out
the blanks  for further reduction elsewhere.  These are important
sites  for  archaeological  study,  though  they  have  long  been
ignored,  as  they  shed  a  great  deal  of light  on  a  fundamental
activity in prehistoric cultures  (Lukowski  1987).

Campsites  are,  throughout  the  state,  found  along  streams  or
other water sources;  most are "open occupation"  sites,  though
caves  and  rockshelters  were  themselves often used  for  habita­
tion.  Many represent  the villages  of hunters  and gatherers,  the
main way of life throughout ancient Texas, until late times, when
farming was introduced  in east  Texas and  in parts of the Pan­
handle  and far west Texas.  They were the locales  of daily life
and  were  perhaps occupied  for  a  few weeks  or  months, before
the group moved on  to  exploit  the plant  and  animal foods  of
another  area.  These  are  the  most  common sites  and  contain
great  quantities  of stone  tools,  fl akes  and  other  debris.  Context
is particularly important in these sites. Even the surface collecting
of an  eroded  campsite can ruin fragile patterns  of tool  distrib­
ution which,  under controlled conditions, might tell the archae­
ologist a  great  deal  about  site function  and  the  ways  in which
different parts of the site were used.  Excavation presents an even
larger  challenge.  Test  pits  can  plumb  the  depths  of  the  site,
sometimes giving us information on the sequence of occupations
by  recovering  stone  tool  types  from  different levels.  However,
to understand  the behavior of the ancient  inhabitants  and the
activities  they carried out,  a fairly large block or open area exca­
vation is usually required.  In this  fashion,  we can plot in place
the projectile points,  scrapers, choppers  and flakes and study the
patterns  of their  horizontal  distribution.  This often  shows  the
archaeologist  where  tool-making  took  place,  where  animals
were  being  skinned  and  butchered,  where  bone  tools  were
being made or wooden spear shafts fashioned-the relationships
of the  tools  to the area of the site  and to other stone tools  pro­
vides,  then,  contextual information vital  to  archaeological inter­
pretation.

We hope these comments serve to demonstrate that not only
are the  artifacts  important, but their relationships within a  site
are even more crucial. Casual collecting and indiscriminate dig-

47

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians

ging destroy these vital links. Thus, a cigarbox of points dug out
of a  site by  an  untrained  person  may make  an  interesting  col­
lection  to  show  friends,  but  it  has  little  or  no  scientific value
in  the  study  of  ancient  Texas Indians.  Only  through  proper
recording and documentation in the f ield, and follow-up cata­
loging once back from the site, will the materials have any last­
ing  meaning.  It  is  beyond  the scope of this book to detail  the
procedures of  recording  and  cataloging.  We  have included as
Appendix 6 a Projectile Point Analysis Form that may be of use.
A  number  of  books  and  manuals  are  available  through  local
archaeological societies or through bookstores.  A partial list of
these includes  Hester ( 1980),  Hemion ( l  983), J oukowsky ( 1980),
Dancey  (1981),  Fladmark (1978), Barker (1982),  Hester,  Heizer
and Graham  (1975)  and Hester,  et al.  (in preparation).  Proper
f ield  and  laboratory  methods  cannot  be  fully  learned  from  a
book,  and  we  encourage  interested  readers  to  join  the  Texas
Archeological  Society and their local  or  regional archaeologi­
cal societies in order to take advantage of the training oppor­
tunities these  organizations provide.

Chronology

In  this  section,  we  have  two  objectives:  f irst,  briefly  to
describe some of the  dating methods used to ascertain the age
of stone tools; second, to review the general  cultural sequence
as it  is known statewide.

There  arc  basically  two  types  of  archaeological  dating:
absolute  and  relative.  Absolute  dating  provides  calendrical
dates  for  archaeological  remains.  The most widely used  tech­
nique in this  regard is  radiocarbon dating.  It can only  be used
for  organic  remains  (charcoal,  wood,  plant  parts,  etc.)  that
have  been  preserved  in  archaeological  sites.  A  date  obtained
through  this  method  has  little  significance  unless  the  archae­
ologist  is  certain  of  its  association  with  distinctive  cultural
remains.  One date often means  very  little;  we  generally  need
a series of dates in order to ascertain the age of a particular cul­
tural  level  which might  contain  diagnostic kinds of stone  tools.
Radiocarbon  dating  is  also  expensive,  with  most  laboratories
charging  around  $200  per  sample.  Samples  of  ideal  size  are

48

Context and Chronologr

around  I O  grams  or more  of charcoal; even then,  the  resulting
date is expressed with a possible  range of error, perhaps 50- 100
years earlier or later than the central date.  Still, this is the most
widely applied and most useful of the absolute dating techniques
in North America.  Other methods of absolute  dating can be used
in some  areas,  but  most  are still  experimental in  their  applica­
tion;  good general archaeology texts, such as  Fagan ( 198 1 ), pro­
vide  a  review  of  such  techniques  as  thermoluminescence,
archaeomagnetic dating, dendrochronology and obsidian hydra­
tion  dating.  Thermoluminescence,  the  measurement  of  alpha
particles emitted from ceramics or other fired or burned mate­
rials, and archaeomagnetic dating, the study of remanen t  mag­
netism  in heated clays (such as firepits or hearths),  have  been
used for some  Texas sites  and  materials,  but  their  application
is still  limited.

Relative dating provides the  archaeologist not with calendar
dates,  but with approximate  ages based on the vertical context
of archaeological specimens.  In  an excavation,  a  certain point
type  may be  found  at  a  level  deeper than  another  style;  thus,
we  can  date  it as older  than this latter type on a  relative  basis.
Stratigraphy plays the key role in relative dating.  If excavations
reveal  a  sequence  of  occupational  deposits,  we  can  assume
that  materials  in the  bottom zone  are  the  earliest,  those  in  the
middle  come  later  and so  on.  Stratigraphic data from  a  series
of sites allow cross-comparison of site sequences and permit the
archaeologist  to  build  a  chronology of  cultural  patterns  for  a
region.  In some central Texas and lower  Pecos sites, where  there
are  deep middens representing repeated occupations over thou­
sands of years,  a detailed chronology  can  be  developed,  based
on  relative  dating  established  through  stratigraphy.  In  other
areas,  as in the  campsites of south Texas,  archaeological remains
are more scattered,  and constructing  a sequence of artifact forms
based on excavations  can be a long, slow process
Hall, Black
and  Graves  1 982;  H all,  Hester and  Black  1986).

Cross-dating  is  an  important  technique  for  establishing  the
age  of  archaeological  sites  in  some  parts  of  the  state.  This
involves  comparison  of  artifacts  of the  same  type  among  sites
within a  region or between regions.  For example,  as excavation
of stratified sites continues in  central  Texas,  and  as  some  cul-

49

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians

tural  patterns  and  their  diagnostic  artifacts  are  radiocarbon
dated,  it  is  then  possible  to  cross-date  artifacts  of known  date
with  sites  in  areas  less  well  known  or where  stratigraphy  and
radiocarbon dating have not established a firm sequence. If Bell
points are  found in  deposits stratified  at  the base  of sites at  Still­
house  Hollow,  central  Texas  (Sorrow,  Shafer and  Ross  1 967),
and placed in an Early Archaic time frame, we can assume that
similar points found in another part of central Texas (for exam­
ple,  in  Bexar  County)  are  of the  same  age.  And,  carrying the
cross-dating further, if Bell points that are typologically and tech­
nologically  identical to those of central Texas are found in adja­
cent  south or east Texas, we  can  speak of occupations  of sim­
ilar age  at sites  in  those regions.

Archaeological Sequences in Prehistoric Texas

Archaeological  work  has  continued  in  parts  of  Texas  for
more than sixty years. Some areas, such as central Texas, have
been  intensively  studied, and detailed archaeological  sequences
have  been  established.  In  other  regions,  such  as the  southern
part  o f  the  s tate,  research  has  intensified  only  in  the  last
decade,  and much  remains  to be learned about the history  of
prehistoric  c ultures.  In  this  section,  we  p rovide  a  general
chronological framework for the state, designed primarily to per­
mit readers  to  understand  better  the  temporal  position  of the
projectile points and tool forms defined below.  Obviously, cul­
tural  change  proceeded  at somewhat  different  rates  over this
vast area;  in  some  regions,  there were hunting and  gathering
cultures  throughou t  prehistory,  while  in  others,  cultures  with
farming and  settled  village  life  appeared.  A  detailed  study  of
Texas prehistory is being assembled by Thomas R. Hester and
Dee Ann S tory, with  contributions from  scholars from around
the state.

Four volumes published in  the Arkansas Archeological Sur­
vey Research Series in  1 98 9  and  l 990  are  the result of "regional
overviews"  done  for the Southwestern Division  of the  Corps  of
Engineers.  Hofman,  et  al.  ( 1 989)  synthesize  north  Texas,  the
Llano Estacado and Panhandle; Simmons et al.  ( 1 989)  examine
the Trans-Pecos; Story et al.  ( 1 990) summarizes East Texas, and

Paleo-Indian.  While  some  claims  h ave  been  made  for
greater antiquity, the earliest known inhabitants of the state, dur­
ing  the  late  Pleistocene  (Ice  Age),  can  be  linked  to  the  Clovis
Complex around 9200  B.C.  The distinctive  Clovis futed point i s
widespread  and  was,  a t   least  in  some  cases ,   used  i n   mam­
moth-hunting. A mammoth kill-site, Miami, is found in Roberts
County  in  the  Texas  Panhandle.  The  Gault  site  (4 l BL323)  in
central Texas has a  Clovis occupation that includes incised peb­
bles, a blade core, and several Clovis points, including one made
of Alibates material  (Collins et al.  1 99 1) .  Ferring ( 1 990) has exca­
vated a  deeply buried Clovis campsite  at the Aubrey site in Den­
ton County; a Clovis point, Clovis blades, and thousands of flakes
were  found.  The  Folsom  Complex,  around  8800-8200  B.C.,  is
distinguished by Folsom  fluted  points  and  is known from  sites

Context and Chronology

this period. Although flu ting ceases to be  an  important trait  of
Paleo-Indian  points  after  Clovis  and Folsom,  later Paleo-Indian
points maintain an  overall lanceolate, parallel-sided form,  often
with careful parallel-flaking and with  the  basal  edges  dulled  to
facilitate  hafting. There is a great diversification of point types,
several  of which  we  still  cannot  precisely  date.  Dalton  and  San
Patrice points  may  date  around 8000  B.C. i n  east Texas;  Plain­
view  points are  found  from  the  Panhandle  into  south  Texas  at
around 8200�8000 B.C., and associated with kills of Pleistocene
bison  at Plainview and Bonfire.  By around  8000  B.C.,  the  end
of the  Pleistocene, remnants of the animals of that  era�mam­
moth,  bison,  camel,  horse,  sloth··-have  disappeared.  Climates
became  more  like  those  of modern  times,  yet in  some  regions,
projectile point traditions  continue to follow the patterns of ear­
lier times.  In east Texas,  there  are  Scottsblujf points from  around
6500 B.c.; in the lower Pecos and south Texas, hunters and gath­
erers  used  Golondrina points,  radiocarbon  dated  at  7000 B.c.  While
we  are  still  learning  more  about  the  lifeways  of  these  late
Paleo-Indian cultures, we  can trace their presence and distrib­
ution  with  these  time-sensitive  point  styles.

Archaic.  Much of Texas prehistory is subsumed within a long
time  span of hunting and gathering cultural patterns known col­
lectively  as  the  Archaic.  It  begins  around  6000  B.C.  and  is
notable for  changes in  the style of proj ectile  points  and  tools,
the  distribution  of site  types  and  the  introduction  of grinding
implements  and ground  stone  ornaments,  all  reflecting a  grad­
ually increasing population utilizing the abundant plant and ani­
mal  resources of environments similar to that of modern times.
The details of the Archaic sequence vary from  region to region
within  the  state.  In  general,  it  can  be  divided i nto Early,  Mid­
dle,  Late  and Transitional  eras.  Each  period is  represented by
specific point  styles,  and  in  some  regions,  each  can  be  subdi­
vided  into  several  s egments,  sometimes  c alled  phases.  The
Early  Archaic  (6000-2500  B.C.)  is poorly  known  i n  its  earliest
phases, though a  number of point and tool types can be linked
to that era (fig.  3- 7).  In  general, settlement appears more scat­
tered, and there  are broader relationships  among  several  regions,
as indicated by  the  widespread  occurrence  of distinctive points,
such  as  Martindale,  Uvalde,  Ear!J  Triangular  and  Bell  (McKinney

1 98 1  ).  The  Middle  Archaic  (2500 B.C.- 1 000 B.C.)  marks  a  time ,
throughout the state, o f  significant population increase, large num­
bers of sites and abundant lithic  artifacts of various forms .  It,  too,
can  be  divided  into  segments  in  some  areas.  Certain  regions
appeared to be typified in the Middle Archaic by one or two  dis­
tinctive  points;  for example,  Gary  and Kent points  in  east  Texas,
Pedernales in central Texas, Langtry in  the lower Pecos and  Tortu
gas in south Texas.  In  some regions, specific types of sites are rec­
ognized,  especially  the  burned  rock middens  of central  Texas
and  shell  middens  on  the  Texas  coast.  Additionally,  cemeter­
ies  with  large  numbers of interments begin to  appear late in the
period, perhaps  reflecting territoriality on  the part of some hunt­
ing  and  gathering  societies.  Similarly,  trade  connections  are
established, bringing in  artifacts of stone and s hell from distant
areas.

The  Late  Archaic  ( 1 000  B.c. 300  B.C.)  sees  the  continuation
of hunting and gathering lifeways  in  most of Texas, again dis­
tinguished by certain  types of projectile  points  and  stone tools
(fig.  3-7). In east Texas,  pre-Caddo ceramic sites mark the begin­
ning  of settled village  life  s hortly  after  500  B.C.  Cemeteries  are
more  notable  in  some  regions,  as  in  southeast  Texas  (Hall
1 9 8 1  ).  Bison  appear to  be an important game  resource  in cen­
tral  Texas  and  in  the  lower  Pecos,  where  another  bison-kill
occurs  at  Bonfire  Shelter  (Dibble  and  Lorrain  l 968).  Other
bison-kills  are  known  in  the  Texas  Panhandle  and  southern
Plains  at  this  time  (Hughes  1 97 6).

The Transitional Archaic (300 B.C.-A.D.  700)  marks an inter­
val which in  some  ways  is  little more  than a  continuation  of the
Late Archaic. S till, there  are distinctive point styles. While  this
time period is an important one in the Archaic sequences of cen­
tral  and  lower  Pecos  Texas,  it  is  not  part  of  the  east  Texas
archaeological  record,  where  village  sites  (such  as  the  George
C .  Davis  site  of the  Gibson  Aspect)  make  their initi al  appear­
ance.  These  often  have  large  mounds,  with  flat-topped  exam­
ples  sometimes  used  to  support  structures  and  conical  mounds
for burials.

Context and Chronology

of stone tools.  Pottery  is  also present,  even  among hunters and
gatherers  in  central,  south  and  coastal  Texas.  Bison  hunting
appears  to be very important  in  most regions.  The  occurrence
of tiny arrow points, such as Scallorn,  Perdi:;,,  Cuney,  Friley  and Cata­
houla,  marks  the  spread  of  the  bow  and  arrow  throughout  the
state.  Many  local  types  develop:  Livermore  in  the  Trans-Pecos,
Lott  and  Garza  in  the  Llano  Estacado  and McClain  and  Bulbar
Stemmed on the  coast.  In some  areas, we can discern distinct shifts
in  arrow  point  styles  through  time,  especially  with  Scallorn
(Austin  Phase)  and, later, Perdi:;,  (Toyah  Phase) in central Texas.
Although a hunting and gathering lifeway continues, as in the
Archaic, the material culture, hunting patterns,  settlement types
and other facets  of Late Prehistoric times mark a fairly distinctive
break  with  the  past.  In  east Texas,  around  A.D.  1 200  the  Gib­
son Aspect gives way to the Fulton Aspect, which continues into
the  Historic  era  and is linked with  the  Caddo.  In the  Panhan­
dle and Llano Estacado,  settled villages are found in  the  Ante­
lope  Creek Phase on the  Canadian River around A.D.  1 400, and
in  Andrews  County,  village  sites  with  links  to  southeast  New
Mexico  appear  around  the  same  time.  In  the  far  west  Trans­
Pecos  area,  a  sequence  of settled  horticulturalists,  with  strong
ties  to  the  Southwest,  commences  in  the  early  centuries  A.D.,
developing more  fully around A.D. 600 (Whalen  1 980), marked
especially  by  pithouse  dwellings.  Down  the  Rio  Grande,  near
Presidio, another center of agriculturally based villages, the Bravo
Valley Aspect  dates  to  around A.D.  1 200- 1 400  (Suhm,  Krieger
and Jelks  1 954; Kelley  1 986).

The  Historic  era  (after ca.  A.D.  1 600)  marks  the  beginning of
the  end for  the native  Indian  cultures  of the state.  Some pro­
jectile points in east Texas continue into historic times (e.g.,  Tur­
ney,  Cuney).  Similarly,  such  types  as  Toyah  and  Fresno  certainly
date  in  part  to  historic  times  in  parts  of the  state.  With  the
advent  of the  Spanish  mission  system,  the  Indians  who  adopted
mission  life continued for a while to make stone tools (Fox  1 979a,
1 983; Hester  1 989b), and a distinctive point type,  Guerrero,  is often
found  in  missions,  ranchos  and  Indian  campsites  of that  era.
However  by  the  late  eighteenth century,  stone  tools  give  way
to  glass,  and  brass  and  iron  points  replace  those  chipped  from
stone,  ending  an  1 1 ,000-year  tradition.

4 .   PROJECTILE  POINTS :  �

TYPE  DESCRIPTIONS

Introduction

Projectile points  are  the  most  familiar  single  diagnostic  ar·
tifact of North American Indians and the  principal tool utilized
by ancient cultures for the last  1 1 , 000 years that shows distinct
attribute  variability.  The  majority  of these  specimens  possess
the same general morphological traits when considered from the
standpoint of the manufacturing process  (see  chapter  2).  Both
the  large,  thick dart  point  and  the  tiny,  thin  arrow  point  are
bilaterally  symmetrical,  bifacially  flaked  artifacts  which  are
thinned  and  pointed  at  the  distal  end.  Usually  they  possess a
haft  element  distinguished  from  the  body  by  means  of edge·
grinding,  basal  and/or  laterally  opposed  notches  or  other
modifications for the apparent purpose of attachment to the haft.
Points  often  have  morphological  "styles"  such  as  side- and
corner-notching in common with types in widely scattered areas;
yet,  they may be thousands  of years  apart  in  time .  Thus,  it  is
essential  to  acquire  a  working  knowledge  of the  technology,
dating and  distribution of a  type ( see chapter 3).  Site  reports,
guides (such as this one)  and archaeological journals are a good
way to gain access to this knowledge.  Studying actual collections
of points will always be the best way to familiarize oneself with
the  variability  of forms.

In order for types to serve as a useful means of communica
tion,  it is  important  that readers  and  authors  attach the  same

64

Projectile Points: Type Descriptions

meaning  to  the  terminology  u sed  in  the  type  descriptions.
Figure  20 graphically describes the nomenclature u sed in this
guide . The dart and arrow points follow and are listed separately
in  alphabetical  order  with  the  descriptive  data for  each  type.
The illustrations are usually at actual size unless a scale is in­
dicated. We have minimized the description, choosing to let the
drawings portray most of the features.  The extent of grinding
and smoothing on Paleo-Indian points, for example, is indicated
with  dots.

Within  the description, numerous references are usually listed,
and  additional detailed  information  can .be  obtained from  these
publications. We have made an effort to  select sites that show the
known  distribution  of the  type  and  have  been  excavated  under
controlled  conditions  vvith associated  tool assemblages  carefully
recorded (readers should be  aware  that these sites  are  on private
property and not open to  the public).  Additional references that
contain relevant studies or pertinent information useful to the type
description  are  also  included.

The site designations used here are based on the Smithsonian trino­
rnial  �ystem,  adopted  in  the  1 950s  by  The  University  of Texas  at
Austin, where it continues in use in the central archaeological data files
of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. In this system, 41  indi­
cates Texas, the county is denoted by a two-letter abbreviation (see Appen­
dix 3),  and the  site  is  numbered in sequential fashion.

The  estimated  age ,  based  on  known  carbon-1 4  dates  and
stratigraphic time estimates,  is included with the cultural affil­
iation (Paleo-Indian, Archaic,  Late Prehistoric,  H istoric), and
a general distributional range of reported specimens is indicated
on  an  index map  of Texas.

Dart  Points

ABASOLO
This  large,  unstemmed  triangular  point  has  a  distinctive  well­
rounded base. The lateral edges may be beveled or steeply chipped,
and the base  is  sometimes  thinned.  It  is  similar  to  Catan  but larger
1n  size.

Distribution:  Common  throughout  south  Texas,  especially
in the  Rio Grande drainage,  and continuing  into  northeast
Mexico./Period:  Early  to  Middle  Archaic/Sites:  Choke
Canyon;  Oulline;  La Perdida;  Sierra de Tamaulipas,
Mexico

ALMAGRE

Thi s  large,  broad  and  comparatively thick  point  has  an irregular
body which  tends to be triangular. The shoulders are almost nonexis­
tent,  and the stern  is  short and sharply contracting.  It  is likely that
these  are  simply preforms  for Langtry  points.

extending i n to  northeast  Mexico . /Period:  Middle
Archaic . / Sites:  Devil's  M outh;  Baker Cave;  Oblate;

ANDICE

This large, broad ,  triangular point has  convex  lateral edges  and  a
long, essentially rectangular, stem . Prominent, massive barbs extend
downward and are narrowest at the juncture with the body ( resulting
in  high  breakage  frequency).  They  are  closely related to Bell  mor­
phologically, but are distinguishable by their greater size, stem length
and barb length (Bell  stems  are  usually more expanding and  rarely
exceed  1 6  mm  in  length).

Distribution:  East  C entral Texas,  across  the  Gulf
coastal plain  to  Victoria-Corpus  C hristi  area. / Period:

ANGOSTURA
This long,  slender,  leaf-shaped  point  has  oblique  parallel-f aking,
a narrow, concave or irregularly straight base and ground basal edges.
Angostura  was originally defined for the  Plains;  specimens attributed
to the type in Texas vary widely in shape and fl�king,  causing prob­
lems in definition. Kelly ( 1983a) suggests two other types of this point
which  he labels "Texas Angostura"  and  "Zella."

Distribution:  Throughout  much  of Texas. / Period:
Late  Paleo-Indian.  An  AMS  C- 1 4  date  on  wood  charcoal
o f  8805 ±: 7 5  B.P.  (6855 ±: 7 5  B.C.)  came from a  deposit
associated  with  an  Angostura  point a t  4 1  BX83 l .  An addi­
tional  date  (5484 5 328 B.C.,  Beta  1 4 7 3 3 ,   1 3C  a djusted,
dendocorrected)  closely  associated  with  a n  Angostura
point  from  Baker  C ave  is  also  known,  but  seems unex­
pectedly  recent.  B.C. /Sites:  S t rohacker;  San  Miguel

AXTELL

This  medium-sized stemmed point i s  thicker than most dart points
(7- 1 0  mm) and generally has a crude appearance. The straight to gen­
tly  convex lateral  edges are commonly lightly serrated  and many have
light edge-beveling.  The shoulders are  slight  to moderate  in  size  and
rarely barbed. They have been called " Penny Points" because o f  the
distinctive,  generally  rounded  stem,  which  is  sometimes  heavily
grou nd.  There  is considerable  variation  i n  the  outline  of the  stem.
It is similar to Palmillas but rounding of the Axtell stem begins closer
to  its  shoulders.

Distribution:  East and  Cen tral  Texas./Period:  Middle
to  Late  Archaic. / Sites:  Navarro  Mills  Reservoir,  Nava­
sota  Reservoir,  4 I LT65,  Limestone  Co.; Jewett Mine;

BAKER
The body of this  point is thick in cross-section,  and it has straight
to  slightly convex lateral  edges,  and shoulders or strong barbs.  The
stem is expanding, and the base is bifurcated.  A second variety is less
commonly  barbed,  and  the  convex  sterns  have  a  "bowlegged"  ap­
pearance; the notches in the base are more open and the base of the
notch  is  rounded.  It  is similar  to  the  Uvalde  type  in central Texas.
Distribution:  Lower  Pecos. /Period:  Early  Archaic,  ca.
6000  B.C. 4000  B.c./ Sites:  Baker  Cave;  Hinds  Cave

BANDY
The lateral edges  on this point vary  from  gently convex to slightly
recurved, and corner-notching produces strong barbs with narrow or
V-shaped notches.  The  stem is slightly expanding,  and the base has
a "fishtail" appearance .  It is thin in cross-section and very well made.
It may be the lower Pecos equivalent of the Martindale type of central

BARBER
A  long,  thick,  parallel-flaked,  lanceolate  point  that  expands  near
mid-body and is  similar to Golondrina  and Plainview.  It has the deep
basal concavity of Golondrina,  but rather than flaring,  recurved basal
edges,  it  has edges  that  contract  more  than  Plainview  (Kelly  1 983b).
The basal concavity and edges  are  ground,  and the  deep,  recurved
or  bell-shaped  concavity  (up  to  1 2  mm)  is  the  deepest  of any  Texas
Paleo-Indian point.

BELL The distinctive  attributes  of  this point are its  wide,  thin,  triangu­
lar body and  long narrow barbs formed by basal-notching.  It is sim­
ilar  to  Andice,  but  smaller  in  size.  Bell points  also  share  typological
similarities with Calf Creek  and  Cossatot River points  of Oklahoma and
Arkansas;  the  dimensions  for Calf Creek  appear  to  fall  between  the
larger Andice  and  the  smaller Bell.

Distribution:  Most  common  in  central  Texas,  but  also
found  in south  Texas,  the  east  edge  of the Llano  Estacado
and the south Texas coast. /Period:  Early Archaic,  ca.  6000

BIG SANDY

This type  has been long known  in  the southeastern  United States
and  has  only  been  recognized fairly  recently in  Texas.  Texas  spec­
imens are usually somewhat smaller than Big  Sandy artifacts illustrated
by  Perino  ( 1 985).  They are more compatible with  those published  by
Justice  ( 1 98 7 :  Fig.  1 3).  The specimens are side notched with the cor­
ners  o f  the  s tem  often  squared.  Serrations  are  sometimes  found
along  the  lateral edges  of the p oint.  G.  Perino  (personal  communi­
cation), believes  that the points shown here arc p ro bably  Cache  River
points that  are  found  in  Arkansas, where  they were named, in  south­
east Oklahoma,  in Louisiana and in east Texas.  tvluch more  research
needs  to  be  done  on  the  Big  Sandy  type in Texas,  and  identification
of these  points  should be  done  with  caution.

Distribution:  In  Texas,  from  east  and  southeast  regions
into  the  Edwards  Plate au./ Period:  Late  Paleo-Indian  to
Early  Archaic? Justice  ( I 9 8 7 :62)  dates  them  between
8000- 6000 B.C. i n   the southeastern  United States,  while
Story et al.  ( 1 990:  Fig.  32)  place  them  at  ca.  4000
B.c . /Sites:  Mcfaddin Beach  (4 1JF50);  Gault  (4 1 B L 3 2 3);

COSSATOT

Cossatot points  are described as  "Cossatot River"  by Perino  ( 1 985:88).
He  ill ustrates  specimens  with  d eep  corner  notches  and  a  broad
expanded stem, often with a notch in the center of the base. G. Perino
(personal communication)  says  that  the  specimens  found  without  basal
notches  are  more  c ommon  in  some  areas  (Texoma  Lake  for  exam­
ple)  than  the  notched  type.  Perino's  examples  are  also  serrated,
although  this  trait  does  not  occur  on all  Cossatot points.  Typological
and distributional  studies  of this type  are  badly  needed  for  Texas.

ground,  tapers  slightly.  Specimens  are  frequen tly  shortened  by
resharpening,  making the  stem  seem  long.

DALTON

Distinctive features o f  this point are  beveled, lateral  cutting edges,
often serrated, and a roughly parallel-sided stem or basal section that
is  distingui shed from  the  body by grinding or  a  change  in  outline.
The base  is  deeply  concave  and  thinned  by  one  or more  relatively
large flake  scars  on  both  faces.  Story  ( 1 990: 1 90)  thinks  that  Dalton
is a  sometimes fluted, lanceolate, p roj ectile point/knife which p rob­
ably  developed  out  of an  eastern  form  of Clovis.  Consi derable  vari­
ation  in  the  point  probably  reflects  morphological  changes  as  well
as use, resharpening,  and probably temporal and/or geographical vari­

ations  (Johnson  1 989b: 1 8). 0 Distribution:  Similar points  found  in Arkansas,  Missouri,

EARLY STEMMED

Early  stemmed  points generally  occur in  Texas  in  the  same  geo­
graphic  areas  and  time  periods  as  Paleo-Indian  point types  such  as
Plainl!iew  and Angostura.  At the \\Tilson-Leonard site  seven  specimens
of a  thick,  notched  point  tentatively  termed  "'Wilson"  were  radio­
carbon  dated  at 94 7 0 ±  1 70 B.P.  (TX-4 787) and 9650 ± 1 20  B.P. (TX-
4793)  (Weir  1 985).  At  sites  in  southeastern  Texas,  specimens  have
been  found  of early  side- or corner-notched  points  usually  exhibit­
ing  ground  stems  and/or  bases,  and  beveled/ resharpened  lateral
edges. Data from the Devil's Mouth site suggest association with  Golon­
drina  and  other Late  Paleo-Indian points.

EARLY STEMMED  LANCEOLATE

Projectile points in this  category have lanceolate outlines with weak
shoulders  forming  ill-defined  stems,  the  edges  of which  have  been
dulled.  They have been  found  in loose association with other Paleo­
Indian projectile points and are thought to date from that era.  Much
typological research is needed to defne this group further; Kelly ( 1 983a)
has  tentatively  included  them  in  his  Victoria  type.

EARLY TRIANGULAR

These are triangular points usually characterized by careful parallel-
and  alternately-

oblique  flaking,  straight  to  slightly  concave
beveled lateral edges  (which  may  also  be  slightly  serrated).

Because there has been considerable confusion in the typology of
triangular  points ,   we  have  used  this  descriptive  name  for  those
triangular  forms  that  occur  in  the  Early  Archaic.  They  are
chronologically earlier than  Tortugas points  in  southern Texas.  In cen­
tral  Texas,  such  specimens have  been  called  (by  Kelley  1 947) Baird
Beveled Blade  and  Taylor Thinned Base ( or Taylor and Baird;  Sorrow  1 969).
However, no specific attributes for clearly separating these two groups
have yet been published. Indeed, Black and McGraw ( 1 984) postulate
that these specimens are knives, with the shapes changing through use
and  subsequent  beveling  (resharpening)  of the  lateral edges.
Distribution:  North  and  south  central,  south  and
southwest Texas. /Period:  Early  Archaic,  ca.  3 7 00

This is a relatively crude and thick point with a wide range of varia­
tion .  Diagnostic traits  include  a  triangular body,  indistinct ,  squared
shoulders  and  a  contracting  stem .

Some  authors  have  suggested  that  the  type  undergoes  gradual
d1minution in size through time (Ford and Webb 1 956: 52-54; Young
1 98 1 :73).

The outline of this point is similar to Darl,  but the flaking is cruder,
the  stem  is  occasionally exaggerated  and the  stem  edges always ex­
hibit some degree of smoothing and grinding. This type was original­

KIRK

The  "Kirk"  label  has  been  applied  to  several  point  types  in  the
southeast  and midwest parts of the  United States (see Justice  1 987).
Story  et al.  ( 1 990:2 I 9)  recognizes  "Kirk"  points  in  northeast  Texas
and adjacent parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas. The specimens illus­
trated here  approximate the "Kirk Serrated" style as defined in Jus­
tice  ( 1 987:82 85). The lateral  edges are strongly serrated,  while the
stems  are  slightly  expanded with bases  concave  or  straight.  Much
more  research has to be done on the occurrence of this type in Texas;
some  may  simply  be  reworked  and  serrated  versions  of other types.

This  point  is  thin  and  well  made  with  straight  to  concave,  or

a  tapered stem,  sometimes  with  alterna tely-beveled edges,  that  ter­
minates in  a  straight or  slightly beveled,  concave  base. There  is  much
variation  within  the  group  in proportions,  base  shape  and develop­
ment of shoulders.  One variation, perhaps a  separate type, has been
called Arenosa  (Bement  1 99 1  h). Arenosa  is similar  t o  both  Langtry  and
Val  Verde  points.  I ts  shoulders  are  square  and  occasionally  h ave
incipient  barbs.  The  stems  contract  but the  base is convex to pointed,
and  usually  the  stems and  b ase  are  not  beveled  as in Langtry  points.

MARTINDALE

This  point  has  prominent  shoulders  and  short  barbs  formed  by
corner-notching.  Its  most distinguishing feature is the base,  which  is
formed by two convex curves meeting in a depression in the center;
this  gives  the  base  a "fishtail" appearance.

Martindale,  as a type, was first proposed by Suhm , Krieger and Jelks
( 1 954) and dated in the Archaic (ca. 4000 B.C.-A.D. 1 000). In the early
l 970s, similar specimens were reported from earlier Archaic contexts,
and in some cases were called "Early Barbed" (lower Pecos) or "Early
Corner-Notched" (south central Texas) .  Prewitt redefined Martindale
as an Early Archaic type with considerable variation in  form, and in­
cluded "Early Barbed" and "Early C orner-Notched ." Bandy is a mor­
phologically  similar  form  and  probably  a  lower  Pecos  equivalent.

Some  of the  specimens  on the following page  illustrate  the  diminu­
tion  and  changes  in  shape  of these  points  as  they  are  repeatedly
reworked.

This  small,  often  thick,  triangular  or  subtriangular,  unstemmed
point  is  similar to  Tortugas,  but  markedly  smaller.  Studies  done  on
Choke Canyon artifacts (Hall, Black and Graves 1982) demonstrated
that the average length of Tortugas was 4 . 9  mm-6. 7  mm; Matamoros
specimens ranged from  3 . 2  mm  to  4. 7  mm in length.  Like  Catan and
Abasolo,  Matamoros  and  the  larger  Tortugas  type  may  represent  a

MESERVE

This  lanceolate to  triangular point has  a concave,  well-thinned base
created  by  the  removal  of one  or  more  flakes  from  both  faces.  The
lateral sides  are essentially parallel for approximately one-third of the
length;  the  upper  portion  is  u nifacially  beveled  and  the  distal  tip
pointed.  The  base  has lateral  and  basal grinding. lvfeserve sometimes
resembles  the  Dalton  type  and is also similar  to  Plainview  and  Golon­
drina  points;  many  may  simply  be  reworked  lanceolate  points  of
those  types.  Indeed,  Goodyear ( 1 982: 382)  maintains  that specimens
classified as Meserve  are  nothing more  than reworkings of lanceolate
points such as  Plainview.  Myers and Lambert  ( 1 983) believe  it is  a west­
ern variant  of Dalton,  and  Story  et al.  ( 1 990: 90)  thinks  that  it  prob­

MIDLAND

This  small,  thin  lanceolate point has  straight  to slightly convex  lat­
eral  edges  that  have  been  carefully  trimm ed.  Both  faces  have  a  flat
invasive  regular  retouch,  parallel  to  subparallel  with  a  marginal
retouch  on  the edges (Martinez  1990).  The base is concave and  basal
modification  is  present  for  thinning.  The  point  resembles  Folsom  in
shape  and  size  but  it  is  very  thin  and  unfluted.  Midland  points  as
defined above,  have been observed at several  sites  within  the south
ern  Llano  Estacado area only  (Martinez  1990).

MILNESAND

A relatively broad, parallel-faked, lanceolate point that has a square,
slightly concave to convex,  wedge-shaped base. It tends to be thickest
toward the  tip,  the base  is  thinned  and  smoothing of the basal and
lateral edges by grinding is characteristic. It is thinner, proportionately
broader and appreciably shorter than Firstview; the majority range be­
tween  40  mm and  55  mm  in  length.

PEDERNALES
The  size  and  body  dimensions  vary  greatly  in  this  narrow  to
broad,  or often  leaf-shaped,  triangular point depending on how it has
been  reworked.  While  the  body  is highly variable,  the  type  is  char
acterized  by  a  more  or less  rectangular,  bifurcated  stem.  The  basal
concavity is often thinned by a  broad,  flute-like flake on one or both
sides.

Distribution:  Extremely  common  in  central  Texas  and
into  the  lower  Pecos.  Found also  at  some south Texas

SANDIA

Wormington (1957) divided these lanceolate points into two forms,
both with a characteristic slight shoulder on one side of the base .  San­
dia "Type  I"  has  a  rounded outline and  a  bluntly pointed base  and
is lenticular in cross-section . Use-marks are said to be common along
one side ,  indicating that they may have been used as knives. Sandia
"Type II" is more carefully made, has parallel sides, is diamond-shaped
in cross-section and has a straight or slightly concave base.  Both have
ground  basal  edges .

Originally ,  specimens  from  Sandia  Cave,  New  Mexico,  were
reported  as  pre-dating  Clovis  points;  further  excavations,  however,
revealed  that  they  are  later  in date.  Broken  and  reworked  Archaic
stemmed  points  in Texas  are  sometimes  mistaken  for Sandia  points
by  artifact  collectors.

SAN PATRICE

This point  is characterized by a  concave, usually deep and ground
base  that  has  been  thinned  by the  removal  of one  to  three  channel
flakes to produce a fluting that extends to mid-point or beyond. Weak
to well-defined shoulders are found at the juncture  of the basal sides
and  tip edge.

Somewhat similar points of Paleo-Indian date have  been  found in
the  Brazos  River  Valley  at  Horn  Shelter  #2  (and  termed  "Brazos
Fishtail"),  and in the Texas Panhandle at the Rex Rodgers bison-kill
site ("Rodgers Side-Hollowed"), suggesting that variants of this form
may  h ave  been  widely  distributed  in  Paleo-Indian  times.

C. Webb  (personal  communication)  believes  that  the  San  Patrice
point  and  culture  i s   one  of a  series  (lvfeserve,  San  Patrice,  Dalton,  Van
Lott  and  local  variants)  that  extends  from  the  Rockies  to  the  south
Atlantic  coast,,  and, in Louisiana, is  the first locally based,  endemic
culture. Webb further suggests two variants: "Hope" (four of the spec­
imens  illustrated  here)  and  "St.  Johns ."  There  is  a  considerable
range  in  size  and  commensurate  variability  in  thickness  and  width
even  within  the  two  variants  " Hope"  and  "St.  Johns"(Johnson
I 989b).

A triangular point with straight to convex lateral edges that are often
slightly serrated.  Basal notches form  a more or less rectangular stem
and short to long barbs. They are usually well-made. Specimens linked
to this type in south Texas are usually made of heat-treated chert,  with
the thermal alteration giving the points a pinkish color, a vitreous sheen
and  a  "greasy"  feeling.

SINNER

These  proje ctile  points  have  multiple  notches  or  deep  serrations
along the lateral edges.  Stems are squared to slightly expanded.  The
type was  named  by  Webb  et al.  ( 1 969:52 53),  and they  report  that
it is  "related to the Evans  type." Evans is distinguished by  a single  deep
notch  in  each  lateral  edge,  while  Sinner  points  h ave  two  to  five
notches  or  d e e p   s errations.  Three  speci m e n s   below  are  from

TORTUGA.S

This  large,  unstemmed ,   triangular  point  has  an  approximately
straight to concave base and alternately beveled edges. It is often thick
and crudely f aked in the midsection and well-thinned basally.  There
are typological problems (see Matamoros and Early  Triangular), but there
is  growing evidence  that points of this form are  characteristic of the
Late Middle Archaic  in  south  Texas.

1 22  Tortuga:;  points were  found with the burial site at  Loma  San­
dia; it was the most numerous point associated with the burials,  which
were  radiocarbon dated at 850  B.C.-600 B.C. (Lynn Highley, personal
communication).

Distribution:  Characteristic  of south  Texas  and  the
lower  R io  G rande,  but  occasionally  found  in  central

TRAVIS

A  slender,  triangular point with rounded shoulders that vary from
slight to fairly prominent. The stem is usually rectangular with parallel
edges.  Similar points  were  found  at  the  Greenhaw  site  and  called
"Buda"; these are now thought to be a local variation of Travis (F. Weir,
personal  communication).

UVALDE

This is a broadly defined type that varies considerably. Generally,
it has a triangular to lanceolate body with rounded shoulders or barbs,
an expanding stem and a  concave  base .  It  was originally  defined  as
a Middle  to  Late Archaic type ;  however, recent research has shown
these points  to  be  Early  Archaic  in date.  Some  of the specimens of
this  general  shape have  been  called  "Early Corner-Notched ." Baker,
in the  lower  Pecos,  i s  probably  a  regional  equivalent.

VAL VERDE

This thin,  triangular point  is  similar to  the Langtry  type.  The  pri­

concavities that extend from the  shoulder  to the  base.  All of the fol­
lowing variations  are  found:  the stem  and  base  alternately  beveled;
stem edges beveled to one surface and the  base  to another; and both
stem and base beveled to  the same surface.

CATAHOULA
The lateral edges of this point are straight to concave or recurved,
and they frequently flare at the  shoulders to form distinctive, large,
rounded or squared barbs, producing a relatively broad shoulder area.
The  expanding  stem  is short,  wide  and  normally  convex.

"Class A-1" and "Class A-2" (Aten 1 967,  1 983) in southeast Texas
are somewhat similar forms with straight-sided or small, contracting
stems that  are  commonly  found on  the  upper  Gulf coast  and  have
usually been  misclassified as  Catahoula.

Patterson  ( 1 98 7)  describes  a  drill-like  variant  of  the  Catahoula
arrow point  from  Site  4 1  HR l 82,  which  he  calls  the  Catahoula  per­
forator.  The  bases  have  straight  stems  and  the  shoulder  barbs  are
squared  like  the  Catahoula  arrow  point  inferring  that  the  tool  was
hafted for  use  as  a  drill/perforator.  Examination  under  magnifica­
tion  showed  tip  smoothing  and  polish  indicating  possible  use  as  a
rotary  tool .

era ( 1 700s) of Coahuila and Texas, often referred to as "mission" points.
They sometimes have very careful parallel-flaking. They are primari­
ly  found  in mission  Indian middens,  but  they  also  occur  at  ranchos
and at historic  Indian occupation  sites.  Some specimens are  knapped
from  shards  of glass.

HARRELL

This triangular point has either side-notches or side-and-basal notch­
ing,  sometimes  with  finely serrated edges.  Bell  ( 1 958) suggests that
Harrell be applied to specimens having a basal notch ,  and  Washita be
applied  to those  without  a  basal  notch .

LOZENGE

A distinctive point  that  is characterized  by  an elongated,  oval  to
diamond-shaped outline.  One-half of the  point is bifacially worked,
resulting in a lenticular cross-section;  the  opposite end is alternately
beveled,  usually on  the right.  It is not always clear which end is the
distal,  and  which  the  proximal,  or  if the  beveling  is  the  result  of
resharpening.

�  I 5.  CHIPPED  STONE  ARTIFACTS  I  44,U,4
Introduction

The wide array of stone tools often found in association with
projectile points are usually more difficult to categorize, but they
constitute an equally important component of the material culture
of a  group  of  people  related  in  time  and  space .  Utilitarian
household implements such as knives,  scrapers, drills and chop­
pers can be used by  the archaeologist to study  the  behavioral
patterns  of populations .

Generally,  the largest class o f  tools i n  an assemblage are the
bifaces - artifacts with flaking on both sides or on  two opposite
faces (see chapter  2). In addition to the projectile points, these
include artifacts often called knives, choppers and "gouges." The
other larger class of tools are the  unifaces - flakes altered on one
side or on one face only.  Unifaces are usually piano-convex in
cross-section;  the ventral surface is the flat side, and the dorsal
surface  is  the raised  (piano) side.  These include artifacts that
are  often  labeled  scrapers,  gravers,  fake  tools  and  unifacial
"gouge"  forms.

Characteristics of chipped stone tools that have functional im­
portance come in a variety of forms,  shapes and disguises, and
the average tool may have been utilized in a number of different
ways; thus,  it  is  sometimes very  difficult  to distinguish a knife
from  a  projectile  point  or  a  scraper from  a  knife.  Since  form
is often simply the by-product of expedience or resharpening or

239

Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians

other modification in a tool's life ,  the most direct sort of evidence
appears  to  be  wear  left  on  the  tool  while  it  was  being  u sed
(chapter 2) .  Hence ,  classification and names must be used with
caution and only in a general fashion; when used ,  they should
ideally  be based on  an  analysis of manufacturing  techniques,
shapes,  wear patterns and context.

Some of the best-known and  most intensively  studied speci
mens have been  named  in the p ast,  and  a  function  suggested
as a result of experiments, studies or hypotheses ( or all of these) .
These  are  described ,  together  with  general  morphological
classifications (scrapers,  choppers,  perforators, gravers,  etc.), and
alphabetically  ordered within  the  two  categories  of bifaces  and
unifaces.  Readers are once again warned that we have assembled
these from  the existing literature; some of these categories are
tentative or represent groupings or functions that have not been
fully tested through archaeological research. Furthermore, many
are  very  restricted  in  time  and  space ,  and  should be  used  for
comparative  purposes  based  on  the  data  provided  here,  and
through  consultation  of the references listed  for  each.

Bifaces

BRISTOL BIFACE

This  relatively small ,  oval  to  subtriangular  artifact was  originally
described by Duffield ( 1 963b). The workmanship varies from good to
crude; it is usually percussion-flaked, and specimens retain cortex on
one or both faces. However, marginal retouching and continuous edg­
ing or smoothing are  visible  on  some of the specimens.  Its  function
is  unknown.

BRONSON  BIFACE

This artifact was originally described by Jelks (1965) as a fat, ap­
proximately rectangular "knife" which had been sharpened on the two
long edges and tapered to form a rounded or pointed tip at one end.
The opposite end was left unaltered and consisted of the weathered
cortex  from  which the knife  was made.

"BUTTED  KNIFE"  Blf ACE

These generally oblong or pear-shaped artifacts are often called "fist
axes" or "carcass cleavers ." Specimens have a rounded natural  cobble
surface  on  one  end  (providing  the  handgrip);  the  opposite  end  is
pointed, with a worked edge that often exhibits extensive, glossy polish,
perhaps from cutting meat or soft plants .  They seem ideally fitted for
butchering tools; the ends are too thin and delicate for heavy chopping.

CARROLLTON AXE

These  notched,  oft e n   crudely  bifaced  artifacts  were  defined  by
Crook and Harris ( 1 954), who attributed them to  their Early  Arc haic
C arrollton  Focus.  However,  more  rec e n t   studies  i n dicate  that  they
are  Late  Arc haic  i n   date  (Pri kryl  1 9 90;  Galm  1 9 7 8).  They  arc  usu­
ally  made  of quartzite,  with  one  end  percussi on-flaked i n to  a  cu tting
"bit"  and t h e  opposite e n d  oft e n  blunt  and battered, perhaps  through
hammering use.  The double  notches  ce rtainly suggest  that  these were
hafted  tools.

CHOPPER

The  term  "chopper"  is  often  applied  to cobbles or a  large  piece  of
stone  with  a  few  flakes  removed  from  one  end.  The  opposite  end  is
usually  rounded ,  and  the  chopper  edge  can  be  unifacial  or  bifacial.
Battering  and  dulling  of the  edge  are  usually  indicative  of heavy
wear - perhaps in gru bbing, hack ing, woodworkin g  and heavy b utch­
ering and food-processing. Sometimes cores can be mistaken for "chop­
pers,'' although cores were , on occasion,  reused as chopping tools (see
chapter  2 ) .

CLEAR  FORK BIFACE AND UNIFACE

The Clear Fork tool form was originally defined by Ray ( 1 94 1  ). Often
called "gouges," these artifacts have triangular to subtriangular outlines,
though some vary to lanceolate, rectangular and ovate. The wide end
is considered the  working edge or bit; it is usually steep and  beveled
and may be  convex,  straight  or  slightly  concave  ("scooped  out").  In
cross-section , the tools are plano-convex and at times almost pyramidal.
Edge-wear  can  sometimes  be  detected  visually  or  with  the  aid  of a
microscope;  it is likely that  they were utilized in woodworking tasks,
as scrapers or adzes, rather than "gouges." The edge angle of the bit
end  varies  from  60 °  to  7 5 °  in most  cases.

The outlines of the  unifacial  and bifacial  forms are generally  the
same.  Large  Clear Fork  bifaces  occur  in some  Paleo-Indian  contexts
(e . g. ,  St.  M ary's  Hall,  Baker Cave).  Large  Clear Fork  unifaces often
appear in the Early Archaic.  The unifacial and bifacial forms of smaller
size are very common in south Texas and in the Abilene area, primarily
during the  M iddle Archaic.

Clear Fork  tools need intensive typological study in order better to
distinguish,  temporally  and  spatially,  distinctive  groups  within  this
broad  category .

CORNER-TANG BIFACE

This relatively rare biface has several body and tang variations; the
most  common  form  has  a  tang notched  into  one  corner  of the  base
(Patterson 1 936).  Most specimens have been found in central and south
central  Texas  and  westward
in  counties  along  the  Balcones
Escarpment.

Function is unknown; some have edge-wear indicating hafting for
use as a knife (Mitchell and Orchard 1 984), others have been reworked
as drills (as  illustrated),  and  some  perhaps  had  no  utilitarian  use  as
they  are  occasionally  found  as  grave  furnishings.

This  artifact  was  originally  described  by J elks  ( 1 962)  as  an  un­
stemmed,  relatively  thin,  bifacially chipped "knife" with  an  approx·
imately straight base that has been thinned by the removal of several
broad,  thin  flakes.  As  a  rule,  the  lateral  edges  are  finely  pressure­
retouched  and  mildly  convex.  The  tips  are  sharply  pointed.

GAHAGAN  BIFACE

This long,  narrow,  triangular artifact has a base that is  generally
straight or moderately concave and thinned to about the same degree
as the lateral edges. It is characterized by recurved edges between the
base and mid-point of the lateral  edges.  Edge-wear suggests possible
use for cutting vegetal substances or meat (Shafer  1973).  Specimens
from  burials indicate  that  some were  elite  items.

GUADALUPE BIFACE

This  unique  artifact  is  thick  and  percussion-flaked  and  has  an
abruptly truncated distal end or bit that angles  from the dorsal edge
toward the proximal end.  The bit is usually unifacially worked, often
by the removal of narrow,  blade-like fakes  around  the  curved  distal
bit, and the working-edge angles are generally steep, ranging roughly
from  55 °  to  85 ° .  Obvious  damage,  scarring and frequent evidence
of resharpening are  visible  on  this  working edge.  The  tool  may  be
biconvex to piano-convex,  keel-shaped or nearly triangular in cross­
section.  Black and McGraw ( 1 984) have done an  extensive study of
the Guadalupe biface and have provided a formal definition of this form.

NUECES BIFACE  AND UNIFACE

These  distally  beveled  bifaces  ( or  occasionally  unifaces)  were
originally described by Hester, White and White ( 1 969: 1 48- 1 49) and
Wakefield  ( 1 968 :26).  They  are  trapezoidal  to  roughly  lunate  (or
crescentic) in outline with piano-convex cross-sections. The widest "bit"
edge  is  steeply beveled,  and  use-marks along this  edge  indicate that
it may  have been employed  in  scraping or  cutting activities.

OLMOS  BIFACE

These small , distinctive artifacts were first def ned by Hester (1 969a)
and  analyzed  by  Shafer  and  Hester  ( 1 97 1  ).  They  are  triangular  i n
outline and bifacially worked a n d  have a beveled-edge b i t  at the broad
end  (usually  at  an  angle  of 60 °  or  more).  The  thickest  part  of the
specimen occurs along this edge ,  which often shows wear i n  the form
of heavy dulling,  battering and  striations. Typically,  the bit  is  much
resharpened by flakes removed  from  the ventral  edge,  and there are
often  burins  on  the  corners  o f  the  bit.

PERfORATORS/DRILLS

This  tool  form  is  characterized  by  a  long  and  tapered  bit  that  is
diamond-shaped  in  cross-section.  The  bit  and  proximal  end  are
bifacially  flaked and  sometimes exhibit  retouching;  the  tips of drills
are often blunted or dulled. The bases of Archaic drills are frequently
the same  as those of projectile points,  suggesting that  they probably
began as points and were later reworked into drills .  Late Prehistoric
perforators are  smaller than the large Archaic bifaces,  and are most
commonly made on  flakes .

1WO- AND FOUR-BEVELED BIFACES

Diamond-shaped,  four-edged  bifaces  sometimes  called  "Plain s
Knives" o r  "H arahey  Knives,"  occur  widely i n  Late Prehistoric sites
in the southern  Plains and  Blackland Prairies and occasionally  in  the
central  and  eastern  parts  of the  state.  They  are  often  made  of Ali­
bates-agatized  dolomite  in  the  Plains. They  are  usually  characterized
by  steep  bevels  on  all  four  alternating  edges.  Restricted  almost
e n t i re ly  to  south  Texas  is  a  different,  two-beveled  form  with  a
shorter,  convex-edged  p roxi mal  segment  (see  item  "C"  below  and
illu strations  on  following  page.  The  tool  form  is  a  region a l  vari ant
of the  better-known four-edged  form;  the  distinctive  shape  is  due  to
patterned  resharpening  ( Brown  et  al.  1 982).  Both  forms  are  fre­
quently  associate d  with  bison  remains.

a straight to  convex  bit  on one edge. The  bits are generally wider than
the base and frequently show secondary retouching. Flaking is confined
to one  surface and may or may not extend across the  entire specimen;
the  opposite side retains  the weathered  cortex.  They may have  func­

SCRAPERS

There is much  variation as to form and quality  of workmanship in
this category of unifacially flaked artifacts that are traditionally referred
to,  and presumably functioned, as scrapers.  They are found i n  a wide
range of shapes  and  forms ;  most  are  made on large  flakes or blades
and are characterized by a steeply flaked working edge.  They are often
categorized  by  archaeologists  according to  the  position  of the  edge,
its location and  the nature of the  retouch:  end scrapers are trimmed t o
a steep and convex bit at the end of t h e  longest axis ( opposite the bulbar
or proximal end) ;  side scrapers  are  trimmed  on one or two  edges  and
have side-and-end trimming in combination on one specimen ;  convergent
scrapers have edges  which  meet in a pointed fashion; concave scrapers have
one  edge  trimmed  in  a  concave  shape;  and  transverse scrapers  have  a
trimmed edge transverse, or obliquely oriented,  to the  proximal end.
Functional  studies  of specimens  (independent  of  morphological
categories)  are  necessary to determine  the usage  of a  particular arti­
fact; microscopic analysis of edge-wear has shown that some unifacially
flaked artifacts were used for cutting, so all unifaces cannot automatical­
ly  be  called  scrapers .

SEQUENT FLAKE UNIFACES

These  are  highly distinctive  artifacts,  made  on  oval flakes  detached
sequentially from a t u bular chert nodule.  Epstein ( 1 962)  first described
them  as  "oval  cortex  scrapers"  and  Shafer ( 1 986)  attributes  them to
the  Baker Interval  in the  Lower  Pecos between 8500 5000 years  ago.
They  are  ge nerally  oval  in  outline,  with  cortex  around a  portion of
the  edge .  The edge  opposite  the c ortex  has been  chipped unifacially
for  use  as  a  s c raper  or  knife.  They have  an  u n usual  cross  sec tion,
with  a  positive  bulb  of percussion  on  one face  a n d   a  negative  bulb
(from  a n   earl i e r   flake  removal)  on  the other

Introduction

This category includes ground, pecked and polished stone tools
that were  shaped  and  altered  intentionally or through use .  Im­
plements  that  have  one  or more  surfaces  modifed  by pecking
and grinding and were shaped in the course of food preparation
are  metates/milling  stones,  manos,  pestles  and  pitted  stones.
Utilitarian tools used in the process of sharpening,  grinding or
honing  different  tools  are  described,  and  stones  used  for
straightening arrow  shafts.  Other  stones  evidence  use  in  saw­
ing,  reaming,  polishing  or  hammering.

Polished stone  artifacts include celts,  plummets,  boatstones,
Waco "sinkers," gorgets and  pipes.  Some  are relatively crude,
but  others  are  beautifully  ground,  polished  and  occasionally
decorated .  Most  of  these  are  ornaments,  but  others  served
utilitarian  tasks .

Ground, Pecked and Polished Stone Artifacts

ABRADING STONES

Irregular fragmen t s  of sandstone  and  l i mestone  often  exhibit  dif­
ferent kinds of wear patterns,  such as  V-shaped, longitudinal grooves
at various  angles,  surface-faceting or edge-faceting.  These  may  result
from  the  use o f  the  abrasive  stone for smoothing the edges of bifaces
during the tool-making process;  other  stones may  have been  utilized
to  shape,  sharpen,  smooth  and  polish  a  number of different  imple­
ments,  such  as  bone  awls  and  needles.

Altered  qua rtzite cobble s  called  " Edge-Preparation Tools" ( Perino
1 9 72)  are  found throughout the country  and  may  have been used  to
gri n d  a n d  dull  the  edges  of preforms  i n   the  bifacing process.  Their
spec ifi c  purpose  is  not  known  but  their  natural  water worn  shapes
were probably being u tilized  and modified i n  various pecki ng,  s trik­
i ng,  poli shi ng,  abrading,  food  gri n di n g  a n d  fli n t  p reparation  ac tivi­
ties  (Chadderdon  1 9 76).

BANNERSTONES

Bann erstones  are  found  infrequently  i n   Texas.  Their  function  is
debatable  but  the  winged,  cente r-drilled,  and  "hourglass"  varieties
were  probably  used  as  atlatl  weights.  They  would  have  been  an
improvement  o n   the  art  of  spear  throwing  because  they  could  be
moved  on spear-th rower shafts with relative  ease compared to boat­
stones  that  had  to  be secu red  (Duke  1 9 89: 1 4) .  Adj ustment of weight
has  been  demonstrated  by  modern atlatl  experts  to  be very i m por­
tant  in  obtaining greater range  and  accuracy  (An nual  World's Atlatl
Contest,  Saratoga,  Wyoming)  (Duke  1 9 85) .

Materials  vary  widely  a n d   range  from  sandstone  to  j aspar  and
basalt.  The  holes  drilled  are  relatively  u niform,  1 . 1   cm.  to  1 . 4  cm.
(which could indicate that  the size of the atlatl shafts  were fairly  stan­
dard  to  fit  holes  in  the bannerstones).  Weights  of the  three  ill u stra­
tions  on  page  2 9 2  range  from  42  gm.  to  90  gm .

Gmund, Pecked and Polished Stone Artifacts

BOATSTONES
The basic form of "boat-shaped" stones is primarily rectangular in
plan and piano-convex in longitudinal cross-section with rounded ends.
The base (flat side) is frequently pecked and ground to form a hollow
or cavity  and  may have  a central groove.  More complex  specimens
may have a "keel" of varying width extending along the convex sur­
face from one end to the other. This keel may be hollowed-out to pro­
duce a V-shaped groove that in certain perforated types connects two
holes. Specimens are sometimes notched at  the ends, with the bottom
faceted; others exhibit some form of incising or decoration. The ma­
jority of these artifacts are made of local materials ,  but obvious cases
of importation are commonly found of cryptocrystalline rocks, igneous
rocks and slate.

This unique artifact is thought by some to be a weight attached to
an atlatl to make  it  more controllable and  hence more accurate,  but
replicative experiments have produced mixed results. Other authors
have suggested use. as a charm stone,  a fetish or a ceremonial object.
They are sometimes found as grave  goods.

METATES AND MANOS

Metates , or m illing stones, are u sually made of sandstone and may
have one or more grinding facets on one or both sides of the slab. They
were  u sed to process  and grind wild  plant  foods,  or  in  later  cul t u res
in parts of Texas (east Texas, especially) for grinding agricultural plants
(maize).  Krieger (Newell  and Krieger  1 949)  believes that  a  distinc­
tion should be made between "milling stones," which are grinding slabs
upon  which  a  mano  was  moved  in  a  rotary  motion,  and  "metates,"
upon which a back-and-forth motion was u sed,  in the Pueblo and Mid­
dle American  m an ner.

Manos are small ,  oval handstones of sandston e ,  q uartzite or other
stone shaped to match the style of the milling stone on which they were
to  be  u sed.  The  basin shape  of the  m illing-stone  surface  require d  a
rotary-grinding  motion  or  one  in  which  sweeping  arcs  were  made
arou n d  the  perimeter  of the  basin.

SHAFT STRAIGHTENERS

These  l oa f-shaped  artifacts  are  distinguished  by  the  following
characteristics: made on oblong, piano-convex cobbles, usually of l ime­
stone;  a  deep  transverse  groove,  which  m ay  or  may  not  h ave  per­
p endicular  i ncised  lines  adj acent  to  or  running  through  the  groove
(sometimes  on(y  the  incised  lines  are present);  and pinkish to red dis­
coloration  of the  limesto ne  due  to  heating  (indeed,  some  specimens
appear  to  have  been  fractured  through  he ating) .

Similar artifacts  are  found in  the  Southwest and i n  California.  The
examples from southern  California  are  much  like  those  from  Texas
and  their  function  in  arrow  shaft  straightening  has  been  described
by  Kroeber  ( 1 925:530,  Pl .  49):  "the  joints
cane  arrows)  were
warmed  in  the  groove  and  bent  by  hand  o r   on  the  ridge  after  the
stone  had been  heated."  Since  most grooved  stones  found  in  Texas
have  u ncertain  contexts,  it  is  not  clear  whether  they  have  been
used  for dart  shafts  o r  arrow  shafts.

large.  In some cases, as at Loma Sandia,  41 L K28 (Hester 1 980), the
stem of the pipe has been found to be a hollow bone inserted in one end .
Effigy pipes were sculptured by pecking and abrading. The pipe bowl
and stem were apparently made by pecking and reaming,  not drilling
(Shafer  1 973).

WACO  "SINKERS"

These  are  medi um-s ized  stone  artifacts  generally  fashioned  from
some form of quartz, or quartzite, water-worn pebble. Specimens range
from thin,  small  and  comparatively flat natu ral pebbles with worked
notches in the ends, through crudely chipped and ground, to skillful­
ly  shaped  objects  of highly  specialized  forms.

Their use is undeterm i ned; some have hypothesized that t hey were

intended  to  function  as "sinker  weights"  or  as "bolas"  stones.

APPENDIX  4.

Archeology  Awareness Week

The  annual Texas Archeology Awareness \Veek was first  cele­
brated  in  1 989.  Governor  Clements  made  the  official proclama­
tion  and concurrent  resolutions were  read  in  the Texas  House  of
Representatives  and  Senate.  Taking place  i n  early  April  of each
year,  Archeology Week is  a  program  of events  oriented  toward
informing the  public  about  archeology  in  the  state  and  involving
them in  archeological activities. The program focuses on how indi­
involved  in  a  positive  way,  what  makes  archeol-
viduals  can

ogy  interesting  and  what  the  past  has  to  offer.  The  program
reflects a continuing tradition of commitment to public awareness
and involvement and has developed into a major public  relations
effort which involves museums, historical societies, libraries, schools
and other federal, state, municipal and private organizations. The
Archeology Awareness  Committee has  an official logo  (above),  a
motto, and information on sources of video, film strips, and speak­
ers. They also have promotional materials and suggestions for activ­
ities.

Sponsors include the Texas Archeological Society, Texas Arche­
ological Research Laboratory,  Texas Historical Commission, Texas
Historical  Foundation,  Council  of  Texas  Archeologists,  Texas
Antiquities  Committee,  The  Archeological  Conservancy,  Texas
Memorial Museum,  Archeological  Planning-Review, Texas  Parks
and \Vildlife  Commission, and the Texas State Department of High­
ways  and  Public Transportation.
