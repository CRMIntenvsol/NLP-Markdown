ABSTRACT On behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), SWCA conducted staged mitigation at site 41DN612, within the area of potential effects (APE) of the proposed Farm-to-Market (FM) 407 Project in Denton County, Texas (CSJ: 1310-01-027). As the project will involve federal funds from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and involves state land that will be controlled by the Dallas District of TxDOT, investigations were conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas; the National Historic Preservation Act; the Programmatic Agreement between the FHWA, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), TxDOT, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC); and the Memorandum of Understanding between TxDOT and the THC. Kevin Hanselka served as Principal Investigator (PI) under Antiquities Permit No. 8872. TxDOT Dallas District is proposing to replace the bridge and approaches on Denton Creek, and replace the culvert at Denton Creek Slough, along FM 407 east of Justin in Denton County, Texas. The total project length is approximately 0.6 mile. A total of 3.047 acres of new right-of-way (ROW) have been acquired for the project and no easements are required. Typical depth of impacts for roadway construction would be about 2.2 feet; maximum depth of impacts would be approximately 20 feet for bridge supports. Roadside ditches would have impacts up to 5 feet below existing ground surface. Based largely on safety concerns related to the existing dangerous curve at this location (to be resolved by realignment during the proposed construction), the project is on an accelerated schedule. The site is a stratified Transitional Archaic occupation situated on a broad flat floodplain of Denton Creek and Denton Creek Slough, an abandoned channel of Denton Creek. SWCA and its subcontractor conducted the data recovery investigations of 41DN612 from April 14 to June 22, 2019; geomorphological assessments were conducted during the last week of fieldwork. Field investigations consisted of a combination of mechanical and hand excavation of all site deposits within the APE. Excavations terminated at 5 feet, as depths of project impacts would not exceed 5 feet. Overall, SWCA excavated 310.1 m3 of sediment from the site. Based on the results of the various analyses, particularly the chronometric analyses, the prehistoric deposits at 41DN612 appear to be primarily associated with the period commonly recognized as the Transitional Archaic, although there is a slight overlap with the Late Prehistoric I period. During these excavations, seven cultural features were exposed, including a large earth oven facility (Feature A) and six isolated burned rock features (Features 1–6), interpreted to be single- or limited-use cooking features. A total of 519 artifacts were collected during the investigations, including 209 historic artifacts and 310 prehistoric artifacts. The historic artifacts were primarily within a large refuse pit that truncated portions of the Feature A. The prehistoric assemblage consisted of faunal remains (155 mussel shells and 99 faunal bone) and burned clay (n=21). No lithic tools or debitage were recovered during the field investigations or during flotation or fine-screening of the feature matrix. In addition, SWCA documented 6,429 pieces of burned rock during the investigations and collected 176 special samples. The excavations were limited to the APE and the exposure afforded only a partial glimpse of the overall site. Based on the assemblage, the site is interpreted as a seasonal (likely spring and summer), ephemeral campsite utilized primarily for hunting/foraging and cooking activities, as indicated by the flora and faunal i NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

assemblage and associated site furniture. Small groups exploited the riparian zone resources, making forays into the landscape to hunt and forage. Over time, there was an increase in land use intensification as evidenced by the single- or limited-use hearths being replaced by earth oven hot rock cooking technology to process lower-ranked resources (e.g., geophytes and starches). Overall, previous studies and literature reviews show a paucity of burned rock features within the Trinity River basin (e.g., Black et al. 1997; Lintz et al. 2008; Prikryl 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). In a report presented by Geo-Marine, a literature review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Database was conducted to compare the occurrence of thermal features reported within the Trinity River and Brazos River basins (Lintz et al. 2008). Lintz et al. (2008) reported that thermal features are rarely reported within the Trinity River basin and twice as likely to be reported within the Brazos River basin. This suggests that the occurrence of seven distinct features at 41DN612 is significant and may provide valuable information on the regional history of the Trinity River basin during the Transitional Archaic period. The smaller hearth features identified at 41DN612 are typical of the small burned rock features encountered within the Trinity River basin during the Late Archaic to early Late Prehistoric (Black et al. 1997; Lintz et al. 2008; Prikryl 1990; Tinsley et al. 2011). Interestingly, larger burned rock features and earth ovens are particularly rare, making the occurrence of Feature A rather unique. In concurrence with the previous survey recommendations, the Hardeman Midden site is considered eligible for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark and for the National Register of Historic Places. The early and late Transitional Archaic components revealed intact, well-preserved archeological deposits that significantly contributed to our understanding of Transitional Archaic patterns. These investigations mitigated the project- specific effects, not the entire site. Any future project that could impact deeper deposits (i.e., deeper than 5 feet), or those beyond the current ROW, warrant further consideration to assess the possibilities for additional contributing components. With these considerations, no further work is recommended. ii NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Chapter 1. Introduction On behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), SWCA conducted staged mitigation at site 41DN612, within the area of potential effects (APE) of the proposed Farm-to-Market (FM) 407 Project in Denton County, Texas (CSJ: 1310-01-027) (Figures 1.1 and 1.2). As the project will involve federal funds from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and involves state land that will be controlled by the Dallas District of TxDOT, investigations were conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas; the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA); the Programmatic Agreement between the FHWA, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), TxDOT, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC); and the Memorandum of Understanding between TxDOT and the THC. Kevin Hanselka served as Principal Investigator (PI) under Antiquities Permit No. 8872. Project Background TxDOT Dallas District is proposing to replace the bridge and approaches on Denton Creek, and replace the culvert at Denton Creek Slough, along FM 407 east of Justin in Denton County, Texas (see Figure 1.1). The proposed project would replace and widen the existing structurally deficient bridge at Denton Creek, bridge class culvert at Denton Creek Slough, and roadway approaches including the addition of a culvert extension just north of the bridge (see Figure 1.2). The existing radius of the curve between the culvert and the bridge would be increased in order to provide a safer approach to the two structures. The roadway would be shifted by as much as 80 feet from the center of the existing curve to the center of the proposed curve. Stone riprap would be added for erosion control. The vertical alignment of the roadway would be raised by 3 to 5 feet and that of the bridge would be raised by 5 to 8 feet to meet hydraulic standards. The total project length is approximately 0.6 mile. A total of 3.047 acres of new right-of-way (ROW) have been acquired for the project and no easements are required. Typical depth of impacts for roadway construction would be about 2.2 feet; maximum depth of impacts would be about 20 feet for bridge supports. Roadside ditches would have impacts up to 5 feet below existing ground surface. Based largely on safety concerns related to the existing dangerous curve at this location (to be resolved by realignment during the proposed construction), the project is on an accelerated schedule. Previous Investigations at 41DN612 On behalf of TxDOT, Raba Kistner performed an intensive archeological survey from January to March 2019 within the project APE, employing pedestrian survey, 10 shovel tests, and 15 backhoe trenches (BHTs) (Neel and Meléndez 2019). Buried prehistoric cultural materials were encountered in a BHT on the far northern end of the project APE, and four more BHTs were excavated nearby to delineate the span of these remains. The cultural remains were ultimately exposed in three BHTs (i.e., BHTs 10, 11, and 12), all within existing ROW of FM 407. Of note, modern and historic debris (e.g., glass, metal, brick) was encountered within a 72-centimeter (cm)-thick fill layer within BHT 10; however, the fill was approximately 22–36 cm above the prehistoric cultural features and did not appear to have impacted the integrity of the cultural features. All other subsurface investigations throughout the APE were negative for cultural remains. 1 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Site 41DN612 was initially recorded as a prehistoric site consisting of four small scatters of fire-cracked rock (FCR), burned and unburned faunal bone, and unburned mussel shell fragments exposed within the three BHTs mentioned above between 90 and 108+ cmbs. The four FCR scatters were located approximately 50– 100 cm apart and were interpreted to be remnants of hearth clean-out and/or dumping activities as no in situ charcoal or burned earth was identified in proximity to the FCR. The BHT excavations were halted at the contact of the cultural materials and limited hand excavations were conducted to expose and document the size, content, and function of each of the cultural features. No temporally diagnostic artifacts or datable materials were observed during this initial survey. Additional work including mechanical scraping and hand excavations were recommended to expose, thoroughly document, and sample the features and determine if any underlying cultural deposits were present within the APE. Due to its buried context, potential integrity, and preservation of faunal materials, TxDOT determined site 41DN612 as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). To accommodate the accelerated project schedule, TxDOT proposed the project for staged data recovery, where an initial phase of work would be used to further explore the site’s data potential and, if warranted, a second phase of work would address that potential with additional excavation. The THC concurred with this plan in a letter dated March 7, 2019. Overview of SWCA Investigations From April 14 to June 22, 2019, SWCA and its subcontractor completed the data recovery investigations of 41DN612 utilizing a combination of mechanical and hand excavation of all site deposits within the APE. Excavations terminated at 5 feet as depths of project impacts would not exceed that depth in this location. The initial excavations consisted of mechanical (i.e., backhoe) scraping of an 8×8-meter (m) block surrounding the features identified during Raba Kistner’s previous survey (Neel and Meléndez 2019) (Figure 1.3). During the course of investigations, TxDOT and SWCA modified the excavation methodology to address unanticipated findings, specifically once it became apparent that the four discrete burned rock clusters identified during the previous survey were part of a larger and more complex burned rock midden (BRM). To delineate the larger feature, mechanical and hand scraping was first used to determine the outer boundary of the portion of the BRM present within the initial 8×8- m excavation block. The initial excavation block was then expanded to the north approximately 2 m and to the east 3 m and an exploratory BHT (BHT 1) was excavated to the south of the block to determine the extent of the BRM in those directions (Figure 1.4). Hand excavations (i.e., 1×1-m units, 50×50-cm column sample) were utilized to: 1) identify, record, and sample any internal feature(s) within the BRM; 2) systematically quantify and characterize the rock material types within the BRM; 3) identify and collect in situ datable materials; and 4) document the internal stratigraphy of the BRM and any underlying cultural deposits. A total of 3.21 m3 of soils were hand excavated across the site, including three 1×1-m excavation units (i.e., Units 1–3) and one 50×50-cm column sample (i.e., CS 1). One feature-focused unit (Unit 4) was also excavated to further expose and document the burned rock layers of the BRM (see Figure 1.4). The matrix from this unit was not screened and the unit was terminated at the base of the feature; it is not included in the total volume of excavated deposits above. 4 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Mechanical stripping and BHT “cuts” were then excavated to conduct the geoarcheological investigations at the site and to look for additional cultural features within the site deposits. A total of 16 cuts (BHT A–P) were excavated during this phase (Figure 1.5). A total of approximately 307.7 m3 of soils were excavated during the initial mechanical excavations and subsequent stripping. Once all mechanical and hand excavations and stripping were complete, final photographs were taken and the site was backfilled. Project Personnel Kevin Hanselka, Ph.D. (TxDOT) served as the PI for the project. Steve Carpenter, M.A., was the Project Manager (PM) for the overall contract and Christina Nielsen, M.A., served as the Project Archeologist (PA) for the 41DN612 field investigations, overseeing overall logistics and organization, managing reporting, and agency consultation. The data recovery was completed by Christina Nielsen; SWCA archeologists Jennifer Anderson, Jessica Ulmer, Michael Golden, Kim Wile, Ken Lawrence, Janaka Greene, and Brittney Ducre; and Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) archeologists Thomas Chapman and Anne Gibson, between April 14 and June 22, 2019, under Permit No. 8872. Jim Abbott and Eric Oksanen from TxDOT also visited the site and assisted with the geoarcheological investigations. Christina Nielsen, Ashley Eyeington, Ken Lawrence, Chris Shelton, Jessica Ulmer, and Michael Golden undertook the reporting effort, while Carole Carpenter and Christian Hartnett expertly produced all field and report maps for the project, and Lauri Logan provided technical editing and document preparation. 5 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Chapter 2. Environmental Context This chapter provides an overview of the present-day environmental setting of 41DN612 and a review of the regional paleoenvironmental record. The discussion is based on the results of field investigations performed by SWCA archeologists and a review of relevant literature. Physiographic Ecoregion Site 41DN612 is within the Western Cross Timbers physiographic ecoregion of Texas, which covers the Grand Prairie (U.S. Department of the Interior 2020; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] 2020). This ecoregion represents a cuesta topography with sandstone ridges, with terrain ranging from gentle slopes to steep scarps. Dominant vegetation includes post oak (Quercus stellata) and blackjack oak (Quercus stellate) with laurel greenbriar (Smilax laurifolia), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and purple top grasses (Tridens flavus). The soils in this region are mainly fine, sandy loams overlying clay soils, which retain water better. The Grand Prairie ecoregion is characterized by the Lower Cretaceous limestone interbedded with marl and clay. In this region, meandering streams cut into the limestone. The original vegetated species include tall grass prairie in the upper region and elm (Ulmus spp.), pecan (Carya illinoensis), and hackberry (Celtis spp.) in areas along floodplains. Invasive species of Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) and honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) have become more abundant in the region since settlement (EPA 2020). Soils Soils at site 41DN612 are mapped as frequently flooded Frio silty clay (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2020). These deposits are characterized as very deep, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium that occupy floodplains and river valleys (NRCS 2020). Typical horizons for this series include an A1 horizon (0 to 20 cm), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay when dry, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, moderate fine and medium granular structure, hard and firm consistency, moderately sticky, moderately plastic, roots, few shell fragments, moderately alkaline with a clear smooth lower contact boundary. Below this is an A2 horizon, which typically is described as a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam when dry, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) when moist, with a moderate and coarse subangular blocky structure giving way to moderate fine subangular blocky structure, few roots inclusions, few shells fragments, moderately alkaline, with a clear smooth boundary. Following the A2 horizon is usually an A3 horizon with characteristics including a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam when dry, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) when moist, with a moderate fine and medium prismatic structure towards moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure, with a hard and firm consistency, few roots, films and threads of calcium carbonate, few shell fragment inclusions, moderately alkaline, with a gradual and smooth lower boundary. Below this, an A4 horizon may occur and is typically described as a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam when dry, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) when moist, with a moderate fine and medium prismatic structure towards moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure, with a hard and firm consistency, few roots, films and threads of calcium carbonate present, moderately alkaline, with a gradual smooth lower contact boundary. Following the A horizons is a Bk horizon consisting of a grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay when dry, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) when moist, with a moderate medium and 9 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

coarse prismatic structure towards a weak coarse blocky structure, with a hard and firm consistency, few roots, with many fine films and threads with mottling of calcium carbonates. All soils are well drained and slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Flooding occurs one to three times a year (NRCS 2020). Topography The topography of the project APE consists of the broad flat floodplain of Denton Creek and Denton Creek Slough, an abandoned channel of Denton Creek located approximately 1,050 feet west of the current channel that functions as an overflow channel during flood events. Another old channel is evident as a remnant oxbow located in woodland northeast of the current channel. A total of 918 feet of the western portion of the APE extends onto a low terrace landform of Denton Creek, measured from the edge of the water to the topographic upland break. The current channel of Denton Creek is entrenched approximately 13–16 feet into its floodplain. The project APE topographically extends from a low of approximately 585 feet above mean sea level (amsl) at the channel of Denton Creek to approximately 605 feet amsl on the western valley terrace, a rise in elevation of only 20 feet (Figure 2.1). Figure 2.1. Overview of Denton Creek floodplain facing northeast toward 41DN612 (image from Google Earth Streetview). Geology and Hydrology The floodplain of Denton Creek is mapped as Holocene-age Quaternary (Qal) deposits composed of alluvium (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS] 2020). The minor terrace at the western end of the project extends onto Pleistocene–age Quaternary fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt). The Denton Creek valley has been cut into the underlying hard rock geology of the Fort Worth Limestone and Duck Creek formation, undivided (Kfd) and has subsequently filled with Holocene alluvium (Fisher 1991). The Fort Worth Limestone and Duck Creek formation, undivided, is an Early Cretaceous-age carbonate limestone with minor beds of unconsolidated marl 10 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

and clay that weathers to low rolling hills. Marine megafossils of oysters, echinoids, and ammonites are known from this unit. No outcrops of the unit were observed in the project area. Denton Creek is within the Upper Trinity River basin and is a tributary of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. It joins the Elm Fork approximately 22 miles downstream from 41DN612 and eventually the Trinity River. Denton Creek at 41DN612, is located in southwestern Denton County, approximately 1.4 miles east of Justin, Texas (see Figure 1.1). The Denton Creek valley at this location is approximately 1 mile wide and appears to have a paired terrace system floodplain (Waters 1992:150–151). There is one alluvial landform (T0) on the floodplain near 41DN612. The T0 landform is generally 800 feet wide on both sides of the drainage. Notably, the T0 landform in this area is dissected in several locations across the floodplain by tributary channels. The tread of the T0 landform is positioned about 10–15 feet above the channel base and quickly rises to the nearby valley margins on the left bank (east side) and gradually rises to the valley margins on the right bank (west side). Site 41DN612 is situated on the tread of the T0 landform, roughly midway between Denton Creek and the upland valley margin. Abbott (2011:130) notes that the drainage gauge for Denton Creek near site 41DN612 has recorded that over 15 large overbank floods have occurred on the drainage within the last 60 years. Denton Creek at this crossing has a high sinuosity ratio (SR) of 1.4, indicating that it is a sinuous channel (Charlton 2008). This elevated SR value indicates that lateral erosion (exterior bends) and extensive sediment deposition (interior bends) are occurring within the channel, particularly at exterior and interior meander bends. Notably, site 41DN612 on the left bank (east side) is positioned on a slight interior meander bend, whereas the right bank (west side) is located on an exterior meander bend. Put simply, the west side of the channel at this crossing is being actively eroded away, while the east side is expanding through continual flood deposition. Furthermore, the high sinuosity of the drainage is also evident on aerial and topographic maps of this crossing (see Figures 1.1 and 1.2). These maps illustrate numerous remnant channels and oxbows that indicate the dynamic fluvial history of this drainage. Notably, site 41DN612 is adjacent to a remnant, oxbow channel about 115 feet to the southeast of the site. The channel base at this crossing is positioned at 585 feet amsl, while the surrounding floodplain in the project area is generally at 590 to 600 feet amsl. Site 41DN612 is positioned at 600 to 605 feet amsl. Flora Vegetation in the Grand Prairie region consists of mixed prairie grasses such as big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), little bluestem, purpletop grasses, sideoats grama (B. curtipendula), yellow Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea) with riparian environments composed of pecan, hackberry, post oak, blackjack oak, laurel greenbriar, and elm (Griffith et al. 2007). Much of the region has been converted to pasture or is in use as rangeland. Due to intensive grazing in the region, there is an increase in buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides), Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), and grama grass (Bouteloua sp.) to the area (Bezanson 2000). 11 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Fauna The project area falls within the far eastern section of the Kansan biotic province. There are 59 mammalian species, 46 reptilian species (turtle, snakes, and lizards), and 15 amphibian species identified by Blair (1950) within the Kansan biotic province. Important mammalian fauna encountered within the Kansan province include: Ord’s kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), and eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), swift fox (Vulpes velox), plains pocket mouse (Perognathus flavescens), black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), badger (Taxidea taxus), coyote (Canis latrans), spotted ground squirrel (Citellus spilosoma), blacktail prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), yellow-faced pocket gopher (Cratogeomys castonops), hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), Merriam pocket mouse (Perognathus merriami), northern grasshopper mouse (Onychomys leucogaster), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), whitethroat woodrat (Neotoma albigula), southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus), and blacktail jackrabbit (Lepus californicus). Bison once existed in this area but no longer remain in this area (Blair 1950; Burt and Grossenheider 1976; Davis and Schmidly 1994). Reptilian species encountered within the Kansan province include one turtle species, 14 lizard species, and 31 snake species. The land turtle species in this province is an ornate box turtle (Terrapene ornate). Some of the lizard species include eastern collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Great Plains skink (Eumeces obsoletus), and prairie lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Some of the snake species include: eastern glossy snake (Arizona elegans), western diamond-backed rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), western rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis), plains blind snake (Leptotyphlops dulcis), gopher snake (Pituophis catenifer), long-nosed snake (Rhinocheilus lecontei), plains black-headed snake (Tantilla nigriceps), checkered garter snake (Thamnophis marcianus), and common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) (Blair 1950; Conant and Collins 1998; Werler and Dixon 2004). Amphibian species encountered within the Kansan biotic province include one urodele, eastern tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum). Anuran species encountered within the Kansan biotic province include: southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), eastern green toad (Bufo debilis), red- spotted toad (Bufo punctatus), and Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii) (Blair 1950; Conant and Collins 1998). Paleoenvironment To date no detailed paleoenvironmental research has been conducted in the immediate vicinity of the project area. Investigations at site 41DL270 along Denton Creek by Brown (1998) compared isotopic variation in oxygen and carbon in mussel shell features to the paleoenvironmental studies conducted within the Central Texas region and found similarities in the paleoclimatic patterns in Denton Creek. Therefore, SWCA used data from regional studies south of the project area to provide a foundation for the paleoenvironment of the North- Central Texas region. Over the past 12,000 years, the environmental and climatic conditions of the Central Texas region have varied considerably. There is some debate about the paleoenvironmental conditions ca. 12,000–10,000 years before 12 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

present (B.P.), and two models are presently posited for the paleoenvironment of this early period. Bryant and Holloway (1985) have proposed that the Central Texas region was predominantly a deciduous forest 65,000– 10,000 years ago, with a diverse assortment of tree and plant species. In contrast, more recent research by Hall and Valastro (1995) and Toomey et al. (1993) suggests that Central Texas was dominated by grassland and mesic climatic conditions during the late Pleistocene. This interpretation fits well with the regional faunal record since megafaunal species from this period, such as mastodon, mammoth, giant bison, camel, and horse, would have required substantial areas of grassland for grazing (Dillehay 1974; Graham 1987; Graham and Lundelius 1984; Toomey et al. 1993). About 10,000 years ago, changes in paleoclimatic conditions led to mass extinctions of megafauna across the region (Graham 1987; Graham and Lundelius 1984). Faunal records from the Edward’s Plateau indicate the average seasonal temperature warmed, and climatic conditions became progressively drier (but still retained higher effective moisture than present day) throughout the early Holocene (Bement 1994; Toomey et al. 1993). As a result, vegetation cover diminished, and a degradation of the soil mantle ensued (Toomey et al. 1993:316). Due to the wind currents and temperature patterns of the nearby Gulf of Mexico, paleoclimatic conditions experienced east of the Edwards Plateau may have been relatively warm and moist during this time (Johnson and Goode 1994:20). Toomey et al. (1993:309) propose that the early Holocene warming trend continued into the middle and late Holocene and peaked ca. 5000–2500 B.P. “when climatic conditions were drier than any time during the last 20,000 years.” This warmer, drier climate is reflected in the shell isotope values from 3200–2600 B.P. at 41DL270 (Brown 1998). From 2500–1500 B.P. a wetter, cooler period followed in central and north-central Texas, which is supported by a rise in the Denton Creek shell isotope values (Brown 1998; Bryant and Holloway 1985; Hall 1988; Toomey et al. 1993). In addition, Humphrey and Ferring (1994) and Nordt et al. (1994) have argued for increased xeric vegetation during this time based on soil carbonates (Brown 1998). Finally, a rise in the Denton Creek isotope values after 1500 B.P. suggests a return to warmer and drier conditions (Brown 1998). From this time forward, present-day climatic and environmental conditions were firmly established for north-central Texas. Previous Regional Geoarcheological Investigations To provide a context for site 41DN612 and Denton Creek, SWCA reviewed previous geoarcheological investigations in the region relevant to the project area. The most extensive geoarcheological investigations within the Upper Trinity River basin occurred about 22 miles northeast of 41DN612 for the Ray Roberts- Lewisville Reservoir project in Cooke, Denton, and Grayson Counties (Prikryl and Yates 1987; Ferring and Yates 1997). The creation of these reservoirs from the impoundment of segments of the Elm Fork River generated archeological investigations extending over two decades by a variety of interdisciplinary researchers (e.g., Southern Methodist University [SMU], Environmental Consultants Inc., USACE - Fort Worth District, and University of North Texas). Among the many notable accomplishments from this research was the discovery and investigation of the Aubrey Clovis site (41DN479). The Aubrey Clovis site, situated on the Elm Fork River, was identified to have an intact stratigraphy extending back into the Pleistocene (Ferring 1990a, 1990b, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995a, 1995b, 2000, 2001; Humphrey and Ferring 1994). Most significant, the site has a 13 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Paleoindian occupation with a well-dated stratigraphy that suggests it is the oldest Clovis site currently known (Ferring 2001). In addition, the extensive investigations at Aubrey Clovis have provided a robust radiocarbon dataset and information from past environments. In summarizing the alluvial history of the Upper Trinity River basin, Ferring (1994) recognizes four morphostratigraphic units (i.e., landforms) composed of deposits from six alloformations. The morphostratigraphic units identified from oldest to youngest include the Stewart Creek Terrace, Hickory Street Terrace, Denton Creek Terrace, and the Floodplain that are interpreted to encompass the Middle Pleistocene up to the present. The Stewart Creek Terrace landform is composed of Irving alloformation deposits, while the Hickory Street Terrace is composed of Coppell alloformation deposits. The Irving alloformation deposits are interpreted to date to the middle Pleistocene approximately 75,000–125,000 years BP (Ferring 1994:35). The Coppell alloformation deposits are interpreted to date to the Pleistocene, sometime around 30,000 years ago (Ferring 1994:44–47; Ferring and Yates 1997). The more recent Denton Creek Terrace is composed of deposits from the Carrollton alloformation that contain Pleistocene faunal remains (e.g., bison [Bison antiquus]) and is interpreted to date to roughly 30,000–20,000 years ago (Ferring 1994:47–48). Most relevant to the archeology of the region is the landform identified as the Floodplain. The Floodplain contains deposits from three alloformations that, from oldest to youngest, include the Aubrey, Sanger, and Pilot Point alloformations. Ferring (1994) indicates that the Aubrey alloformation dates to the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition. The terminus ante quem for this alloformation is from the Aubrey Clovis site (41DN479), which initially calibrated to 17,030 calendar years before present (cal yr BP) (SMU-2236) and terminates sometime after 14,410 cal yr BP (Ferring 1994; Ferring and Yates 1997). The initial calibration of the overlying Sanger alloformation begins in the Late Pleistocene sometime prior to 13,460 cal yr BP (AA-5274) and extends to sometime after 7,550 cal yr BP (SMU-2339) (Ferring 2001: Table 3.2). Ferring (1994:58–59) notes that the Sanger alloformation is capped by a moderately developed buried soil that in several locations has been eroded by the Pilot Point alloformation. The Pilot Point deposits began prior to 4,470 cal yr BP (SMU-2401) and terminated sometime after 1,676 cal yr BP (Beta-14963). A well-developed cumulic soil identified as the West Fork soil frequently caps the Pilot Point alloformation that is interpreted to encompass the last 4,000 years. Beginning in the Late Pleistocene, the alluvial history of the Upper Trinity River basin as defined by Ferring (1994:147–149) has a period of stasis with no discernable geomorphic activity occurring between 14,000– 11,000 years ago (17,000–13,000 cal yr B.P.). Specifically, Ferring (1994:147) notes that no alluvial or colluvial deposition or evidence of a disconformity is associated with this period. Subsequent to 11,000 years ago (13,000 cal yr B.P.), a period of rapid alluviation occurs in the basin, initiating a phase of valley filling. Interestingly, this period of rapid alluviation occurred shortly after the Clovis occupation at the Aubrey Clovis site and continued until 7,500 years ago (7,550 cal yr B.P.) (Ferring 1994:148). This event is inferred to be associated with a shift to a moister (i.e., mesic) climate. By the middle of the Holocene, a shift to a drier (xeric) climate occurred as evidenced by soil development in the Sanger alloformation and eolian deposits in some of the uplands of the upper basin of the Trinity River (Ferring 1994:148). These xeric conditions seemingly continued until approximately 4,500 years ago when a period of rapid alluviation occurred and the deposition 14 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

of the Pilot Point alloformation began (Ferring 1994:148–149). The rapid alluviation is particularly apparent between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago (Ferring 1994:149). In contrast to other researchers, Ferring (1994) notes that alluviation in the Upper Trinity River basin does not correlate with arid conditions. Instead, Ferring (1994:150–153) noted in this basin that the fluvial response to moist conditions was rapid alluviation and/or erosion while drier conditions led to stability and soil development and that the primary internal influence on a landscape’s evolution is the underlying bedrock, which affects the vegetation. Specifically, the calcareous loams and clay loams derived from weathered limestone support a prairie environment that is more resistant to erosion. Conversely, the non-calcareous soils derived from sandstone and shale support a mixed forest environment that has a lower threshold for erosion. Two primary external influences identified are the climate and changes in sea level. Although no examples are provided, eustatic influence is proposed as a possible influence to the upper extent of the basin. Regarding overall archeological potential within the upper basin, Ferring and Yates (1997) indicate that archeological sites occur in two principal contexts (i.e., terraces and upon or below floodplains). For the terraces, Ferring and Yates (1997) propose that the Trinity River terraces between Dallas and Valley View are Late Pleistocene in age. As such, any archeological sites less than 11,000 years old (~13,000 cal yr B.P.) could occur on the terrace surfaces, which are supported by numerous surveys in the area particularly in Denton, Dallas, and Tarrant Counties (Ferring and Yates 1997:279). For the floodplains in the Upper Trinity River basin, the age of the sites on the floodplains can be predicted by their stratigraphic location (Ferring and Yates 1997: Table 18.2). Unfortunately, Ferring and Yates (1997) note that cutbank exposures along Elm Fork River are “poor” and alluvial units thicken as they progress downstream. Consequently, older sites will become increasingly difficult to discern downstream. This will be particularly evident for Paleoindian–Middle Archaic sites, which will likely require mechanical excavation for their discovery. In contrast, the Pilot Point alloformation is exposed within the cutbanks of the entire upper extent of the basin and is characterized as thick, dark, and clayey with a buried soil (West Fork soil) located beneath recently deposited sand (Ferring and Yates 1997:280). Closer and more relevant to site 41DN612 are the investigations conducted by TxDOT at Denton Creek and US 380 in east-central Wise County, approximately 13 miles (21 km) upstream from 41DN612 (Abbott n.d. 2011). This project included extensive geoarcheological investigations including providing a stratigraphic model for Denton Creek. Abbott (2011:131–133) encountered deposits encompassing the Late Pleistocene to recent in age. The oldest observed deposit is characterized as prismatic, sandy loam and interpreted to correlate with the aforementioned Carrollton alloformation dating to 30,000–20,000 years ago (Abbott 2011:131; Ferring 1994:47–48). Next, Abbott (2011:131–132) identified a clay paleosol with prominent slickensides, mottles of ferromanganese, and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) masses that he interpreted as part of the Sanger alloformation. As noted above, the Sanger alloformation dates to approximately 13,500–7,000 years ago (Ferring 2001: Table 3.2). Notably, Abbott (2011:132) indicates the Sanger alloformation dates to 11,500– 4,500 years ago. Above the Sanger alloformation deposits, Abbott (2011:132) observed a clayey floodplain interpreted to be the Pilot Point alloformation dating to approximately 4,500–1,800 years ago. Finally, the Pilot Point deposits at that crossing of Denton Creek were capped by clayey alluvium less than 3.3 feet thick and interpreted to be recent in age (Abbott n.d.). 15 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Chapter 3. Cultural Setting Site 41DN612 is situated within the North Central Texas archeological region on a tributary of the Elm Fork within the upper Trinity River basin (Perttula 2004:7). The following prehistoric cultural chronology of North Central Texas (and the upper Trinity River basin) derives its information from major reports by Hofman et al. (1989), Peter and McGregor (1988), Prikryl (1987, 1990), and Yates and Ferring (1986) (Table 3.1). Table 3.1.

Consequently, the following chronology presents an overview of the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods with special focus on the Late and Transitional Archaic, providing the framework for subsequent discussion of research objectives. Archaic The Archaic period in North Central Texas is subdivided into Early (8,500–6,000 B.P.), Middle (6,000–3,500 B.P.), and Late (3,500–1,200 B.P.) based on perceived (though not fully agreed upon by all scholars) technological, environmental, and adaptive changes (Perttula 2004:9; Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990:48). In the eastern and southwestern United States and on portions of the Great Plains, development of horticultural-based, semi-sedentary to sedentary populations followed the Archaic period. In these areas, the Archaic truly represents a developmental stage of adaptation as Willey and Phillips (1958) define it. It generally is believed to represent a shift toward hunting and gathering of a wider array of animal and plant resources and a decrease in group mobility (Willey and Phillips 1958:107–108). For North Central Texas, this characterization of the Archaic is somewhat problematic. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that Archaic-like adaptations were in place before the Archaic (Bousman et al. 2002; Collins 1998, 2004:117–118; Collins et al. 1989) and that these practices continued into the succeeding Late Prehistoric period (Collins 2004:118–119; Prewitt 1981:74). 16 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Early Archaic Within the North Central Texas region, the Early Archaic period (8,500–6,000 B.P.) is marginally better documented than the Paleoindian period. However, both Early and Middle Archaic sites are few in number due to extensive erosion of mid-Holocene deposits. Early Archaic sites, specifically, are difficult to define due to a lack of well-documented archeological sites with distinct Early Archaic components. Most sites in this region are temporally mixed with inconsistent artifact assemblages, thus providing poor cultural associations. Those sites that have provided valuable data regarding the Early Archaic Period (i.e., Prikryl 1990) are limited to surficial findings (Ferring 1994; Frederick et al. 2006; McKee et al. 2010; Prikryl 1990; Todd and Skinner 2006; Williams 2004). Lynott (1981) proposes that population increased slowly over time, responding to warmer and drier environmental conditions. It is thought that these factors may have led Archaic populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of North Central Texas to develop a diversified hunting and gathering pattern based on bottomland resources of the rivers and major creeks (Hofman et al. 1989). In general, projectile points were manufactured from local lithic sources suggesting that populations were less mobile during the Early Archaic period relative to the preceding Paleoindian period. The Early Archaic diagnostics include Angostura, Bulverde, Gower, Hoxie, Martindale, Uvalde, and Wells projectile points, as well as early split-stem projectile points. The trend towards shorter, more triangular projectile points and the emergence of polished tools, as well as ground stone tools, supports a shift in subsistence strategies. This indicates a strategy that relies more heavily on the processing of plant resources and the hunting of smaller, more local game (Williams 2004; Ferring and Yates 1998). The construction and use of rock hearths and ovens, which had been limited during the Paleoindian period, become commonplace in the Early Archaic. The use of rock features suggests that retaining heat and releasing it slowly over an extended period was important in food processing and cooking and also reflects a specialized subsistence strategy. Such a practice probably was related to cooking plant foods, particularly roots and bulbs, many of which must be subjected to prolonged periods of cooking to render them consumable and digestible (Black et al. 1997:257; Wandsnider 1997; Wilson 1930). Botanical remains, as well as other organic materials, are often poorly preserved in Early Archaic sites, so the range of plant foods exploited and their level of importance in the overall subsistence strategy are poorly understood. But recovery of charred wild hyacinth (Camassia scilloides) bulbs from an Early Archaic feature at the Wilson-Leonard Site provides some insights into the types of plant foods used and their importance in the Early Archaic diet (Collins 1998). Middle Archaic The Middle Archaic (6,000–4,000 B.P) is, more or less, an extension of the Early Archaic Period. The drier climate that had been established in the Early Archaic continued into the Middle Archaic, becoming more mesic as time progressed (Freeman 2007). One distinguishable difference that dominates the archeological landscape in Central Texas during the Middle Archaic period is the dense distribution of thermal features (i.e., BRMs and FCR) (Freeman 2007). However, these features are notably lacking from the North Central Texas landscape, specifically in the lower Elm Fork region. A number of reasons have been suggested as to why the feature density is less; however, the three main theories include: a difference in available plant resources, a difference in underlying geology that hinders the processing of specific plant resources (i.e., acorns), and the possibility that the North Central Texas groups developed distinct adaptations to their paleoenvironment, which 17 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

is supported by the distribution of dart points across the region (Nickels et al. 2015; Prikryl 1990). These dart typologies include Carrollton, Dawson, Morrill, Wells, and basal-notched forms such as Andice and Bell, which differ from the Nolan, Travis, and Bulverde point types commonly found in association with the BRMs in the Central Texas region (Nickels et al. 2015; Prikryl 1990; Turner et al. 2011). There is evidence that large game hunting (i.e., bison) in the early Middle Archaic again became an important dietary component. Johnson and Goode (1994:25) suggest that the Bell and Andice dart types are parts of a specialized bison-hunting tool kit and believe that an influx of bison and bison-hunting groups from the Eastern Woodland margins during a slightly more mesic period marked the transition from the Early Archaic to the Middle Archaic. Bison populations decreased as more xeric conditions returned during the latter part of the Middle Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994:25). In general, cultural patterns in Central Texas during the Middle Archaic period point toward mobile hunter- gather populations intensively harvesting and processing plant materials such as acorns, pecans, and cacti (though not as evident in North Central Texas), as well as hunting small and medium-size game such as deer and turkey, and bison during the earlier parts of the period. In addition to the aforementioned lithic assemblage, other artifacts from the Middle Archaic include choppers, gouges, and expedient tools such as the bifacial and unifacial Clear Fork tools. Grinding stones and bases, referred to as manos and metates, show up in Middle Archaic artifact assemblages as well as several perforators, drills, and awls. Late Archaic Prikryl (1990) places the Late Archaic period from 3500–1250 B.P. and describes a threefold increase in the number of Late Archaic sites compared to the Middle Archaic as well as a greater distribution of sites over the landscape. Story (1981:144) hypothesized these population increases could be a result of factors such as more favorable environmental condition, changes in subsistence practices and technology, and reductions in group mobility, though no evidence for sedentarism during this period exist. The climate during the Late Archaic is suggested by Ferring (1986) to have been more mesic than in the previous Middle Archaic period. In comparison, the West Fork paleosol that developed in the latter part of the Late Archaic (approximately 2,300–1,000 years ago) in the Upper Trinity Basin is said to be evidence of a wetter, more favorable environment (Abbott 2011; Ferring 1986:112; Hall et al. 2011:542–544). This change in climate in the latter part of the Late Archaic would have resulted in the expansion of the Eastern Cross Timber woodlands and provided more food resources for both humans and animals such as deer (Prikryl 1990:74). This increase in locally available resources would have offset the population growth and reduction in group territory sizes occurring during this time period. Sites found within the West Fork paleosol often contain burned clay/clay balls, animal bone, and varying amounts of mussel shell, but similar to site 41DN612, have little to no lithic material (Todd 2014:8). Deer, rabbit, turtle, birds, fish, freshwater mussel shell and a continuing increase in the exploitation of plant resources (evidenced by large, presumably communal burned rock features termed “Wylie pit”) characterize subsistence adaptations during this period (Ferring and Yates 1997:6). The so-called “Wylie pit” is a large human-made pit, used for large-scale processing of plant foods thought to have been used on the East Fork starting in the Late Archaic (Bruseth and Martin 1987; Prikryl 1990:76). These pits, which resemble the BRMs 18 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

of Central Texas, suggest that plant foods were part of a broad-based diet (Kibler and Scott 2000:134). These pits were sometimes repurposed as burials, as seen at sites such as 41COL141 (Prikryl 1987:60-62) and 41DN102 (Skinner et al. 1982:162) along the East Fork at the Roberts Reservoir (Prikryl 1990:76). Late Archaic diagnostics in the North Central Texas region include Bulverde, Castroville, Dallas, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, Ensor, Gary, Godley, Marcos, Marshall, Palmillas, Trinity, and Yarbrough. Projectile point styles overlap with both Eastern and Central Texas archeological regions as well as with Oklahoma to the north, possibly suggesting increasing interaction with groups in those regions (Green et al. 2013; Prikryl 1990). Of these point styles, the Gary point is most common style in the Lower Elm Fork area followed by Dallas and Trinity and Godley, Ellis, Elam, Edgewood, and Yarbrough types. In addition, Prikryl (1990:55) found that lithic material used for tool manufacture in the Late Archaic in this area was predominantly locally available Ogallala quartzite (62 percent) rather than non-local chert (38 percent). This suggests a decrease in group mobility as compared to earlier periods and could be a result of an increase in exploitation of local resources and/or could point to a decrease in access to other areas, possibly as a result of territorial restrictions in Central Texas (Prewitt 1983; Skinner 1981). In addition, the first currently known evidence of ceramics was found at Cedar Creek and the Richland-Chambers reservoirs at the eastern margins of North Central Texas region (Bruseth and Martin 1987; Story 1965). Transitional Archaic The Transitional Archaic is defined as the last 1,000 years of the Late Archaic (2250–1250 B.P.) and is thought to be an intensification of the cultural patterns of that time (Turner et al. 2011). Population continues to rise, and locally sourced chert continues to be readily utilized. Large cemeteries appear in the central Texas region during this time, implying established territories and subsistence zones (Black and McGraw 1985; Collins 2004; Lang 2019). Late Prehistoric This period encompasses 1250–250 B.P. and is divided into two subperiods: Late Prehistoric I (1250–750 B.P.) and Late Prehistoric II (750–250 B.P.) (Turner et al. 2011). This period is technologically defined by the widespread shift from dart points and atlatls to arrow points and bows, as well as specialized stone tools such as end scrapers, small drills, beveled knives, and bifaces. Additionally, this period is marked by the emergence of ceramics, maize horticulture, and more permanent domestic structures (Black and McGraw 1985; Collins 2004; Lang 2019; Todd 2014; Turner et al. 2011). The climate during the Late Prehistoric I period was the same as the Late Archaic and, as such, subsistence behavior during this time continued to rely on the hunting and gathering strategies from the previous period. Diagnostic traits that emerge during this time include grog-tempered and sand-tempered pottery; maize horticulture and the occupation of floodplains; more permanent domestic structures; and Scallorn, Steiner, Catahoula, and Alba arrow points, which are more abundant in the Late Prehistoric I period (Todd 2014). The Late Prehistoric II period coincides with a drying event in North Texas, creating an environment conducive to the return of bison to the region. This period is distinctively marked by the appearance of Perdiz points, as well as Fresno, Washita, and Harrell points. Both local and Caddoan pottery emerge, as well as large, thin bifaces (Pipe Creek and Gahagan), end scrapers, prismatic blades, and stone tool assemblages used in the 19 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

hunting of medium to large mammals such as bison, deer, and antelope (Antilocapra americana) (Turner et al. 2011:49–51). Occupation sites transition during this time from floodplains settlements to sandy terraces located above the floodplains, and faunal tools (i.e., bison scapula hoes) are noted. This new settlement location appears to be conducive to agriculture, although no conclusive evidence has been found to indicate an extension of agricultural activity during this period, aside from the bison scapula tools noted above (Ferring and Yates 1998; Todd 2014). Historic Context The Historic period began in Denton County after the Texian Land and Immigration Company (TLIC) from Louisville, Kentucky, obtained a land grant from Congress in 1841. The grant included all of Denton County, and sections of neighboring counties, with the understanding that the TLIC would convince 800 families from outside of the Republic of Texas to settle within the land in three years (Wade 2020). The first settlement was in the southeastern section, near present Hebron and the land settled by the company became known as the Peters colony (Odom 2020). The majority of the settlers from the area came from the upper South. In 1850, approximately 40 percent of the setters were from Tennessee and Kentucky. However, settlement of the area was slow, due to land cultivation being limited to subsistence agriculture from lack of water transportation (Odom 2020). The Icarian Colony In addition to the Peters colony settlers, French immigrants negotiated with the Peters Land Company for a million acres of land and established the Icarian colony near present-day Justin in 1849. The Icarian experiment was organized by the French socialist Ètienne Cabet, who wanted to create a utopian settlement that would share wealth on an equal basis and abolish private property and capital (Davidson 2020). The initial participants consisted of less than 70 inhabitants with a promise from Cabet that an additional 1,500 inhabitants would follow (Davidson 2020). However, when the settlers arrived at the Icarian colony, less than 100,000 acres of the one million were available for their use, and the land was divided into unconnected half- mile squares. In addition, the land was not suited for cultivation, and the colonists did not have enough equipment or horses to produce a crop (Davidson 2020). By midsummer, malaria had spread through the colony and incapacitated the vast majority of the colonists. The second wave of settlers consisted of only 10 inhabitants instead of the promised 1,500 and the remaining colonists abandoned the Icarian experiment and returned to New Orleans in the winter of 1849, less than a year after the colony was established (Davidson 2020). Rural and Urban Growth (1870–1990) Denton County grew slowly until after the Civil War in the 1870s. During this decade, the population doubled in size and new residents began farms, which switched the county’s focus from subsistence agriculture to cultivation (Odom 2020). In the 1880s, Denton County experienced a second wave of growth as railroads entered the county. Production of subsistence agriculture and cattle ranching declined as railroads provided a method of shipping cotton and wheat. Denton County proved ideal for wheat and from 1890 to 1920 the county ranked first or second in wheat production in the state of Texas (Odom 2020). In addition, cotton 20 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

peaked in 1920, but declined by the 1980s as demand for cotton decreased. Due to railroads playing a vital part in the economy, town locations were determined by railroads up to the 1970s (Odom 2020). Denton County experienced a third wave of expansion in the twentieth century as a commercial and higher education center. In 1890, the Texas Normal College was established, which later became the University of North Texas. In 1993 the university had an enrollment of more than 20,000 students (Odom 2020). In addition, the Girls’ Industrial College, which later was renamed to Texas Women’s University, was established in 1903. The two colleges attracted population growth and improved the cultural life in Denton (Odom 2020). During World War II, the county began transitioning from rural to urban as Denton began to serve as an extension of Dallas-Fort Worth. Completion of Interstate Highway 35 in the 1950s increased commuting, and by the 1980s Interstate highways 35E and 35W forked in Denton. After completion of the highway, Denton was connected to Dallas-Fort Worth and was the residence of many commuters to the city (Odom 2020). In addition to urban development, the rural population nearly tripled in growth from 1960 to 1980. A transition from small rural plots to large, sprawling ranches was observed as the horse trade expanded in Denton County (Odom 2020). By 1983 horses had brought a significantly larger income than any agricultural product and both newcomers and older residents reverted a significant portion of Denton County’s cropland to pasture (Odom 2020). Historic Map Review A review of the historic topographic maps and aerial maps revealed two structures near the 41DN612 site area (Foster et al. 2006; Historic Aerials 2020; USGS 2020). The first structure is located approximately 459 feet north of the site on the north side of FM 407. The structure appears on the 1961, 1969, and 1987 topographic maps, but is not present on the 2013 topographic map and later. In addition, the structure is present on the 1968 historic aerial map and is not present on the next available map dated in 1981. The structure appears to be a barn or similar outbuilding with an associated corral (Historic Aerials 2020). The second structure is approximately 1,033 feet northeast of the site on the south side of FM 407. The structure appears on the 1961, 1969, and 1987 topographic maps, but is not present on the 2013 topographic map and later. However, no structure is apparent in this location on the historic aerials dating from 1968 to 2016 (Historic Aerials 2020). 21 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Chapter 4. Research Design and Methods Investigations at site 41DN612 entailed multiple phases, including survey conducted by Raba Kistner (Neel and Meléndez 2019), and then staged mitigation and geoarcheological investigations conducted by SWCA. At each phase, the fundamental objectives changed, and accordingly the methodology evolved to address the new objectives. Techniques and methods were first adapted to define the limits and significance of site deposits, and then subsequently modified to gather solid, non-redundant data that would contribute to an understanding of the broad patterns of regional prehistory. SWCA’s investigations at site 41DN612 indicate the prehistoric deposits appear to be primarily associated with the Transitional Archaic, although there is slight overlap with the Late Prehistoric I Period. Within the deposits, two analytical units were defined (i.e., Upper and Lower units) (see Chapter 6 of this report) (Lawrence et al. 2020). The Upper Analytical Unit falls at the end of the Transitional Archaic and very beginning of the Late Prehistoric I Period between 1540–1200 cal yr B.P., and the Lower Analytical Unit occurs between 2080 and 1820 cal yr B.P. As previously mentioned, these analytical units appear to be separated by a recognized period of change on the Denton Creek drainage channel. Abbott (n.d.:7) noted a change along Denton Creek at the US 380 crossing approximately 13 miles (21 km) upstream from 41DN612 around 1,740 years ago. Although the noted change to the Denton Creek channel is referring to a localized event at the US 380 crossing, the drainage certainly experienced similar contemporaneous alterations upstream and downstream from that crossing. The changes to Denton Creek upstream from the project area approximately 1,700 years ago may explain the increase in sedimentation separating the two age groups observed at the site. Research Design The following research design was developed to address general questions pertaining to prehistoric land use in the upper Trinity Basin area of North Central Texas focusing on variability in burned rock features and functional implications, and subsistence practices and implications to land use and mobility during the Transitional Archaic. Although no lithic materials were recovered from the site, good faunal and floral preservation allowed SWCA to explore the issues of burned rock cooking technology (hot rock cooking) and subsistence strategies during the analysis and reporting stages of the investigations and then compare these data with known regional Transitional Archaic sites. The following research topics were proposed for the analysis and reporting of the data recovery investigations. Research Topic 1: Burned Rock Cooking Technology:  SWCA examined the data collected for the burned rock features at the site with the goal of inferring feature functions and changes in technology, resource exploitation over time, and site occupational intensity and frequency, to further our understanding of broader issues regarding settlement patterns, foraging strategies, and social organization in the Transitional Archaic period in North Central Texas.  A total of seven burned rock features were identified at 41DN612 during the course of the investigations. A large BRM (i.e., Feature A) and five dense burned rock clusters within or just below the BRM (i.e., Features 1 through 5) were encountered in the Upper Analytical Unit. The size of Feature A (over 8 m in diameter), as well as quantity of rocks and basin shape, indicate a high investment of labor for food 22 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

## Page 35

processing and/or an extended period of environmental stability. One burned rock feature (i.e., Feature 6) was identified in the Lower Analytical Unit. This feature is a discrete, burned rock cluster interpreted to be single- or limited-use hot rock cooking event.  The small, isolated burned rock features identified in the Upper and Lower Analytical Units are interpreted as single-use cooking features, which suggests a lower investment of labor for food processing and intermittent or brief occupations of the site area during this period. Conversely, the accumulation of the large BRM in the Upper Analytical Unit is suggestive of a higher investment of labor and more intensive and/or repetitive occupation of the site during the latter part of the Transitional Archaic (Black and Thoms 2014:205, 222; Dering 1999). Further study of the contexts and functions of these features as they relate to investment of labor and resource availability could yield information on economical and organizational aspects of landscape use, planning, and shifting resource bases over time. Specific research questions and data used to address these issues are presented below: 1) Are there variations in feature function at the site over time and/or within each of the analytical units?  Feature function was inferred using the feature data recorded during the field investigations (e.g., feature dimensions and morphology, coarse and fine matrix descriptions, and nonmatrix constituents) and results of macrobotanical and faunal analysis. The most common function attributed to burned rock features is their utilization as ovens or hearths (Black et al. 1997). In North Central Texas, earth ovens of varying sizes were especially common by 2500 B.P. in the Late Archaic, and stone-boiling features were also reported in this area during this period (Fields 2004; Rogers 1997; Rogers and Kotter 1995). Thoms (2009:577) provides the following, more-comprehensive list of hot-rock cooking methods/functions: a) grilling or otherwise cooking on open-air hearths with stone heating elements fired in situ, b) baking with stone heating elements, fired in situ or elsewhere, in closed pits and mounds (earth ovens), c) steaming with stone heating elements, fired in situ or elsewhere, in closed pits and mounds, and d) stone boiling in open pits and non-ceramic vessels with stones heated on nearby surface hearths/fires.  In addition to the methods of cooking, resources used for construction (e.g., rock, wood fuel) of the feature as well as the resource(s) processed or around each feature, were reviewed and compared to the other features at the site. 2) How many individual cooking events are estimated for the earth ovens within the site?  The burned rock at the site was size-sorted, weighed, and counted by material type (e.g., limestone, quartzite) for each unit by level and/or feature and a representative sample of material types was collected. Feature burned rock weights and rock sizes were used to estimate the number of cooking events associated with each feature classified as an earth oven, and for the BRM (earth oven facility). Based on data from excavated archeological sites and experimental earth ovens, a general range of burned rock weight per cooking event is estimated to be 100 to 250 kilograms (kg) (Black 1985; Black et 23 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

al. 1997; Dering 1999; Leach et al. 1998). In addition, the size and fragmentation of feature rocks can aid in the evaluation of use and reuse of features. In general, larger rocks are more likely part of a “primary structural element” of an earth oven, whereas smaller rocks are more indicative of reuse and/or discard (Black et al. 1997:83). 3) What is the relationship of site formation processes and the patterning of the cultural features observed within the site?  The geoarcheological analysis results and feature distribution throughout the site were used to determine what processes have affected the cultural manifestations observed at the site. Are the smaller, isolated features a result of more sedimentation covering the site during that time period, indicative of specific feature function and/or specific resource processing, a result of cultural/natural disturbances, or a combination of these factors? Did the large BRM feature accumulate due to a period of surface stability, allowing reuse of the site features creating a palimpsest, or is this a result of intensification of resource processing and the need for larger cooking features (i.e., increased labor investment)? Research Topic 2: Subsistence Strategies:  Through the analysis of burned rock feature technology, flora, and faunal samples, and regional paleoenvironmental data, the investigations could identify if there are any discernible changes amongst the isolable Transitional Archaic occupations at the site. As Todd (2014) mentions, only a limited number of analyses have been conducted for floral remains at archeological sites in the Upper Trinity Basin area, and even fewer of these studies are for sites from the Transitional Archaic. Nonetheless, the limited floral data combined with more robust faunal data suggest the foraging patterns of the prehistoric inhabitants of the Upper Trinity River basin can be characterized as broad diet breadth exploiting locally available resources such as deer, rabbit, small game, turtle, birds, fish, and freshwater mussel shell, and an increased use of plant resources.  Analysis of the preserved flora and faunal material and cooking features aided in determining whether the 41DN612 assemblage is consistent with these expectations or shows a different foraging strategy. Specific research questions associated with this topic include: 1) Is the 41DN612 assemblage consistent with expectations of a broad-based foraging strategy?  Results of the macrobotanical analyses on samples from feature contexts at 41DN612 primarily identified wood charcoal, interpreted to be fuel for cooking features, and carbonized bulb scale fragments (geophytes) including camas (Camassia spp.) and wild onion or garlic (Allium spp.) (Bush 2020). In addition, indeterminable starchy fragments were also identified and may represent bulbs, tubers, rhizomes, or large, starchy seeds. The tubers might be prairie turnips (Psoralea esculenta, also known as Pediomelum esculentum) or scurfpea (Pediomelum spp.) found at other sites in the Trinity Basin (Field et al. 1993; McGregor and Bruseth 1987; Reid 1977; Wedel 1978). Earth oven facilities were used to convert otherwise inedible foods such as these into more digestible starches and sugars (Dering 1999; Thoms 2008; Wandsnider 1997). Dering (1999:671) suggests that the use of large earth ovens, such as the BRM at 41DN612, is indicative of a broad-spectrum economy.

would not have been a primary carbohydrate source, rather one component of a much broader subsistence strategy that changed in response to factors such as availability of other, higher-ranked resources (e.g., deer).  The distribution and types of cultural features, macrobotanical remains, and faunal remains (i.e., bone and shell) within each analytical unit will be reviewed and compared against the broad-based diet breadth model presented above. 2) Can any inferences be made about seasonality of site use?  Over 140 mussel shells were recovered from the site from feature and non-feature contexts. The analysis focused on identifying each specimen to the most specific taxonomic order as the specimens allowed. Research was then conducted to try to determine when each mussel shell type would have been available to human gatherers throughout the year and if they were only available seasonally (e.g., in the warmer months). In addition, examination of the macrobotanical remains and faunal bone exploited by site occupants also shed light on the issues of seasonality. For example, most geophytes like the camas and wild onion identified from the site during the macrobotanical analysis, have spring and summer growing seasons (Acuña 2006). 3) Is there any evidence of intensive resource processing or tool manufacture at the site?  Classic signatures of intensive plant processing, such as manos, metates, or nutting stones, are absent at the site. However, the presence of a large BRM in the Upper Analytical Unit suggests intensive plant processing likely occurred on site during the Late Transitional Archaic. The feature function analysis (Research Topic 1, Question 3) aided in determining if intensive plant processing was occurring at the site and when, what resource(s) were being processed intensively, and what methods were being used to process those resources. In addition, examination of faunal remains identified if butchering or intensive processing (e.g., marrow extraction) was occurring at the site during this period.  No lithic tools or detritus were recovered from the site during the survey or excavation phases. Close examination of the freshwater mussel shells and faunal bone was conducted to determine if any evidence of shell-working activities or evidence for production of bone tools is present in the assemblage. Ultimately, this research design sought to provide information that would contribute to the model of prehistoric land use in North Central Texas presented above, as well as address issues pertinent to the understanding of the prehistory of Texas. The research goals proposed for the site were focused on burned rock technology, subsistence practices, and how cultural and environmental factors might have affected these activities throughout the Transitional Archaic. Field Methods Initial Field Methodology Given an accelerated schedule for the proposed construction, TxDOT requested that the adverse effects to site 41DN612 be mitigated through a combination of staged data recovery to detect any additional features and/or 25 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

burials within the project APE (monitored scraping of the site, described below), and alternative mitigation in the form of law enforcement training in best practices when dealing with possible Native American burials and archeological sites. Initial field investigations consisted of monitoring mechanical (i.e., backhoe) scraping in an 8×8-m block surrounding the positive BHTs on 41DN612. Overburden was removed mechanically, followed by systematic scraping into the archeological deposits. If intact features were encountered, scraping was to be ceased while features were exposed by hand, mapped with a Total Data Station (TDS), documented, photographed, and sampled. At least one liter of feature matrix was to be collected for flotation for macrobotanical data. Diagnostic artifacts and FCR were mapped in situ by TDS. Two negative BHTs excavated to the east during survey suggested that cultural materials would not extend in this direction. However, if features were found to extend beyond the block, the excavation would be enlarged accordingly. Once materials related to the known occupation were documented and removed, scraping would continue down until it was determined whether additional underlying occupations were present within the vertical APE. If any underlying features were encountered within the vertical APE, they would be documented and sampled in the same manner. As depths of impacts will not exceed 5 feet at this location, scraping would cease once this depth was reached. The Advisory Council for Historic Preservation was advised of the pending adverse effects to site 41DN612, and approved of the proposed mitigation strategy. The PI of the investigation is Kevin Hanselka (TxDOT), who was assisted in the field by personnel from SWCA and Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES). This proposed strategy was developed in consultation with interested Tribes. In the event that human remains are discovered during any phase of fieldwork or construction, investigators shall cover the remains, cease work in the immediate area, and procedures consistent with the TxDOT’s programmatic agreement and the Texas Health and Safety code will be initiated. If practical, work may continue in areas more than 5 m away from the identified remains. During the initial mechanical and hand scraping, it was discovered that the site did not consist of four discrete burned rock clusters, rather, the site contained a large BRM. As such, the field methodology had to be adjusted due to the additional complexities of the site (see below). Modifications to Field Methods As previously mentioned, it became necessary to modify certain elements of the excavation methodology once it became apparent that the site contained a large BRM. A combination of mechanical and hand scraping was first used to determine the outer boundary of the portion of the BRM present within the excavation block. The initial excavation block was also expanded to the north and east and an exploratory trench (BHT 1) was excavated to the south of the block to determine the extent of the BRM in each of those directions. A column sample (CS 1) was excavated on the western wall of BHT 1 to explore the historic fill deposits in this portion of the APE and determine if the BRM continued in this direction. The column sample was 50×50 cm, extending from the ground surface to the base of the vertical APE (i.e., 5 feet). The soils from the column sample were excavated in 10-cm levels and screened through ¼-inch hardware screen mesh. 26 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Three traditional, 1×1-m excavations units (i.e., Units 1–3) were then placed over the presumed center of the BRM. As mention in Chapter 1, the purpose of the hand excavations were to: 1) identify, record, and sample any internal feature(s) within the BRM; 2) systematically quantify and characterize the rock material within the BRM; 3) identify and collect in situ datable materials; and 4) document the internal stratigraphy of the BRM and any underlying cultural deposits. The units were excavated in arbitrary 10-cm levels using standard archeological methods, and were documented using standardized field forms and photography. All artifacts and pertinent special samples were collected for analysis and bagged separately to examine site stratigraphy and occupation levels. Features encountered during the investigations were carefully exposed, documented, and sampled (see detailed feature excavation methods below). Upon completion of the hand unit excavations, additional stripping of the excavation block and area immediately south of the block was conducted. The stripping was done “broadcast style” (i.e., starting at the edge of the BRM and exposing a series of adjacent “cuts” to full depth, looking for internal features [if any]). Each cut (herein referred to as BHT) was completed, assigned a letter to designate the BHT, the wall cleaned and photographed, and inspected for internal cultural features before starting the next BHT. Any internal features discovered within the BHTs were exposed, photographed, documented, and sampled by hand. In addition, one “feature-focused” unit (i.e., Unit 4) was excavated during the mechanical stripping phase to further explore the horizontal and vertical extents of Feature A. To expedite the feature investigations, each layer of burned rock within the portions of Feature A in Unit 4 were exposed and photo-documented, but not hand-drawn or sampled; this approach was approved by Kevin Hanselka (PI, TxDOT), who was on site that day. The feature-focused unit was not excavated further after Feature A was fully documented. Ken Lawrence of SWCA and Jim Abbott of TxDOT conducted the geoarcheological investigations at the site concurrent with the mechanical stripping. Once all mechanical and hand excavations and stripping were complete, final photographs were taken and the site was backfilled. Feature Excavation Methods As an important data set, features were focal points of the archeological investigations. The main feature at the site, the large BRM, was designated Feature A. The other six features discovered during at the site were numbered, with the PA maintaining the list of consecutive numbers. Features identified during the hand excavations were exposed in plan, drawn, photographed, and described and documented on a special feature form. Charcoal samples for radiocarbon dating were collected as determined by the PA. Matrix samples were taken for flotation analysis, and the coarse matrix (burned rock) was size-sorted, counted, weighed, and discarded in the field. The remaining matrix was screened through ¼-inch mesh for full artifact recovery. Due to time constraints, features identified within the BHTs during the mechanical stripping were photo- documented but not hand-drawn and limited samples were collected at the discretion of the PA and PI. Geoarcheological Methods Geoarcheological field investigations were conducted in June 2019 and consisted of examining multiple BHTs and excavation units that provided an exposed stratigraphic profile across the site. The exposed BHTs were thoroughly examined and characterized using a modified soil profile documentation advocated by Birkeland (1999) and Schoeneberger et al. (2012) (Appendix 1). All Munsell colors, unless indicated otherwise, were 27 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

recorded dry. These field investigations, conducted by SWCA geoarcheologist Ken Lawrence, M.A., incorporated documentation of the physical characteristics of the horizon matrices as well as systematic sampling to provide matrix for laboratory analyses. Artifact Collection and Sampling Strategy All artifacts and samples recovered from each provenience unit and level were collected, bagged, and labeled accordingly, and were assigned a general bag number in the field inventory. Artifacts exposed during the initial mechanical scraping and exposure of the BRM were point-plotted using the TDS. In addition, artifacts and samples associated with features identified during the backhoe trenching were point-plotted using the TDS while point-plotted artifacts and samples from the excavation units were recorded using the unit datums. Point provenience artifacts and samples were assigned an individual bag number in the field inventory. Burned rock was sorted by material type and then size-sorted, weighed, and counted for each unit by level and/or feature (Appendix 2). A small sample of burned rock was collected to further evaluate material types but the rest of the burned rock was discarded in the field. The presence of snails was also noted on unit level forms but not collected. In conjunction with the excavations, special samples were collected from appropriate contexts across the site. Special samples included materials for radiocarbon dating (from feature and non-feature contexts), matrix samples for flotation, and matrix for geoarcheological analyses. Laboratory Processing and Analysis Methods An important component of the data recovery investigations at 41DN612 was the laboratory processing and analyses conducted subsequent to the fieldwork. These disparate analyses performed separately were designed to provide a more thorough picture from which to interpret the significance of the site. Artifact Processing The artifact processing and cataloging system was done in compliance with the Center for Archeological Studies (CAS) curation standards and guidelines. Artifact processing included washing, sorting, and tabulating the recovered materials with the resulting data compiled into the specimen inventory cataloging system. The field inventory was applied to the specimen inventory, which included assigning lot numbers to the bag numbers previously designated in the field and assigning specimen numbers to facilitate artifact analyses. The specimen inventory for the data recovery excavations are presented in Appendix 3. All artifact processing was accomplished at SWCA’s laboratory. Artifact Analysis Once the fieldwork was complete, SWCA analyzed all recovered artifacts. This included washing all artifacts and sorting into analytical categories, including historic materials, burned clay, and faunal remains (i.e., bone and shell). Analysis of historic artifacts focused on recording basic attributes and determining approximate manufacture dates (Appendix 4). Faunal analysis of animal bone and shell focused on determining species, number of individuals, elements, seasonality, butchering practices, and effects of post-depositional processes (Appendices 5 and 6). Data from the analyses were then used to determine cultural behaviors on the site. Site 28 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

analysis included examining artifact distributions, running all special samples, and comparing overall results to other regional data. Faunal Analysis Animal Bone The 41DN612 animal bone analysis was conducted in SWCA’s Austin office. The assemblage was sorted, thoroughly analyzed, and interpreted by Chris Shelton, M.A. Each faunal element was individually examined and analyzed both macroscopically, and with the aid of a 10x microscope combined with an oblique angle light source. When possible, each specimen within the assemblage was identified to skeletal element, as well as to the lowest level of taxonomic classification using comparative osteology manuals, such as Klein and Cruz- Uribe’s (1984) The Analysis of Animal Bones from Archeological Sites, Lyman’s (1994) Vertebrate Taphonomy, and Olsen’s (1973) Mammal Remains from Archeological Sites, as well as comparative faunal collections housed in the SWCA Austin lab. The faunal assemblage was computer catalogued using Microsoft Excel. The database consisted of 12 distinct criteria, including: taxon identification; common name of animal; estimated body size; element presence; cultural modification presence and type; bone element identification; element side; presence of growth plate fusion; presence and degree of surface weathering; evidence of burning, margin angle, as well as all relevant metrics (Appendix 5). Human taphonomy processes, such as presence or absence of butchery in the form of cut marks, chop marks and percussion impact breakage were cataloged to examine foraging techniques. The combination of these criteria can be analyzed individually or as groups in order to determine important economic, preference, and social information in regard to the site. Shell The 41DN612 shell analysis was conducted in SWCA’s Austin office. Analysis of the shell used macroscopic and low-power microscopic inspection to search for cultural modification and determine the genus and species of each shell. The assemblage was analyzed by SWCA biologist Stephen Van Kampen-Lewis and SWCA archeologist Michael Golden. SWCA archeologists and biologists used designations and distinctive characteristics defined by Howells (2014), who provide a thorough inventory of fresh water mussel shells in Texas, to identify the various species recovered from the excavations. Other comparative manuals, such as Graf and Cummings’s (2020) The Freshwater Mussels (Unionoida) of the World (and other less consequential bivalves) and Randklev et al.’s (2020) Mussels of Texas Project Database were also used to aid in the shell identifications. The shell assemblage was computer catalogued using Microsoft Excel. The database consisted of nine distinct criteria, including artifact type; taxon identification; common name; count; weight; umbo presence; side; adult/juvenile; and cultural modification presence/type along with specific provenience information for each analyzed specimen (e.g., Lot No., Unit, Point Provenience) (Appendix 6). 29 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Special Samples As mentioned briefly above, special samples were systematically collected from appropriate contexts across the site. Special samples included materials for radiocarbon dating (from features, geomorphic units, and other contexts), matrix samples for flotation and/or fine screening (from features), and sediment samples for geoarcheological analysis (e.g., particle size and magnetic susceptibility [MS]). These types of samples, often critical in interpreting a site, were taken from both cultural and natural contexts. Special samples were immediately prepared and submitted to the appropriate laboratories for processing. Quick submittal of the samples ensured a fast turn-around time so that results could be integrated into the report. Radiocarbon Analysis Radiocarbon samples were collected from select locations at 41DN612 to provide an approximate age of specific strata found at the site and to aid in identifying analytical units. The subsequent radiocarbon analyses were conducted by Beta Analytic, Inc. (Appendix 7). The calibration and statistical modeling of the radiocarbon results discussed below was performed by Ken Lawrence using OxCal v4.3.2. Briefly, radiocarbon years (14C) are not calendar years, but rather a measurement of remaining 14C isotopes (Bartlein et al. 1995; Blackwell and Buck 2008; Blackwell et al. 2006; Blockley et al. 2007; McCormac and Baillie 1993; Mock and Bartlein 1995; Ramsey 2008a, 2008b, 2009:337; Stuiver and Suess 1966). Consequently, the 14C years must be converted to a calendrical format (i.e., calibrated) for general interpretation and comparison (Mook and Waterbolk 1985:20). This study uses the nomenclature proposed by Nordt (1992) and the journal of American Antiquity guidelines for distinguishing between uncalibrated radiocarbon and calibrated radiocarbon results. Specifically, the results of these analyses are here reported in both conventional radiocarbon age (14C yr BP) and the calendar calibrated (cal yr BP) results. The Gregorian calendar year A.D. 1950 is recognized as the beginning point of B.P. (Hua 2009; Mook and Waterbolk 1985; Stuiver and Polach 1977; Taylor 1997:67–68, 2009). Due to the proximity and tight vertical control of the collected radiocarbon samples, the conventional radiocarbon results of select samples from Beta Analytic, Inc., were recalibrated and examined with Bayesian modeling. Briefly, the calibration software (e.g., OxCal, Bcal, and Calib), interprets the conventional 14C data with a probability distribution (Banning 2000; Ramsey 1995, 1998, 2001, 2008a, 2009). The calibration software plots the 14C dating results onto the calibration curve and then characterizes the probability of the interpreted outcome. There are more than a half dozen software packages, but the one used for the 41DN612 analyses was OxCal Version 4.3.2, which can incorporate Bayesian statistics into the characterization of the dating results. Briefly, the calibration software (e.g., OxCal, Bcal and Calib), interprets the conventional 14C data with a probability distribution (Banning 2000; Ramsey 1995, 1998, 2001, 2008a, 2009). Broadly defined, Bayesian statistics enable a researcher to incorporate data from the calibration curve with new data (e.g., 14C results), as well as accounting for prior information, to suggest the most probable outcome (Bayliss and Ramsey 2004; Blackwell and Buck 2008; Buck et al. 1991; Buck et al. 1992; Buck et al. 1994; Buck et al. 1996, Buck et al. 2006; Buck 2004; Christian 1994; Heaton et al. 2009; Ilan 2001; Ramsey 2009). The technique uses Baye’s theorem that expresses the uncertainty of an event or set of parameters occurring before and subsequent to the results of an analysis (Buck 2004; Buck et al. 1996; Christian 1994).

another way, the Bayesian analysis of 14C calibration data considers all possibilities of the outcome (prior) with the measured data (likelihood), and then determines the probability of those results occurring (Ramsey 2009). A prior probability is inferred from relative dates (e.g., stratigraphic position) and then compared with the likelihood probability that is interpreted from the absolute dates (e.g., 14C dates), which culminates in the determination of the posterior probability. When comparing multiple events simultaneously, the large number of individual combinations that are considered for each outcome (iteration) can become infinite. To aid in these analyses by calibration software, a sampling algorithm, such as the Metropolis-Hastings or equivalent, is typically used (Ramsey 2009). Metropolis-Hastings is an algorithm of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, which randomly examines each event across a defined distribution, gradually increasing the confidence of the result (Breyer 2020; Heaton et al. 2009; Ramsey 2009). Further, the implementation of MCMC allows for the inclusion of the uncertainty of multiple factors that can allow for the comparison of points as well as their deviations on the curve (Buck and Blackwell 2004:1101; Everitt 2002; Upton and Cook 2006). For specific OxCal v4.3.2 operations, the calibration curve utilized IntCal13 and the analyses were primarily conducted using default settings. However, output was set at both 68.2 percent (1σ) and 95.4 percent (2 σ) and rounded to the nearest decade for a minimum of 30,000 iterations. These analyses were conducted under the assumption that horizons at lower elevations will be older than shallower samples (i.e., Law of Superposition). The radiocarbon assays at 41DN612 were grouped in the identified stratigraphic horizon and were examined in OxCal using the Phase model under the Sequential setting. This setting allows for sets of radiocarbon samples to be grouped in sequence (i.e., stratigraphic) and contrasted both within the group and against other groups (Ramsey 2009). Further, the Sequential setting can operate under the assumption that another group (i.e., horizon) cannot be temporally contiguous or overlapping (Ramsey 2009). Ultimately, the intent of using this suite of techniques is to derive as much information as possible to compare the results and help identify the analytical units for 41DN612. Flotation and Macrobotanical Analysis Additional attempts were made to obtain plant-related subsistence data from 41DN612. In open, well-drained sites like 41DN612, plant remains rarely preserve unless they were previously exposed to 250–300°C temperatures with little oxygen, resulting in carbonization (Hard et al. 1996). Although resistant to biological deterioration once carbonized, they still may be destroyed by mechanical means (Miksicek 1987:20). When possible, charred fragments visible to the naked eye (“macrofossils”) were collected directly from the site’s exposures (i.e., hand excavation units and BHT walls). Smaller remains go unnoticed during excavation and often slip through screens, so SWCA collected soil samples for processing by water separation, or flotation (Struever 1968), in order to maximize data recovery. Twenty matrix soil samples were retained for this purpose from six features (i.e., Features A and 1–3, 5, and 6) and of those, 18 were processed for further analysis. The samples were processed in a 15-gallon metal wash pan filled about two-thirds with water. A large piece of fine window screen was clipped to the circumference of the rim, loose enough to hang well below the water surface. Individual soil samples were added to the water gradually and gently agitated by hand, allowing for the sediment matrix to break up and free any lightweight organic contents (light fraction) into the water column. 31 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

The light fraction was then scooped from the water using a fine-mesh aquarium net. The procedure was repeated until the entire sample was processed, and the light fraction set to dry. The heavier materials caught in the window screen catchment (heavy fraction) were rinsed clean, dried, and bagged separately from the light fraction. Once dry, each of the light and heavy fractions were weighed (in grams) and the light fractions were packaged to be sent to Dr. Leslie Bush for macrobotanical analysis. In addition to the analysis of light fractions from the feature matrix samples, SWCA sent Dr. Bush 32 fragments of wood charcoal collected directly from feature contexts and from select non-feature contexts for identification. The macrobotanical analysis report and analysis tables are included in Appendix 8. Geoarcheological Investigations The laboratory geoarcheological analyses included texture analyses, calcium carbonate content, and MS. The geoarcheological laboratory analyses (discussed in detail below) of 41DN612 were conducted in September– October 2019 and January–February 2020 at the SWCA Austin office laboratory by Ken Lawrence, the Texas A&M Soil Characterization Laboratory, and assistants Ashley Eyeington and Jessica Ulmer. Particle Size (Texture) Analysis To examine the texture of the matrix at site 41DN612, samples were submitted to Texas A&M Soil Characterization Laboratory. At the laboratory, the samples were removed from their initial shipping containers, placed in aluminum or other non-porous, non-corrodible shallow containers and oven dried at 65°C (+2°C) in a forced air oven for 16 hours or until dry. Following oven drying, samples were pulverized using an open-mesh- bottom hammer-style soil pulverizer. All soil exiting the pulverizer was screened to remove all particles greater than a 2-millimeter (mm) diameter. The texture analyses used the pipette method and identified the percentages of coarse fragments (>2.00 mm), sand (2.00–0.05 mm), silt (0.05–0.002 mm), and clay (<0.002 mm). Results from the analyses were provided in tabular form. Calcium Carbonate Content Analysis To examine the Calcium Carbonate (CaCO ) content of the selected matrix, samples were submitted to Texas 3 A&M Soil Characterization Laboratory. The CaCO analyses used the Chittick method on the matrix and identified 3 the percentages of CaCO , dolomite, and calcite. Results from the analyses were provided in tabular form. 3 Magnetic Susceptibility (MS) Analysis MS analyses of soils have been utilized for archeological investigations for several decades, and have largely been directed toward surveys (e.g., Crowther and Barker 1995; Dalan 1996, 2008; Rosendahl et al. 2014; Van Leusen et al. 2014; Wiewel and Kvamme 2014). More recently, these investigations have focused on archeological site formation and associated depositional processes (Dalan 2006, 2008). In particular, these analyses have assisted in identifying buried or thermally altered soils associated with cultural activities, as well as identifying the horizontal extent of cultural features (e.g., Dalan and Banerjee 1998; Dalan and Bevan 2002; Ellwood et al. 1995; Frederick 2010; Jones and Leffler 2003; Mauldin and Figueroa 2006; Nickels 2010; Peters and Thompson 1999; Rivers et al. 2004). 32 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Extensive reviews of the processes of environmental magnetism and particularly the application of MS have been produced (e.g., Dearing 1999a, 1999b; Gale and Hoare 1991:201–229; Maher et al. 1999; Thompson and Oldfield 1986; Verosub and Roberts 1995). Briefly, however, magnetic minerals are prevalent in the natural environment and are sensitive to environmental changes (Gale and Hoare 1991:202). The measurement of MS, χ (Chi), is a quantification of the “magnetisability” of the material (Dalan 2008; Dalan and Banerjee 1998; Dearing 1999b:5; Gale and Hoare 1991:202–204). The mineralology, the size and shape of the grains, internal stress, and other factors can initially influence the susceptibility value (Dearing 1999a, 1999b; Gale and Hoare 1991:204). However, of relevance to this discussion, factors including organic content, pedogenesis, thermal alteration, and cultural activities (e.g., ash-charcoal and refuse) can subsequently alter (usually increase) the susceptibility values. The implications of using MS for archeological research is that when examining either vertical or horizontal areas, the susceptibility values can assist in identifying cultural activity areas that may otherwise be blurred at a macro level. Horizontally, the application of MS analysis has been used to define the limits of cultural features and living spaces in excavation blocks (e.g., Mauldin and Figueroa 2006; Wiewel and Kvamme 2014). Vertically, the MS results have been applied to recognizing and delineating cultural horizons (e.g., Frederick 2010, 2012; Lawrence and Frederick 2012). For the investigations at 41DN612, MS samples were collected from profile walls of excavation units (Units) 1 and 2. The MS samples were collected up profile in systematic 3- to 5-cm intervals. Each of the samples were mapped into the profile, effectively correlating them to site stratigraphy and excavation elevation. The select samples were placed in 8-cc inert plastic cubes and correlated with the BHT stratigraphy. These samples were subsequently analyzed using a Bartington MS2 meter and MS2B dual frequency sensor to examine both low (χlf) and high (χhf) frequency (470 and 4700 Hz, respectively) MS. The cube samples were measured at the high sensitivity setting (i.e., 0.1) compared to the normal sensitivity setting (i.e., 1.0). The high sensitivity setting was necessary since the frequency dependency of the MS samples were also calculated (Gale and Hoare 1991:223–224). The values for each cube sample were catalogued twice at both the low and high frequencies to provide an average value using the Système International (SI) scale. Each of the χlf, χhf, and the average values were recorded, as well as each sample’s weight in an Excel table. After every five readings, the Bartington MS2 meter was “zeroed” out to recalibrate the meter. The cube samples from this analysis were subsequently calculated using the methods outlined by Gale and Hoare (1991:223–226). Briefly however, the primary metric for recognizing MS values of interest is the coefficient of frequency dependency (χfd). This calculation is indicated as: χfd= 100 [(χlf-χhf)/ χlf] This calculation uses χlf as the ‘normal’ sensitivity value and contrasts it with the χhf value to reveal significant values of difference in percentages (Dearing 1999a:47, 1999b:17–18; Gale and Hoare 1991:226). Elevated values of χfd can represent concentrations of ultrafine magnetic grains (e.g., maghemite), which are commonly associated with pedogenesis (Dalan 2006:164; 2008:22). Several factors may cause an increase in χlf values including biological (e.g., bacteria) or inorganic (e.g., natural weathering of iron minerals) processes. In an archeological context, an increase in χlf values may reflect cultural activities from thermal features and general refuse (Dalan 2008; Dalan and Banerjee 1998; Frederick 2012).

an archeological site, collected in systematic intervals (e.g., 2–3 cm), and contrasted with cultural data (e.g., artifact frequencies), this analysis can provide valuable data to interpret site formation and cultural activities. Maximum Firing Temperature (Burned Clay) Analysis As part of the geoarcheological investigations of 41DN612, Ken Lawrence and Ashley Eyeington determined the maximum firing temperature of the burned clay samples recovered from the site. These analyses were conducted on five samples from Units 2 and 3 and one sample collected during the scraping at the site. Previous researchers (i.e., Rasmussen et al. 2012) have determined using a systematic step-wise refiring in combination with magnetic susceptibility analysis that the maximum temperature of burned clay and pottery between 400–1000°C can be approximated with relative certainty to within +25.8°C accuracy. The methods are discussed in more detail below. Subsequent researchers (e.g., Goodwin and Hollenback 2016; Karacic et al. 2016; Kostadinova-Avramova et al. 2018; Jordanova et al. 2019; Tema and Ferrara 2019) have tested the general approach advocated by Rasmussen and others (2012) and found it to be valid. Notably, Tema and Ferrara (2019) in their experiments with natural clay and analysis of ancient clay from two archeological sites do advise some caution. Specifically, the researchers observed that maximum temperatures of burned clay determined to be <300–400°C should be used with extreme caution since the thermomagnetic curve can be reversible at those lower temperatures (Tema and Ferrara 2019:70–74). Overall, the research in the determination of maximum firing temperature of burned clay with magnetic susceptibility analysis is agreed to be an effective and acceptably precise approach. The primary objective of determining the maximum firing temperature of the burned clay nodules at 41DN612 was to discern if these items were the product of cultural activities or rather natural phenomenon (e.g., range fire). Various researchers (e.g., Bellomo 1993; Canti and Linford 2000) have conducted experiments using several approaches including MS. Bellomo (1993:533) determined a natural grass fire typically had temperatures between 100°C and 225°C, tree stump fires produce temperatures ranging from 200°C to 250°C, and campfires can produce temperatures between 400°C and 600°C. Similarly, Canti and Linford (2000) concluded that surface campfires (i.e., hearths) typically remain below 500°C with a commensurate drop in temperature with depth away from the heating element. Therefore, any evidence of maximum temperatures in the burned clay analyses exceeding 300°C is attributed to cultural activity. Admittedly, the context of the burned clay at 41DN612 was within a recognized cultural feature in a prehistoric site. Therefore, the inferential leap attributing these burned clay samples to cultural origins is not large. However, if the maximum firing temperature for each of these samples can be approximated then the second objective of the study might be accomplished, which is to examine integrity of the site and feature. The premise is that if the firing temperature of separate samples are “equivalent” then an inference might be made that they are associated with the same thermal event. If those “equivalent” samples are scattered over a broad vertical span (e.g., > 50 cm) but are within proximity to each other (e.g., < 2 m), then it could be interpreted as an indicator of vertical translocation. This inference is based on the discrete size of a typical thermal feature. Conversely, if the “equivalent” samples are in a very discrete vertical context (e.g., <10 cm) but broadly distributed horizontally (e.g., >2 m) then translocation of the samples should be considered. In the instance of a broad burned rock midden as found at 41DN612, the translocation may be attributed to the reuse and/or 34 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

extraction of the cooked foodstuffs. Regardless, any interpretations would ideally be made with additional corroboration with available data. The determination of the maximum firing temperature of the burned clay samples utilized the approach of Rasmussen and others (2012). Specifically, beginning at room temperature, the susceptibility values of the samples were repeatedly examined with a Bartington MS2 meter and MS2B dual frequency sensor. At the end of each interval of being gradually cooked in a muffle furnace at prescribed temperatures for certain intervals of time the average χlf and derivative χlf was calculated. Rasmussen et al. (2012:1706) recommends calculating and plotting the squared first derivative value against the next subsequent value to provide a more accurate representation of the step-wise refiring temperature. Put another way, the value at one temperature stage (e.g., 250°C) is compared against the value of the next higher temperature stage (e.g., 350°C) with the process repeated up to 1,000°C. Using the plotted data, a notable change should mark the point when the original maximum firing temperature is exceeded (for example see Rasmussen et al. 2012: Figure 1). Ultimately, the prominent spike of a sample is correlated to the temperature and compared with the temperatures identified by previous researchers (e.g., Bellomo 1993; Canti and Linford 2000) to provide a context whether the burned clay nodule is naturally or culturally derived. To take into account some of the noted caution by previous researchers (e.g., Tema and Ferrara 2019), a sample was split (if big enough) into multiple samples and the respective fragments were examined parallel to each other. This allowed for a validity test of the maximum firing temperature of the clay nodule. Unfortunately, an unburned clay sample from off site to use for comparison was not examined in this burned clay study. The burned clay study at 41DN612 was an analytical approach devised after the field investigations at the site. The burned clay study solely used recovered data from the excavations at the site. Notably, future burned clay studies would benefit from incorporating off site “baseline” data. Curation Per specifications of the ACT permit issued for the data recovery (Antiquities Permit No. 8872), all project documents and artifacts must be curated at an approved curatorial facility. Artifacts recovered during the investigations were prepared for permanent storage (e.g., washing, labeling, and cataloguing) and curation using state archeological standards. All curated artifacts will be housed at the Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas State University, San Marcos (CAS). 35 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Chapter 5. Overview of Data Recovery Investigations This chapter summarizes the results of SWCA’s data recovery excavations at the Hardeman Midden Site (41DN612) that were conducted from April 14 to June 22, 2019, to mitigate project effects to the site. The results from the initial mechanical scraping, hand unit excavations, and mechanical trenching undertaken at the site are discussed, followed by a summary of the natural stratigraphy at the site. An overview of the radiocarbon and geoarcheological sample analyses results, particularly regarding site formation processes are also provided. Chapter 6 presents more-detailed information on recovered materials and cultural features encountered during these excavations. Previous work at the site during the initial survey by Raba Kistner was summarized in Chapter 1 (Neel and Meléndez 2019). Scraping Investigations During the initial scraping, soils were removed by backhoe from an 8×8-m block surrounding previously identified features identified during the initial APE survey (Neel and Meléndez 2019) (Figure 5.1; see Figure 1.4). During the monitoring of the scrape area, identified cultural materials were point plotted and all faunal bone and shell were collected. Burned rock were plotted and material types and size grades were noted; however, the rock was not collected. As previously mentioned, the initial 8×8-m excavation block was expanded to determine the extent of the BRM. This included scraping an additional 2 m to the east and excavation of BHT 1 to the south of the southeast corner of the excavation block (Figures 5.2 and 5.3). Figure 5.1.

Hand Excavations A total of 3.21 m3 of soils were excavated across the site among three 1×1-m traditional excavation units (i.e., Units 1–3) and one 50×50-cm column sample (CS) unit (i.e., CS 1) (Table 5.1; see Figure 1.4). One feature- focused unit (i.e., Unit 4) was also excavated during the investigations.; however, no matrix was screened so this is not included in the total cubic meters of soils excavated. The units were laid out on top of the presumed central portions of the BRM (Feature A). During the hand excavations, one additional feature (Feature 1) was identified and sampled. Table 5.1.

The datum used for the units was shot in with the TDS and had an elevation of 153.5 m. The datum set up for the column samples had an elevation of 153.94 m. All excavation unit and column sample elevations referenced below are in relation to these datum elevations. Due to undulations in the ground surface, the first levels in the excavation units were thicker than 10 cm (e.g., Unit 1, Level 1 beginning at 153.24 m and terminating at 153.1 m [14-cm-thick level]). Unit 1 Unit 1 was placed over a dense concentration of burned rock exposed during the initial mechanical scraping (Figure 5.4). The unit was excavated in nine levels from elevation 153.24 to 152.3 m (26 to 120 cm below datum [cmbd]. A total volume of 0.94 m3 was excavated from Unit 1 (see Table 5.1). The excavations in Unit 1 revealed that the dense concentration of burned rock (Feature A) extended to approximately 58 cmbd or an elevation of 152.92 m. The concentration consisted of approximately 6 layers that extended throughout the entire unit. A dense cluster of large, tabular burned rock was encountered at 35 to 40 cmbd (153.15–153.1 m); this was interpreted to be an internal feature (possibly a heating element) within the larger BRM and was designated as Element 1 (see Feature A discussion below). Below that, between 58–80 cmbd (152.92–152.7 m), a sharp decrease in burned rock was encountered. In Level 6 (152.7– 152.6), within Stratum IV, an isolated burned rock concentration was observed within the central portion of the unit. Charcoal was observed within the center of the burned rock cluster. This phenomenon was designated as Feature 1 (see Feature 1 discussion below). Cultural materials encountered in Unit 1 included 29 faunal bone, four unmodified shell, one metal fragment, one clay artifact (i.e., burned clay), and over 40 kg of burned rock. In addition, 14 charcoal samples, eight feature matrix samples, four soil matrix samples, and 68 geoarcheological samples (59 MS and nine bulk matrix samples) were collected from Unit 1. 38 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Figure 5.4. Unit 1, Level 1 opening photograph. Unit 2 Unit 2 was excavated adjacent to the north wall of Unit 1 over a dense concentration of burned rock (i.e., Feature A) exposed during the initial mechanical scraping. Unit 2 was also excavated in nine levels from elevation 153.24 to 152.3 m (26 to 120 cmbd). A total volume of 0.94 m3 was excavated from Unit 2 (see Table 5.1). The excavations in Unit 2 revealed the dense concentration of burned rock (Feature A) extended to approximately 80 cmbd or an elevation of 152.7 m (Figure 5.5). Four possible internal heating element features (Elements 1–4) were identified within Feature A in Unit 2. Element 1 identified in Unit 1 at 35 to 40 cmbd (153.15–153.1 m) extended into Unit 2. A basin-shaped alignment of 10–15+ cm FCR was exposed in the north wall profile of Unit 2 at approximately 45–50 cmbd (153.05–153.0 m) and was designated as Element 2. Element 3 consisted of a basin-shaped alignment of large, angular FCR measuring 8–15 cm in diameter at approximately 54–60 cmbd (152.96–152.9 m). Element 4 was a basin-shaped alignment of large FCR measuring 10–15+ cm in diameter exposed in the north wall profile at approximately 75 cmbd (152.75 m). These elements are discussed in more detail in the Feature A discussion in Chapter 7. Below that, between 80–120 cmbd (152.7–152.3 m), a sharp decrease in burned rock was observed. No additional features or burned rock clusters were observed within Unit 2. Cultural materials encountered in Unit 2 included 43 faunal bone, 37 unmodified shell, one quartzite fragment, nine clay artifacts (i.e., burned clay), and over 80 kg of burned rock. In addition, eight charcoal samples, six feature matrix samples, and 39 geoarcheological samples (all for MS) were collected from Unit 2. 39 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Unit 3 Unit 3 was excavated adjacent to the east wall of Unit 1 to further explore Feature A exposed during the initial mechanical scraping and within Levels 1–3 of Unit 1 (Figure 5.6). Unit 3 was excavated in nine levels from elevation 153.25 to 152.3 m (25 to 120 cmbd). A total volume of 0.95 m3 was excavated from Unit 3 (see Table 5.1). The excavations in Unit 3 revealed the dense concentration of burned rock (Feature A) extended to approximately 50 cmbd or an elevation of 153.1 m. Two of the possible internal heating element features (Elements 1 and 2) previously mentioned for Unit 2, also extended into Unit 3. Element 1 was identified in Level 1 of Unit 3 at 35 to 40 cmbd (153.15–153.1 m) (Figure 5.7). Element 2 was identified in the north wall of Unit 3 at approximately 45–50 cmbd (153.05–153.0 m) (Figure 5.8). Below that, between 50–120 cmbd (153.1–152.3 m), a sharp decrease in burned rock was observed (see Figure 5.8). No additional features, or clusters were observed within Unit 3. Cultural materials encountered in Unit 3 included 16 faunal bone, 11 unmodified shell, 10 clay artifacts (i.e., burned clay), and over 30 kg of burned rock.

Figure 5.8. Feature A Element 2 burned rock exposed in north wall of Unit 3 and south wall of Unit 4 at approximately 45–50 cmbd (153.05–153.0 m). Unit 4 Unit 4 was excavated adjacent to the east wall of Unit 2 to further expose and photo-document the burned rock layers of Feature A observed in the adjacent Units 1–3 (Figures 5.9 and 5.10). Unit 4 was excavated as a feature-focused unit; therefore, no matrix was screened, and no cultural materials were collected. During the excavations, five layers of Feature A burned rock were exposed from 153.27–152.93 m. Two possible internal heating element features (Elements 1 and 2) previously described in the Units 1–3 discussions, extended into Unit 4. Element 1 was identified in burned rock Layer 2 of Unit 4 (top elevation recorded as 32 cmbd [153.18 m]) (see Figure 5.9). Element 2 was identified in burned rock Layer 3 of Unit 4 (top elevation recorded as 39 cmbd [153.11 m]) (see Figures 5.8 and 5.10). Rock sort data was not obtained for these two elements as the burned rock from Unit 4 was only photo-documented. In addition, only a general top elevation of each of the burned rock layers was recorded; therefore, elevation ranges for Elements 1 and 2 within Unit 4 are not available. 42 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Column Sample (CS) 1 CS1 was excavated off the west wall of BHT 1 to explore both the historic and prehistoric deposits in this portion of the site. The CS was 50×50-cm in size and was excavated in 15 levels from elevation 153.84 to 152.34 m (10 to 160 cmbd) (Figure 5.11). A total volume of 0.38 m3 was excavated from CS1 (see Table 5.1). The CS encountered a disturbed upper zone in Levels 1 and 2 containing 175 pieces of historic debris (e.g., metal, glass, brick) that extended to 30 cmbd or an elevation of 153.64 m. Below this zone, isolated historic artifacts (i.e., single clear bottle glass fragments) were recovered from Levels 3, 4, and 6 and isolated prehistoric artifacts (i.e., burned rock, faunal bone) were recovered from Levels 6 and 7. A small cluster of burned rock was identified in the northeast corner of Level 8 between 80–90 cmbd (153.14–153.04 m). Only diffuse prehistoric artifacts including burned rock, faunal bone, mussel shell, and burned earth were encountered in the remaining levels between 130–160 cmbd (152.64–152.34 m). Historic artifacts encountered in CS1 included 146 glass fragments (6 amber/brown bottle, 127 colorless bottle 1 cobalt blue bottle, and 12 colorless window), one aluminum circular saw blade fragment, one brick fragment, one terracotta ceramic fragment, eight round-headed nails, one bolt, and 17 miscellaneous metal fragments. The prehistoric artifact assemblage included four unidentifiable faunal bone fragments, one burned clay nodule, one mussel shell identified as threeridge (Amblema plicata), and 13 burned limestone rock.

Backhoe Trench Investigations In addition to the scraping of the main excavation block and subsequent hand excavations, a series of BHTs were excavated. Specifically, 12 BHTs were placed over the main excavation block and an additional four BHTs were excavated south of this area (see Figure 1.5). The BHTs (BHTs A–P) were systematically placed and oriented to determine the site deposits and their character. BHTs A–D were excavated roughly east to west, while BHTs E–P were excavated north to south (Figure 5.12). During the BHT investigations at the site, five additional cultural features were identified (i.e., Features 2–6). A total of approximately 307.7 m3 of soils were excavated during the initial mechanical excavations and subsequent stripping. Site Stratigraphy The stratigraphy observed in the BHTs and in the excavation block area was very similar across the site (see Figure 5.12). Five horizons were observed extending to approximately 195 cmbs (Appendix 1). The typical stratigraphy observed in the BHTs consisted of a surface horizon (Stratum I) of brown to dark grayish brown (10YR 4/3–4/2) firm, silt clay with angular blocky structure, subrounded pebbles (5 percent), asphalt chunks (1 percent) with a clear and smooth lower boundary (Appendix 1). Stratum I also contained clear and brown colored glass fragments. Beginning around 12–15 cmbs, the second horizon (Stratum II) consists of a brown (10YR 4/3) friable silty clay loam with a subangular blocky structure with a clear and smooth lower boundary at approximately 40–45 cmbs (Appendix 1). Stratum II also contained clear glass fragments. The third horizon (Stratum III) consists of a black to very dark brown (10YR 2/1–2/2) friable silt clay loam with a subangular blocky structure, 1-mm-diameter calcium carbonate (CaCO3) filaments, dendritically arranged (2 percent) with a clear and smooth lower boundary (Appendix 1). Stratum III also contained scattered burned rock. Beginning around 85–100 cmbs, the fourth horizon (Stratum IV) consists of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) friable, clay loam with angular blocky structure, 1-mm-diameter CaCO3 filaments, dendritically arranged (5 percent), with a gradual and smooth lower boundary (Appendix 1). Stratum IV contained scattered burned rock. Beginning around 150–180 cmbs, the fifth horizon (Stratum V) consists of brown to yellowish brown (10YR 5/3–5/4) friable, clay loam with 1- to 3-cm slickensides (3 percent), 1-mm-diameter CaCO3 filaments (2 percent) and an unobserved lower boundary (Appendix 1). Stratum V contained scattered burned rock. Notably, a large section of the site and scrape area has been disturbed by the excavation of a large refuse pit (Figure 5.13; see Figure 1.4). The linear pit was roughly oriented southwest to northeast and was about 35 feet long and minimally 12 feet wide. The southern end of the refuse pit was not observed and certainly extends south of the southernmost BHT (BHT D). The refuse pit was excavated into Strata II–IV and capped by Stratum I. No evidence was observed that the refuse pit was excavated into Stratum V. The base of the refuse pit was deepest (i.e., 133 cmbs) in BHT D and gradually got shallower to the north between BHT A (i.e., 109 cmbs) and the excavation block where the refuse pit was solely confined to Stratum II. The refuse pit was observed to contain dense brick fragments, numerous complete or nearly complete glass bottles, abundant glass fragments (i.e., cobalt, colorless, milk and brown glass), abundant tile, whiteware, a washing machine, a doll leg, foundation rubble, a pipe, a 50-gallon drum, a pot, barbed wire, and miscellaneous metal. The foundation rubble, washing machine, and pipe was limited to BHT A and B (Figures 5.14 and 5.15). 45 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Figure 5.15. Washing machine, facing north. Within BHT 1, the historic debris appeared to have been burned based on the presence of melted glass, charred materials, and dark soil matrix. A representative sample of complete glass bottles (n=27) was collected from the backdirt and within BHT 1. Based on the observed temporally diagnostic artifacts within the refuse pit, the assemblage likely dates from the 1890s to the 1960s (Intermountain Antiquities Computer System Guide [IMACS] 2001; Society for Historical Archaeology [SHA] 2020). In addition, faunal bone collected from Level 7 of CS1 (70–80 cmbs; 153.24–153.14 m) was radiocarbon dated to 1955–1956 cal AD. It appears that the pit was excavated (likely by a bulldozer) subsequent to 1950 from the north to south toward Denton Creek, and then filled in with assorted debris and capped. Although not a perfect correlation with the mapped soil pedons for the area (i.e., Frio and Medlin-Sanger series), the stratigraphy encountered at 41DN612 most closely matches the pedon attributed to the Frio series (NRCS 2020). The Frio series has a recorded pedon of A1 (0–20 cmbs), A2 (20–56 cmbs), A3 (56–74 cmbs), A4 (74–102 cmbs), and Bk (102–203+ cmbs) (NRCS 2020). Within 41DN612, the observed soil pedon is interpreted to be an Ap1 (~0–12 cmbs), Ap2 (~12–45 cmbs), Ab (~45–95 cmbs), Bk (~95–170 cmbs), and Bkss (~170 cmbs+). 48 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Chapter 6. Geoarcheological Analyses This chapter summarizes the results of radiocarbon, particle size distribution, and MS analyses conducted at 41DN612 previously presented in the Analytical Unit Definition and Geoarcheology Report (Lawrence et al. 2020). Radiocarbon Analysis Twenty samples (mixture of faunal bone and charcoal) were selected for radiocarbon analysis at 41DN612 to provide chronostratigraphic data for the site (Table 6.1; Appendix 7). All faunal bone and macrobotanical samples were identified to the most specific taxonomic order possible to inform the selection of radiocarbon samples for Accelerated Mass Spectrometry (AMS) dating (e.g., selection of short-lived, carbonized, or economic species) (Appendices 5 and 8). Of the 20 samples, 15 radiocarbon samples had a good elevational and stratigraphic context (Figures 6.1 and 6.2). These samples were modelled in OxCal v4.3.2 by stratigraphic order with the Phase model under the Sequential setting. Four phases were created for this modelling analysis. Specifically, the samples confidently associated with Stratum III deposits were assigned under a phase (i.e., Stratum III), samples located at the base of Stratum III or top of Stratum IV were assigned under Stratum III/IV phase, samples confidently associated with Stratum IV deposits were assigned under a phase (i.e., Stratum IV), while the sample confidently associated with Stratum V deposits was assigned under the Stratum V phase. The results of the modelling illustrated a reasonably good stratigraphic order through the 41DN612 excavations (Figure 6.3). Most interesting is that the dates tend to group into two periods regardless of assigned horizon (Figure 6.4). The most recent group crosses Stratum III, Stratum III/IV, and one of the Stratum IV samples roughly falls between 1540 and 1200 cal yr BP. The older group is within Stratum IV and V and roughly falls between 2080 and 1820 cal yr BP (see Figure 6.4). The vertical spread of the more recent group of ages (1540–1200 cal yr BP) across Strata III and IV is likely attributed to the use and reworking of the BRM designated Feature A. This thick scatter of broadly distributed burned rock of Feature A was certainly utilized multiple times by prehistoric inhabitants. Consequently, the excavation of the food materials and subsequent reuse of the BRM at an unknown time likely mixed the dateable materials. It is interesting that within the nine assays composing the 1540–1200 cal yr BP group of ages, the deepest assay (S-18) dates to and clusters with assays S-14 and S-166 around 1310 to 1290 cal yr BP, while the shallowest assay (S-32) clusters with assays B-7, S-36, and S-154 around 1530 to 1460 cal yr BP. Simply put, the oldest age is shallower, while the younger age is stratigraphically deeper (see Figure 6.4). For the older group of ages identified at 41DN612 (i.e., 2080–1820 cal yr BP), a similar argument (i.e., mixing and reuse) is more tenuous due to the good context of the Stratum V assay (S-155) that is approximately 32 cm below the next assay in the group of ages (B-6) in Stratum IV. The almost perfect overlap of these two assays is undetermined with the current data. Unfortunately, Bayesian modelling of the assays through OxCal provided no resolution. Regardless, both groups of dates fall in the period commonly recognized as the Transitional Archaic (Turner et al. 2011:51). The older group in Stratum IV and possibly Stratum V falls near the beginning of the Transitional Archaic, while the more recent group in Stratum III and the top of Stratum IV falls near the end of the Transitional Archaic period. 49 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Notably, one assay (S-40) falls between the two identified age clusters at 41DN612 (see Figure 6.4). This sample was collected from BHT A within Stratum IV and it is separated from the excavation block assays composing most of the chronometric data for 41DN612. The S-40 assay has a very large temporal span and roughly dates to 1700–1550 cal yr BP. This age for S-40 falls closer to the younger age group cluster identified at 41DN612. The rate of deposition on this small sample of dates at 41DN612 was grossly approximated comparing the more recent, shallower ages against the oldest, deepest assay. The approximate rate of deposition at 41DN612 across these prehistoric occupations appears to be approximately 7.5 cm per century. The gap between the two age groups were also compared using sample B-5 in Stratum IV and S-154 in Stratum III/IV. There is approximately 320 years between these two assays and at least 22 cm in elevation, which would approximate a rate of deposition 14.5 cm per century. This estimate doubles the overall estimation of deposition at 41DN612 and Denton Creek. The previously mentioned investigations by Abbott (n.d.:7) on Denton Creek, upstream from 41DN612, noted that Denton Creek around 1740 B.P. avulsed (i.e., abandoned its channel) and began forming a new channel. This dramatic change to the Denton Creek drainage likely explains the notable increase in sedimentation separating the two age groups observed at 41DN612. Further, the aforementioned West Fork paleosol developed within and caps the Pilot Point alloformation, which itself dates from 4,500 to 1,800 years ago (Abbott 2011). By extension then, the West Fork paleosol would date to the latter parts of this period. Previous researchers (Hall et al. 2011), conducting investigations on the Clear Fork of the Trinity River, examined the West Fork paleosol and refined the age of the buried soil as dating more specifically from 2300–1000 years ago. These dates, performed on humate samples, aligned stratigraphically in comparison to charcoal assays in the study (Hall et al. 2011:542–544). The West Fork paleosol encompasses the two age groups observed in the radiocarbon analyses at 41DN612. Further, the observed Stratum III was a buried soil and appears to correlate with the West Fork paleosol, while the underlying Stratum IV and V are similarly associated with the Pilot Point alloformation. Particle Size Distribution A series of soil geomatrix samples were collected at 41DN612 to help characterize the deposits (Figure 6.5). The geomatrix samples (n=10) were predominantly collected from Unit 1 to sample each of the identified strata. One of the samples (S-153) was collected from BHT N (adjacent to Unit 1) that targeted Stratum V at 152.0–151.9 m elevation. The results of the particle size texture analyses from the geomatrix samples by the Texas A&M Soil Characterization Laboratory indicates that Stratum I is a loam, Stratum II is a clay loam, Strata III and IV are clays, and Stratum V is a silty clay to clay (Table 6.2). 56 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

One MS column was collected from a profile in Unit 1 (see Figure 6.5). The second column was collected from a profile in Unit 2 (Figure 6.6). The two columns were positioned on opposite ends of the excavation block with the Unit 1 column on the south end and Unit 2 column on the north end. The southern MS column in Unit 1 extended vertically from the ground surface to the top of Stratum V. The northern MS column in Unit 2 began in the middle of Stratum III and continued downward into Stratum V. Effectively, the two MS columns overlap vertically through 41DN612 deposits. The MS results for the Unit 1 column suggests dynamic fluctuations in the upper two strata that are associated with the disturbance from the refuse pit (see Figure 6.5). Within Stratum III, the MS results for Unit 1 column shows a dramatic and steady increase in values between 153.41 and 153.07 m (see Figure 6.5). These increased values coincide with the zone of BRM designated as Feature A (Figures 6.7 and 6.8). The underlying Stratum IV has areas of increased value, but these spikes are more localized (see Figure 6.5). The spikes in values occur roughly between 152.99 and 152.95 m (see Figure 6.5). As noted previously, Stratum IV contained scattered burned rock throughout the horizon and contained several discrete features. One feature (Feature 1) is recorded near the Unit 2 MS column that likely correlates with the increased MS at 152.99– 152.95 m (see Figure 6.6). Below these spikes in χlf and χhf values in Stratum IV, the values very gradually decrease with depth as the column descends into Stratum V. The MS in Unit 1 within Stratum V indicates the χlf and χhf values were still gradually decreasing in value at the base of the column (see Figure 6.5). 58 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Similarly, the MS analyses within Unit 2 column shows a dramatic and steady increase in values between 153.24 and 153.14 m (see Figure 6.6. These increased values may coincide with the zone of BRM designated as Feature A (see Figures 6.7 and 6.8). More obvious is the elevated values in the underlying Stratum IV (see Figure 6.6). The spikes in values occur roughly between 152.99 and 152.76 m (see Figure 6.6). Near the MS column is a recorded feature (Feature 1) that certainly correlates with the increased MS at 152.99–152.76 m (see Figure 6.6). Below these spikes in χlf and χhf values in Stratum IV, the values very gradually decrease with depth as the column descends into Stratum V. The MS in Unit 2 within Stratum V indicates the χlf and χhf values were still gradually decreasing in value at the base of the column (see Figure 6.6). The results of the MS analyses were combined for the two columns and organized by elevation (Figure 6.9). As with the results in the individual columns, the dynamic fluctuations appear to primarily correlate with recent disturbance in Strata I and II, Feature A (BRM) in Stratum III, and Feature 1 in Stratum IV (see Figure 6.9). Below Feature 1, the MS values gradually decrease with a few, isolated fluctuations down into Stratum V. Burned Clay MS Analyses The analyses of the maximum firing temperature of burned clay were conducted on six samples at 41DN612 with two in Unit 2 (i.e., Samples 1 and 2), three in Unit 3 (i.e., Samples 3, 4, and 5), and one found during mechanical trenching (i.e., Sample 6). This analysis was conducted to accomplish two objectives. The first primary objective was to approximately determine the maximum firing temperature of the encountered burned clay samples and by extension, determine if the samples were attributed to natural or cultural processes. As noted above in the methods section, previous researchers (i.e., Bellomo 1993; Canti and Linford 2000) have correlated specific temperature ranges to natural fires versus cultural thermal activities. The analyses used a slightly modified system used by previous researchers (Rasmussen et al. 2012). When possible, each burned clay sample was broken into two subsamples (i.e., Samples 1A and 1B, 2A and 2B, 3A and 3B, and 6A and 6B) for a total of 10 samples. Notably, two samples (i.e., Samples 4 and 5) were too small to divide into subsamples. Each subsample split was of a comparable size and allowed the respective sample results to be compared and verified (Tables 6.3 and 6.4). Of note, the MS analysis used S.I. 0.1 and recorded both low (χlf) and high (χhf) frequencies to determine if any discrepancies were present. Since all the results were consistent, only one of the data rows (i.e., χlf) was selected for illustration. SWCA calculated both the average χlf and derivative χlf as recommended by Rasmussen et al. (2012:1706). The derivative process is an unambiguous method to establish the threshold temperature rather than solely reading the susceptibility values versus the temperature values. For comparison at 41DN612, the results of the χlf values of the refiring are illustrated in Figure 6.10, while the derivative values of those samples are illustrated in Figure 6.11. The χlf values of Samples 1A, 2A, 3A, 4, and 5, do not exhibit any fluctuation until 850°C, whereas Samples 1B, 2B, 3B, and 6A and 6B were unchanged (see Figure 6.10). In the derivative values, Samples 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, and 3A 62 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Samples 3B, 6A, and 6B exhibited no change in the derivative values. In general, the results of the derivative χlf of all six samples suggest that the burned clay samples do not have a clearly defined maximum firing temperature above 250°C (see Figure 6.11). Without a demonstrable change across the derivative results for the burned clay, at least two options are possible: 1) the maximum firing temperatures were at or below 250°C, which is in the natural fire temperature range (see Bellomo 1993:533), or 2) the samples were located on the periphery of a low-temperature cooking event (see Canti and Linford 2000). Given the abundance of burned rock, the latter seems to be the case. This is particularly true regarding Samples 1, 2, 3, and 4, which are all located within or in proximity to the large BRM identified as Feature A. Sample 5 is not definitively associated with any feature and may be the result of natural firing or may have been displaced by natural processes such as bioturbation. Finally, Sample 6 was a grab sample encountered and 66 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

collected by TxDOT geoarcheologist Jim Abbott during mechanical scraping and no provenience was available; therefore, the sample cannot be placed into spatial context with the identified features at the site. Regarding the fluctuation in derivative values observed for most of the samples above 850°C, this is inferred to be attributed to natural processes (see Figure 6.11). This interpretation is based on several factors including the absence of pottery at 41DN612 and the consistency across the samples at that threshold. As mentioned previously, researchers have identified that a typical thermal feature reaches temperatures above 250°C and below 500°C (Bellomo 1993; Canti and Linford 2000). In contrast, researchers have previously estimated the firing temperatures of ceramics to range from a low of 600°C–650°C (Zhushchikhovskaya and Nikitin 2014:124) to 800°C–900°C (Bong et al. 2008:304; Rasmussen et al. 2012). Understandably, the range of firing temperatures will vary depending on temper, technology, and fuel source to name a few factors. Based on these data, the range of firing temperatures for intentional ceramic production is interpreted to exceed 650°C. Therefore, the absence of ceramics at 41DN612 is notable. If the fluctuation in derivative values at temperatures above 850°C in the 41DN612 samples was attributed to cultural activities, then some presence of ceramics at the site would be expected. Rather, the derivative value fluctuation observed above 850°C is likely mineralogical in origin. Previous researchers have noted that there can be a destruction or formation of minerals at higher temperatures, particularly above 800°C (Bong et al. 2008:303–304; Rasmussen et al. 2012:1711– 1712). Considering the consistency of the 41DN612 samples exhibiting a change at the 850°C, temperature does suggest a common cause (e.g., mineralogical). To resolve this question a mineralogical analysis of the samples (e.g., x-ray diffraction) would need to be conducted. With the available data the most likely answer for this fluctuation is that it is attributed to natural causes and these samples had not previously been heated to that high temperature (i.e., >850°C). Accordingly, the fluctuation at 850°C indicated by the derivative values in these samples is not interpreted to be from cultural activities. In summary, there is no evidence of the burned clay samples at 41DN612 having a clearly defined maximum firing temperature above 250°C. This may be that the temperatures never fully exceeded 300–400°C for long durations of time as cautioned by previous researchers (e.g., Tema and Ferrara 2019). Another possibility may be suggested by previous researchers working on hearth features in France (Brodard et al. 2012). These researchers used thermoluminescence properties of quartz and MS of sediment systematically around a prehistoric hearth to identify the maximum temperature (i.e., paleotemperature) of the samples in relation to the hearth (Brodard et al. 2012). Not surprisingly, the MS values dramatically decreased further away from the hearth. Interestingly, the main hearth exceeded 600°C and the thermal map suggests a reduction to <350°C within 70 cm (Brodard et al. 2012:357). Regardless, the results at 41DN612 suggest that the burned clay samples were either thermally altered at temperatures below 250°C from a natural fire, not heated above 300°C for extended periods of time, or on the periphery of a thermal feature (Brodard et al. 2012; Canti and Linford 2000).

cultural feature, they appear to have been on the periphery of a main thermal heating source (i.e., Feature A). Analytical Unit Definitions and Integrity Overall, the data indicate that at least two periods of prehistoric occupation occurred at 41DN612 during the Transitional Archaic that are separated by an apparent depositional change along the Denton Creek drainage. The older group is associated with Stratum IV and roughly falls between 2080 and 1820 cal yr BP (i.e., Lower Analytical Unit). The more recent activities (i.e., Upper Analytical Unit) are associated with Stratum III and the BRM phenomenon (Feature A) subsequent to the changes to Denton Creek (around 1740 B.P.) and occurred around 1540–1200 cal yr BP (Figure 6.12). For most of 41DN612, the Upper Analytical Unit (1540–1200 cal yr BP) has been truncated and removed by the historic and recent refuse disposal activities. This disturbance from the refuse disposal activity to the Upper Analytical Unit is primarily located south of the excavation block and extends over 26 feet to the south (see Figure 1.4). On the northern half of the excavation block, road construction fill was observed to partially truncate and cap the upper horizons (Figure 6.13). This fill was observed to extend over the northern third of the excavation block (see Figure 6.7). Fortunately, the Upper Analytical Unit (1540–1200 cal yr BP) primarily associated with Stratum III appears to be unaffected by the road construction fill, as the horizon was sloping downward in this portion of the block (see Figure 6.7). Portions of the Lower Analytical Unit (2080–1820 cal yr BP) observed in Stratum IV and the upper portions of Stratum V appears to have some disturbance. As with the Upper Analytical Unit, the historic refuse pit was seen to intrude into Stratum IV across BHTs A–D (see Figures 1.4 and 6.7). The lowermost Stratum V appeared to be unaffected by the refuse pit excavation in the vicinity of the excavation block. Overall, within the excavation block, Strata IV and V containing the Lower Analytical Unit (2080–1820 cal yr BP) appeared to be intact. Summary The stratigraphy at 41DN612 appears to correlate with the Pilot Point alloformation, which is capped by the West Fork paleosol. The Pilot Point alloformation is recognized as dating to 4,500–1,800 years ago, while the West Fork paleosol is interpreted to date to 2,300–1,000 years ago (Abbott 2011; Hall et al. 2011:542–544). Strata I and II are associated with modern and historic disturbances; however, Stratum III appears to correlate with the West Fork paleosol, while the underlying Stratum IV and V correlate with the Pilot Point alloformation. The prehistoric deposits at 41DN612 appear to be solely associated with the Transitional Archaic. The Upper Analytical Unit falls at the end of the Transitional Archaic, while the Lower Analytical Unit occurs at the beginning of the Transitional Archaic. These analytical units appear to be separated by a recognized period of change within Denton Creek when the drainage channel changed course around 1,740 years ago (Abbott n.d.:7). The change to the Denton Creek drainage likely explains the notable increase in sedimentation separating the two age groups observed at 41DN612. 68 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Chapter 7. Artifacts, Ecofacts, and Features Archeology is the study of the material record to derive interpretations of past societies and their contexts. But what endures through the destructive processes of time is often only a small fraction of the overall material culture. Items manufactured from hides, wood, and other perishables disintegrated long ago, and are generally lost to the archeological record. In addition to natural processes that bias the archeological record, there are social filters that influence what is discarded on residential sites and what is discarded elsewhere. Accordingly, archeological assemblages are inaccurate reflections of the total material culture of any given past society. This chapter presents descriptive data on the features, artifacts, and ecofacts that were investigated or recovered during the excavations. The materials are not organized by component or stratum, but rather by basic descriptive categories. The intent of this chapter is to present the data as objectively as possible with only brief chronological or stratigraphic divisions. A few low-level interpretations are provided on functions of tools and features, but these are kept at a minimum. The subsequent chapter will develop more of an interpretive context that will address the issues of moving from the material record to inferences on prehistoric society and behavior. Cultural materials recovered during the data recovery excavations on site 41DN612 include features and artifact categories composed of various materials, including historic-age materials and floral and faunal remains (Appendix 3). Stone usually comprises the vast majority of artifact assemblages at sites as a result of depositional and post-depositional (e.g., preservation) site formation processes; however, site 41DN612 is unique in the fact that lithic tools and debitage were absent and the only stone recovered was abundant burned rock. Site 41DN612, however, yielded a relatively good collection of perishable materials, including bone, shell, and floral remains. Some of these are artifacts, and many are ecofacts, defined as plants, animals, or rocks that were not clearly culturally modified or produced but were nevertheless culturally introduced or otherwise part of the overall site context. Charcoal and bone, which forms the basis for determining the site’s chronological parameters through radiocarbon dating, were abundant and well preserved. Dates reported in this chapter are corrected, 2-Sigma calibrated dates (cal yr B.P.). Both macro- and micro-floral remains were also well preserved. Artifacts Over the course of the data recovery efforts, SWCA collected 519 artifacts (Table 7.1; Appendix 3). Historic artifacts (n=209) encompassed the majority of the artifact assemblage (Appendix 4). Burned rock was abundant (n=6,429) but was counted and discarded in the field for the most part except for 32 examples of burned rock, which were included in the total collected artifact count above (Appendix 2). Faunal remains formed the next largest category, with a total of 155 unmodified mussel shells and 99 bone fragments; however, the majority of bone were very fragmented and likely originated from relatively few individual specimens (Appendix 5 and 6). In addition, 21 burned clay artifacts were recovered. 71 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

These items include 134 glass shards (colorless, cobalt, amber, and milk), 27 complete glass bottles, 12 shards of window glass, one glass marble, eight round-head nails, one metal bolt, one aluminum circular saw blade fragment, 20 miscellaneous metal fragments, three brick fragments, one terracotta sherd, and one slip decorated creamware sherd. All of the historic assemblage was recovered from the backdirt piles associated with BHT 1 and the Southern Scrape Area and within CS1 excavated on the west wall of BHT 1. The section below discusses the artifact assemblage by artifact type. During the current investigation, glass was recovered in abundance, including a glass marble, bottle glass shards, window glass shards, as well as complete glass bottles with a variety of maker’s mark and colors including colorless, cobalt blue, amber, and white milk glass. During the laboratory analysis of the historic glass assemblage, SWCA determined that some recovered bottles were used for medicinal purposes, as well as for condiments, alcohol, soda, canning use, and for cosmetic/toiletries. The dates for these bottles range between 1890s to the present. Below, the glass assemblage is discussed by glass color and the use of the bottle is noted when determined. The colorless glass assemblage consists of 127 shards of bottle glass, 20 complete glass bottles, two complete glass jugs, and one complete glass jar. Additionally, 12 shards of window glass were recovered. During the glass analysis, SWCA identified 15 complete colorless bottles with maker’s marks representing either the glass manufacturer or the firm/company name.

13, and 132-2) within the assemblage contain complete side seams and a finish with an external twist thread closure (Figure 7.1; Appendix 4). Although Heinz bottle manufacture dates range from 1876–1890 and 1930s–1960s, the diagnostic manufacturing techniques suggest post-early-twentieth-century manufacture (IMACS 2001). Overall, the colorless glass bottles functioned as condiment bottles, soda bottles, liquor bottles, and for canning purposes. Some colorless bottles lacked a clearly defined use. One green complete bottle, a Dr. Pepper soda bottle, was also recovered from the site (Figure 7.2; Appendix 4). The Dr. Pepper bottle (Lot No. 1-7) was manufactured ca. 1950s–1960s (SHA 2020). Figure 7.1. H.J. Heinz Co. bottle (Lot No. 132-2) Figure 7.2. Dr. Pepper bottle (Lot No. 1-7) ca. ca. 1930–1960s. 1950s–1960s. The cobalt glass assemblage includes one cobalt glass bottle shard and two complete cobalt glass bottles. The two complete bottles were used for medicinal purposes and include a Vicks Vapor Rub container, thought to be manufactured by Maryland Glass Corp before the 1970s, as well as a Phillips Brand Milk of Magnesia bottle dating to the 1950s. The Vick’s Vapor Rub container (Lot No. 132-4) was recovered from the historic fill of BHT 1, while the Milk of Magnesia bottle (Lot No. 1-2) was recovered from the surficial refuse pile associated with the Southern Scrape Area (Figure 7.3; Lindsay 2020). The remainder of the glass assemblage consists of one amber glass shard, one complete amber bottle, one complete white milk glass jar, as well as one glass marble. The two complete bottles bear diagnostic maker’s marks, with the amber bottle (Lot No. 1-1) likely being used for beer. The white milk glass jar (Lot No. 132-6) is thought to have been used for cosmetics/toiletries; white milk glass was a commonly used bottle color for ointment and cream jars from the 1890s–1960s (Figure 7.4) (IMACS 2001; Lindsay 2020). 73 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

White milk glass jar (Lot No. 132-6) was commonly used for cosmetic/toiletry purposes ca. 1890s–1960s. During the current investigation, 30 metal fragments were recovered. These included eight round-head nails, one metal bolt, one aluminum oxide circular saw fragment, and 20 pieces of miscellaneous metal fragments. Of these artifacts, only the wire nail and the circular saw fragment present diagnostic characteristics from which temporal associations can be derived. Circular saws are thought to have been invented in the late eighteenth century, with most modifications to this design occurring during the 1800s. Regarding the nails, the rounded body and head of the nails identify them as wire nails, which were manufactured ca. 1890s–present (Visser 2020). 74 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Lastly, three brick fragments and two ceramic sherds were recovered during the current investigation. The ceramic sherds include one slip decorated creamware sherd (Lot No. 132-9) and one terracotta sherd (Lot No. 231-8). Creamware was introduced in the latter parts of the eighteenth century as an alternative to china and continued to be made until ca. 1820 (Aultman et al. 2014; Marciniszyn 2017). Two of the three brick fragments (Lot No. 1-16) are stamped with “FERRIS” and were recovered from the surface of the Southern Scrape Area. These bricks are marked with the Ferris Brick Company maker’s mark, who operated the company from 1923–present (Hart 2010; McKnight and Dunn 2016). Burned Clay SWCA recovered 21 pieces of burned clay during excavations conducted at site 41DN612. All the pieces of burned clay exhibited amorphous shapes, with sizes ranging from 10–40 mm in diameter. A representative sampling of the pieces of burned clay is depicted in Figure 7.5. Most of the burned clay was recovered from in and around Feature A (discussed below), a large BRM radiocarbon dated to the late Transitional Archaic. The pieces of burned clay were associated with charcoal flecks, burned bone, mussel shell fragments, and abundant FCR. a. b. Figure 7.5. Representative sample of burned clay nodules collected from site 41DN612 (a. Lot No. 139-1; b. Lot No. 210-6 [two nodules]). Given their association with a hot rock cooking feature, the pieces of burned clay were tested to see if they were utilized as heating elements for earth ovens. Pieces of burned clay have been associated with earth ovens archeologically at sites across North and Central America (Hays et al. 2016; Simms et al. 2013). In experimental recreations, amorphous clay balls have been found to retain heat longer than fire embers and serve to replenish stored heat through conduction (Hunter 1975:67; Hudgins 1993:51).

pieces of burned clay could result from natural causes, such as burning brush or tree roots in clay or sandy soils (Hudgins 1993). At the Loeve-Fox site (41WM230) Prewitt (1982) identified a concentration of burned clay that was interpreted as a burned tree root. The pieces of burned clay depicted in the site report appear similar to those recovered from this site (Prewitt 1982:Figure 14a). The small size of the burned clay (i.e., 10–40 mm) at site 41DN612 suggests they may be a result of natural causes or they were unintentionally manufactured along the periphery of the burned rock features during firing. Recent studies have shown that microbotanical residues from plants and other materials cooked in earth ovens become embedded in cook stones used as heating elements within the oven (Thoms et al. 2015). Furthermore, the maximum firing temperature analysis results presented in Chapter 6 support the interpretation that the burned clay nodules from the site were thermally altered as a result of natural fire or due to proximity to a thermal feature (i.e., Feature A) (Canti and Linford 2000). Based on the context of the burned clay, they appear to have been on the periphery of a thermal feature (i.e., Feature A). Burned Rock Burned rock from each of the hand-excavated units and features contexts was first sorted by materials type (e.g., limestone, sandstone) and then size-sorted into four size grade categories (0–5 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–15 cm, and 15+ cm diameter). The rocks were then counted and weighed by material type and size grade (Appendix 2). A total of 6,429 burned rock was documented within the controlled hand-excavation units and features at site 41DN612. Most of the rock (n=6,068; 94.4 percent) was associated with Feature A. Burned limestone (n=6,266) was prevalent in the site deposits and accounted for 97.5 percent of the burned rock assemblage. Silicified limestone was present (n= 147; 2.3 percent) along with very sparse Quartzite (n=7; 0.1 percent) and Sandstone (n=3; <0.1 percent). The majority of burned rock was within the 0–5 cm diameter size grade class (n=5459; 84.9 percent); which is indicative of reuse of the features and would be expected within a large BRM. A total of 784 rocks were within the 5–10 cm diameter size class, comprising 12.2 percent of the assemblage. The 10–15 cm diameter size class included a total of 160 burned rock (2.5 percent) and the 15+ cm diameter size class contained 27 burned rock (0.4 percent). The total weight for the burned rock at the site was 179 kg. The highest total weight was within the 5–10 cm diameter size class (74 kg; 41.4 percent), followed by the 10–15 cm diameter size class (61 kg; 34.2 percent). The 0–5 cm diameter size grade class had a total weight of 25 kg (14.0 percent) and the 15+ cm diameter size class had a total weight of 19 kg (10.4 percent). The count, weight, and size distribution of the burned rocks were used to estimate number of cooking events within each of the features (see Chapter 8). Faunal Remains Bone SWCA recovered and analyzed a total of 99 vertebrate faunal bone from the excavations (Appendix 5). As a result of the high degree of fragmentation, weathering, and other taphonomic factors, few of the fragments 76 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

could be attributed to specific elements and/or specific taxa (Appendix 5). From the vertebrate assemblage, three specimens could be attributed to biological class Aves, 14 specimens of the biological order Testudines (turtle/tortoise), and 36 specimens could be attributed to class Mammalia. Two specimens from class Mammalia could be attributed to large (cow/bison size) bovid, and two more within the Mammalia class could be attributed to the order Rodentia. Only nine specimens could be accurately attributed to the species level, all of which are white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Bone preservation within the assemblage ranged from excellent to weathered beyond recognition. The most prevalent taphonomic processes identified during the analysis are general weathering, geogenic acid etching, and rodent gnawing (Appendix 5). The assemblage is highly fragmented, with only seven (7.1 percent of the assemblage) whole elements. Of the seven whole elements, six have been identified as distal limb elements attributed to white-tailed deer. The whole element not attributed to species level is a small juvenile mammalian femur measuring 8.5 cm in length with growth plates missing from each epiphysis. Anthropogenic taphonomy is present on the surface of seven specimens, all of which have been identified as white-tailed deer, or as deer-sized mammal elements that could not be definitively attributed to species due to the small size of the fragments and lack of identifying landmarks (Appendix 5). A proximal epiphysis of a tibia attributed to white-tailed deer (Lot No. 228-1) exhibited a percussion impact with surrounding crushed bone and two additional percussion notches on the oblique, spirally fractured cortical margin. A long bone mid-shaft fragment attributed to a deer-sized mammal (Lot No. 23-1) also exhibited a percussion notch on an oblique, spiral cortical margin. The surfaces of both specimens with impact marks were moderately obscured by geogenic acid root etching, which possibly obscured any additional anthropogenic marks (e.g., cut marks). The percussion marks on the long bone elements generally indicate marrow processing. The oblique angles and spiral shape of the fracture would indicate perimortem (green) fractures (Johnson 1985). A total of four elements from the assemblage exhibited anthropogenic cut marks on the cortical surface. A long bone mid-shaft fragment (Lot No. 23-5) exhibited five v-shaped, parallel cut marks, and was found in the same location as the mid-shaft fragment with a percussion notch (Lot No. 23-1). Two additional deer-sized, long bone mid-shaft fragments (Lot Nos. 155-1 and 156-1) also had parallel cut marks on the cortical surface and were found in Unit 1 between 90 and 102 cmbd (Figure 7.6). At least six cut marks are present at the distal end of a proximal phalanx attributed to white-tailed deer (Lot No. 242-1). In addition to the cut marks, a calcaneus (Lot No. 41-1), attributed to white-tailed deer, exhibited deep chop marks (Figure 7.7). The interior surface of the chop marks has been soil stained to the same degree as the surrounding cortical surface, indicating that the marks were made near the time of deposition and are not the result of damage occurring during excavation. The cut marks located at the midshaft are likely the result of meat package removal, while the chop marks and cut marks located near distal limb joints are likely an indication of disarticulation and/or skinning (Binford 1981:46-47). 77 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Only two fragments in the assemblage (Lot Nos. 72-1 and 249-B1) exhibited indications of burning. Both specimens were small, unidentifiable fragments, which were burned to nearly calcined. One specimen (Lot No. 241-1), a long bone mid-shaft fragment attributed to a deer-sized mammal, exhibited a small patch of polish on the cortex near one of the obliquely fractured ends. The polish could be attributed to pot polish, polishing from the surrounding soil, or from gastric acid. No other specimens in the assemblage exhibited similar polish. However, small carnivore tooth pits and U-shaped tooth drags were observed on the cortical surface of the specimen, thus faunal gastric acid is the likely cause. The number of specimens within the assemblage is relatively low. Although biological class Aves and biological orders Bovidae, Testudines, and Rodentia are all represented in the assemblage, only nine elements could be attributed to species. All nine of these elements were attributed to a single species, white-tailed deer, and each of the elements present are represented only once, except for two 3rd phalanxes, which cannot be accurately sided. Therefore, the number of identified specimens per taxon (NISP, using species) is nine, while the minimum number of individuals (MNI) is one (Grayson 1984). Additionally, the observed anthropogenic taphonomy can be associated with butchery and was only present on elements attributed to white-tailed deer and deer-sized mammal elements. Thus, the butchery of a single deer can securely be attributed to the site assemblage. Shell Other faunal remains encountered during excavations included 89 freshwater mussel shell umbos and 66 observed fragments, for a total of 155 collected specimens. SWCA biologist Stephen Van Kampen-Lewis conducted analysis of the shell assemblage, focusing on identifying the various species of mussel shell commonly found in the Trinity River drainage system in Denton County. A total of five species were identified for 66 mussel shells within the 41DN612 assemblage; the remaining shells were too fragmented for a definitive identification (Table 7.2; Figure 7.8).

a. b. c. d. e. Figure 7.8. Example of five mussel shell species identified within site 41DN612 assemblage (a. Threeridge [Lot No. 101-1]; b. Lilliput [Lot No. 12-1]; c. Threehorn wartyback [Lot No. 108-1]; d. Louisiana pigtoe [Lot No. 81-1]; and e. Rock pocketbook [Lot No. 128-1]). The vast majority of the shells was associated with cultural features, and 32 percent of the assemblage (n=49) exhibited evidence of cultural modification through battering, cutting, burning, and other damage from harvesting or use. Accordingly, these shells are cultural artifacts or ecofacts that indicate subsistence. Battering was the most common modification observed; however, one specimen (Lot No. 195-1) was burned and two specimens (Lot Nos. 102-1 and 198-1) had evidence of possible cutting (Figures 7.9). Multiple parallel lines were observed under microscopic view on Lot No. 102-1, which appear to be cut marks (Figure 7.10). Parallel grooves were observed on Lot No. 198-1; these were not as distinct but are also possible cut marks (Figure 7.11). Of note, the remaining 106 shell specimens (68 percent) were either too fragmentary or had too much post-depositional damage to determine if any kind of cultural modification was present. Texas’ freshwater mussels exhibit phenotypic plasticity depending on inhabited drainage and/or specific environmental conditions that can change the shell shape (e.g., elongate forms occurring in swiftwater and rounded forms occurring in slackwater). Some species are also sexually dimorphic, further complicating identification. As such, identifying individuals is often difficult, even when assessed by experts (Hess et al. 2018). However, knowing a mussel’s home drainage greatly reduces the potential list of species and increases the potential for correct identification. SWCA assumed all shells are from the Trinity River drainage and the species list was assembled using an online database from Randklev et al. (2020) that lists documented species from Denton County. Identification guides by Graf and Cummings (2020) and Howells (2014) were also consulted for shell identification. 80 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Figure 7.11. Lot No. 198-1 Closeup (0.75x magnification) ventral side with parallel grooves that are possible cut marks illustrated. Overall, the shells and shell fragments represent a mix of currently common and uncommon species known to inhabit the Trinity River drainage. Most identified species are from areas with stable substrate in moving water such as creeks or rivers. The most common identified species (Threeridge) is known from both rivers and impoundments. No species were identified that are usually found in slow-moving backwaters or impoundments with soft, muddy substrate. In addition to a food source, these shells might have been selected for use as pendants or other adornments; however, no shell ornaments were identified within the 41DN612 assemblage. Vertical mussel migration within the substrate during stressful conditions is well documented throughout the United States, with many species burying themselves deeper during winter (Amyot and Downing 1997; Block et al. 2013; Schwalb and Pusch 2007). The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD 2020a) prefers mussel relocations from April through November or when water temperatures are above 60°F, based on relocation protocol from Carlson et al. (2008) and Mackie et al. (2008). However, very little research has been conducted on seasonal mussel assemblage movements in Central Texas. As such, it is unclear if any mussel species burrow deeper during winter than during other seasons. It is also unclear if stream-dwelling species are physically capable of burrowing deeper, considering the generally rocky nature of Central Texas river substrate. The lack of clarity regarding seasonal vertical migration specifically in Central Texas makes it difficult to determine mussel availability to human gatherers throughout the year. 82 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Special Samples The data recovery excavations at 41DN612 recovered 176 special samples from appropriate contexts across the site. These included materials for radiometric dating, matrix samples for flotation, flora, and wood identification samples, and geoarcheological samples, which included bulk matrix (geomatrix) and MS samples. SWCA recovered 32 charcoal samples from various contexts throughout the site, with the majority procured directly from feature contexts. Of these, 10 samples were submitted for radiocarbon dating, including eight from feature contexts. These results are provided in Appendix 7. Three additional sample were initially submitted for radiocarbon dating but ended up being too small to be processed. Of note, an additional 10 faunal bone samples were also submitted for radiocarbon dating. A total of 20 feature matrix samples were collected, 18 of which were subjected to flotation and two were fine- screened. The heavy fraction of the flotation samples was sorted for bone, mussel shell, burned clay, and burned rock. The light fraction of the flotation samples, as well as selected flora and wood identification samples recovered from the excavations, were subjected to macrobotanical analysis. The results of the macrobotanical analysis from each of the features, including the flora and wood identification samples, are discussed in the feature section below and are also presented in Appendix 8. In addition, four bulk matrix samples from non-feature contexts were collected and subjected to fine-screening in order to look for lithic materials; unfortunately, no lithic materials were identified. SWCA collected 10 geomatrix samples for particle size analysis and 100 geoarcheological samples for MS analysis. The geomatrix samples were collected from Unit 1 and BHT N to sample each of the identified strata. The geoarcheological samples were collected from two vertical sample columns (south wall of Unit 1 and north wall of Unit 2), on opposite ends of the excavation block. Features Seven cultural features (i.e., Feature A and Features 1–6) were documented across the site over the course of the data recovery investigation; all features were documented within the Transitional Archaic component and yielded dates that are consistent with the prevailing chronological placement of the Transitional Archaic. It should be noted that Feature 4 was only photographed and documented during the investigation, due to the lack of coherency of the feature and the likelihood of it being an extension of the BRM (i.e., Feature A) thoroughly documented and sampled during excavation of Units 1–3. Feature A (Burned Rock Midden) Feature A consisted of a large, circular, BRM with an associated diffuse mussel shell, bone, and charcoal scatter within the Upper Analytical Unit (Table 7.3). Most of the feature was located within Stratum III; however, as mentioned previously, Feature A was also observed to extend into the underlying Stratum IV due to excavation and prehistoric reuse of the thermal feature (see Figure 6.7). Further, the results of several of the radiocarbon assays were vertically incongruous (i.e., younger dates below older dates) implying multiple uses of the BRM. 83 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

SWCA noted that these features were connected and additional burned rock and other cultural materials (e.g., shell, bone) expanded in all directions. The exposed portions of the BRM measured 9 m north/south by 11 m east/west but likely extended further south; however, this portion of the BRM appears to have been truncated by construction of a large historic refuse pit consisting of household debris (Figures 7.12 and 7.13). Three 1×1-m units (i.e., Units 1–3) were excavated in the presumed center of the feature to further document and sample the BRM and a feature-focused unit (Unit 4) was excavated adjacent to these units during the mechanical scraping (see Figure 1.4). 84 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Feature A contained numerous layers of burned rock primarily within Stratum III, between 25–80 cmbd (153.25–152.7 m). Within Units 1–3, a total of 6,068 burned rocks were mapped, sorted, and tabulated (see Table 6.3; Appendix 2). Burned rock material types included thermally altered limestone (n=5,917), silicified limestone (n=147), sandstone (n=2), and burned quartzite (n=2). Most of the burned rock (n=5,250; 86.5 percent) were less than 5 cm in diameter (Figure 7.14; see Table 7.3). The next dominant size class was 5–10 cm in diameter (n=661; 10.9 percent) followed by 10–15 cm diameter (n=140; 2.3 percent), and over 15 cm in diameter (n=17; 0.3 percent). The burned rocks were angular to subangular in shape and the majority were highly fragmented, though some fractured in situ and unfractured rocks were observed. Feature A ranged in thickness within the excavation units from 33 cm in Unit 1 to 54 cm thick in Unit 2. A total of 13 flotation samples (S-1 to S-9, S-25, S-27, S-34, and S-35) and 11 charcoal samples (S-10, S-11, S-19, S-26, S-28 through S-33, and S-166) were collected from within Feature A (see Table 6.3). The macrobotanical analysis of the floated light fraction and collected charcoal samples from the feature matrix identified numerous species of charred wood. In order of predominance, the primary wood species include indeterminable hardwood, white oak group (Quercus sect. Quercus), mulberry (Morus spp.), unspecifiable oak (Quercus spp.), slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), hickory/pecan (Carya spp.), elm, and diffuse-porous hardwood (Appendix 8). Less common species (less than two NISP) include plum/cherry (Prunus spp.), ring-porous hardwood, ash (Fraxinus spp.), juniper/redcedar (Juniperus spp.), American elm (Ulmus americana), viburnum (Viburnum spp.), and legume (Fabaceae) (Appendix 8). One carbonized camas bulb scale and one wild onion bulb scale were also identified along with 13 indeterminable bulb scales. The floated light fraction also included 12 additional starchy fragments that were unidentifiable, one bark fragment, and one indeterminable botanical. Artifacts recovered from Feature A include 21 burned clay nodules, 22 pieces of bone, and 39 mussel shell. Identified species within the bone assemblage included deer, indeterminable rodent, turtle/tortoise, and indeterminate fragments, some of which might be avian and snake (Appendix 5). The identified mussel shell included 13 threeridge, two lilliput, and 24 indeterminate mussel shell (Appendix 6). Five samples (one bone and four charcoal) from Feature A were submitted for AMS radiocarbon dating (see Table 7.3). Two dates can be associated with the interior features (Elements 1 and 4) and are discussed below. The remaining three samples were collected from the BRM matrix. Slippery elm from a charcoal sample (S-32; Lot No. 212-1) collected from Unit 3 Level 1 at 153.15 m produced a calibrated age range of 1450– 1510 cal B.P. Turtle or tortoise bone (B-7; Lot No. 183-1) collected from Unit 2 Level 4 at 152.82 m produced a calibrated age range of 1470–1530 cal B.P. A wood charcoal sample belonging to the white oak group (S-28; Lot No. 190-1) from Unit 2 Level 5 at 152.78 m produced a calibrated age range of 1350–1410 cal B.P. Chronologically, this places Feature A near the end of the Transitional Archaic period (see Table 7.3). 86 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Figure 7.14. Top of Feature A exposed in Unit 1 Level 1 depicting primarily <5 cm diameter burned rock, view facing north. Within the larger BRM, four internal features were identified (Elements 1–4) and are interpreted to be remnants of individual primary heating loci within the larger earth oven facility (Figures 7.15 and 7.16). The first internal feature (Element 1) was initially exposed in Level 1 of Units 1–3 (and also encountered in Unit 4) and consisted of a dense cluster of FCR measuring approximately 65 cm north/south by 100 cm east/west. The base of the larger (primarily 8–15 cm in diameter) feature rocks was at 35 to 40 cmbd (153.15–153.1 m). The larger tabular rocks slanted down slightly towards the center of the burned rock concentration and charcoal flecking was observed between and around the periphery of the feature. A wild onion bulb scale (S-1; Lot No. 134-1) was initially submitted for radiocarbon dating, but the sample was too small after pretreatment to be analyzed. A carbonized camas bulb (S-166; Lot No. 137-1) from the feature matrix was then submitted and produced a calibrated age range of 1260–1320 cal B.P. Element 2 was initially exposed in the profiles of Unit 2 (east wall) and Unit 3 (north wall) and consisted of a basin-shaped alignment of FCR primarily measuring 10–15+ cm in diameter, some of which were fractured in situ (see Figure 7.15). The base of the feature rocks was at approximately 45–50 cmbd (153.05–153.0 m) and charcoal flecking was observed between and below the feature rocks. Burned rock associated with this element was also observed in Unit 4; however, no charcoal samples were collected during excavation of this feature-focused unit. 87 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Element 3 was exposed in Level 3 of Unit 2 and consisted of a basin-shaped alignment of large, angular FCR measuring 8–15 cm in diameter infilled with smaller, fractured FCR (0–7 cm) (see Figure 7.16). The feature spanned the entire 1×1-m unit and the base of the feature rocks was at approximately 54–60 cmbd (152.96– 152.9 m). Charcoal flecking was observed between and around the periphery of the feature and burned earth (initially collected as charcoal sample S-19) was identified below one of the burned rocks at the northern edge of the feature. No other charred botanical remains or faunal bone was recovered directly from the feature; therefore, no radiocarbon dates could be obtained. Element 4 was exposed in the north wall profile of Unit 2 and consisted of a basin-shaped alignment of large FCR measuring 10–15+ cm in diameter; the rocks slanted down towards the center of the feature (see Figure 7.16). The base of the feature rocks was at approximately 75 cmbd (152.75 m). Charcoal flecking was observed between and around the periphery of the feature and a hickory charcoal sample (S-30; Lot No. 194- 1) from below FCR in Unit 2 Level 5 at the same depth produced a calibrated age range of 1280–1340 cal B.P. 89 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Summary Feature A consists of a BRM located within Strata III and IV within the Upper Analytical Unit. Four possible individual primary heating loci were identified within the BRM during the hand excavations suggesting that Feature A was a large earth oven cooking facility that prehistoric inhabitants used and reused during the Transitional Archaic (Black and Thoms 2014). Specifically, the chronometric data (i.e., Lot Nos. 194-1 and 137- 1) for Feature A temporally overlap and demonstrate use between 1340–1260 cal BP. Subsequent disturbance from a historic refuse dump likely destroyed the most southern extent of the feature. Feature 1 Feature 1 was an isolated, oval shaped, burned rock concentration identified within Stratum IV in the Upper Analytical Unit (Table 7.4).The feature was initially encountered in the central-eastern portion of Unit 1 between 152.66–152.59 m. Feature 1 measured 12 cm north/south by 20 cm east/west in size once fully exposed. Two layers of approximately 7-cm-thick rock were visible in the profile of Feature 1. This feature was confined to Unit 1 between Levels 6 and 7 and was approximately 25 cm below the Feature A deposits in Unit 1, which terminated at 152.92 (Figure 7.17). The feature consisted of thermally altered limestone (n=17) of various shapes and sizes (see Table 7.4). Most of the altered limestone (n=10) was 0–5 cm in diameter and the rest (n=7) measured 5–10 cm in diameter. A majority of the thermally altered rock was sub-rounded, while the larger pieces were tabular in shape. The burned rock within Feature 1 was stacked to create two layers of intact pieces overlapping with little to no soil matrix between the rocks. Six of the limestone rocks were clustered in the northwestern portion of the feature. Charcoal sample (S-18) was taken from this portion of the feature (Figure 7.18). The remaining 11 burned rocks were encountered overlapping with some of the fractured in situ rock in the southeastern portion of the feature. The surrounding matrix of Feature 1 between 84–91 cmbd (152.66–152.59 m elevation) contained evidence of burning (e.g., charcoal). Once the feature was exposed, SWCA collected a 1-gallon-size bag of matrix for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. The sample was collected immediately below Feature 1, from 90–96 cmbd and the remaining matrix was screened in the field. Additionally, one charcoal sample (S-18) was collected from the feature. The macrobotanical analysis of the floated light fraction and collected charcoal sample from the feature matrix identified unspecifiable oak and diffuse-porous hardwood. The charred hardwood (S-18; Lot No. 152-2) returned a calibrated age range of 1348–1276 cal B.P. (see Table 7.4). Chronologically, this places Feature 1 within the later part of the Transitional Archaic in the Upper Analytical Unit. Artifacts recovered from Feature 1 included five pieces of bone and one tooth enamel fragment. One bone specimen was identified as deer and the rest of the assemblage consisted of unidentifiable fragments (Appendix 5). Summary Feature 1 is an isolated, burned rock cluster located in Stratum IV, within the Upper Analytical Unit. No pit or basin was observed but the presence of thermally altered rocks fractured in situ and charcoal suggests Feature 1 represents a single- or limited-use hot rock cooking event during the late Transitional Archaic. 90 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Feature 1 Figure 7.18. Feature 1, showing overlapping cluster of burned rock, plan view. Feature 2 Feature 2 consisted of a discrete burned rock cluster within Stratum IV in the Upper Analytical Unit identified at a similar elevation to Feature 1 (Table 7.5). Burned rock associated with the feature was initially encountered in the north wall of BHT A, between 152.7–152.5 m. Feature 2 was only partially exposed by BHT A; therefore, complete dimensions of the feature are unknown. Two burned rock layers approximately 23 cm thick were observed in the BHT profile. The width of the feature diminished with depth; the top of the feature was 36 cm, the center was 33 cm, and the base was 18 cm wide. The feature was confined to geomorphic Stratum IV and was approximately 35 cm below the historic refuse concentration. Of note, Feature 2 contained large cobbles, as opposed to prevalent scattered burned rock (<5 cm) within the same soil strata. The feature consisted of thermally altered limestone (n=13) with various shapes and sizes. The altered limestone appeared angular in shape and was fractured in situ. Most of the burned rock (n=7) measured between 5–10 cm in diameter, with five burned rock <5 cm and one cobble larger than 15 cm (see Table 7.5). The exposed portions of Feature 2 suggest the feature was composed of two layers of burned rock, with the larger cobbles occupying the upper layer (Figure 7.19). The burned cobbles of Feature 2 are located within Stratum IV between 152.7–152.5 m, suggesting the feature was constructed on the same occupational surface as Feature 1. The internal matrix from Feature 2 contained small flecks of charcoal, which indicated burning. In addition, evidence of in situ thermal alteration was observed and consisted of burned soil surrounding the feature rock, as well as thermal fractures and flecks of charcoal below the burned rock. 92 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Once the feature was uncovered, the matrix was collected from between the burned rocks for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. Additionally, two charcoal samples (S-38 and S-39) were collected from beneath the burned rock cluster. The macrobotanical analysis of the floated light fraction from the feature matrix and collected charcoal samples identified white oak group, viburnum, indeterminable hardwood, and a carbonized walnut hull (Juglandaceae) (Appendix 8). A sample of the white oak group (S-38; Lot No. 243-1) was initially submitted for radiocarbon dating, but the sample was too small after pretreatment to be analyzed. The carbonized nut hull (S-40; Lot No. 245-5) recovered from the floated light fraction was then submitted and produced a calibrated age range of 1696–1544 cal B.P. Chronologically, this places Feature 2 within the latter part of the Transitional Archaic at the base of the Upper Analytical Unit. No other artifacts were recovered in association with the feature. Summary Feature 2 consists of a stacked burned rock cluster located in Stratum IV within the Upper Analytical Unit. No pit or basin was observed but the presence of thermally altered sediment and rocks fractured in situ suggests Feature 2 represents a single- or limited-use hot rock cooking event during the late Transitional Archaic. Feature 3 Feature 3 consisted of a stacked burned rock cluster within Stratum IV in the Upper Analytical Unit identified at a similar elevation (approximately 10 cm below) to Features 1 and 2 (Table 7.6). Burned rock was initially encountered in the east wall of BHT I, between 152.56–152.51 m. Overlapping and stacking of burned rock approximately 5 cm thick were observed in the BHT profile (Figure 7.20). Feature 3 was only partially exposed by BHT I; therefore, complete dimensions of the feature are unknown. The width of the feature increased toward the center; the top of the feature was 22 cm wide, the center was 26 cm wide, and the base was 24 cm wide. The feature contained a mixture of limestone and a granular based rock (i.e., quartzite). The source of the quartz raw material is currently unknown. However, quartzite gravels and cobbles are recorded as a component of Holocene and Pleistocene aged fluviatile terrace deposits on several geologic atlas maps in the region (Barnes 1972, 1987; McGowen et al. 1991). Three of these geologic regions (i.e., Abilene, Sherman, and Wichita Falls-Lawton sheets) are either upstream or overlap the project area. Notably, Denton Creek is recorded as having these fluviatile terrace deposits that are mapped within 1.5 miles southwest of 41DN612 (McGowen et al. 1991). The large granular rock at 41DN612 that appears to be quartzite is most likely to have originated from the fluviatile terrace deposits along Denton Creek. The feature consisted of thermally altered limestone (n=11) and quartz (n=7) of various shapes and sizes. Most of the burned rock (n=11) was 0–5 cm in diameter. Four altered quartz measured between 5–10 cm in diameter and the remaining altered rock (n=3) measured 10–15 cm in diameter. The thermally altered rock was angular in shape, fractured in situ, and primarily clast-supported (i.e., overlapping with little to no soil matrix between the rocks). 94 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Once the feature was uncovered, SWCA collected the feature matrix from between the burned rocks for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. A granular rock sample was also collected for identification purposes. The internal matrix from Feature 3 resembled the surrounding matrix and did not contain any evidence indicative of burning (e.g., reddening, charcoal flecking). However, thermal alteration was observed, as many of the altered rocks exhibited in situ thermal fracturing. No other cultural materials were observed and Feature 3 was not fully excavated. The macrobotanical analysis of the floated light fraction from the feature matrix identified a single carbonized indeterminable botanical weighing less than 0.01 grams. Due to the small size of the specimen, it was not submitted for radiocarbon dating. Summary Feature 3 is a discrete burned rock cluster located in Strata IV within the Upper Analytical Unit. The feature is below the cultural deposits associated with the BRM (Feature A) and may be on the same occupational surface as Features 1 and 2; however no radiocarbon dates were obtained for Feature 3. SWCA did not fully excavate the feature; however, no evidence of other features or cultural materials were encountered immediately adjacent to the feature. No pit or basin was observed but the presence of thermally altered rocks fractured in situ suggests Feature 3 represents a single- or limited-use hot rock cooking event during the early Transitional Archaic. Feature 4 Feature 4 is an irregularly shaped burned rock cluster and possible extension of Feature A within the Upper Analytical Unit (Table 7.7; Figure 7.21). Feature 4 was initially encountered in the floor of BHT K within Stratum III, between 153.04–152.99 m. The feature measured approximately 80 cm north/south by 45 cm east/west and consisted of a thin layer of burned rock approximately 5 cm thick. Once the feature was exposed, SWCA photographed and documented the burned rock layer. The burned rock within Feature 4 was mostly small, intact pieces with little to no overlap. The feature is within similar elevations to the burned rock associated with Feature A, exposed in Units 1 and 2; however, no mussel shell or other faunal remains were found within the feature matrix. The feature matrix was consistent with the surrounding matrix and lacked evidence indicative of burning. No cultural materials, matrix, or burned rock samples were collected and a burned rock sort was not conducted. Summary Feature 4 is an irregularly shaped burned rock layer located in Stratum III, within the Upper Analytical Unit. No pit or basin was observed. The lack of thermally altered sediment or rocks fractured in situ suggests Feature 4 represents a thin layer of discarded burned rock (i.e., clean out activity) associated with Feature A, which dates to the late Transitional Archaic. 96 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Feature 5 Feature 5 consisted of a coherent, circular burned rock cluster with a central concentration of thin, flat burned rock slabs within Stratum IV in the Upper Analytical Unit (Table 7.8). The feature burned rock was initially encountered within BHT N between 152.85–152.7 m. To further capture and delineate the feature, SWCA excavated BHT O to the east down to the feature elevation. Once fully exposed in BHTs N and O, Feature 5 measured 100 cm north/south by 75 cm east/west in size (Figure 7.22). Three layers of burned rock approximately 15 cm thick were observed in the profile; the burned rock were adjoining but not stacked. The feature contained a mixture of limestone and a granular based rock (Quartzite). The feature consisted of thermally altered limestone (n=74) and quartzite (n=5) of various shapes and sizes (see Table 7.8). Most of the altered limestone (n=61) was 5–10 cm in diameter. Some of the altered limestone (n=9) were smaller in size, at less than 5 cm in diameter. The remaining altered limestone (n=4) measured greater than 15 cm in diameter. The thermally altered quartzite (n=5) were the largest burned rocks within the feature, at greater than 15 cm in diameter. These larger rocks were concentrated within the central cluster of Table 7.8.

Figure 7.22. Feature 5, showing overlapping cluster of burned rock, plan view. the feature, with the smaller of the altered rocks dispersed peripherally. A majority of the thermally altered rock was angular in shape and were fractured in situ. Once the feature was exposed, SWCA collected a 1-gallon-size bag of matrix for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. The sample was collected immediately below the central rock cluster of Feature 5, from 90–96 cmbd. The remaining matrix was screened in the field; however, no cultural materials were recovered. The internal matrix of Feature 1 between 84–91 cmbd (152.85– 152.7 m) resembled the surrounding soils and did not contain any evidence indicative of burning. However, evidence of in situ thermal alteration (e.g., reddening, thermal fractures) was observed. The macrobotanical analysis of the floated light fraction from the feature matrix identified indeterminable carbonized bulb scales, white oak group, American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), and indeterminable hardwood (Appendix 8). The charred American beautyberry (S-154; Lot No. 253-3) returned a calibrated age range of 1522–1351 cal B.P. (see Table 7.8). Chronologically, this places Feature 5 within the later part of the Transitional Archaic in the Upper Analytical Unit. No other cultural materials were encountered within or surrounding the feature and no temporally diagnostic artifacts were found in direct association with the feature. Summary Feature 5 is a coherent, circular burned rock cluster located within Stratum IV, within the Upper Analytical Unit. No pit, basin, or presence of thermally altered sediment indicative of burning was evident, but rocks fractured in situ suggests Feature 5 represents a single- or limited-use hot rock cooking event during the late Transitional Archaic. 99 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Feature 6 Feature 6 consisted of an isolated, oval shaped, burned rock concentration within Stratum V in the Lower Analytical Unit (Table 7.9; Figure 7.23). The feature was initially encountered in the floor of BHT P, between 152.08–151.98 m. Feature 6 was the deepest feature observed at site 41DN612. The feature measured approximately 50 cm north/south by 30 cm east/west. A single layer of burned rock approximately 10 cm thick was observed in the BHT profile. The feature consisted of thermally altered limestone (n=34) of various shapes and sizes (see Table 7.9). Most of the altered limestone (n=17) was 0–5 cm in diameter. A portion of the altered limestone (n=15) was 5– 10 cm in diameter. The remaining altered limestone (n=2) measured 10–15 cm in diameter. A majority of the thermally altered rock were angular in shape and mostly fractured in situ. The rocks were primarily adjoining and supported. Once the feature was exposed, SWCA collected a 1-gallon-size bag of matrix for flotation and macrobotanical analysis. The sample was collected immediately below Feature 6, from 151.99–151.93 m. The internal matrix of Feature 6 resembled the surrounding soils and did not contain any evidence indicative of burning. However, evidence of burning (e.g., charcoal, burned soil, ash) was observed in the soil matrix directly beneath Feature 6. Table 7.9.

Figure 7.23. Feature 6, showing burned rock concentration, plan view. The macrobotanical analysis of the floated light fraction from the feature matrix identified American beautyberry (Appendix 8). A charred American beautyberry sample (S-155; Lot No. 254-1) returned a calibrated age range of 2299–2001 cal B.P. (see Table 7.9). Chronologically, this places Feature 6 within the early Transitional Archaic in the Lower Analytical Unit. No cultural materials were encountered in direct association with the feature; however a bone fragment was recovered just north of the feature at the same elevation as Feature 6. The specimen (B-10; Lot No. 242-1) was identified as deer and at least six cut marks were observed on the bone suggesting butchering activities (Appendix 5). The bone was sent for radiocarbon AMS dating and returned a calibrated age range of 2294– 1999 cal B.P., which overlaps with the radiocarbon date of the American beautyberry sample above. Summary Feature 6 is an isolated burned rock concentration located within Stratum V in the Lower Analytical Unit. No pit or basin was observed, but the presence of thermally altered sediment below the feature and rocks fractured in situ suggests Feature 6 represents a single- or limited-use hot rock cooking event during the early Transitional Archaic. 101 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Chapter 8. Review of Research Topics and Findings Research Issue 1: Burned Rock Technology A total of seven burned rock features were identified at 41DN612 during the investigations within the Upper and Lower Analytical Units. A large BRM (i.e., Feature A), two dense burned rock clusters in association with the BRM (i.e., Features 4 and 5), and three isolated burned rock features (i.e., Features 1–3) were encountered in what has been designated as the Upper Analytical Unit within Strata III and IV. The lowermost burned rock feature (i.e., Feature 6) at the site located in Stratum V was identified in the Lower Analytical Unit. The following questions were developed to explore the burned rock technology at the site. 1) Are there variations in feature function at the site over time and/or within each of the analytical units? The interpretation of burned rock features and their functions has long been of interest to address questions about technology, subsistence, and social changes across time (e.g., Black et al. 1997; Black and Thoms 2014; Collins 1972; Derring 1999; Freeman 2007; Kelley and Campbell 1942; Weir 1976). Various methods and analytical data—including feature dimensions and morphology, coarse and fine matrix descriptions, nonmatrix constituents, and results of macrobotanical and faunal analysis—can provide information on the context and functions of these features. This information can then be related to investment of labor and resource availability, which could yield information on economical and organizational aspects of landscape use, planning, and shifting resource bases over time. The burned rock features at 41DN612 fall into two groups consisting of isolated hearth features and a BRM. The small, isolated burned rock features (i.e., Features 1–6) in the Upper and Lower Analytical Units are interpreted as single- or limited-use cooking features, which suggests a lower investment of labor for food processing and intermittent or brief occupations of the site area during this period. Conversely, the accumulation of the large BRM in the Upper Analytical Unit is suggestive of a higher investment of labor and more intensive and/or repetitive occupation of the site during the latter part of the Transitional Archaic (Black and Thoms 2014:205, 222; Dering 1999). As mentioned in Chapter 4, we were hopeful that by using Thoms’ (2009:577) more-comprehensive list of hot-rock cooking methods/functions, the function of each feature could be determined and compared across space and time. Feature A is a large, circular, BRM with an associated diffuse mussel shell, bone, and charcoal scatter within Strata III and IV within the late Transitional Archaic component. The feature was initially recorded as four separate burned rock clusters during survey by Raba Kistner (Neel and Meléndez 2019:12). During SWCA’s investigations, the clusters were observed to be connected and additional burned rock was observed in all directions past the initial boundary of the four clusters. The feature was reclassified as a BRM and designated as Feature A. The approximately 9 m north/south by 11 m east/west feature is representative of Thoms (2009:577) definition of a closed pit baking feature with stone heating element (i.e., earth oven). Earth oven facilities are large, specialized features that are often reused over long periods of time. The remnants are often seen as an irregular pit surrounded by discarded burned rock (oven clean out and discard) and previously abandoned hearth centers (Black and Thoms 2014).

reused over time a large homogenous deposit may form (i.e., BRM) due to the continued reuse, disturbance, and mixing that occurs during the construction of new hearths (Kelly and Campbell 1942:320; Weir 1976). Excavations of Units 1–4 positioned at the center of Feature A exposed various base depths revealing an irregular pit with depths ranged from 50–80 cmbd (153.0–152.7 m) (see Figure 6.7). Within the larger BRM (Feature A), four internal features were identified (Elements 1–4) and are interpreted to be remnants of individual primary heating loci within a larger earth oven facility. All four units exhibited an increase in larger tabular rocks (Element 1) from 35 to 40 cmbd (153.15–153.1 m) focused near the center of the excavated block (Figure 8.1). Another cluster of larger rocks (Element 2) fractured in situ was encountered near the center of the block from 45 to 50 cmbd (153.05–153.0 m). Two additional smaller clusters of large rocks fractured in situ were encountered in Unit 2 at 60 cmbd (Element 3 at 152.9 m) and Unit 2 at 75 cmbd (Element 4 at 152.75 m) (see Figure 7.15). These clusters could indicate a series of primary heating elements (i.e., central oven bed with large, often tabular, fractured in place rocks in a circular pattern) that have been deflated through reuse and/or borrowing of materials for later iterations of the earth oven facility (Black and Thoms 2014:213–216; Kelly and Campbell 1942:320). Unit 2 Unit 4 Unit 1 Unit 3  Figure 8.1. Overview of possible individual primary heating element (Element 1) from Units 1–4 in Feature A at 35 to 40 cmbs (153.15–153.10 m). Although the rest of the feature was not excavated, the size and diffuse pattern of burned rock noted on the exposed surface is likely representative of discarded FCR patterns (i.e., the irregular discard of small and fractured rocks that are no longer useful during cleanout or reuse) typical of earth oven facilities (Black and 103 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Thoms 2014:218) (see Figure 7.12). Additional individual primary heating elements may also remain in the unexcavated portions of the BRM. Feature 4 is an irregularly shaped burned rock layer located within Stratum III within the late Transitional Archaic component. It was encountered in the floor of BHT K and measured approximately 80 cm north/south by 45 cm east/west and 5 cm thick. No mussel shell or other faunal remains were found within the feature matrix. Interestingly, this feature was encountered at 46–51 cmbd (153.04–152.99 m), which correlates to the middle of the BRM (Feature A) (Figure 8.2). Due to its characteristics (i.e., size, irregular arrangement, thin single layer, small unfragmented rocks, and lack of thermally altered sediment), Feature 4 is likely the discarded remains of FCR from oven cleanout and reuse of the larger Feature A (Black and Thoms 2014:218). Feature 5 is a circular burned rock cluster with a central concentration of thin, flat, burned rock slabs located in Stratum IV within the late Transitional Archaic component. It was exposed within BHT N and BHT O and measured 100 cm north/south and 75 cm east/west. Feature 5 consists of three layers, approximately 15 cm thick, with adjoining but not stacked burned rock. A majority of the rocks were less than 10 cm in size, but the 24 (of 94 total) rocks larger than 10 cm were concentrated in the central portion of the feature with the smaller rocks falling along the periphery. These larger and tabular central rocks may represent the remains of an individual primary heating element because they were fractured in situ (Black and Thoms 2014:213–216). The feature is also 84–91 cmbd (152.85–152.7 m), which places it in spatial association with the lower boundary of Feature A (see Figure 8.2). Due to its characteristics (i.e., size, circular shape, and core of tabular in situ fractured rocks) and association with Feature A, Feature 5 likely represents what Thoms (2009:557) classified as a closed pit earth oven. Its spatial association with Feature A may indicate that Feature 5 represents an earlier single- or limited-use cooking event that was later encompassed and disturbed by events in association with Feature A (Thoms 2009:586). Feature 5 may represent a small earth oven and early iteration of the more-intensive activities seen in association with Feature A (Black and Thoms 2014:205). Features 1 and 2 were identified at 84 to 91 cmbd (152.66–152.59 m), which places them immediately below Feature A (see Figure 8.2). Feature 1 is an isolated, oval shaped, burned rock concentration initially encountered in the central-eastern portion of excavation Unit 1. Feature 1 measured 12 cm north/south by 20 cm east/west and consisted of two layers, approximately 7 cm thick. Feature 2 consists of a discrete burned rock initially encountered in the north wall of BHT A. Feature 2 was only partially exposed by BHT A and was not fully excavated. The profile of the feature consists of two burned rock layers, approximately 23 cm thick. The width of the feature diminished with depth, as the top of the feature is 36 cm, the center to 33 cm, and finally terminating at 18 cm wide at the base. Although the thickness of the feature varied, the feature was confined to geomorphic Stratum IV. Immediately below Feature 1 and 2 at 94–99 cmbd (152.56–152.51 m) another feature (Feature 3) was identified (see Figure 8.2). Feature 3 consisted of a stacked burned rock cluster initially encountered in the east wall of BHT I. The profile of Feature 3 consists of overlapping and stacking burned rock measuring approximately 5 cm thick. The width of the feature increases toward the center, as the top of the feature is 22 cm wide, the center to 26 cm wide, and finally terminating at 24 cm wide at the base. Feature 3 was only partially exposed by BHT I and was not fully excavated. 104 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Features 1, 2, and 3 likely represent limited-use open-air hearths (Thoms 2009:577, 586). These features are small in size (total number of FCR for Feature 1 is 17 and for the exposed portions of Features 2 and 3, FCR is 13 and 18, respectively) with evidence of in situ fractured rocks. Alternatively, these features could represent early limited-use earth ovens. Black and Thoms (2014:204–205) argue that smaller ovens are often overlooked or misidentified due to their ephemeral context and more limited preservation in relation to larger earth oven facilities. Nonetheless, these features do likely correspond to earlier less-intensive hot rock cooking techniques that were later expanded upon, resulting in the more-intensive earth oven facility (Feature A). Feature 6 is the deepest feature identified at the site and the only one not immediately associated with the larger BRM feature (see Figure 8.2). It is an isolated, oval shaped, burned rock concentration initially encountered in the floor of BHT P, between elevations 152.08–51.98 m (142–152 cmbd). The feature measured approximately 50 cm north/south by 30 cm east/west. The profile of Feature 6 consisted of a single layer of burned rock, approximately 10 cm thick. Due to its characteristics (size, circular shape, and in situ fractured rocks with thermally altered sediment below), Feature 6 likely represents a single- or limited-use open-air hearth (Thoms 2009:577). Features 1, 2, and 3 (Upper Analytical Unit) and Feature 6 (Lower Analytical Unit) are all small single- or limited- use hearths. All four features consist of two to three layers of burned rock that could represent multiple uses. The small size of the features and incomplete excavation of Features 2 and 3 make it difficult to determine how many cooking events occurred within these features. Feature 6 lies well below the remaining features and is expected to represent one of the earliest ephemeral occupations of the site. Features 1, 2, and 3 lie stratigraphically below Feature A and near the interface of the Upper and Lower Analytical Units. These features may indicate the beginning of consistent occupation of the site. In the Upper Analytical Unit we see a shift to larger, more-labor intensive, and reused earth ovens (Features 5 and A) with Feature 4 representing an FCR discard loci from oven clean out and reuse. The seven features identified across site 41DN612 conform with hot rock cooking models in which initial stone cooking techniques are represented by few rocks in small, single- or limited-use open-air hearths or griddles. The more labor-intensive earth ovens typically follow or post-date the regular use of open-air hearths (Thoms 2009:586–587; Fields 2004: 362–363). Theories on the transition from limited and low-intensity stone cooking features to the increased use of higher-intensity features include climate change, increased population density, decreased mobility, and increased occupation and reuse of sites. These pressures likely resulted in changes in subsistence strategies with a focus on land use intensification (Fields 2004:364; Freeman 2007; Thoms 2008, 2009:588; Wandsnider 1997). In addition to the methods of cooking, resources used for construction (e.g., rock, wood fuel) of the feature as well as the resource(s) processed or around each feature were reviewed and compared to the other features at the site. For the construction or processing, there were no evident differences used between the features or analytical units. A majority of the stone used in the construction of the features was limestone with local quartzite occurring only in very minimal numbers in Feature A (n=2), Feature 3 (n=7), and Feature 5 (n=5). Interestingly, the quartzite found in Feature 5 did encompass the largest size clast and were utilized for the primary heating element, but this was not the case in the other features with quartzite. 106 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

The fuel types utilized in these features consisted of various hardwoods suggesting opportunistic collection. Specifically, Feature A contained white oak, slippery elm, and hickory; Feature 1 contained an indeterminate hardwood; Feature 2 contained walnut; Feature 5 contained white oak, American beautyberry, and indeterminate hardwood; and Feature 6 contained American beautyberry. Similarly, the procured food resources were highly variable across all of the features. Feature A contained a wild onion, a carbonized camas bulb, mussel shell, deer, indeterminate rodent, turtle/tortoise, and several indeterminate fragments that might be avian and snake. Feature 1 contained fragments of deer; Feature 2 contained a carbonized walnut hull; Feature 3 contained indeterminate botanical fragments; Feature 4 had no identifiable flora or fauna materials; Feature 5 contained carbonized bulb scales; and Feature 6 contained deer. 2) How many individual cooking events are estimated for the earth ovens within the site? To estimate the number of cooking events with the earth oven facility, the number, weight, and size distribution of the burned rocks as well as the rate of fragmentation were used to evaluate use and reuse of the features. Previous data from both archeological and experimental earth ovens have provided an estimated general range of between 100 to 250 kg of burned rock per cooking event (Black and McGraw 1985; Black et al. 1997; Campbell 2012; Dering 1999; Leach et al. 1998). In addition, larger rocks are more likely part of a “primary structural element” of an earth oven, whereas smaller rocks are more indicative of reuse and/or discard (Black et al. 1997:83). Feature A has been recognized as an earth oven facility with multiple cooking events represented. One of the earliest cooking events in association with the facility is Feature 5. This feature consists of a total of 94 burned rocks ranging in size from less than 5 cm to more than 15 cm in size and weighing a total of 19.0 kg. Based on previous research and the characteristics of the feature (i.e., size, predominance of small clast rocks, and occurrence of distinct individual primary heating loci) it is assumed that at least one cooking event occurred at this feature (Black and McGraw 1985; Black et al. 1997; Leach et al. 1998). Three layers of adjoining but not stacked rocks were observed. These layers may represent reuse of the feature and associated rocks, but subsequent disturbance from reuse of the facility has distorted these events. A total of four units were excavated from Feature A. Unit 4 was excavated as a feature-focused unit and information was not recording as to the number and weight of materials per 10-cm level. The remaining three units were fully documented in 10-cm levels, including documenting burned rock characteristics per level. Using these metrics and suggested calculations from Black and McGraw (1985:299), estimations were made as to the total area, density, and volume of burned rock from Feature A. The total area is estimated to be 77.8 m2, the volume is 31.37 m3, and density is 207.35 kg per m3. Based on these calculations, the entire BRM area is estimated to consist of 6,504 kg of rock and anywhere between 86 (reuse of rocks twice) and 173 (reuse of rocks four times) cooking events may have occurred within the BRM (Black and McGraw 1985:299; Black et al. 1997; Dering 1999). In attempting to estimate the number of firing or cooking events of a feature, one of the major factors involves determining the rate of burned rock fracture to approximate reuse and discard (Black et al. 1997; Black and Lucas 1998; Campbell 2012; Leach et al. 1998). Experimental research done by Leach et al. (1998) to estimate rates of burned rock reuse and discard determined that, generally, rocks could only be utilized once 107 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

or twice before becoming too thermally fractured for use. Taking this into account, a conservative estimation of between 43 and 86 cooking events is likely more representative of the BRM at 41DN612. The number of burned rocks were plotted by size for Features 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and Elements 3 and 4 for Feature A (Figure 8.3–8.7). Feature 4 was omitted because detailed rock sorting and counting was not completed for that feature. In addition, Elements 1 and 2 were omitted because no rock sort data was obtained from the portions of the elements that extended into Unit 4. The hope was to establish the frequency distribution of small (<5 cm) to large rocks (>15 cm) as an indicator of reuse for each feature. If a feature is composed of predominantly smaller rocks, then it is more likely the feature has been reused. In contrast, if a feature consisted of mostly large rock, then the feature is less likely to have been reused. It should be noted that the hearth features have a relatively low sample size due to the small size of the feature and the fact that they were not fully excavated (e.g., Features 2 and 3). Despite this, all six populations were generally positively skewed, meaning the five features and two elements support the hypothesis that reuse was occurring. Features 1, 2, and 3 are predominately composed of rocks smaller than 10 cm in size. The exclusive occurrence of rock sizes less than 10 cm in Feature 1 suggests that reuse was occurring; this in conjunction with the small size of the feature fits with the model that Feature 1 represents a limited-use hearth (see Figure 8.3). Based on the amount of moderately sized rocks (5–15 cm) in Features 2 and 3, there was likely only some reuse occurring, which fits with the model of these features representing limited-use hearths (see Figure 8.4). Although the rock sizes within Features 1, 2, and 3 suggest reuse, the minimal sample size (n=23, n=13, n=28, respectively) does not provide a robust enough sample to assume the distribution model is indeed representative of the population. However, these features were included to extract as much information as possible about the site and its occupational history. This distribution model is seen with the population from Features 5 and 6 as well (see Figure 8.5). 15 10 5 0 <5 cm 5-10 cm 10-15 cm >15 cm Figure 8.3.

Although the distribution of Feature 5 is still positively skewed, the population is predominantly composed of rocks between 5 and 10 cm in size (64.9 percent) (see Figure 8.7). This suggests some reuse, but still only limited activity. The distribution of Feature 5 may not be wholly represented as it is situated within the BRM and anthropomorphic disturbances may have altered the population. The distribution of Feature 6 also suggests limited reuse because only two of the total 34 rocks (5.9 percent) are larger than 10 cm in size (see Figure 8.7). The two elements analyzed from Feature A are strongly right skewed, with 84 percent of Element 3 and 71 percent of element 4 consisting of rocks smaller than 5 cm in size (see Figures 8.6 and 8.7). The long- tailed size-frequency distribution seen in both elements strongly suggests intensive reuse. Both elements have a much larger sample size and were completely excavated, in contrast with Features 2 and 3, but the dramatically skewed distribution likely suggests that reuse of individual features was more intensive within the BRM. This supports the model proposed of increased intensification through time at 41DN612. 3) What is the relationship of site formation processes and the patterning of the cultural features observed within the site? The geoarcheological analysis results and feature distribution throughout the site were used to determine what processes have affected the cultural manifestations observed at the site. Are the smaller, isolated features a result of more sedimentation covering the site during that time period indicative of specific feature function and/or specific resource processing, a result of cultural/natural disturbances, or a combination of one or more of these factors? Did the large BRM feature accumulate due to a period of surface stability, allowing reuse of the site features creating a palimpsest, or is this a result of intensification of resource processing and the need for larger cooking features (i.e., increased labor investment)? Site 41DN612 is on the left bank (east side) of a slight interior meander bend that is laterally growing from continual flood deposits. As mentioned previously, Denton Creek at this crossing has an SR value of 1.4, suggesting a dynamic fluvial history. This is partially evident from the oxbow channel situated approximately 35 m southeast of the site. To help in examining the site formation processes, 15 radiocarbon samples from good elevational and stratigraphic context were considered (Appendix 7). The radiocarbon data indicate that at least two periods of prehistoric occupation occurred at the site during the Transitional Archaic. Specifically, the Upper Analytical Unit within Stratum III, the interface of Strata III and IV, and the upper portion of Stratum IV dates between 1540 and 1200 cal yr BP at the end of the Transitional Archaic. The Lower Analytical Unit roughly falls between 2080 and 1820 cal yr BP and the beginning of the Transitional Archaic. As previously discussed, the rate of alluvial deposition at 41DN612 was approximated comparing select radiocarbon assays and their stratigraphic elevation. These data suggest an average rate of deposition across both analytical unit occupations appears to be 7.5 cm per century (see Chapter 6). However, when comparing the temporal gap of 320 years between the two analytical units, the estimated rate of deposition is 14.5 cm per century, doubling the average rate of deposition for the site. As previously noted, this period of increased sedimentation appears to temporally coincide when Denton Creek avulsed and established a new channel upstream from 41DN612 around 1740 B.P. (Abbott n.d.:7). The period of dynamic change along Denton Creek drainage roughly correlates stratigraphically between the lowest feature (Feature 6) dated to between 2159 and 2001 cal yr BP and the lowermost portions of the Upper 111 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Analytical Unit that includes Features 1, 2 and 3. Specifically, Feature 2 returned an estimated date of between 1696 and 1544 cal yr BP and Feature 1 was dated roughly between 1348 and 1276 cal yr BP (Feature 3 was not able to be dated). Notably, these features are stratigraphically below the BRM (Feature A). Once the new channel of Denton Creek was established, a period of stability was seen as marked by the formation of the West Fork paleosol, which correlates with Stratum III and the BRM (Feature A). As a result, it appears that although the BRM did accumulate during a period of stability allowing reuse of the site features creating a palimpsest, the occurrence of single-use features (i.e., Features 1, 2, and 3) immediately below the BRM and their accumulation after the shift in Denton Creek’s channel does suggest an increase in land use intensification (i.e., single- or limited-use hearths being replaced by earth oven hot rock cooking technology). Sources for the lithic raw materials, particularly quartzite, composing the burned rock features at 41DN612 is difficult to identify. As noted above, several regional geologic maps record the presence of gravel and cobble- sized quartzite as a component of the fluviatile terrace deposits. Within the Sherman sheet that encompasses the project area, fluviatile terrace deposits are mapped along Denton, Hickory, and Clear Creeks (McGowen et al. 1991). Each of these mapped deposits are within 1.5 miles, 9 miles, and 17 miles, respectively. Admittedly, the presence of quartzite at these mapped locations is unknown, but the quartzite at the site most likely came from one of these drainages, with Denton Creek being the most reasonable interpretation. Limestone, the primary component of the burned rock features, is more prevalent in the area. Limestone from the Fort Worth Limestone and Duck Creek Formation are mapped within 0.25 mile of 41DN612 in the uplands east of the site (McGowen et al. 1991). It is interpreted that limestone clast materials were readily available both in the Denton Creek channel base and in the surrounding uplands for use in the burned rock features at 41DN612. As to initial size of the procured FCR raw materials at 41DN612, only an approximate size range can be made due to the extensive reuse of the FCR observed in the features. Accounting for this limitation, the clast materials identified as “primary structural elements” are the best gauge for initial procured rock size. Although a few clast materials were identified larger than 15 cm, the most consistent ‘large’ rock materials were between 10 and 15 cm in size. It is here interpreted that the primary size of initial procured clast materials at 41DN612 tended to be 10–15 cm in size and the reuse of the thermal features subsequently fragmented and reduced the rock. Research Issue 2: Foraging Strategies Research has shown that earth oven facilities were used to convert otherwise inedible foods (i.e., geophytes and starches) into more digestible starches and sugars (Dering 1999; Thoms 2008; Wandsnider 1997). Dering (1999:671) suggests that the use of large earth ovens, such as the BRM at 41DN612, is indicative of a broad- spectrum economy that may be a result of changes in resource availability of other, higher-ranked resources (e.g., deer). The following questions were developed to explore foraging strategies used by the groups who inhabited site 41DN612. 1) Is the 41DN612 assemblage consistent with expectations of a broad-based foraging strategy? Macrobotanical analyses was conducted primarily on samples from the feature contexts at 41DN612. The results primarily identified wood charcoal, which is interpreted to be fuel for cooking features, and carbonized 112 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

bulb scale fragments (geophytes) including camas and wild onion or garlic (Appendix 8; Bush 2020). In addition to the geophytes, indeterminable starchy fragments were also identified that may represent bulbs, tubers, rhizomes, or large, starchy seeds. Previous macrobotanical research by Gayle J. Fritz during the Richland Chambers Reservoir project found that nuts (hickory, pecan, and acorn) as well as prairie turnip were prominent food sources for hunter gatherers during the Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). A relative of the prairie turnip, scurfpea was also commonly found at Late Archaic to Early Caddoan sites around the Lake Cooper area (Fields et al. 1993). The occurrence of these starchy carbohydrates at other sites within the Trinity River Basin, as well as their documented importance historically to the Great Plains region, suggests that the indeterminate starchy fragments from 41DN612 may have been from the Psoralea tuber family (Field et al. 1993; McGregor and Bruseth 1987; Reid 1977; Wedel 1978). Archeological plant remains at site 41DN612 were sparse (0.02 g/liter) and consisted primarily of wood charcoal and bulb scale fragments (Appendix 8) (Bush 2020). The macrobotanical remains analyzed from the light fractions of the flotation samples were all collected from feature contexts; however, several non-feature charcoal samples from below Feature A and the trenching activities were also analyzed. The identified plant remains from the features consisted of wood charcoal, bulb scale fragments, starchy fragments (i.e., bulb, tuber, or rhizome), a small piece of bark, and two unidentified botanical fragments (Table 8.1) (Bush 2020). Table 8.1. Number of Identified Species Present for Bulb Scales and Starchy Fragments Common Name Botanical Name NISP Camas Camassia spp. 4 Wild Onion Allium spp. 1 Indeterminable bulb scale n/a 16 Starchy fragments n/a 12 A total of 21 bulb scales were identified from Feature A (n=18) and Feature 5 (n=3) in the Upper Analytical Unit (see Table 8.1) (Bush 2020). Four camas bulb fragments (Units 1 and 2, Feature A) were identified as either Atlantic camas (Camassia scilloides) or prairie camas (C. angusta). A wild onion or garlic bulb fragment was also identified (Unit 1, Feature A). The remaining 16 samples were indeterminate regarding species (Appendix 8). Additionally, indeterminable starchy fragments found in seven samples may also represent bulbs, but the possibility of tubers, rhizomes, or even large, starchy seeds cannot be ruled out (see Table 8.1) (Bush 2020:7). Identification was attempted for 293 wood charcoal fragments, but due to the small size of most fragments, only 228 could be identified to genus or species (Table 8.2; Appendix 8). The identified samples were collected from Features A, Features 1–3, and Features 5–6, as well as a few non-feature contexts. Oaks (NISP=66) were the most numerous, composing 22.5 percent of the identified assemblage. Oak specimens that could be identified below the genus level were all white oak group. Other predominant wood charcoal species within the assemblage included several elm varieties (NISP=32; 10.9 percent), hickory/pecan (NISP=27; 9.2 percent), plum/cherry (NISP=27; 9.2 percent), dogwood (Cornus) (NISP=21; 7.2 percent), mulberry (NISP=17; 5.8 percent), and viburnum (NISP=15; 5.1 percent) (Appendix 8) (Bush 2020). The remaining wood charcoal species comprised less than 5 percent of the assemblage. Most of the identified specimens were from the 113 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Identified specimen included three attributed to biological class Aves, 14 specimens of the biological order Testudines (turtle/tortoise), and 36 specimens attributed to class Mammalia; these were present in both the Upper and Lower Analytical Unit assemblages. Only nine elements could be attributed to species and, interestingly, all nine were identified as deer. As a result of the faunal analysis, the NISP was determined to be nine and the MNI is one. Seven specimen presented signs of anthropogenic taphonomy. All seven were identified as white-tailed deer, or as deer-sized mammal elements that could not definitively be attributed to species due to the small size of the fragments and lack of identifying landmarks.

with evidence of percussion impacts, four specimens with cut marks, and one specimen with chop marks. These anthropogenic taphonomic signatures are typically associated with butchery. As such, the butchery of at least one deer can be assumed to be represented within the site assemblage. Only one specimen (Lot No. 155-1) with cut marks was found in association with a feature (i.e., Feature 1). A second specimen (Lot No. 228-1) with percussion impacts was found at a similar elevation as Lot No. 155-1, but in Unit 3. Finally, one specimen with cut marks (Lot No. 242-1) was found in close association to the upper elevation of Feature 6 (152.09 m). The remaining specimens with anthropogenic taphonomic signatures were found within the BRM area in the Upper Analytical Unit, but generally below the BRM and not in direct association with any feature (Appendix 5). The vertical distribution of the deer bones exhibiting anthropogenic taphonomy may indicate that more than one deer is represented within the faunal assemblage, and that deer was being processed during both the early and Late Transitional Archaic (in both the Upper and Lower Analytical Units). Finally, other faunal remains encountered during the 41DN612 investigations included 155 mussel shell fragments of which 89 were umbos. Of the 155 mussel shells, 66 (42.6 percent) were identified by genus and species. The remaining 89 (57.4 percent) could not be confidently identified because of their fragmentary nature. Of those that were classified, five species were identified including threeridge, rock pocketbook, threehorn wartyback, Louisiana pigtoe, and lilliput. These encompass a mixture of both common and uncommon species to the Trinity River. The most frequent identified species (n=47; 71.2 percent) is Amblema plicata, known as the threeridge because of its exterior flutes and ridges. These are found throughout drainages in central and east Texas (Howells et al. 1996:34–35). Historically, these typically thick-shelled mussels were used for button production or polished shell ornaments. The thickness and luster of this species may also have been utilized in prehistoric times; however, no shell ornaments were identified within the 41DN612 assemblage. These shells were common throughout the site and present in both the Upper and Lower Analytical Units; therefore, no clear vertical or horizontal concentration could be identified in the distribution of this species. Lilliput mussel shells comprised 16.7 percent and were primarily identified within the Upper Analytical Unit deposits; however, two specimens were identified in the Lower Analytical Unit (Unit 2 Level 7 and BHT N). Louisiana pigtoe comprised 9.1 percent and, similar to the lilliput, was mostly found in the Upper Analytical Unit contexts with only one specimen in the Lower (Unit 1 Level 8). The remaining two species only had one specimen each in the assemblage and both were in the Upper Analytical Unit deposits. The identified species are typical of flowing water environments with a stable substrate (i.e., creeks or rivers). The mussel shells were collected from across the site, and 123 were found in general association with the BRM feature. Overall, analysis of the flora and faunal remains at site 41DN612 is characteristic of a broad diet breadth exploiting locally available resources such as deer, small game, turtle, birds, and freshwater mussel shell, and an increased use of plant resources. Archeologists have documented a long history of bulb exploitation in Texas, and the use of earth oven facilities to transform otherwise inedible geophytes into nutritionally optimal starches and sugars seems to be part of a continent-wide trend that began in the early Holocene (Thoms 2008; Wandsnider 1997). Although the occurrence of plant remains at 41DN612 is rather low, it is possible that the earlier earth ovens were used to cook meat (i.e., deer) and items other than plant foods. Alternatively, 115 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

later cooking events may have differentially destroyed the earlier bulb scale fragments, which are less common and more delicate than wood charcoal (Bush 2020). 2) Can any inferences be made about seasonality of site use? Due to the paucity of identifiable flora and faunal remains, it is difficult to make determinations as to the seasonality of the assemblage. As mentioned, the occurrence of camas, wild onion (or garlic), and other indeterminate bulb scales and starchy fragments do suggest a spring to early summer procurement event (Acuña 2006; Boyd et al. 2004). As the macrobotanical analysis was only able to identify two specimens to species, it is difficult to narrow down the season, but within the Western Cross Timbers Allium typically grow between March and June and camas between March and May (Acuña 2006:28–29). As these plant remains were largely found in association with Feature A in the excavated units, it is likely that at least one or more of the cooking events represented within the central portion of the BRM occurred during the spring between March and May. Only six elements from the faunal assemblage were able to be generally aged (Appendix 5). Of these, four were determined to be adult and two were designated as juvenile. All the elements, except for one juvenile, were also identified as deer. Two of the adult elements were found below Feature A in Units 1 and 3 (Lot Nos. 143-1 and 224-1). The juvenile classified as white-tailed deer (Lot No. 227-1) was collected from below Feature 1. This suggests that at least Feature 1 was utilized in spring or summer as white-tail deer fawns in the Western Cross Timbers are typically born between April and July with a majority of births occurring in June (TPWD 2020b). Finally, very little research has been conducted on seasonal mussel assemblage movements in Central Texas. As such, it is unclear if any mussel species burrow deeper during winter than during other seasons. It is also unclear if stream dwelling species are physically capable of burrowing deeper, considering the generally rocky nature of Central Texas river substrate. The lack of clarity regarding seasonal vertical migration, specifically in Central Texas, makes it difficult to determine mussel availability to human gatherers throughout the year. Overall, the limited flora and faunal remains recovered from the site make determinations of seasonality difficult. Based on the identified macrobotanical remains, we can estimate at least one or two occurrences of plant banking in the spring or early summer. Additionally, the faunal elements that were able to be identified to species and age indicate a late spring to early summer kill event. Although the flora and faunal remains are sparse, site 41DN612 does appear to mirror other Late Archaic sites recorded in the Trinity River basin. Previous investigations have reported evidence of broad-based subsistence strategies and small seasonal camp sites along the tributaries of the Trinity River (Ferring and Yates 1998; McGreger and Bruseth 1987; Tinsley and Dayton 2011). It has been suggested that these ephemeral campsites along the creeks were used seasonally for specific hunting and foraging activities, while more- permanent habitation sites were located on the uplands along the Trinity River proper (Tinsley and Dayton 2011: 181). Interestingly, these Late Archaic campsites typically have a broad-based diet breath but focus on deer and other large game (i.e., bison). Additionally, a late spring to early summer occupational period is commonly suggested due to the identification of young deer and bulbs in many of the assemblages (McGreger and Bruseth 1987; Peter and McGreger 1988; and Tinsley and Dayton 2011). 116 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

3) Is there any evidence of intensive resource processing or tool manufacture at the site? As previously mentioned, anthropogenic taphonomy is present on the surface of seven specimens, all seven of which have been identified as white-tailed deer, or as deer-sized mammal elements that could not definitively be attributed to species due to the small size of the fragments and lack of identifying landmarks. The taphonomic signatures identified include two specimens with evidence of percussion impacts, four specimens with cut marks, and one specimen with chop marks. The observed anthropogenic taphonomy can be associated with butchery and was only present on elements attributed to white-tailed deer and deer-sized mammal elements. Thus, the butchery of a single deer can securely be attributed to the site assemblage. None of the faunal bone showed evidence of modification for tool use. The vast majority of the shells was associated with Feature A, and 32 percent of the assemblage, exhibited evidence of cultural modification (i.e., battering, cut edges, burning). It is likely that the remaining shell was also culturally modified; however, these specimens were either too fragmentary or had recent breakage and cultural modification could not be ascertained. None of the mussel shell exhibited intentional modifications for tool use or adornments. Additionally, archeologists have documented a long history of bulb exploitation in Texas, and the use of earth oven facilities to transform otherwise inedible geophytes into nutritionally optimal starches and sugars seems to be part of a continent-wide trend that began in the early Holocene (Thoms 2008; Wandsnider 1997). Although the occurrence of plant remains at 41DN612 is rather low, the incidence of bulb scale fragments and starchy fragments (i.e., bulb, tuber, or rhizome) does indicate that at least some intensive plant processing was being conducted. This intensive plant processing may have been minor in scale, with other foods (i.e., deer and mussel) being more important. The heavy reuse and internal mixing of Feature A also may have destroyed other fragile plant remains. 117 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

Chapter 9. Site Summary and Conclusions On behalf of TxDOT, SWCA conducted staged mitigation on the Hardeman Midden site (41DN612), within the APE of the proposed FM 407 Project in Denton County, Texas (CSJ: 1310-01-027). The site is a stratified Transitional Archaic occupation situated on a broad flat floodplain of Denton Creek and Denton Creek Slough, an abandoned channel of Denton Creek. SWCA and its subcontractor conducted the data recovery investigations of 41DN612 from April 14 to June 22, 2019; geomorphological assessments were conducted during the last week of fieldwork. Field investigations consisted of a combination of mechanical and hand excavation of all site deposits within the APE. Excavations terminated at 5 feet as depths of project impacts would not exceed 5 feet. Overall, SWCA excavated 310.1 m3 of sediment from the site. Subsequent to the fieldwork, analyses included radiocarbon dating, flotation sampling, geoarcheological analyses, identification of faunal remains, and assessment of the artifacts and features. As described in Chapter 6, the stratigraphy at 41DN612 appears to correlate with the Pilot Point alloformation (dating to 4,500–1,800 years ago), which is capped by the West Fork paleosol (interpreted to date to 2,300– 1,000 years ago). Within these deposits, five depositional strata were identified. Strata I and II are associated with modern and historic disturbances; Stratum III appears to correlate with the West Fork paleosol; and the underlying Strata IV and V appear to correlate with the Pilot Point alloformation. Based on the results of the various analyses, particularly the chronometric analyses, the prehistoric deposits at 41DN612 appear to be primarily associated with the period commonly recognized as the Transitional Archaic, although there is a slight overlap with the Late Prehistoric I period. Within these deposits, two cultural or archeological analytical units were defined (i.e., Upper and Lower Analytical Units). The Upper Analytical Unit falls at the end of the Transitional Archaic (and very beginning of the Late Prehistoric I period) calibrated between 1540–1200 cal yr B.P.), whereas the Lower Analytical Unit occurs in the early Transitional Archaic between 2080 and 1820 cal yr B.P. These analytical units appear to be separated by a recognized period of change within Denton Creek when the drainage channel changed course around 1,740 years ago (Abbott n.d.:7). The change to the Denton Creek drainage likely explains the notable increase in sedimentation separating the two age groups observed at 41DN612. During these excavations, seven cultural features were exposed, including a large earth oven facility (Feature A) and six isolated burned rock features (Features 1–6), interpreted to be single- or limited-use cooking features. All of the features were within the Upper Analytical Unit except for Feature 6, which was within the Lower Analytical Unit. A total of 519 artifacts were collected during the investigations including 209 historic artifacts and 310 prehistoric artifacts. The historic artifacts were primarily within a large refuse pit that truncated portions of the Feature A, and was limited to the Upper Analytical Unit. The prehistoric assemblage consisted of faunal remains (155 mussel shells and 99 faunal bone) and burned clay (n=21). No lithic tools or debitage were recovered during the field investigations or during flotation or fine-screening of the feature matrix. In addition, 6,429 pieces of burned rock were documented during the investigations and 176 special samples were collected. Overall, previous studies and literature reviews show a paucity of burned rock features within the Trinity River basin (e.g., Black et al. 1997; Lintz et al. 2008; Prikryl 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). In a report presented by Geo-Marine, a literature review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Database was conducted to compare the occurrence of thermal features reported within the Trinity River and Brazos River basins (Lintz et al. 2008). Lintz et al. (2008) reported that thermal features are rarely reported within the Trinity River basin and twice as 118 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

likely to be reported within the Brazos River basin. This suggests that the occurrence of seven distinct features at 41DN612 is significant and may provide valuable information on the regional history of the Trinity River basin during the Transitional Archaic period. The smaller hearth features identified at 41DN612 are typical of the small burned rock features encountered within the Trinity River basin during the Late Archaic to early Late Prehistoric (Black et al. 1997; Lintz et al. 2008; Prikryl 1990; Tinsley et al. 2011). Interestingly, larger burned rock features and earth ovens are particularly rare, making the occurrence of Feature A rather unique. The excavations were limited to the APE and the exposure afforded only a partial glimpse of the overall site. Based on the assemblage, the site is interpreted as a seasonal (likely spring and summer), ephemeral campsite utilized primarily for hunting/foraging and cooking activities, as indicated by the flora and faunal assemblage and associated site furniture. Small groups exploited the riparian zone resources, making forays into the landscape to hunt and forage. Over time, there was an increase in land use intensification as evidenced by the single- or limited-use hearths being replaced by earth oven hot rock cooking technology to process lower-ranked resources (e.g., geophytes and starches) Regional Comparison To place the activities at site 41DN612 into a regional context, a brief review of archeological sites in the Trinity River Basin was conducted. The main purpose of this literature review was to identify sites with burned rock middens, and if possible, to compare the features and occupations of those sites with site 41DN612. The review focused on three main types of sources: projects completed in the region (Brown and Lebo 1990; Ferring and Yates 1997; Parrish and Burson 2002; Raab and Moir 1981; and Shanabrook et al. 2002), site specific investigations (Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring and Yates 1998; Lintz et al. 2008; Peter and Harrison 2011; and Shelton 2016), and sources that discuss regional archeological histories (Crook III and Hughston 2016; Fields 2004; Prikryl 1990; Sciscenti 1971; and Todd 2014). A total of 161 Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric sites were identified in the literature review (Table 9.1). Identifying sites with burned rock middens proved to be difficult due to the inconsistency of language used to describe features, the paucity of information reported on some sites, and time constraints of this project. Of the 161 sites, a total of 24 sites were found to include burned rock midden features, and an additional 26 sites were found to potentially include burned rock middens (Figure 9.1). Those sites notated as having the potential to contain burned rock middens were sites in which the language or reporting was limited but seemed to indicate a likelihood of midden or earth oven activity (e.g., cultural midden noted with dense mussel and FCR; no midden noted but 14 burned rock features were reported). During this brief review, several trends became clear. The occurrence of burned rock middens or large earth oven facilities appears to increase as one moves westerly within the Trinity River Basin with sites downstream having less abundant burned rock assemblages (Lintz 2008; Peter and Harrison 2011:273). Secondly, site use appears to mirror residential mobility, as proposed by Binford (1982), with site use intensifying through the Late Archaic and into the Late Prehistoric periods (Ferring and Yates 1997:305; Peter and Harrison 2011:31). Finally, burned rock middens appear to support subsistence practices focused on plant processing and commonly on mussel consumption (Lintz 2008:127; Peter and Harrison 2011:272). 119 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

A compilation of testing and mitigation level data would need to be synthesized and analyzed for a true comparison. Two sites (i.e., 41TR170 and 41TR198) were earmarked as being similar to site 41DN612 (Lintz 2008; Peter and Harrison 2011). These sites resemble 41DN612 in the size, density, structure, and variability of thermal features. The similarity ends there though, as both sites exhibit a much more diverse array of artifacts, including lithic tools. In fact, during the literature review no other sites were identified consisting solely of a large multi-use burned rock midden with no other cultural materials. Though, it should be noted that many sites had relatively small lithic assemblages. This literature review was not meant to be intensive, but instead was conducted to bolster the discussion on burned rock middens in the Trinity River Basin. Lintz (2008) conducted a similar, and more intensive, review of the distribution of thermal features in the Trinity and Brazos River basins. He points out that a regional synthesis of thermal features is lacking and found similar issues during his review in identifying such sites due to inconsistencies in language and the scarcity of detailed reporting. Overall, the Trinity River basin would benefit from such a study. It would not only strengthen our understanding of the region but allow for comparisons to neighboring regions such as the Brazos River basin and Central Texas. Conclusions The data recovery investigations at the Hardeman Midden site sought to address environmental, technological, and adaptive changes throughout the Transitional Archaic. The overall artifact recovery at the site was low and mostly consisted of flora and faunal remains; however, feature recovery was high. Some disturbances (i.e., historic refuse pit) were noted within the upper deposits of the site; however, this only impacted a portion of the Feature A deposits. The late Transitional Archaic component contained intact, well-preserved archeological deposits containing preserved flora and faunal material and numerous cooking features. The early Transitional Archaic occupation was more difficult to characterize, due to the limited quantities of artifacts and presence of only a single cultural feature. Despite these limitations, the data recovered from the cultural components show diachronic shifts between the technological and foraging strategies from the early to late Transitional Archaic. The early Transitional Archaic appears to be a period of relatively low occupational intensity and the faunal assemblages indicate groups had a broad diet breadth exploiting locally available resources such as deer, 121 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

small game, turtle, birds, and freshwater mussel shell. Fracturing and fragmentation of the faunal remains suggests butchering and intensive processing (e.g., marrow extraction) was occurring at the site during this period. The late Transitional Archaic groups were continuing to exploit locally available resources; however, these groups had more substantial occupational debris, including several isolated burned rock features and a large earth oven cooking facility. The earlier groups appear to have had intermittent or brief occupations of the site area based on the presence of limited, single-use cooking features. In contrast, the later groups appear to have had more intensive and/or repetitive occupations. These groups were exploiting locally available floral resources for both fuel and food sources and some intensive processing of plant materials appears to have occurred at the site based on the presence of plant bulb remnants and an earth oven facility. No lithic tools or debitage were recovered from the site and no bone or shell tools were identified in the assemblage. This is very unusual and intriguing, as distinct cut marks were observed on several of the faunal remains (i.e., bone and shell). One explanation, which corelates with Tinsley and Dayton’s (2011:181) hypothesis, is that this site was used solely for specific hunting/foraging activities and food processing, while habitation and other activities (e.g., tool production) was occurring elsewhere as lithic raw materials are rare in the region. Recommendations In concurrence with the previous survey recommendations, the Hardeman Midden site is considered eligible for designation as an SAL and for the NRHP. The early and late Transitional Archaic components revealed intact, well-preserved archeological deposits that significantly contributed to our understanding of Transitional Archaic patterns. These investigations mitigated the project-specific effects, not the entire site. Any future project that could impact deeper deposits (i.e., deeper than 5 feet), or those beyond the current ROW, warrant further consideration to assess the possibilities for additional contributing components. With these considerations, no further work is recommended. 122 NRHP Mitigation at 41DN612, The Hardeman Midden Site, Denton County, Texas

February 03, 2020 Mrs. Mercedes Cody SWCA Environmental Consultants 4407 Monterey Oaks Blvd Austin, TX 78749 United States RE: Radiocarbon Dating Results Dear Mrs. Cody, Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for 17 samples recently sent to us. As usual, the method of analysis is listed on the report with the results and calibration data is provided where applicable. The Conventional Radiocarbon Ages have all been corrected for total fractionation effects and where applicable, calibration was performed using 2013 calibration databases (cited on the graph pages). The web directory containing the table of results and PDF download also contains pictures, a cvs spreadsheet download option and a quality assurance report containing expected vs. measured values for 3-5 working standards analyzed simultaneously with your samples. Reported results are accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 standards and all chemistry was performed here in our laboratory and counted in our own accelerators here. Since Beta is not a teaching laboratory, only graduates trained to strict protocols of the ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 program participated in the analyses. As always Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per the conventions of the 1977 International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce sigmas lower than +/- 30 years, a conservative +/- 30 BP is cited for the result. The reported d13C values were measured separately in an IRMS (isotope ratio mass spectrometer). They are NOT the AMS d13C which would include fractionation effects from natural, chemistry and AMS induced sources. When interpreting the results, please consider any communications you may have had with us regarding the samples. Thank you for prepaying the analyses. As always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, Ronald E. Hatfield President Page 1 of 35

REPORT OF RADIOCARBON DATING ANALYSES Mercedes Cody Report Date: February 03, 2020 SWCA Environmental Consultants Material Received: January 17, 2020 Conventional Radiocarbon Age (BP) or Percent Modern Carbon (pMC) & Stable Isotopes Laboratory Number Sample Code Number Calendar Calibrated Results: 95.4 % Probability High Probability Density Range Method (HPD) Beta - 550627 SWCA52105.01_41DN612_S-14 1300 +/- 30 BP IRMS δ13C: -24.5 o/oo (95.4%) 660 - 770 cal AD (1290 - 1180 cal BP) Submitter Material: Charcoal Pretreatment: (charred material) acid/alkali/acid Analyzed Material: Charred material Analysis Service: AMS-Standard delivery Percent Modern Carbon: 85.06 +/- 0.32 pMC Fraction Modern Carbon: 0.8506 +/- 0.0032 D14C: -149.42 +/- 3.18 o/oo ∆14C: -156.59 +/- 3.18 o/oo (1950:2020) Measured Radiocarbon Age: (without d13C correction): 1290 +/- 30 BP Calibration: BetaCal3.21: HPD method: INTCAL13 Results are ISO/IEC-17025:2005 accredited. No sub-contracting or student labor was used in the analyses. All work was done at Beta in 4 in-house NEC accelerator mass spectrometers and 4 Thermo IRMSs. The "Conventional Radiocarbon Age" was calculated using the Libby half -life (5568 years), is corrected for total isotopic fraction and was used for calendar calibration where applicable. The Age is rounded to the nearest 10 years and is reported as radiocarbon years before present (BP), “present" = AD 1950. Results greater than the modern reference are reported as percent modern carbon (pMC). The modern reference standard was 95% the 14C signature of NIST SRM-4990C (oxalic acid). Quoted errors are 1 sigma counting statistics. Calculated sigmas less than 30 BP on the Conventional Radiocarbon Age are conservatively rounded up to 30. d13C values are on the material itself (not the AMS d13C). d13C and d15N values are relative to VPDB-1. References for calendar calibrations are cited at the bottom of calibration graph pages. Page 2 of 35

No sub-contracting or student labor was used in the analyses. All work was done at Beta in 4 in-house NEC accelerator mass spectrometers and 4 Thermo IRMSs. The "Conventional Radiocarbon Age" was calculated using the Libby half -life (5568 years), is corrected for total isotopic fraction and was used for calendar calibration where applicable. The Age is rounded to the nearest 10 years and is reported as radiocarbon years before present (BP), “present" = AD 1950. Results greater than the modern reference are reported as percent modern carbon (pMC). The modern reference standard was 95% the 14C signature of NIST SRM-4990C (oxalic acid). Quoted errors are 1 sigma counting statistics. Calculated sigmas less than 30 BP on the Conventional Radiocarbon Age are conservatively rounded up to 30. d13C values are on the material itself (not the AMS d13C). d13C and d15N values are relative to VPDB-1. References for calendar calibrations are cited at the bottom of calibration graph pages. Page 3 of 35

No sub-contracting or student labor was used in the analyses. All work was done at Beta in 4 in-house NEC accelerator mass spectrometers and 4 Thermo IRMSs. The "Conventional Radiocarbon Age" was calculated using the Libby half -life (5568 years), is corrected for total isotopic fraction and was used for calendar calibration where applicable. The Age is rounded to the nearest 10 years and is reported as radiocarbon years before present (BP), “present" = AD 1950. Results greater than the modern reference are reported as percent modern carbon (pMC). The modern reference standard was 95% the 14C signature of NIST SRM-4990C (oxalic acid). Quoted errors are 1 sigma counting statistics. Calculated sigmas less than 30 BP on the Conventional Radiocarbon Age are conservatively rounded up to 30. d13C values are on the material itself (not the AMS d13C). d13C and d15N values are relative to VPDB-1. References for calendar calibrations are cited at the bottom of calibration graph pages. Page 13 of 35

Quality Assurance Report This report provides the results of reference materials used to validate radiocarbon analyses prior to reporting. Known-value reference materials were analyzed quasi-simultaneously with the unknowns. Results are reported as expected values vs measured values. Reported values are calculated relative to NIST SRM-4990B and corrected for isotopic fractionation. Results are reported using the direct analytical measure percent modern carbon (pMC) with one relative standard deviation. Agreement between expected and measured values is taken as being within 2 sigma agreement (error x 2) to account for total laboratory error. Report Date: February 03, 2020 Submitter: Dr. Steven Carothers QA MEASUREMENTS Reference 1 Expected Value: 0.447 +/- 0.04 pMC Measured Value: 0.45 +/- 0.03 pMC Agreement: Accepted Reference 2 Expected Value: 129.41 +/- 0.06 pMC Measured Value: 129.41 +/- 0.35 pMC Agreement: Accepted Reference 3 Expected Value: 96.69 +/- 0.50 pMC Measured Value: 97.16 +/- 0.28 pMC Agreement: Accepted COMMENT: All measurements passed acceptance tests.

February 19, 2020 Mrs. Mercedes Cody SWCA Environmental Consultants 4407 Monterey Oaks Blvd Austin, TX 78749 United States RE: Radiocarbon Dating Results Dear Mrs. Cody, Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for three samples recently sent to us. As usual, the method of analysis is listed on the report with the results and calibration data is provided where applicable. The Conventional Radiocarbon Ages have all been corrected for total fractionation effects and where applicable, calibration was performed using 2013 calibration databases (cited on the graph pages). The web directory containing the table of results and PDF download also contains pictures, a cvs spreadsheet download option and a quality assurance report containing expected vs. measured values for 3-5 working standards analyzed simultaneously with your samples. Reported results are accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 standards and all chemistry was performed here in our laboratory and counted in our own accelerators here. Since Beta is not a teaching laboratory, only graduates trained to strict protocols of the ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 program participated in the analyses. As always Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per the conventions of the 1977 International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce sigmas lower than +/- 30 years, a conservative +/- 30 BP is cited for the result. The reported d13C values were measured separately in an IRMS (isotope ratio mass spectrometer). They are NOT the AMS d13C which would include fractionation effects from natural, chemistry and AMS induced sources. When interpreting the results, please consider any communications you may have had with us regarding the samples. Our invoice has been sent separately. Thank you for your prior efforts in arranging payment. As always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, Ronald E. Hatfield President Page 1 of 7

No sub-contracting or student labor was used in the analyses. All work was done at Beta in 4 in-house NEC accelerator mass spectrometers and 4 Thermo IRMSs. The "Conventional Radiocarbon Age" was calculated using the Libby half -life (5568 years), is corrected for total isotopic fraction and was used for calendar calibration where applicable. The Age is rounded to the nearest 10 years and is reported as radiocarbon years before present (BP), “present" = AD 1950. Results greater than the modern reference are reported as percent modern carbon (pMC). The modern reference standard was 95% the 14C signature of NIST SRM-4990C (oxalic acid). Quoted errors are 1 sigma counting statistics. Calculated sigmas less than 30 BP on the Conventional Radiocarbon Age are conservatively rounded up to 30. d13C values are on the material itself (not the AMS d13C). d13C and d15N values are relative to VPDB-1. References for calendar calibrations are cited at the bottom of calibration graph pages. Page 2 of 7

Quality Assurance Report This report provides the results of reference materials used to validate radiocarbon analyses prior to reporting. Known-value reference materials were analyzed quasi-simultaneously with the unknowns. Results are reported as expected values vs measured values. Reported values are calculated relative to NIST SRM-4990B and corrected for isotopic fractionation. Results are reported using the direct analytical measure percent modern carbon (pMC) with one relative standard deviation. Agreement between expected and measured values is taken as being within 2 sigma agreement (error x 2) to account for total laboratory error.

Macrobotanical Analysis, 7/11/20, p. 2 Thirty-two carbon samples and eighteen flotation samples from the Hardeman Midden Site (41DN612) were submitted for sorting, identification, interpretation, and recommendation of materials for radiocarbon dating. The site is characterized by burned rock concentrations with bone and mussel shell. The dearth of lithic debitage and charcoal suggested to the initial investigators that the deposits they examined did not represent hearths in primary context but rather discard piles from hearths constructed and used nearby (THC Site Form 2/29/2019). Additional investigations revealed that the site is a complex burned rock midden overlain by historic-age household and structural debris (Nielsen and Carpenter 2019:3). Investigations focused on the burned rock midden that, based on geoarchaeological evidence, includes components dating from the Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods (Nielsen and Carpenter 2019:4). SITE SETTING The Hardeman Midden Site is located in southwestern Denton County, Texas between an old channel and an oxbow of Denton Creek. Denton Creek eventually flows into the Trinity River via the Elm Fork. Plants of such riparian zones tend to tolerate flooding and other disturbances better than their upland counterparts. A great many species may share the canopy in a floodplain forest, and “dominance is absent or poorly defined” (Lee 1945:163). Common trees of riparian areas in north-central Texas include elms (Ulmus spp.), hackberies (Celtis spp.), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), Shumard oak (Q. shumardii), pecan and other hickories (Carya spp.), roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii), soapberry (Sapindus saponaria), and American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) (Bezanson 2000:115). Floodplains also support useful vines such as grapes (Vitis spp.) and Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia). Plants with edible bulbs such as camas (Camassia spp.) and wild onions and garlic (Allium spp.) grow on the banks. Oxbows, sloughs, marshes, and other wetlands associated with Denton Creek would have offered plant resources such as cattail (Typha spp.) and aquatic tubers or rhizomes including arrowhead (Sagittaria spp.) and spatterdock (Nuphar lutea). Upland vegetation differs from riparian vegetation today, as it would have in the past. Denton County lies in the eastern portion of the Cross Timbers vegetation area, a belt of wooded lands between the Blackland Prairie to the east and the Fort Worth Prairie to the west. Vegetation protected from modern human impacts in the Cross Timbers today is an oak savannah of post oak and blackjack oak (Quercus stellata and Q. marilandica) with a mixed-grass understory characterized by by grasses such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparius), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), and 8-2

Macrobotanical Analysis, 7/11/20, p. 3 forbs (Bezanson 2000:115-116; Diggs et al. 1999:45-48; Gould 1962). Mean annual precipitation in Denton County during the period 1951-1980 was 33.5 inches (851 mm). Precipitation has a bimodal distribution with modest peaks in May and September. The frost-free season averages 226 days and runs from March 27 through November 8 (NFIC 1987:465-466). METHODS Radiocarbon samples were examined under a Leica S9i stereoscopic microscope at 6.1-55 X magnification. Materials were identified regardless of size or carbonization status for up to twenty-one specimens from each bag. Only three bags contained more than twenty specimens (Bags 54, 215, and 265). The additional specimens from these bags likely represent the same genus as the first twenty-one specimens. Plant parts were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Hoadley 1990; InsideWood 2004; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980; Wheeler 2011). Plant nomenclature follows the PLANTS Database (USDA, NRCS 2019). Taxon identification for wood fragments was obtained by snapping to reveal a clean transverse section. When necessary, tangential or radial sections were examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting, and other minute characteristics. After identification, specimens of each taxon were counted, labeled, recorded, and weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic balance. To retain suitability for radiocarbon dating, samples were placed on freshly washed glassware when not in specimen containers, and they were handled only with vinyl gloves and metal forceps. Contact with paper and other plant products was avoided. Flotation samples were processed at SWCA in a Flote-Tech machine (Dausman 1989, Hunter and Gassner 1998, Rossen 1999). They were sorted according to standard procedures in the Macrobotanical Analysis laboratory (Pearsall 2015). Each flotation light fraction was weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic balance before being size-sorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh. All carbonized botanical materials that did not pass through the No. 10 mesh (2 mm square openings) were sorted under a Leica S9i stereozoom microscope at 6.1-55 X, then counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Gastropods, small rocks, and uncarbonized botanical material larger than 2 mm (usually rootlets) were weighed, recorded, and labeled. Materials that fell through 8-3

Macrobotanical Analysis, 7/11/20, p. 4 the 2 mm mesh were examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 6.1-55 X magnification for carbonized botanical remains that had not been previously identified in the 2 mm size fraction. Identifiable botanical materials were removed from residue, counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized macrobotanical remains other than rootlets (seeds, nut hull, and semi-carbonized wood) were recorded on a presence/absence basis on laboratory forms. Wood charcoal identification was attempted for up to twenty specimens larger than 2 mm from each flotation sample. Only one of the samples from 41DN612 yielded twenty wood charcoal specimens larger than 2 mm (Bag 257). For the remaining samples, all specimens larger than 2 mm were identified, and identification was attempted for progressively smaller fragments until either twenty fragments were identified or identification became impractical. Wood charcoal fragments were snapped to reveal a transverse section and examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 6.1-55 X magnification. When necessary, tangential or radial sections were examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting, and other characteristics. Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; InsideWood 2004; Martin and Barkley 1961; Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980; Wheeler 2011). Plant nomenclature follows that of the PLANTS Database (USDA, NCRS 2019). RESULTS Radiocarbon material Identifications of material for possible radiocarbon dating are given in Table B.1. Fragments of a camas bulb were identified in Bag 112 (Figure B.2). The remainder of the material consisted of wood charcoal and soil. A fragment of slippery elm wood charcoal (Ulmus rubra) from Bag 215 is shown in Figure B.3. Some wood charcoal fragments were incompletely carbonized, usually partly or completely very dark brown rather than black in color. Bag 2 consisted of a wood fragment that was completely burned on one side and unburned on the other. Incompletely carbonized material may be associated with historic or modern activity in the site area, especially in samples from shallow depth. Incomplete carbonization is noted in Table B.1. 8-4

Macrobotanical Analysis, 7/11/20, p. 5 Flotation samples Uncarbonized plant materials other than rootlets are shown on a presence/absence basis in Table B.2. Archaeological plant materials recovered are given in Tables B.3 and B.4 by count and weight respectively. All flotation samples had an original soil volume of 3.0 liters. Uncarbonized and semi-carbonized (historic or modern) plant remains. Most uncarbonized plant parts in the samples appear in the form of rootlets that are clearly related to the modern vegetation at the site. Uncarbonized seeds (Table B.1) are a common occurrence on most archaeological sites, and they usually represent seeds of modern plants that have made their way into the soil either through their own dispersal mechanisms or by faunalturbation, floralturbation, or argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51-52; Keepax 1977; Miksicek 1987:231-232). In all except the driest areas of North America, uncarbonized plant material on open-air sites can be assumed to be of modern origin unless compelling evidence suggests otherwise (Lopinot and Brussell 1982; Miksicek 1987:231). The seeds, leaves, and fruits at 41DN612 consist of grasses, weedy annuals, and pecan family nut hulls that appear to relate to the current vegetation. Semi-carbonized remains are also interpreted as historic or modern here. They consist of semi-carbonized wood found in Levels 1 and 2 of Units 1 and 2 and a fragment of nut hull found in the north wall of BHT A (Feature 2). The antiquity of a fully carbonized fragment of nut hull from this same context is therefore sufficiently doubtful that it is reported here with the historic and modern remains (Table B.1) rather than the ancient remains (Tables B.2 and B.3). The wood is of an unknown type that does not appear among the fully carbonized wood charcoal. Carbonized (ancient) plant remains. Overall density of carbonized plant remains was low (0.02 g/liter). Average density was the same for feature and non-feature contexts. Plant remains consisted of wood charcoal (0.81 g), bulb scale fragments, starchy fragments that may be bulb, tuber, or rhizome fragments, a small piece of bark, and two botanical fragments that could not be further identified. Bulbs and other geophytes. A bulb fragment identifiable as camas (Camassia spp.) was recovered from Unit 2 Level 2. (The camas fragments identified in radiocarbon samples were from Unit 1.) These may represent Atlantic camas 8-5

Macrobotanical Analysis, 7/11/20, p. 6 (Camassia scilloides) or prairie camas (C. angusta). Bulbs of the two species are similar, with the plants distinguished largely by the smaller scape height, fewer floral bracts, and earlier bloom period of Atlantic camas and the persistent flower stalks of prairie camas (G. Yatskievych 1999:503-504; K. Yatskievych 2000:297- 298). A bulb fragment identifiable as wild onion or garlic (Allium spp.) was recovered from Unit 1 Level 1. Drummond’s onion (A. drummondii) and meadow garlic (A. canadense) are the two most common species in the area today, but prairie onion (A. stellatum) and plains onion (A. perdulce) are also present (Kartesz 2015). Archaeologists have documented a long history of bulb exploitation in Texas, with camas bulbs at the Wilson-Leonard Site currently the oldest known, dating to approximately 8,000 years before present (Acuña 2006:57; Mehalchick et al. 2004:Table 8.18). The use of earth oven facilities to transform otherwise inedible geophytes into nutritionally optimal starches and sugars seems to be part of a continent-wide trend that began in the early Holocene (Thoms 2008; Wandschnider 1997). In addition to camas and wild onion, edible bulbs available in Denton County today include crow poison (Nothoscordum bivalve) and fawnlilies (Erythronium spp.) (Ogden 1991). It is not clear whether prairie celestials (Nemastylis geminiflora) or the rain lilies (Zephyranthes spp. [syn. Cooperia spp.] and Habranthus tubispathus) are edible. Death camas (Zigadenus nuttallii, syn. Toxicoscordion nuttallii) is emphatically not edible. Indeterminable starchy fragments found in seven sample may also represent bulbs, but the possibility of tubers, rhizomes, or even large, starchy seeds cannot be rule out. Edible tubers currently recorded for Denton County include Indian breadroot (Pediomelum hypogaeum), greenbrier (Smilax spp.), and groundnut (Apios americana) and the aquatic tubers of arrowhead and rhizomes of spatterdock (Kartesz 2015). The range of sunchoke (Helianthus tuberosus) may also have extended as far south as Denton County at times in the past. Wood charcoal. In keeping with the riparian nature of the site area, many types of wood were present in the samples. Identification was attempted for 148 wood charcoal fragments. Due to the small size of most fragments, only 101 could be identified to genus or species. Oaks (Quercus spp.; n=42) were the most numerous, making up 42% of the identified assemblage. Oak specimens that could be identified below the genus level were all white group oak (Quercus sect. Quercus; Figure B.4). Mulberry was the next most common wood (n=16; Figure B.5), followed by viburnum (Viburnum spp.; n=12), American beautyberry (n=13), and hickory/pecan (n=10). Plum/cherry (Prunus spp.), ash, juniper (Juniperus 8-6

Macrobotanical Analysis, 7/11/20, p. 7 spp.), and American elm (Ulmus americana) were represented by one or two specimens each. Wood charcoal is interpreted as fuel for hearths, ovens, or other cooking features. The common white group oak of the area, bur oak, has excellent coaling qualities and a specific gravity of 0.64 (Alden 1995:101). In general, the heat value of a wood is directly related to its specific gravity (Marcouiller and Anderson n.d.). Coaling properties, which are especially important in earth oven cooking, relate to the third stage of the burning process. After evaporation of within-cell moisture (first stage), wood is converted to charcoal (second stage, signified by flames). In the third stage, the glowing coals burn slowly, without flame, and can be left for hours without attention (Collier and Turner 1981, Marcouiller and Anderson n.d.). Mulberry has a specific gravity of 0.66 and produces excellent coals but has a reputation for throwing sparks (Kuhns and Schmidt 1998). Other woods recovered in the samples would also have been useful in fires. For example, softwoods such as juniper tend to ignite more easily than hardwoods (Collier and Turner 1981). Shrubs such as viburnum and beautyberry may have provided small-diameter woods that were also relatively easy to ignite. Chronology. Radiocarbon dates for the Hardeman Midden can be roughly assigned to two periods: the fifth through mid-eighth centuries of the common era, and the last three centuries prior to the common era. The earlier dates come from Feature 6 and the lower levels of Units 1 and 3 (Levels 7 and 9). Feature 5 falls in the later group of dates, at cal. A.D. 428-599 (Beta 550632). Material from Feature 2 has not yet been dated. Of the contexts where dates are available, carbonized bulb scale fragments are present only the younger deposits. Possibly, the earlier earth ovens were used to cook meat and items other than plant foods. Alternatively, later cooking events differentially destroyed the earlier bulb scale fragments, which are less common and more delicate than wood charcoal. SUMMARY Archaeological plant remains at Site 41DN612 were sparse (0.02 g/liter) and consisted primarily of wood charcoal and bulb scale fragments. Twenty-one bulb scale fragments, including some identifiable as camas and wild onion, were recovered from feature and unit level contexts. Thirteen types of wood charcoal were identified in the carbon and flotation samples. Wood is interpreted as fuel wood, probably associated with earth oven cooking of bulbs and other plant material. 8-7
