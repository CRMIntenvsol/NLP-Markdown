Acknowledgments

This project has been a gratifying publication to work on (since 1994, when it got
under way), and I want to thank all the authors for committing their time and re-
sources to see it come to fruition. D. Gentry Steele and the publication, market-
ing, and editorial staff at Texas A&M University Press have greatly supported the
project from the very beginning of our discussions, and they have also assisted me
at each turn. Maureen Creamer Bemko did an excellent job of copyediting the
draft manuscript. The revisions to the lengthy book manuscript were aided by
comments by two anonymous peer reviewers, although I remain responsible for
any omissions or errors.

I am particularly grateful for the support of the executive committee and the
board of directors of the Texas Archeological Society and for their permission to
use materials in this book from the 1995 Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society
copyrighted to the society. Furthermore, I appreciate the efforts of many of the
authors in either revising and signiﬁcantly updating their papers, or in the case of
the papers by Myles Miller and Nancy Kenmotsu; C. Britt Bousman, Barry Baker,
and Anne Kerr; and Robert L. Brooks, I am grateful for their hard work in prepar-
ing new papers speciﬁcally for the book. Robert A. Ricklis also contributed a new
chapter for the book with little urging on my part.

An Introduction to Texas Prehistoric Archeology

Timothy K. Perttula

Our understanding of the prehistoric
archeology of Texas has come a long way
since the ﬁrst true synthesis of Texas
archeology, E. B. Sayles’s An Archaeologi-
cal Survey of Texas (1935). About twenty
years later, Dee Ann Suhm (now Story),
Alex D. Krieger, and Edward B. Jelks
published the now classic “An Introduc-
tory Handbook of Texas Archeology” in
volume 25 of theBulletin of the Texas Arche-
ological Society (1954). That 552-page
handbook presented the then-current
knowledge of the archeology of Texas as
well as an illustrated compendium of the
known pottery and projectile point types
in the state (the latter compendium was
republished separately by the Texas Arche-
ological Society and the Texas Memorial
Museum in Suhm and Jelks 1962). The
book was very well received by the pro-
fessional and avocational archeological
communities in Texas and surrounding
states, but it has been out of print for
many years.

Since that time, a truly phenomenal
number of archeological investigations
have occurred in Texas—by both avoca-
tional and professional archeologists alike
from one end of the state to the other—
and the pace of archeological work has
quickened, especially since the mid-1970s
and early 1980s. This increase in the
number of archeological investigations
across the state of Texas has greatly de-
pended on the passage of a host of federal
laws (principally the National Historic

Preservation Act of 1966, as amended;
see Hutt et al. 1999) and state regulations
(the 1969 Antiquities Code of Texas, as
amended) concerning historic preserva-
tion and the conduct of archeological
studies when development projects will
have an impact on important sites.

It is fair to state that more archeologi-
cal investigations have been completed in
the last two decades of the twentieth cen-
tury in Texas than in the seventy-ﬁve
years before then. During this time, a
host of new equipment (particularly the
personal computer and software), analyti-
cal techniques, and methods have come
to the fore (see Hester et al. 1997) that
have assisted archeologists in learning
more about the Native American peoples
that lived in Texas. New equipment and
methods include the use of accelerator
mass spectrometry for precise dating of
organic materials, global positioning sys-
tems for mapping sites, aerial photogra-
phy from satellite imagery, geographic in-
formation system analyses of different
layers of spatial information, and new
means of chemical and physical analyses
of ceramics, organic residues (including
blood), and plant and animal remains.
Archeological theories and hypotheses
have come and gone, here in Texas as
elsewhere, from culture history to the
processual approach of the “new archeol-
ogy,” to post-processualism, as well as a
diverse array of other schools of thought
that seek to explain the nature of the

5

archeological record (see M. Johnson
1999 and Trigger 1989 for cogent sum-
maries of archeological ideas). The arche-
ological record (i.e., the artifacts, sedi-
ments, structural remains, and other bits
and pieces that are found on an archeo-
logical site) in Texas is massive and con-
tinues to provide ample opportunities to
study the human past.

The Internet and the World Wide Web

have also provided unparalleled means,
unimagined even a few years ago, for
communication and data sharing between
archeologists and people interested in
archeology in the United States, as well
as across the world (see Hodder 1999).
These innovations, and future ones we
cannot even begin to conceive of, prom-
ise to expand our knowledge of the rich
archeological legacy in Texas left by the
Native American peoples that lived there
for millennia (Hester 1998). Finally, an-
other important trend in Texas is that
archeologists and Native Americans are
working together to share ideas and infor-
mation (see Bruseth et al. 2000; Thoms
1999).

Archeological overview volumes com-
missioned by the U.S. Army Corps of En-
gineers, Southwest Division (COE-SWD),
do provide a reasonably good sense of the
scope of the current archeological data
base in Texas (with more than ﬁfty-four
thousand sites recorded to date, and the
number continues to climb) and sur-
rounding states, the types of investigations

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

01-A2946  4/13/04  11:44 AM  Page 6

conducted across the state of Texas, and
the kinds of research problems and ques-
tions that have been, and continue to
be, the subject of inquiry (Hester et al.
1989b; Hofman 1996; Hofman et al.
1989b; Jeter et al. 1989; Sabo et al. 1988;
Simmons et al. 1989; Story et al. 1990).
While these volumes are extremely valu-
able research documents, they are not
broadly accessible to all those interested
in the prehistoric archeology of Texas.
Nor are the many hundreds, if not thou-
sands, of cultural resource management
technical documents of surveys and exca-
vations prepared by contract archeologi-
cal ﬁrms for clients, permit applicants,
regulatory agencies, and other govern-
ment consumers; few copies are pro-
duced, few see the light of day other than
to reside on a shelf in government agency
ofﬁces, and few are seemingly written to
be read by more than the jargon-bound
professional archeologists and cultural re-
source managers (Fagan 1995; McMana-
mon 2000; see also commentaries in
Black 1995a and Bruseth and Perttula
1995, 1–2, about Texas archeology).
Nevertheless, truly exciting and interest-
ing archeological research is being con-
ducted in this sometimes bleak forum,
in Texas, North America, and in other
countries (see, e.g., McManamon and
Hatton 2000), and innovative ways must
be found to share this knowledge with
the public and the interested avocational
archeologist, as well as the professional
archeological community.

The Texas Archeological Society

(TAS), established in 1929 and now com-
posed of more than fourteen hundred
dedicated amateur or avocational and
professional archeologists, has contrib-
uted more than its fair share over the
years to the stock of archeological knowl-
edge in the state of Texas by conducting
annual ﬁeld schools across the state since
the ﬁrst ﬁeld school in 1962 at the Gil-
bert site (41RA13) in Rains County (see
Richmond et al. 1985). The results of
these many ﬁeld school investigations
have been regularly published in the so-
ciety’s journal, the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society or BTAS (see Mueg-
genborg 1994; J. Smith 1993; Turpin
and Davis 1993; Houk and Lohse 1993;
J. Wright et al. 1997; Corbin and Hart
1998; Few 1999; Rinker et al. 1999; and
Walter 1999 for recent publications of

6 / TEXAS PREHISTORY

the results of TAS ﬁeld schools). The TAS
also has helped sponsor regional ﬁeld
schools held by afﬁliated avocational
archeological societies in Texas (such as
the South Texas Archaeological Associa-
tion’s annual September ﬁeld school).

Foremost, though, among the impor-
tant roles of the TAS in communicating
the results of archeological research to
those interested in the prehistory and
early history of Texas has been the compi-
lation and publication of nearly seventy
years’ worth of archeological research in
Texas that documents human life in the
state (Perttula 1994b). In particular, from
time to time, the BTAS has taken stock of
our understanding of the archeology of
particular parts of Texas by publishing in
a single volume a number of important
articles that focus on one of the prehis-
toric cultural regions of Texas. Since 1958,
the BTAS has published papers summa-
rizing the archeology of various regions
of Texas: east Texas, central Texas, Trans-
Pecos Texas, and the central and southern
parts of the Gulf Coast; the southern
Texas coast; the Lower Pecos and eastern
Trans-Pecos; Texas Panhandle and South-
ern Plains; north-central Texas; and north-
eastern Texas (see Perttula 1995c, 8).

In 1995, the time seemed propitious
to again take stock of our current knowl-
edge of Texas archeology. Thus, the 1995
BTAS provided a summary collection
of papers on the archeology of many
different cultural and natural regions
of Texas—from the Caddo mounds of
northeastern Texas, the Archaic and Late
Prehistoric shell middens of the Gulf
Coast, the burned rock middens of cen-
tral Texas, the slab houses of Plains farm-
ers and bison hunters, to the Puebloan
villages of the Hueco Bolson and the Rio
Grande. The success of the 1995 BTAS,
the support of the TAS board of directors
in presenting the most current archeolog-
ical ﬁndings to a broad audience, and the
resulting new interest generated in the
prehistoric archeology of Texas led di-
rectly to the preparation of this book.
We had several goals in mind as we
set about compiling this volume on pre-
historic archeology of Texas—a big job
for a big state. Our primary goal is to re-
cord and communicate, in one accessible
source, what has been learned (and what
we still do not know) about all aspects
of Texas archeology from about 1950 to

2000. Second, recognizing the constantly
evolving understanding of the prehistoric
archeology of Texas as new sites are found
and explored and new ideas are proposed,
evaluated, challenged, reﬁned, and ex-
plored again, we view the book as a rare
opportunity for professional archeologists
working in Texas to take stock of what we
know (or think we know) in a compre-
hensive way and to attempt to synthesize
the very diverse character of the archeo-
logical record in Texas. In taking a broad
and synthetic view of the prehistoric
archeology of the state of Texas, our ef-
forts are a long overdue follow-up to
Sayles’s 1935 work, the classic 1954 BTAS
(Suhm et al. 1954), and other syntheses,
and we hope that the reader will ﬁnd the
present book to be a suitable accompani-
ment to those volumes.

Organization of the Volume

Following this introductory chapter,
the remaining chapters in this volume are
summaries of the current state of archeo-
logical knowledge in different cultural-
ecological regions of Texas (Fig. 1.1). The
regions are broadly deﬁned, following the
divisions recognized in the COE-SWD
overviews, physiographic zones, and bi-
otic communities (see D. E. Brown et al.
1998, ﬁg. 5 and table 4), and there are
inevitable overlaps in coverage and
presentation.

There is probably no area in North
America that is as environmentally di-
verse as Texas (Figs. 1.2 and 1.3). Within
its arbitrary boundaries are warm temper-
ate forests and woodlands, swamps and
riparian forests, and deciduous and ever-
green forests in the eastern and southeast-
ern reaches of the state; Gulf coastal
grasslands and wetlands; plains or cold
temperate grasslands in the High Plains
and in the prairies of north Texas; unique
canyonland habitats in the Edwards Pla-
teau and Llano Estacado; Chihuahuan
or warm temperate and semidesert grass-
lands along the border and the Trans-
Pecos; warm temperate desert lands with
scrub and chaparral in far south Texas;
and Tamaulipan thornscrub and semide-
ciduous forests and woodlands in south
Texas and the lower Rio Grande valley
(see Blair 1950; Diamond et al. 1987;
D. E. Brown et al. 1998). Even with sub-
stantial changes in paleoenvironmental

conditions over the last twelve thousand
years or more, from the Late Pleistocene
(ending about ten thousand years ago) to
the modern Holocene period (ten thou-
sand years ago to the present), these habi-
tats supported a plethora of wild plants
and animals that, with knowlege, skill,
and ingenuity, could be and were ex-
ploited by generations of Native Ameri-
can groups.

Consequently, it is no surprise that the
prehistoric archeology of Texas is incredi-
bly diverse. Because of this manifest di-
versity over a long span of human history
in North America, Native American
adaptations are quite varied from one bi-
otic community to another in the state,

and the chapters in this volume deal di-
rectly with the distinctive but changing
character of Native American life in the
prairies and plains, the Edwards Plateau,
the canyonlands and High Plains, the
coastal lands, the inhospitable and climat-
ically challenging deserts and mountain
basins of west Texas, and the well-watered
prairies, woodlands, and pineywoods of
eastern and northern Texas (see Fig. 1.2).
The temporal framework employed in

this book is quite straightforward and
matches the terminology and age ranges
found in other treatments of the archeol-
ogy of much of the southern, central, and
southwestern parts of North America
(Bell 1984b; Bense 1994; Cordell 1997;

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

Mainfort and Jeter 1999; O’Brien and
Wood 1998; Sassaman and Anderson
1996; Wood 1998). The prehistoric
archeology of Texas began at least 11,500
years before the present (b.p. meaning, by
convention, a.d. 1950) (Table 1.1), in the
Early Paleoindian period.1 Depending
upon the region and the archeologist, the
Paleoindian period ended between 8,000
and 9,000 b.p. across Texas and was suc-
ceeded by the Archaic period, with Early,
Middle, and Late temporal subdivisions.
Although a time of considerable diversity
in lifeways, material culture, and behav-
ior, the Archaic periods had mobile groups
across the state all characterized by a gen-
eralized hunting-foraging economy. The
Archaic periods ended between 2,000 and
1,000 years ago, and they are followed by
Late Prehistoric cultures. In some areas,
such as the High Plains, the upper Texas
Coast, east Texas, and east-central Texas,
archeologists also have deﬁned Ceramic
and/or Woodland periods that lasted
from ca. 2,000 to 1,200 years ago (see
Table 1.1). One of the more notable
archeological characteristics of this period
of time in these areas is the adoption of
pottery by these particular aboriginal
groups, and these groups also seem to
have become more sedentary than other
hunter-gatherer populations in Texas.
The Late Prehistoric period began be-
tween ca. 1,200 and 1,000 years ago and
lasted until ca. 250 years ago in Texas (see
Table 1.1), when Spanish and French
colonists, traders, and missionaries began
to settle across the area and write about
the Native Americans living in what was
to become Texas. Other than the fact that
these Late Prehistoric groups all made ar-
row points and generally used and made a
variety of ceramic wares, this period was
really a time of much diversity in the way
of life of aboriginal populations (i.e., from
mound-building Caddo farmers to bison-
hunting nomads on the High Plains).
The Late Prehistoric groups that inhab-
ited Texas can often be readily associated
with more modern Native American
groups—such as the Caddos, Wichitas,
and the Karankawas—but in other re-
gions of the state, matching the archeo-
logical record with ethnic afﬁliations is
quite a challenge (see M. Collins 1999,
table 1).

As the reader will note in the chapters

INTRODUCTION TO TEXAS PREHISTORIC ARCHEOLOGY / 9

Table 1.1. Chronological Charts for Archeological Regions in Texas

that follow, most of the Native Americans
that lived in Texas during prehistoric
times lived by hunting and collecting
plant and animal foods, and the archeo-
logical record across much of the state
provides abundant evidence for the differ-
ent kinds and ranges of camping activities
of many related and unrelated bands of
hunters and gatherers. In east Texas, the
prehistoric Caddo Indians were successful
farmers who came to depend upon the
cultivation of maize, beans, and squash to
support their complex and well-organized

societies, and they continued to live in
Texas until 1859, when they were re-
moved to Oklahoma (see F. Smith 1995,
1996). Other farming groups lived in the
western Trans-Pecos and the Panhandle,
but by a.d. 1450, these Native Americans
had either left those regions and/or
changed their lifeways and become more
nomadic hunters and gatherers again.
Who these people were is not known
with any conﬁdence; Myles R. Miller and
Nancy A. Kenmotsu (chapter 7) and
Robert L. Brooks (chapter 11) consider

these issues in detail. Similarly, the ethnic
and cultural afﬁliations of many of the
prehistoric hunting and gathering groups
that lived in Texas are debatable. The
small size of most of these groups, their
nomadic nature, the effects of introduced
European diseases and increased mortal-
ity after the mid-sixteenth to seventeenth
centuries throughout North America (for
mortality in Texas see Ewers 1973), and
the absence of direct European observa-
tions and writings leave us in many cases
with little more than the name of a group

and a geographic location. In spite of
these difﬁculties, in many regions archeo-
logical and historical research has estab-
lished some linkages between the prehis-
toric archeological record of tribes such as
the Caddos, the Wichitas and afﬁliated
groups, the Karankawas, the Querechos
and Teyas of the Southern Plains, the Ju-
manos, and the Mansos and Sumas in the
western Trans-Pecos. The Tonkawas, long
thought to have been prehistoric residents
of Texas (see Newcomb 1961), are now
known to have migrated into the state in
the late seventeenth century and coalesced
with Native American groups that moved
north from their original locations in
northern Mexico (see summaries in New-
comb 1993 and Prikryl 2001). Where

tions of the prehistoric archeological rec-
ord in several regions of Texas, chapters
in this book will explore these archeologi-
cal, ethnic, and cultural relationships.

However, we begin ﬁrst with a lengthy
chapter that concerns the earliest inhabi-
tants of Texas, the Paleoindians. These
highly mobile groups lived in Texas more
than 9,000 years ago, and perhaps as long
as 11,500 to 12,000 years ago (see Table
1.1). Understanding the lifeways of these
ancient hunter-gatherers is truly a conti-
nental challenge, as our interest is not
only in how and when these peoples from
the Old World initially colonized and
settled all of North America (see, for ex-
ample, Anderson and Gillam 2000) but
also in the character of their adaptations
once they settled in different regions
within present-day Texas and bordering
states. With the recent and compelling
evidence for the settlement of the Monte
Verde site in South America by at least
12,500 years ago (see Dillehay 1997)
and the controversial discovery and study
of 9,000-year-old human remains from
the Kennewick site in Washington state
(Chatters 2000; R. Taylor et al. 1998;
D. Thomas 2000), the study of the Paleo-
indian archeology of North and South
America is currently a very exciting and
rapidly changing ﬁeld.

Chapter 2, by C. Britt Bousman,
Barry W. Baker, and Anne C. Kerr, dem-
onstrates that Texas has a substantial
post–twelve thousand-year-old Paleo-
indian archeological record, with at least
456 known archeological components
widely distributed across the state

Paleoindian sites in the state has been
ongoing since the early 1920s at famous
archeological sites such as Lubbock Lake,
Midland, Plainview, Bonﬁre Shelter,

with a host of others discussed in chapter
2. The authors’ exhaustive summary in-
cludes a reclassiﬁcation of all known
Paleoindian lanceolate and stemmed pro-
jectile point forms found in Texas, in
combination with a review of the geologi-
cal stratigraphy and chronology of the
better-known sites, to establish with some
conﬁdence the absolute chronology of
Clovis, Folsom-Midland, Plainview, Early
Stemmed, San Patrice and Scottsbluff,
Golondrina-Barber, and Angostura-
Thrall occupations. Bousman, Baker, and
Kerr also review the record of Paleoindian
subsistence from plant and animal re-
mains, as well as dental studies from
Paleoindian burials, and they highlight
the complexity of subsistence adaptations

by Paleoindian groups, which in most
cases do not differ greatly from the adap-
tations of early Holocene Archaic hunters
and gatherers across the state.

In parts II, III, IV, V, and VI of the
volume, the chapters present detailed in-
formation on the archeology of the differ-
ent regions recognized across Texas (see
Fig. 1.1). Michael B. Collins (chapter 3)
and Thomas R. Hester (chapter 4) dis-
cuss current knowledge of the prehistoric
Paleoindian, Archaic (Fig. 1.5), and Late
Prehistoric hunter-gatherers (and signiﬁ-
cant bison hunting at particular intervals
in the prehistoric past) of the central and
south Texas prairies and plains. Collins’s
chapter also considers the implications of
the Monte Verde ﬁndings for uncovering
evidence of pre-Clovis habitation (that is,
predating ca. 12,500 years ago) in central
Texas.

of the extensive and expansive research
and cultural resource management efforts
at Fort Bliss and the La Junta district.
Miller and Kenmotsu synthesize an im-
pressive and well-dated (more than four
thousand chronometric dates) archeologi-
cal data base and emphasize the identiﬁ-
cation and understanding of long-term
changes and trends in settlement mobility
and settlement character, landscape use,
and subsistence economies, as well as dis-
parate technologies of material culture
and feature use from both eastern and
western Trans-Pecos contexts. In a com-
pelling summary, Miller and Kenmotsu
note signiﬁcant periods of innovation and
change throughout the prehistory of the
Trans-Pecos, particularly in the western
Trans-Pecos with the adoption of culti-
gens by ca. 1500 –1000 b.c. and the evi-
dence for semisedentary settlements by
ca. 2500 b.c., while eastern Trans-Pecos
groups (with the notable exception of the
La Junta district groups) never used culti-
gens and maintained a mobile foraging
lifestyle throughout the prehistoric era.
The pace of change in the western Trans-
Pecos accelerated in the Formative period
(ca. a.d. 200 –1450) (see Table 1.1), and
there is substantial archeological evidence
during the period for changes in architec-
tural form, site structure, subsistence,
technologies (e.g., thermal and storage
features, groundstone tools, ceramics,
chipped stone, and water control fea-
tures), and regional settlement patterns
and land use. These changes culminate in
the establishment after ca. a.d. 1250 of
agriculturally dependent Puebloan com-
munities of the Jornada Mogollon in the
western Trans-Pecos and the La Junta dis-
trict of the eastern Trans-Pecos (Figs. 1.7.
and 1.8). After a.d. 1450, the western
Trans-Pecos is virtually abandoned by
Puebloan groups, while a diverse array of
agricultural and hunting-gathering com-
munities lived at La Junta until well after
Spanish contact.

In chapter 8, Turpin documents a long

record of hunter-gatherer adaptations to
changing environmental conditions in
the Lower Pecos, a distinct cultural region
within the Chihuahuan desert of western
Texas and northern Mexico. The region is
best known for its dry rockshelters and
spectacular rock art paintings and petro-
glyphs (dating after approximately forty-
one hundred years ago; see discussions of

toric Native Americans along the Texas
coast. In each of these regions, there was
a continuous occupation by hunter-gath-
erers who relied on a rich and diverse ar-
ray of plants and animals from prairie,
plains, and coastal habitats; there is no
evidence for agriculture or horticultural
pursuits. The archeological record is char-
acterized by technological changes in
hunting and plant food processing and,
along the Texas coast, the development of
intensive ﬁshing and shellﬁsh collecting
during the Late Archaic, Early Ceramic
(Fig. 1.6), and Late Prehistoric periods.

ern Trans-Pecos), and Boyd discusses
archeological evidence in settlements,
burials, features (including pithouses and
storage pits), material culture, and subsis-
tence remains to place the archeology of
the Palo Duro Culture in regional and
temporal contexts.

In chapter 11, Robert L. Brooks syn-
thesizes the social, economic, and politi-
cal lifeways of the Antelope Creek phase
(ca. a.d. 1200 –1450/1500) as seen in the
archeological record of their distinctive
stone slab and adobe mortar structures
and village communities. Probably an in-
digenous development of Native Ameri-
can groups living on the High Plains of
Texas, Oklahoma, and adjoining states
(see Fig. 1.7), these peoples had a Plains
Village lifestyle based on the hunting of
bison, the cultivation of corn, beans, and
squash, and a simple technology of ce-
ramic cooking pots, stone scraping tools
and projectile points for the hunting and
processing of bison and bison products
(meat and hides), and bone tools for cul-
tivation activities and other domestic pur-
suits. They may have borrowed their ar-
chitectural styles from Puebloan groups,
and they also appear to have intensively
interacted and traded with them, if the
quantities of New Mexico obsidian and
Puebloan ceramics are any indication.
Mysteriously, about a.d. 1450/1500, the
Antelope Creek phase peoples abandoned
the High Plains, and Brooks considers ex-
planations for where they may have gone
as well as what factors may have contrib-
uted to their disappearance.

The prehistoric archeology of the Post
Oak Savanna, parts of the Blackland Prai-
rie, and the Pineywoods of east-central,
east, and north Texas are discussed in
chapters by Ross C. Fields (chapter 12)
and Timothy K. Perttula (chapter 13).
Fields’s chapter focuses on key archeo-
logical research areas in the Sulphur,
Navasota, and Trinity River basins (see
Fig. 1.1) to demonstrate long-term trends
in Native American occupational histo-
ries, technologies, subsistence strategies,
site function, use intensity, and sociocul-
tural interaction. In particular, he docu-
ments an increasing aboriginal use of the
region over the last two thousand years,
principally by hunter-gatherers who inter-
acted with groups in central Texas and in
northeastern Texas (particularly with the
Caddos after ca. a.d. 900) (see Fig. 1.7),

1996, 1998a, 1998b), particularly the
Pecos River style (see Fig. 1.5). However,
the archeological record preserved in shel-
ter and open camp site deposits, wood
and plant artifacts, burials, stone tools,
and other material culture well demon-
strate a basic continuity in lifeways marked
by intensiﬁcation in ritual through much
of the prehistoric settlement and use of
the Lower Pecos region.

In part V, three chapters review differ-
ent aspects of the prehistoric archeology
of the High Plains and canyonlands of
western Texas. In chapter 9, Eileen John-
son and Vance T. Holliday consider the
long sweep of prehistory in the High
Plains, focusing on the adaptations and
cultural adjustments of Native American
peoples to changing paleoenvironmental

conditions. Their review of the arche-
ology suggests that the High Plains re-
gion was occupied by mobile grasslands
hunter-gatherers who relied on bison and
a wide range of other plants and animals.
Douglas K. Boyd focuses in chapter 10
on the distinctive archeological record in
the Caprock Canyonlands, a unique envi-
ronmental habitat on the High Plains (see
also D. Boyd et al. 1997a). Speciﬁcally,
he reviews new and current archeological
understanding of the Palo Duro Culture
(ca. a.d. 500 –1100/1200) centered in
the canyonlands (see Fig. 1.6). This pre-
historic Native American culture repre-
sents a semisedentary group of hunters
and gatherers that may have had afﬁlia-
tions with Jornada Mogollon groups in
the American Southwest (eastern and
southeastern New Mexico and the west-

as well as signiﬁcant intraregional vari-
ability (on east-west and north-south tan-
gents) in the character of their adapta-
tions. In east and north Texas, similar
adaptational trends in settlement, subsis-
tence, and material culture are apparent
in archeological sites dating before ca.
a.d. 900 that had been occupied by
hunter-gatherers for millennia (for north
Texas, see Hofman et al. 1989b; Drass
1998), but Perttula’s chapter deals in the
main with the sophisticated and complex
prehistoric archeological record of the
Caddo peoples that lived there until the
mid-nineteenth century (see Fig. 1.7).

The prehistoric Caddos were a seden-
tary horticultural group that lived in dis-
persed communities, villages, hamlets,
and farmsteads, and they maintained a re-
ligious and political elite that lived on
ﬂat-topped earthen mounds and were in-
terred in accompanying burial mounds.
These elites interacted widely with their
neighbors to obtain exotic goods that
symbolized and solidiﬁed their chieﬂy au-
thority in their communities. Of particu-
lar interest in chapter 13 is a summary of
the archeology of the Late Caddoan com-
munities that lived in east Texas at the
time of initial European contact, most
notably the well-known Titus phase
(ca. a.d. 1450 –1680) Caddo groups (see
Fig. 1.7) that De Soto encountered in the
early 1540s but who had abandoned much
of the Big Cypress Bayou and Sabine River
basins by the mid- to late seventeenth
century. The Titus phase archeological
record provides a detailed accounting of
the lives of Caddo peoples immediately
before and after the entry of Europeans
into the east Texas Pineywoods.

The archeology of north Texas ranges
from the spectacular stratiﬁed Aubrey site
with Clovis-era deposits (see Fig. 1.4) to

14 / TEXAS PREHISTORY

the distinctive Late Prehistoric Southern
Plains Village archeological record (dating
from ca. a.d. 700 –1600) (see Fig. 1.7
and Drass 1998). There is a great need
for a regional synthesis of the archeologi-
cal record in this area, and the available
archeological evidence suggests there are
differences and continuities in adaptation
and technological character between Na-
tive American groups on the middle Bra-
zos, the upper and middle Trinity River
basins, and the upper reaches of the Red
River (see Drass 1998; Hofman et al.
1989b). These differences and continu-
ities can be seen in the features, subsis-
tence remains (including the use of bison
and the adoption of maize), projectile
points and ceramic styles, and the use of
different raw materials, particularly high-
quality lithics, preserved in the archeo-
logical record. Due to an unfortunate set
of circumstances, none of the archeolo-
gists working in Texas who have expertise
in the prehistory of northern Texas were
able to contribute to this volume. The
reader is referred to Drass (1998) for a re-
cent and masterful synthesis of the arche-
ology of Plains Village peoples on the
Southern Plains of northern Texas, Okla-
homa, and southern Kansas.

The chapters, for the most part, are

broadly cultural-historical in nature.
Nevertheless, they stay strongly focused
on important and current research prob-
lems recognized in each of the environ-
mentally based regions that hold par-
ticular promise for achieving a better
understanding of prehistoric (from at
least 12,000 to 12,500 years ago to before
ca. a.d. 1520) and early historic (before
ca. a.d. 1700) Native American adapta-
tions in Texas. Of course, the emphases
of the different chapters vary depending
upon the state of archeological knowledge

in a particular region of the state—rang-
ing from the discussion of one or a few to
many particular research problems and
perspectives, temporal periods, and cul-
tural manifestations—and our current
understanding of long- and short-term
cultural change across the state. Thus, the
various chapters in The Prehistory of Texas
present both careful but exhaustive con-
siderations of the Texas archeological (and
paleoenvironmental) record, while offer-
ing new, vital, and innovative means of
understanding the past.

for the oldest radiocarbon dates. Using the most
current calibrations (Stuiver et al. 1998) as an
example, the onset of the Early Paleoindian pe-
riod would have taken place about 13,500 cali-
brated years ago, with the Late Paleoindian
period beginning about 11,500 years ago and
lasting until ca. 10,000 years ago. In turn,
Early Archaic sites would fall into the 10,000 –
8,000 b.p. interval, and the Middle Archaic into
the 8,000 – 6,000 b.p. interval. J. S. Girard has
noted that “although sequences used for eastern
and central Texas tend to be later [than in the
southeastern United States] . . . archaeologists in
Texas do not routinely calibrate radiocarbon
dates. With calibrations, subdivisions of the Ar-
chaic [see Table 1.1] . . . would be similar [to the
southeastern United States]” (Girard 2000, 8).

Paleoindian Archeology in Texas

C. Britt Bousman, Barry W. Baker, and Anne C. Kerr

The following sentences are excerpts from
the ﬁrst scientiﬁc article about Paleo-
indian archeology in Texas:

Good, dependable[,] deﬁnite evidence
of human artifacts in the Pleistocene in
America has at last been found. Many
geologists and investigators have been
expecting such evidence to be turned
up. . . . In the present instance, fortu-
nately, the evidence is so dependable that
no reasonable doubt can exist that the
artifacts and fossil animals found are
contemporaneous, and that the animals
and artifacts are in original, undisturbed
Pleistocene deposits. . . . The location of
these ﬁnds is a point near the Colorado
River, near the southeastern end of the
Staked Plains, and near the little town of
Colorado, Texas, on Lone Wolf Creek.
(Cook 1925, 459 – 60)

Lone Wolf Creek (Fig. 2.1) was exca-
vated by members of the Colorado (now
Denver) Museum of Natural History in
1924, and they found the articulated re-
mains of a very large bison, now believed
to be Bison antiquus, in direct association
with three lanceolate projectile points.
Based on the size of the bison and the
depth of the remains, Harold Cook, an
honorary curator of paleontology, inferred
that they dated to the Late Pleistocene.
The 1925 article by Cook was published
six months before he and Jesse D. Figgins,
the museum director, made their ﬁrst

visit to the now-famous Folsom site in
New Mexico (Cook 1927; Figgins 1927).
Cook wrote a second, more persuasive
and conﬁdent article on the discoveries at
Lone Wolf Creek the same summer that
the initial Folsom excavations took place.
Clearly written with the Folsom discover-
ies in mind, the 1926 article, entitled
“The Antiquity of Man in America: Who
Were the First Americans? Whence Came
They?” is a rebuttal to a piece written by
Ales Hrdlicka only a few months prior in
the same journal, Scientiﬁc American. At
the time, Hrdlicka was a towering ﬁgure
in American anthropology. He strongly
advocated a model of recent immigration
of Native Americans to the New World
and refuted claims for a Pleistocene pas-
sage. In his second article, Cook, relying
on geological and paleontological meth-
ods, precisely and deftly refuted Hrdlicka’s
arguments regarding the antiquity of Na-
tive Americans. Hrdlicka (1907, 1918,
1926) believed that he could rely solely
on the lack of evidence for morphological
change reﬂected in Native American
skeletal remains. This debate occurred be-
fore the Folsom site had been accepted as
a Pleistocene-era occupation. In addition,
even though the signiﬁcance of Lone
Wolf Creek was not fully accepted by
North American archeologists until its
evidence was published a third time along
with the Folsom discoveries (Cook 1927;
Figgins 1927), it is clear from reading the
earlier articles that Cook unquestionably

15

believed Lone Wolf Creek provided the
necessary evidence to demonstrate the
presence of Native Americans during the
Pleistocene of North America (Cook
1925, 1926). Thus, this Texas site pro-
vided some of the earliest scientiﬁcally
valid evidence for the Paleoindian occu-
pation in North America.

The research that followed at Paleo-
indian sites in the 1930s and 1940s wit-
nessed remarkable discoveries in the
Southern Plains. Other pioneers of Paleo-
indian archeology in Texas include indi-
viduals such as Cyrus Ray, E. B. Sayles,
Erwin Barbour and Bertrand Schultz, and
especially Elias B. Sellards, Glen Evans,
and Grayson Meade. In 1934, Sellards
and Evans (with the Texas Memorial
Museum at the University of Texas in
Austin) excavated a site in a small playa,
near Miami in Roberts County, that con-
tained long ﬂuted projectile points and
mammoth bones (Sellards 1938). This
excavation was the ﬁrst of a Clovis site in
the state and the ﬁrst excavation by the
Sellards and Evans team.

Much later, after excavations at Mi-

ami, Buckner Ranch (also known as
Berclair Terrace), Plainview, Lubbock
Lake, and Midland in Texas, and Black-
water Draw and Milnesand in New Mex-
ico, Sellards established the “classic” se-
quence of Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, and
later (Plano) Paleoindian cultures (Sellards
1952; see also Sellards and Evans 1960).
They thought this sequence applied to

the entire Southern Plains and all of cen-
tral North America. The persistent re-
liance on this basic sequence can still be
seen in the recent prehistoric overviews
for the Southern Plains, south Texas, and
east Texas by Stephen L. Black (1989a,
1989b), Jack L. Hofman (1989), and Dee
Ann Story (1990). However, cracks are
starting to show as Hofman reviewed the
recognized complexes from a critical per-
spective and pointed out weaknesses and
unsolved problems in the data (Hofman
1989). Story chose to exclude Plainview
as an overused and meaningless label and
emphasized Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San
Patrice, and Scottsbluff as more easily
identiﬁable and therefore more reliable
categories for the Gulf Coast Plain region
of Texas (Story 1990, 177).

Now, almost seventy-ﬁve years after
the excavation at Lone Wolf Creek, the
existence of North American Paleoindians
is not in doubt, but the record of the early
occupations of Texas by Native Ameri-
cans still contains many gaps. Today we
know that local sequences in the southern
prairies, plains, and woodlands show evi-
dence of small-scale developments with
limited distributions, and the monolithic

sequence of Paleoindian cultures proposed
by Sellards and Evans is too simple. Fur-
thermore, it is widely believed that Paleo-
indian societies were thinly distributed on
the landscape and, especially in the Pleis-
tocene, that these societies formed small
groups that occupied larger areas and
moved frequently. Even with a number of
newer detailed studies (Bamforth 1988;
M. Collins 1998b; Hofman 1994; Holli-
day 1997a; E. Johnson 1987c; L. Johnson
1989), we are still debating the nature and
structure of Paleoindian societies. This
chapter provides a brief summary and our
interpretation of this fragmentary record,
but only new, carefully designed and im-
plemented archeological research will
bridge the gaps and complete our knowl-
edge. Much remains to be done.

Typological Analysis of
Lanceolate and Stemmed
Projectile Points and the
Development of Paleoindian
Culture History

The term Paleoindian has different
meanings to different archeologists. Ac-
cording to some, the term is restricted to

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

Pleistocene peoples whose subsistence
base included the exploitation of extinct
megafauna such as mammoth, bison (Bi-
son antiquus), camel, and horse (Fiedel
1994). This point of view places Early
Holocene peoples in the Early Archaic
period. Other scholars refer to Pleistocene
peoples within the period of ca. 12,000 –
10,000 b.p. as Early Paleoindian, and Late
Paleoindian refers to those societies mak-
ing lanceolate projectile points during the
Early Holocene period of ca. 10,000 –
8,000 b.p. (E. Turner and Hester 1993).
We adopt the latter usage, but this choice
is not without difﬁculties, as we will dis-
cuss below.

The classiﬁcation of projectile points
remains one of the more dominant con-
cerns of Paleoindian archeologists in
Texas. While its importance should not
be overstated, it is clear that the entire
cultural-historical framework of Paleo-
indian archeology is highly dependent
on projectile point classiﬁcations. When
projectile points are absent from a site,
even with reliable radiocarbon dates the
depth and breadth of the conclusions we
can draw from such a site are limited.
Thus, the constructs presented in this
chapter, and Paleoindian archeology as
a whole, are intimately linked with ty-
pology. Given this context, it is instruc-
tive to review the history of how archeol-
ogists initially deﬁned these points and
how these deﬁnitions have changed
through time.

Folsom and Clovis

Certainly, the most distinct Paleo-
indian lanceolate projectile points are
those with ﬂutes (the negative scars of
elongated ﬂakes driven from the base on
both faces). The ﬁrst ﬂuted points docu-
mented in good stratigraphic contexts
were found at the Folsom site in New
Mexico. At this site, during excavation
seasons in 1926, 1927, and 1928, Jesse D.
Figgins (1927) and Harold Cook (1927)
discovered nineteen extremely well ﬂaked,
ﬂuted points in direct association with
an extinct form of bison. Later, similar
points were found at other sites in Texas,
such as Lipscomb (Fig. 2.2).

At ﬁrst, after the Folsom site was widely

accepted as evidence for Pleistocene-age
Native Americans, many archeologists did
not distinguish between the various kinds
of ﬂuted projectile points. In 1933 when
Edgar B. Howard (1935) began excavat-

02-A2946  4/13/04  11:46 AM  Page 17

PALEOINDIAN ARCHEOLOGY IN TEXAS / 17

ing at the Clovis site in Blackwater Draw,
he and John Cotter (1937, 1938) saw
signiﬁcant differences between what they
termed “generalized Folsom” or “Folsom-
like” as distinguished from “true Folsom”
points. Similar “Folsom-like” points were
found at Dent, Colorado, in 1932 and at
Miami, Texas, in 1934 (Fig. 2.3). By Sep-
tember, 1941, at a symposium held at
Santa Fe, New Mexico, it was agreed that
generalized Folsom would be called Clo-
vis Fluted and true Folsom would be
termed Folsom Fluted (E. Howard 1943;
Krieger 1947a). The major difference be-
tween Clovis Fluted and Folsom Fluted
was the longer ﬂutes, ﬁner ﬂaking, and
thinner cross sections in Folsom Fluted
points. It was also recognized that eastern
forms similar to Clovis existed and these
were called Ohio Fluted. The relative
temporal positions of Clovis as older and
Folsom as younger were not well under-
stood until Glen Evans’s careful analysis
of the stratigraphy at Blackwater Draw
( J. Hester et al. 1972). Archeologists have
retained the distinctions between Folsom
and Clovis and between different forms
of Clovis since the mid-twentieth century.
Numerous Clovis and Folsom points have
been discovered in Texas, and they have
been recovered from excavated sites such
as Miami, Lubbock Lake, Kincaid Shel-
ter, Bonﬁre Shelter, Aubrey, Lipscomb,
and Midland.

Unﬂuted Projectile Points
and the “Yuma Problem”

Unﬂuted lanceolate projectile point
typology presents a more difﬁcult puzzle.
E. B. Renaud’s (1931, 1932, 1934) intro-
duction of Yuma as a type illustrates this
quandary. Based on surface collections
from northeastern Colorado near Yuma,
Renaud (1931) described Yuma varieties
with careful and precise attention to size,
shape, and ﬂaking morphology (Fig. 2.4).
These characteristics are the same basic
set of observations used today, but Re-
naud’s use of surface collections and his
primary reliance on morphology instead
of context prematurely led to a series
of named types. Furthermore, Renaud
(1932, 10) thought that Yuma forms
preceded and were coeval with Folsom
forms, although Figgins (1935) and Rob-
erts (1940) suggested that Yuma points
were manufactured after the production
of Folsom projectile points had been
discontinued.

Fig. 2.4. Renaud’s typology of Yuma and Folsom projectile points.

Even at this early stage, it was realized
that the Yuma typological concept failed
to provide insights. And so, through a
formal declaration at the 1941 Santa Fe
symposium (E. Howard 1943) and later
arguments offered by Hannah M. Wor-
mington (1948), “Yuma” was abandoned
in favor of more distinctive type names
such as Eden, Scottsbluff, and Oblique
Yuma. Wormington had the ﬁnal word
(1957, 103 –107) when she argued that
Yuma types were ﬂawed because of the
large degree of morphological variability
among the types and subtypes and be-
cause of Renaud’s failure to incorporate
contextual and chronological informa-
tion. Today the Yuma term is completely
abandoned, and other names are used to
reﬂect the variability that was represented
under the term.

Plainview, Golondrina, and Barber

In 1947 Alex Krieger described the
unﬂuted, parallel-ﬂaked, lanceolate pro-
jectile points from the Plainview site.
He called them Plainview and established
the concept on a detailed consideration
of morphology and context (Krieger
1947b). In doing so Krieger was one of
the ﬁrst to break ranks with the estab-
lished approach of calling all unﬂuted
projectile points Yuma. The Plainview
site, excavated in 1945, was interpreted as
a single-event bison kill with up to one
hundred killed or butchered bison (see
description below). Krieger (1947b, 938 –
52) described the points as being parallel-
sided and having concave bases with
rounded corners, grinding from base to
midpoint or slightly beyond, and two
forms of ﬂaking: irregular ﬂaking over

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

convex surfaces and collateral ﬂaking of
near equal size meeting at a medial ridge
(Fig. 2.5). Krieger amassed an impressive,
at least for the time, set of quantitative
data regarding metric dimensions, and
he compared his results with those from
other sites. It is clear that Krieger did not
ﬁnd the Yuma concept useful, and he ob-
viously thought that the limited amount
of variation he observed among the Plain-
view projectile points provided strong
evidence that this form was restricted in
time and space.

By 1954, with the publication of An
Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology
by Dee Ann Suhm et al., the acceptable
variation for the Plainview type had
stretched well beyond the original deﬁni-
tion. The size, ﬂaking pattern, and shape
of Plainview points had all been greatly
expanded, and the type deﬁnition began
to be applied indiscriminately. This trend
began to be reversed a decade later with
the introduction of Plainview Golondrina
(golondrina being Spanish for swallow) as
a variant of the Plainview type by LeRoy
Johnson (1964) to distinguish projectile
points he excavated from the Devil’s
Mouth site in the Lower Pecos region
(Fig. 2.6). Johnson used the genus-species
concept as a way to highlight the similari-
ties and differences between Golondrina
and Plainview points. By 1977, however,
the genus-species approach had been
dropped, and only the term Golondrina
was being used to represent these un-
ﬂuted lanceolate projectile points with
distinctive ﬂared basal corners, deep basal
concavities, crescent-shaped basal thin-
ning scars, and more random ﬂaking pat-
terns (Hester 1977b).

In the early 1970s, both Joe Ben Wheat
(1972) and Cynthia Irwin-Williams et al.
(1973) had expressed serious concerns
regarding the use of the term Plainview.
It had become a label for any unﬂuted
lanceolate projectile point with parallel
sides and a concave base. Apparently, the
original tightly deﬁned Plainview type
had been transformed into a loosely de-
ﬁned, carelessly applied term reminiscent
of the Yuma concept.

In 1982, Tom Kelly published the ﬁrst

of his quantitative analyses of unﬂuted
lanceolate points. He was concerned
with the distinction between Plainview
(from the type site) and Golondrina
(from Devil’s Mouth), and he used factor

analysis and discriminant analysis to de-
velop a consistent and objective proce-
dure for determining the differences be-
tween these two types. Kelly selected
mostly basal attributes for measurement
and developed various indices to deter-
mine the typological identity of unﬂuted
lanceolate projectile points. Kelly con-
cluded (1982) that Plainview and Golon-
drina are distinct types. In addition, al-
though he did not indicate why speciﬁc
attributes were chosen, his discussion of
hafting differences indicates that these at-
tributes were useful characteristics of dif-
ferent hafting styles.

Based on the geometry of the different
point styles, Kelly (1982, 16) agreed with
W. James Judge (1973) and Ruthann
Knudson (1973, 1983) that Plainview
points were probably hafted in a bison rib
socket on a foreshaft and used primarily
as a projectile tip (Fig. 2.7). Alternatively,
he suggested that Golondrina points were
hafted on split-stem hafts with or without
foreshafts and used as both projectile
points and butchering knives. Kelly fur-
ther argued that the nature of these haft-
ing styles would require Plainview points
to be deeply set into a socketed haft and
bound with little cutting edge exposed,

while Golondrina points in a split-stem
haft would not need to be deeply set and
thus could expose more of the cutting
edge while still hafted (Kelly 1982, 17).
Kelly also reported on replication ex-
periments using Golondrina and Plain-
view points manufactured by J. B. Soll-
berger (Kelly 1982). In these experiments
a Golondrina point in a split-stem haft
easily withstood strong lateral pressures
that would be incurred during butcher-
ing, while the haft of the Plainview point
broke at weaker pressures. Kelly went on
to suggest that Plainview points were de-
signed as deeply penetrating projectile

tips for killing large animals such as bi-
son, while the basal ﬂaring of Golondrina
points would “resist penetration” of large
animals and thus were probably used for
killing medium-sized animals such as deer
or antelope and for butchering (1982, 17).
Marvin Kay’s use-wear analysis of Golon-
drina points from the Wilson-Leonard site
(1998) further supports Kelly’s hypothesis
that Golondrina points were used as both
projectiles and knives. Similar use-wear
analysis on a sufﬁcient sample of Plainview
points has yet to be done at this writing.
In a later paper, Kelly applied similar

quantitative techniques to the Brom
Cooper collection from McMullen
County, Texas, and identiﬁed a possible
variant of Plainview that was shorter and

narrower. Kelly informally called these
“Miniature Plainview” points (1983a, 28)
but recognized that he lacked good con-
textual information to distinguish these
points as a formal type.

In a third paper based on material
from the Byron Barber collection from
Gillespie County and from lanceolate
points excavated by the Texas Depart-
ment of Transportation (TxDOT) at
the Wilson-Leonard site in Williamson
County, Kelly’s quantitative analysis
(1983b) prompted him to identify a new
type that he called Barber. These are very
wide lanceolate points with slightly con-
tracting sides and very deep basal concav-
ities. Kelly (1983a, 21) noted the strati-
graphic position of Barber points below

Angostura points at Wilson-Leonard and
St. Mary’s Hall. Kelly (1983b) also sug-
gested that Barber points were hafted in
a nocked split-stem haft (Fig. 2.8). The
base of the deep concavity on Barber
points would ﬁt on this curved nock. In
sum, Kelly achieved most of the objec-
tives identiﬁed by Krieger (1944) in suc-
cessfully isolating a projectile point “type,”
that is, points with a distinctive morphol-
ogy that are restricted in space and time,
as well as supplementing the deﬁnition
with functional explication of distinctive
morphology.

Midland

Midland projectile points have also re-
ceived a considerable amount of attention

ity 1 at the Midland site (after Wendorf et al.

(Fig. 2.9). After excavations at the Mid-
land site (Scharbauer Ranch), Fred Wen-
dorf and Alex Krieger ﬁrst described this
type as unﬂuted Folsom points (Wendorf
et al. 1955). In 1959 they formally de-
scribed and provisionally named these
points Midland (Wendorf and Krieger
1959).

Midland points are often found in as-

sociation with Folsom points, and they
share some technological and morpholog-
ical attributes. Unﬂuted Folsom projectile
points are common in Folsom sites, and
it is not certain that these signiﬁcantly
differ from Midland points. But a few
sites have produced only Midland points,
leading to a hypothesis about an indepen-
dent Midland Complex that was contem-
porary with Folsom and shared some
characteristics in technology and lifestyle
(Blaine 1968; Irwin 1971). Wormington
(1957, 42) and Wendorf and Krieger
(1959, 67) suggest that Midland points
were too thin for ﬂuting because their
blanks were too thin at the beginning.
Martinez (1990) argues that Folsom and
Midland points from the Scharbauer
Ranch site (Midland) were probably
thicker than most Folsom points before
ﬂuting, and Hofman et al. (1990, 243 –
44) present evidence from Shifting Sands
that Midland points were thick enough
for ﬂuting. Thus, the “too thin to ﬂute”
hypothesis does not seem to be supported.
Analyses by Amick (1995), Hofman

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

22 / TEXAS PREHISTORY

(1991a, 1992), and Hofman et al. (1990)
have suggested that Midland and Folsom
projectile points are part of one techno-
logical system used by highly mobile spe-
cialized bison hunters. According to this
hypothesis, Midland points may have
been made at times when it was necessary
to conserve lithic raw material. In the
Southern Plains, where high-quality raw
materials are rare and restricted to only a
few sources, Folsom/Midland hunter-
gatherers tended not to make ﬂuted points
when their access to acceptable raw mate-
rial was limited. Because of the great skill
necessary for ﬂuting, the risk of manufac-
turing failures for Folsom points was
likely too high when there was no easy
access to fresh raw material (Amick 1995,
30 –31). Anthony Boldurian proposes
that Folsom groups, moving through the
Southern Plains, curated large bifaces in
order to extend access to acceptable mate-
rials for point manufacture at great dis-
tances from quarry sources (Boldurian
1991, 293 –94).

New research on Goshen-Plainview
technology has further complicated the
Midland point typology (Bradley and Fri-
son 1996; Frison et al. 1996). This work
indicates that Goshen-Plainview technol-
ogy shares some attributes with Folsom
technology, and in the Hell Gap assem-
blage it is difﬁcult to distinguish Midland
from Goshen-Plainview points. The re-
searchers suggest that the relationships
between Plainview, Midland, and un-
ﬂuted Folsom points need to be resolved
with more typological, stratigraphic, and
chronological study, particularly in the
Southern Plains. In light of these ﬁndings,
it is interesting to note the presence of a
large, very thin biface, usually considered
part of a Folsom tool kit (Boldurian
1991; Stanford and Broilo 1981), in the
Plainview point–dominated Ryan’s site
cache (Hartwell 1995, 172).

Angostura

Another example of a typological co-
nundrum is offered by Angostura points.
Jack Hughes (1949) brieﬂy described
lanceolate projectile points that he called
Long points, which had been excavated at
the Ray Long site in South Dakota at the
planned Angostura Reservoir. Richard
Wheeler (1954), during further excava-
tions at the same site, renamed these
points Angostura. In the same year, Suhm

et al. (1954) published a description based
on specimens from Texas. Wormington
supported the new name for points from
the Ray Long site (1957, 138 – 40) and it
was generally accepted, but she added to
the confusion by illustrating a point from
a site other than Ray Long (Greiser 1985).
Herbert Alexander’s excavations at
Levi Rock Shelter (1962, 1963, 1974,
1982) suggested that similar points
should be called Plainview-Angostura and
that a single group was responsible for
producing both forms. Birmingham and
Hester (1976) proposed the name Victo-
ria Angostura for a large, broad-bladed,
strongly constricted stemmed point from
the coastal plains of Texas. With his quan-
titative approach, Kelly distinguished
three variants of Angostura points—
Texas Angostura, Victoria Angostura,
and Zella Angostura—and suggested that
all were forms within the general range
(Kelly 1983a). It was not until the mid-
1990s that a formal description was pub-
lished on the original Angostura points,
which were distinguished on the basis of
a diagonal ﬂaking pattern and not on
shape and size (Wheeler 1995). Thoms
(1994) assessed the “Angostura” problem
and presented new evidence from the
Richard Beene site indicating that Angos-
tura points occurred near the end of the
Paleoindian period. Alternatively, Elton
Prewitt (1981) placed Angostura within
the Early Archaic period, based on his ex-
cavations at the Loeve site in Williamson
County.

Reclassiﬁcation of Selected
Lanceolate Points

As a response to the typological prob-
lems that have grown up around unﬂuted
Paleoindian projectile points, a recent
and comprehensive effort to classify these
points in Texas systematically was under-
taken during the TARL Wilson-Leonard
project (Dial et al. 1998; Kerr and Dial
1998). This analysis incorporated a larger
set of attributes partially derived from
Kelly’s original list (1982), considered a
much larger sample (182 points from
ﬁfteen sites) that included many of the
original points from many of the type
sites, and used different statistical proce-
dures (cluster analysis, discriminant
analysis, and analysis of variance). Lance-
olate points from Plainview, Wilson-

cupations that took place between 8800
and 8100 b.p. Levi Rock Shelter is poorly
dated, and the Tombstone Bluff speci-
mens are from a surface context. The cur-
rent evidence on stratigraphy, chronology,
or technology for Angostura cannot dis-
tinguish temporal or functional signiﬁ-
cance for the morphological variations
reﬂected by clusters 1–5. Therefore, this
wide range of variation has to be accepted
for now as part of the Angostura type
deﬁnition.

Lubbock

Also present in clusters 3 –5 are three
previously named Lubbock points from
Lubbock Lake (Holliday and Johnson
1990, ﬁg. 8; Knudson et al. 1998) and a
previously classiﬁed Plainview point from
Bonﬁre Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain
1968, ﬁg. 14d, specimen no. 392). These
four points share a similar contracting
stem morphology with Angostura but
differ from Angostura in ﬂaking pattern
and age. Specimen no. 392 is from Bone
Bed 2, Component C, at Bonﬁre Shelter
(Fig. 2.12) and is from the same unit as
the radiocarbon dates ranging between
10,230 and 9920 b.p. (see below). The
Lubbock points from Lubbock Lake are
associated with a radiocarbon age of 9950
! 120 b.p. Thus, these points from Lub-
bock Lake and Bonﬁre Shelter appear to
date to a similar interval (approximately
10,300 to 9900 b.p.) and are not contem-
porary with the Angostura points from
the Wilson-Leonard or Richard Beene
sites. Although there are only four speci-
mens in the sample, they present a com-
pelling pattern. But more specimens in
good stratigraphic and chronological con-
text would add better support for its type
status.

Thrall

The points within clusters 6 and 9
(Fig. 2.13) are easily distinguished from
the other contracting stem groups by very
thick stems and are predominantly from
Wilson-Leonard, with one specimen from
the Wiley Williams site. These points oc-
cur above Angostura specimens in Early
Archaic contexts at Wilson-Leonard
(Unit IIIa). Due to their distinctive mor-
phology and stratigraphic position, they
have been named Thrall. Thrall points
show some morphological similarity to
Victoria forms identiﬁed in Birmingham

Fig. 2.10. Metric attributes used in quantitative analysis of unﬂuted lanceolate points.

Leonard, Ryan’s site, Beidleman Ranch,
Bonﬁre Shelter, Lubbock Lake, St. Mary’s
Hall, Levi Rock Shelter, Milnesand (New
Mexico), Winkler-1 site, Sloan (Arkansas
Dalton), Devil’s Mouth, Baker Cave,
Tombstone Bluff, and Wiley Williams
were used in this analysis.

The variables used included ﬁve mea-

surements taken from the base or stem
segment of a lanceolate point and three
ratios developed from those measure-
ments to provide an indication of point
geometry at a standardized but approxi-
mate position of the haft (Fig. 2.10). Al-
though other measurements were taken,
the decision was made that the basal vari-
ables would provide the most dependable
measures of the original manufactured
point morphology. This decision was
based on the assumptions that the basal
variables would be less affected by dam-
age or resharpening than other measure-
ments that could be taken on the medial
or distal portions of points and that the
base of a point reﬂects differences in haft-
ing strategies, like a footprint reﬂects a
foot.

The results of this analysis are striking.
The cluster analysis identiﬁed twenty-one
clusters, and only four individual lanceo-
late points were left unclassiﬁed as out-
liers. Discriminant analysis suggested that
these clusters were coherent, and the
analysis of variance procedure determined
which attributes offered the greatest diag-
nostic potential. Two broad morphologi-

cal categories of lanceolate forms were
identiﬁed: contracting stem and parallel
stem forms. To assess the typological sta-
tus of the morphological clusters the
stratigraphic and chronological afﬁliations
of the individual clusters were also exam-
ined. This examination led to the conclu-
sion that several of the individual clusters
could be combined to form groups that
in some cases reached the level of types.
As new stratigraphic and chronological
evidence comes forth, the status of these
groups can be reviewed and revised, but
for the present, this analysis is the least
subjective classiﬁcation of unﬂuted lance-
olate points. A summary of this analysis
brings a fresh outlook to Paleoindian pro-
jectile point typology.

Contracting Stem Points

From among the nine contracting
stem clusters, groups of clusters form
three types that appear to have cultural
historical signiﬁcance and two morpho-
logical groups that require further study.

Angostura

Clusters 1 through 5 are dominated by

contracting stem specimens previously
classiﬁed as Angostura (Fig. 2.11). These
points are characterized by relatively nar-
row blades with moderately thick con-
tracting stems. Bases vary from slightly
convex to slightly concave. The speci-
mens from Wilson-Leonard are all be-
lieved to have been discarded during oc-

Victoria and Zella forms, but comparable
morphological data are not available to
conﬁrm this. Alternatively, Thrall may be
a central Texas variant, while Victoria and
Zella are found in coastal or near-coastal
sites, but the temporal positions of Victo-
ria and Zella forms are unknown.

26 / TEXAS PREHISTORY

Midland

Clusters 7 and 8 include specimens
previously identiﬁed as Midland and Mil-
nesand points. These points are distin-
guished by very thin stems and slight con-
tracting stem shapes (Fig. 2.14). These
two clusters are dominated by Midland
specimens from the Winkler-1 site. In
addition, although there are slight differ-
ences in stem thickness, stem width, and
ﬂake patterning with the three Milnesand
points, the results here are not compelling
enough to support ﬁrm type deﬁnitions
for either the Midland or Milnesand
forms. In light of recent concerns men-
tioned by Frison and others (1996), new
analyses (including a more well-rounded
Midland/unﬂuted Folsom/Plainview
sample) employing specimens associated
with better chronological control may of-
fer more resolution on the typology of
these points.

Parallel Stem Points

The parallel stem specimens are sub-

divided into two general classes: those
specimens with shallow-to-moderate basal

concavities and those with deep basal
concavities. From the six clusters of paral-
lel stem points with shallow-to-moderate
basal concavities, three types that appear
to have sufﬁcient cultural historical
signiﬁcance were identiﬁed; one morpho-
logical group needs more study.

Plainview

Clusters 12 –14 are dominated by

points from the Plainview site (see
Fig. 2.5), Beidleman Ranch, Ryan’s Site,
and Bonﬁre Shelter (Fig. 2.15) and were
previously typed as Plainview. The re-
maining points are from the Milnesand
site and were known as Milnesand; from
Wilson-Leonard, there is one point origi-
nally typed as Midland (M. Collins
1998a). These points, all reclassiﬁed as
Plainview, are characterized by parallel
stems that are thinner than those on the
other points with moderate basal concavi-
ties; also, they have very well controlled
ﬂaking patterns. The variation in stem
widths is all that is reﬂected by the three
clusters, and this variation does not ap-
pear to have cultural-historical signiﬁ-

cance. This analysis narrowly deﬁnes
Plainview points morphologically and
thus clears away some of the typological
confusion that has cluttered the type in
the past. But as will be discussed in detail
below, the temporal position of Plainview
in the Southern Plains has been difﬁcult
to pin down. If the older dates, such as
the 10,940 b.p. age from the Plainview
site and the ca. 11,000 b.p. assays from
Wilson-Leonard hold up, then the age of
Plainview in the Southern Plains com-
pares well with the age of Goshen-Plain-
view in the Northern Plains (Frison et al.
1996).

St. Mary’s Hall

The specimens in clusters 10 and 11
are characterized by thicker stems than on
other points, with moderately deep basal
concavities (Fig. 2.16). These points are
from the St. Mary’s Hall site (Hester
1977b, 1978a, 1991a) in San Antonio,
Levi Rock Shelter, bone concentration 3
in FA6-11 at Lubbock Lake, and predom-
inantly from Unit II at Wilson-Leonard.
The point from Levi Rock Shelter was
previously called Plainview-Angostura,
and the points from St. Mary’s Hall and
Lubbock Lake were referred to as Plain-
view points. However, now it is clear that
these points are morphologically distinct
from true Plainview, and with dates from
two of the sites in the sample suggesting
an age range between 9990 and 8700 b.p.
(see a more detailed discussion below),
these points have been distinguished ty-
pologically as St. Mary’s Hall. It is likely
that Kelly’s Miniature Plainview points
(1983a) would ﬁt within this class.

Scottsbluff

Cluster 15, characterized by wide,
thick stems and very shallow basal con-
cavities, contained three specimens, two
of which are considered to be Scotts-
bluff (Fig. 2.17). Scottsbluff points have
slightly formed shoulders that frame wide
stems, and all come from Late Paleo-
indian contexts at Wilson-Leonard
(Bousman 1998a). The sample in this
analysis was too small to examine all the
variability possible in the Scottsbluff type,
and a large sample with type site speci-
mens would be more informative.

Parallel-Sided Stem

Within cluster 14 were four specimens
from Wilson-Leonard that appear to have

slightly wider and thicker stems and less
well controlled ﬂaking patterns than did
Plainview points. These points are provi-
sionally called parallel-sided stem until a
larger sample is available for further study
(Fig. 2.18).

Points with Deep Basal Concavities

The ﬁnal six clusters are characterized
by deep basal concavities and moderately
thick, parallel stems. These clusters dis-
play the morphological variability of three
point types. The results show a more scat-
tered pattern with regard to previously
identiﬁed types for a majority of the
points with deep basal concavities.

Atypical St. Mary’s Hall

The exception is cluster 16, which con-
tains specimens called atypical St. Mary’s
Hall (Fig. 2.19). These points have stem
width and thickness proportions similar
to those of St. Mary’s Hall but have atypi-
cal deeper basal concavities. However,
these specimens differ from the rest of the
lanceolates with deep basal concavities by
their narrower stem widths and shallower
basal concavities. The specimens are from
the St. Mary’s Hall and Wilson-Leonard
sites and are temporally comparable to
the St. Mary’s Hall type.

Golondrina, Barber, and Dalton

Clusters 17–21 display the morpho-
logical overlapping of the previously typed
Golondrina, Barber, and Dalton points
(Fig. 2.20). While cluster 17 contains
mostly points with slightly contracting

stems identiﬁed as Barber, cluster 18 has
points with slightly expanding stems
characteristic of Golondrina, and cluster
19 comprises primarily Dalton points
(from the Sloan site in Arkansas) with the
deepest basal concavities. The specimens
in clusters 20 and 21, with wider stems
than seen in the other clusters, show a
range from Golondrina to Barber.

These clusters illustrate the full range
of basal shape present in all three types.
This range, however, renders such basal
characteristics useless for assigning typol-
ogy among points with deep basal con-
cavities. A look at ﬂaking pattern gener-
ally distinguishes Dalton points, which
show more controlled and regular ﬂaking
than either Golondrina or Barber. Based
on the dates from Rodgers Shelter in Mis-
souri (Wood and McMillan 1976), it ap-
pears that Dalton points may be older
than Golondrina. With most of the mor-
phological continuum from Golondrina
to Barber present in the Golondrina
type site collection from Devil’s Mouth
(L. Johnson 1964; see Fig. 2.6), at present
there is no stratigraphic or chronological
evidence that supports their separation as
types. Also, Hester (1995, ﬁg. 10; see also
Hester, chapter 4, this volume) illustrates
a cache of Golondrina points from south
Texas, and the specimens show the full
range between Golondrina and Barber.

Stemmed Points

Stemmed points have been found in
apparent Paleoindian contexts at a num-
ber of sites in west, central, and south

Texas. The clear occurrence of stemmed
points stratiﬁed above and below com-
ponents with lanceolate projectile points
in a well-dated context at the Wilson-
Leonard site highlights the difﬁculty of
equating Paleoindian status with only
those components having lanceolate pro-
jectile points. In the last half of the twen-
tieth century as many as four different
stemmed forms may have been found on
Paleoindian sites in Texas.

Wilson

At the Devil’s Mouth site, LeRoy
Johnson (1964) and William Sorrow
(1968) found expanding stem projec-
tile points with basal grinding in layers
they believed were Paleoindian in age
(Fig. 2.21). Johnson (1964, 55 –57, and
ﬁgs. 17–18) indicates that these were
found in the Upper Gravels in Area C,
while Sorrow (1968) found stemmed
forms in Strata O and P of Area D. Other
sites with early stemmed points include
the Landslide site (Sorrow et al. 1967),
the Merrell site (Campbell 1948), and
possibly Horn Shelter No. 2, Northern
Area (Forrester 1985). Ellen Sue Turner
and Thomas Hester (1993) refer to these
points as early stemmed. Similar points
have been found in surface contexts at
other sites, but the excavations at Wilson-
Leonard uncovered a large intact occupa-
tion within the Leanne Soil (Bousman
1998a).

Two forms occur at Wilson-Leonard.
The most common form (see Fig. 2.21) is
very similar to those from Devil’s Mouth,

but one, called atypical Wilson, is similar
to those found at Buckner Ranch (see be-
low). Wilson points share broad, thick,
expanding stems with ﬂat to slightly con-
cave bases, and the shoulder morphology
extends from prominent to slightly
barbed. The sides and base of stems are
ground. At Wilson-Leonard, most of the
specimens are complete, although often
they are intensively resharpened and thus
blade length varies. The specimens with
the longer blades all have a long triangu-
lar shape that becomes arched near the
tip but have a very short, squat triangular
shape as resharpening progresses. The

major difference between the Devil’s
Mouth and Wilson-Leonard specimens is
that the latter are consistently thicker and
have shorter stems. It is unclear if this is
a difference in the production of these
points or a difference in the available raw
materials.

Marvin Kay (1998) conducted a use
wear analysis of the Wilson points at Wil-
son-Leonard, and it indicated that many
of them had complex use histories. Some
were used ﬁrst as points and then later as
knives, some were resharpened, another
was used ﬁrst as a knife and then showed
evidence of impact fractures, one was ﬁrst

a point and then retooled into a burin,
and a ﬁnal specimen was used ﬁrst as a
point and then recycled into a scraper.
Bousman’s analysis (1998a) of the Wilson
and Late Paleoindian materials at Wilson-
Leonard suggested that the stemmed pro-
jectile points were less likely to break
than were lanceolate forms and that this
could be one reason for the eventual shift
to stemmed forms.

Berclair

The ﬁrst discovery of stemmed points
in a Texas Paleoindian context was made
by Elias Sellards et al. (1940) in Blanco

Fig. 2.22. Berclair points from Buckner Ranch and Wilson-Leonard.

Creek deposits on the Buckner Ranch.
Two stemmed points with deep, moder-
ate to wide side notches that form strongly
expanding stems were found in the Lower
Horizon of the Berclair Terrace at Local-
ity 1 (Fig. 2.22). Sellards et al. did not
feel conﬁdent that these points were in
reliable geological contexts even though
detailed information indicated that these
stemmed points were found with a gouge
and a scraper as well as ﬂakes, and at the
same level as the typical Paleoindian
lanceolates. A similar point was found
in the Wilson component at Wilson-
Leonard and called atypical Wilson by
Kerr (see Fig. 2.22). Patterson and Hud-
gins (1985) found a single point of simi-
lar morphology at 41WH19, and Pat-
terson (1995) has called these early
side-notched.

While more research is warranted for
these stemmed forms, four sites in Texas
have these points in stratiﬁed contexts,
and components at Wilson-Leonard and
41WH19 have been dated to between
10,000 and 9000 b.p. We tentatively
suggest that this form of side-notched
stemmed point be called Berclair.

San Patrice

A number of sites have points with
broad, moderately short blades, shallow
side-notched stems, and concave bases

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

Fig. 2.23. San Patrice and Big Sandy points from Wilson-Leonard.

with prominent basal thinning (Fig. 2.23).
Clarence Webb (1946) originally de-
scribed similar points from San Patrice
Creek, Louisiana. Later, Lathel Dufﬁeld
(1963) deﬁned three varieties from the
Wolfshead site in east Texas: St. Johns,
Hope, and Goodwin. Webb et al. (1971)
deﬁned a number of variants from speci-
mens recovered from the John Pearce site
in northwestern Louisiana. In Texas, ex-
cavated San Patrice points were recovered
from dated contexts at Horn Shelter,
Wilson-Leonard, and the Rex Rodgers
site. At Horn Shelter, Frank Watt (1978)
called these Brazos Fishtailed, and at Rex
Rodgers, Patrick Willey et al. (1978b)

used the term Rodgers side-hollowed
points. They all fall within the morpho-
logical range of San Patrice. These points
appear to date between 9500 and 8000
b.p. in Texas, but much more work must
be done before this distinctive form can
be considered securely dated.

Big Sandy

At Wilson-Leonard a single triangu-
lar point with a narrow side notch was
identiﬁed as Big Sandy (see Fig. 2.23).
This form is not common in Texas, and
we believe that Wilson-Leonard is the
only site producing an excavated speci-
men in a dated context.

Summary

The above section discusses the evi-
dence for Texas Paleoindian projectile
point typology. A number of distinctive
morphological forms carry signiﬁcant cul-
tural-historical information. These forms
include Clovis, Folsom, Plainview,
Golondrina-Barber, Wilson, St. Mary’s
Hall, Dalton, Scottsbluff, Angostura,
Berclair, San Patrice, Big Sandy, Lub-
bock, and Thrall. With this larger array
of more ﬁnely tuned point types it is pos-
sible to begin the work needed to im-
prove the chronological-stratigraphic
range of these forms. Then, with greater
conﬁdence, researchers will be able to de-
velop more anthropologically and behav-
iorally focused analyses of Paleoindian
archeology in Texas.

Geological Stratigraphy
and Site Descriptions

The geological setting of the great ma-

jority of Paleoindian sites can be easily
summarized: most are surface occurrences
and do not occur in a buried context.
However, a few sites have been discovered
in buried contexts, and the geological set-
tings were documented to varying degrees.
The geological stratigraphy of Paleo-

indian sites in Texas, especially on the
Llano Estacado, has recently been re-
viewed in detail by Vance Holliday
(1997a), and a full treatment is not war-
ranted here. Nevertheless, a discussion of
the stratigraphic settings of sites with well-
recorded stratigraphy is essential for the
presentation of other sources of evidence.
Holliday (1997a) does rename strati-
graphic units at many of the sites; how-
ever, in this chapter, when possible, the
original stratigraphic nomenclature from
the site reports or most complete descrip-
tion is used. Holliday (1997a) demon-
strates that most Paleoindian sites occur
in a limited number of depositional envi-
ronments in the High Plains. These are
alluvial, eolian, and playa settings. To this
can be added rockshelters from the Lower
Pecos and central Texas regions. Of
course, these are the most widespread
geological settings where Late Pleistocene
and Holocene deposits accumulate, so
buried sites should be found in them.
Few other areas have excavated Paleo-
indian sites, and the geological contexts

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

of Paleoindian sites in these other regions
remain poorly understood. Additionally,
no true coastal Paleoindian sites are
known because the Pleistocene coasts
were ﬂooded by rising sea levels that
have probably inundated sites.

Lubbock Lake (41LU1)

To date, the best studied and most
carefully documented Paleoindian strati-
graphic sequence is from the site of Lub-
bock Lake (E. Johnson 1987c). Lubbock
Lake is actually a complex series of indi-
vidual excavations conducted during four
separate stages by different institutions
over many years in the same general seg-
ment of Yellowhouse Draw (Fig. 2.24).
This portion of Yellowhouse Draw had a
series of springs that dried in the 1930s,
and a U-shaped pond was dug by the
Works Progress Administration (WPA) in
the hopes of reactivating the springs. The
ﬁrst archeological excavation was directed
by Joe Ben Wheat (1974) for the WPA in
1939. The second effort was directed by
Sellards, Evans, and Meade under the
auspices of the Texas Memorial Museum,

and the excavations occurred sporadically
between 1948 and 1955. F. E. Green re-
newed excavations in 1959 and 1960 for
the West Texas Museum at Texas Tech
University. The most recent phase of in-
vestigations has been directed by Eileen
Johnson. She and Vance Holliday worked
together from the mid-1970s forward on
the Lubbock Lake Project (see also John-
son and Holliday, chapter 9, this vol-
ume). It is the stratigraphic record estab-
lished for Lubbock Lake initially by Glen
Evans (stratigraphic notes for Stations B,
D, E, F, G, H, I, and M on ﬁle at TARL)
and reﬁned in works by Stafford (1981),
Holliday and Allen (1987), and Holliday
(1995d, 1997a) that is presented here.

Five primary units were identiﬁed and
numbered consecutively (1–5) from bot-
tom to top (Fig. 2.25). These sediments
were deposited in a Pleistocene cut chan-
nel. Stratum 1 at the bottom is alluvial
sand and gravel, and it contains the oldest
archeological remains, probably Clovis
aged. Stratum 2, conformable above Stra-
tum 1, consists of multiple facies: 2A, 2B,
2e, and 2s. In Holliday’s nomenclature

the letter e indicates an eolian deposit and
the letter s represents slope wash. Within
facies 2A are a number of thin distinctive
depositional units called local beds (LB1–
4) composed of diatomite, thin lens of
diatomite interstratiﬁed with sands, and
diatomaceous muds.

Stratum 2 contained the original Fol-

som materials excavated by Sellards,
Evans, and Meade at Station D in 1951.
Stratum 2B is composed of a paludal mud
and has slope (2s) and eolian (2e) facies.
Fine subdivisions, also called local beds,
were identiﬁed in Stratum 2s. These are
identiﬁed by the letters a, b, and c. Buried
bone in Stratum 2B, excavated by Evans
and Meade in 1950 at Station M, was
originally believed to be Folsom in age.
The radiocarbon age of 9883 ! 350 b.p.
was thought to be the ﬁrst radiocarbon
date on Folsom material in North Amer-
ica, even though diagnostic artifacts were
not present, but later stratigraphic work
demonstrated that this material was actu-
ally younger in age. The upper part of
Stratum 2B is weathered to form the First-
view soil, with the period of soil formation

spanning the period between 8500 and
6300 b.p. Above Stratum 2 are Strata 3, 4,
and 5, and these units contain Archaic and
Late Prehistoric components (see Johnson
and Holliday, chapter 9, this volume).

Wilson-Leonard (41WM235)

Wilson-Leonard is another recently
excavated site with a well-studied strati-
graphic record (Goldberg and Holliday
1998). This site is in central Texas and
presents the most complete single cul-
tural sequence in that portion of the state
(M. Collins 1998b). Wilson-Leonard is
situated in a Late Pleistocene and Holo-
cene terrace of Brushy Creek in southern
Williamson County. It is signiﬁcant for
demonstrating the existence of a stemmed
projectile point component (called Wil-
son) stratiﬁed above and below classic
lanceolate Paleoindian occupations.

The Wilson component represents the

remains discarded from a series of resi-
dential camps, with artifacts and bone
scattered around multiple hearths, and
the interment of a middle-aged woman in
a shallow burial pit (Bousman 1998a).

Below the Wilson component is the so-
called Bone Bed component (M. Collins
1998a). This level contains the scattered
remains of butchered bison and a single
horse bone at the bottom of a stream
channel. Only a single projectile point
was found in the Bone Bed component,
and Kerr and Dial’s (1998) statistical
analysis suggests that it is most similar
to Plainview, although Collins’s techno-
logical analysis demonstrates similarities
with Folsom/Midland ﬂaking technology
(M. Collins 1998a). Clovis materials were
discovered below the Bone Bed compo-
nent in a gravel unit (M. Collins 1998a).
Above the Wilson component is a stra-
tum with a variety of unﬂuted lanceolate
Paleoindian projectile points, including
Golondrina-Barber, St. Mary’s Hall,
Scottsbluff, San Patrice, Big Sandy, and
Angostura (Bousman 1998a). Capping
the Paleoindian strata is a stratum that
contains the complete central Texas Ar-
chaic and Late Prehistoric sequence (see
M. Collins, chapter 3, this volume).

Goldberg and Holliday (1998) divided

the deposits into three primary units:

Fig. 2.26. Wilson-Leonard stratigraphy (after Goldberg and Holliday 1998; Mear 1998).

Unit I, Unit II, and Unit III, and these
are subdivided into a series of more dis-
crete deposits (Fig. 2.26). Starting at the
bottom, Unit Igl is an alluvial unit that
sits unconformably on bedrock. It is
composed of a gravel bar complex con-
taining Clovis materials that form the
bottom of a Pleistocene-aged channel.
Unit Igl interdigitates with and is covered
by a thin silty alluvial deposit called Unit
Isi. In the central portion of the site at
the location of the excavation block, and
above Unit Isi, is a clayey cienega (pond)
that largely plugs a Pleistocene channel.
In Unit Isi below the cienega deposit
(Unit Icl) is the Bone Bed component.
The cienega deposit is virtually archeolog-
ically sterile, and no diagnostic artifacts
were recovered in those sediments. Above
the cienega and the lateral silty alluvial de-
posits (Unit Isi) is the Leanne Soil (Holli-
day 1992) with the Wilson component.
Goldberg and Holliday (1998) label the
Leanne Soil as Unit Ic. Above Unit Ic is a
silty deposit, called Unit Id, that forms
the uppermost subunit of Unit I, and it
also contains Wilson component materi-
als. The upper boundary of Unit I con-
sists of eroded Unit Ic or Unit Id sedi-
ments. Unit II is above Unit I, and it has
much more poorly sorted sediments that
appear to be from colluvial and alluvial
sources. Within Unit II are a series of
Late Paleoindian occupations that cannot
be separated stratigraphically, although
the lowermost materials are primarily
Golondrina-Barber points; the middle
portion of the unit has St. Mary’s Hall
and a series of parallel-sided lanceolate
forms, and the upper portion has Angos-
tura points. The upper boundary of Unit
II represents an unconformity that in

places is marked by the excavation of
Early Archaic ovens with early split-stem
forms such as Gower and Hoxie. Unit III
contains the remaining portion of the
Holocene cultural record.

Aubrey (41DN479)

In 1988 C. Reid Ferring discovered
the Aubrey site, which was deeply buried
in the ﬂoodplain of the Elm Fork of the
Trinity River in Denton County. This
Clovis site was exposed when the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers excavated a
deep trench during the construction of
the outﬂow channel for Ray Roberts
Lake. Ferring (1989a, 1989b, 1989c,
1990a, 1990b, 1992) conducted exten-
sive excavations and geoarcheological
work at the site.

Ferring identiﬁed eight geological
units at the Aubrey site (Fig. 2.27). The
sequence is well dated (see below) and be-
gins sometime before ﬁfteen thousand
years ago, when the Elm Fork began to
downcut its Late Pleistocene ﬂoodplain
and isolate the Denton Creek terrace.
The downcutting was deep enough to
erode bedrock and carve a deeper chan-
nel. At the base of this channel a sand
and gravel bar (Unit A) formed, and
on its surface Clovis hunter-gatherers
camped near the stream. Unit B1 is silts,
clays, and peat that were deposited in a
spring-fed pool. This pool formed in a
low depression on the Unit A sand and
gravel bar. Ferring argues that little allu-
vial deposition occurred during the for-
mation of Unit B1. Unit B2 consists of
peat, spring travertines, and tufas depos-
ited in the pool. While this apparently
was a period of increased spring ﬂow,
there was still very little alluvial deposi-

tion. Unit C comprises cross-bedded tu-
fas and marls deposited in the pool by
spring seep. These deposits change to silty
and sandy marls at the pool margins
when colluvial deposits are introduced
from the Pleistocene terrace. Unit D is a
sand and gravel colluvial deposit that pro-
graded from the western portion of the
pool and formed the “red wedge” unit.
After the “red wedge” was deposited, the
surface was stable or eroding in the main
axis of the channel. Clovis-related arti-
facts and discarded materials were left on
the surface of the “red wedge,” the eroded
pond deposits, and the exposed surface of
the Unit A sand and gravel bar (see
Fig. 2.27). Unit E is interstratiﬁed clay
and thin marl beds. These beds mark the
renewed deposition of pool deposits. In
the eastern portion of the site renewed al-
luviation deposited Unit F sediments.
Unit G is clay and silt alluvium that rap-
idly covered the remainder of the Clovis
occupation during the Early Holocene.
The top of Unit G weathered in the
Middle Holocene to form a soil. Unit H
is overbank clays and silts that apparently
accumulated during the Late Holocene.
This unit covers Unit G, and a soil has
formed on its surface as well.

Miami (41RB1)

Bones were ﬁrst discovered by Charles
Puckett on the C. R. Cowan Ranch near
Miami, Texas, in 1933. These discoveries
were reported to Judge J. A. Mead of Mi-
ami, who excavated a small area of the
site in 1934 and found mammoth teeth
and a “stone dart point lying directly be-
tween two ribs of one of the big mam-
moths” (Science News Letter 1935, 92).
In 1937, Sellards and Glen Evans ex-

cavated the bones, teeth, and tusks of
ﬁve mammoths along with a scraper and
three ﬂuted Clovis projectile points in di-
rect association with the mammoth re-
mains in the deposits of a small playa.
Sellards describes the playa deposits set
into “red sandy clay bedrock” (1938,
ﬁgs. 3 and 5). The lowest playa ﬁll was
described as a ﬁne silt colored by organic
matter. The lower ﬁll was overlain by
a “loess stratum about 6 inches thick”
(1938, 1002). Above the loess stratum
was a silt similar to the lower ﬁll, and the
Clovis component and mammoth bone
were in the bottom of this silt lens (1938,
1002 –1003).

A reinvestigation in 1990 –92 by Hol-

liday et al. (1994) provides useful strati-
graphic details and radiocarbon assays.
They show that the playa ﬁll extends only
to a depth of 1.62 m, and below this
depth organic matter stained the Black-
water Draw Formation (Fig. 2.28). Thus,
the playa ﬁll is bowl shaped rather than
conical as described by Sellards (1938).
The lower playa ﬁll is a very dark gray silt
loam. The “loess” stratum is a light gray
silt (94 percent silt), and Holliday et al.
(1994, 237) concur it is probably eolian.
In this later investigation most of the
overlying ﬁll was found to be disturbed
backdirt from the Sellards and Evans ex-
cavation. However, in one core Holliday
and his collaborators discovered a thin
section of the lower portion of the upper-

most ﬁll intact and containing bone. This
section is certainly related to the original
Clovis component. It is described as a
dark gray silt loam.

The 1990 –92 investigation supports
all of the substantive conclusions of the
1937 investigation, but it did provide
more technical detail and, of course, the
radiocarbon assays (see below). However,
one inconsistency was noticed in this
more recent project. Most of the descrip-
tions refer to the sediment below the
playa ﬁll as organically stained Blackwater

Draw Formation. However, the discus-
sion on the radiocarbon assays suggests
that the lower sediment sample that pro-
duced the oldest radiocarbon dates is
from the lower 12 cm of the playa ﬁll,
more than 2 m below the surface and at
least 40 cm below the lower boundary of
the playa ﬁll.

Midland (41MD1)

Midland or Scharbauer Ranch consists

of ﬁve localities, but the primary site is

logical section below). The possible pres-
ence of stemmed Wilson projectile points
at Localities 2 and 3 (see Wendorf et al.
1955, ﬁgs. 18 – 42 and 19 –53) is tanta-
lizing, but until these specimens are
viewed and further documented this as-
sessment is hypothetical.

Horn Shelter No. 2 (41BQ46)

Horn Shelter No. 2 is a large, east-
facing overhang (46 by 7.6 m) on the
right bank of the Brazos River north of
Waco. The shelter is naturally divided into
southern and northern areas. The north-
ern area is reported by Forrester (1985)
and the southern area by Watt (1978)
and Redder (1985). The Paleoindian ma-
terials recovered by Watt and Redder in
the southern shelter are discussed here.
The deposits were divided into

twenty-seven strata (Fig. 2.30), and these
fall into three groups (Redder 1985;
D. Young 1988). Strata 1–3 consist of an-
cient ﬂuvial deposits of the Brazos River,
Strata 4 –11 formed in slowly aggrading
shelters with intensive human occupa-
tion, and Strata 12 –27 are ﬂuvial de-
posits that formed from recent ﬂooding
of the Brazos River, human occupation,
and recent disturbances.

The lowest stratigraphic units are dis-
cussed here. Stratum 1 (Bottom Sand) is
a sterile, ﬁne, compacted dark red sand.
Stratum 2 (River Gravel) is a coarse sand
and limestone gravel unit with faunal re-
mains and a possible human tooth. Stra-
tum 3 (Yellowish Clay) is a yellowish clay

Fig. 2.29. Midland stratigraphy (after Holliday and Meltzer 1996).

ological investigations by Holliday and
Meltzer (1996) complement the original
investigations by Wendorf et al. (1955),
Sellards (1955), and Wendorf and
Krieger (1959).

Midland stratigraphy consists of allu-

vial and eolian deposits (Fig. 2.29).
Within the channel cut through a mas-
sive calcrete, the oldest deposits are the
alluvial White Sands. As Holliday and
Meltzer (1996) demonstrate, stratigraphi-
cally above the White Sands is a lower
Red Sand unit. Holliday and Meltzer sug-
gest that the Folsom materials found by
Wendorf et al. (1955) were in this lower
Red Sand. At least in one locality, this
lower Red Sand is stratiﬁed below the
Gray Sand, which is covered by an upper

Red Sand. The upper Red Sand is capped
by the Tan Sand.

Although very little archeological ma-

terial was recovered in situ, human re-
mains were found on the surface of the
Gray Sand, and Holliday and Meltzer
(1996) believe they postdate the Folsom
materials; Wendorf and Krieger (et al.
1955; 1959) believe they predate the Fol-
som materials. This interpretive differ-
ence in the dating of the Midland human
remains is perhaps even more signiﬁcant
than Holliday and Meltzer (1996) indi-
cate because the uranium-series date of
the human remains (McKinney 1992)
suggests that they may be contemporary
with the burials at Wilson-Leonard and
Horn Shelter (see discussion in chrono-

Fig. 2.30. Horn Shelter No. 2 stratigraphy (after Redder 1985).

with some sand, limestone clasts, and cal-
cium carbonate nodules. A hearth, a few
ﬂakes, and fragmented bone were found
in this stratum. Turtle (Geochelone sp. or
Gopherus sp.) remains were dated to
10,150 ! 120 b.p. (see below). Scattered
limestone roof fall was found on the up-
per surface of Stratum 3.

Stratum 4 (Shaley Red) consisted of
thin limestone spalls coated with red clay.
This stratum apparently represents the
rapid decomposition of the back wall and
roof of the shelter. A few lithic ﬂakes
were found in this unit. Stratum 5 (Cave
Deposit) is ﬁne-grained decomposed shel-
ter debris. This stratum is subdivided into
two members and seven substrata. The
lower member includes Substrata 5a, 5b,
5c, and 5d, while the upper member con-
sists of 5e, 5f, and 5g.

Stratum 5a (Lower Member–Clean
Cave Fill) is described as “clean cave ﬁll.”
In the lower portion of Stratum 5a was a
low density of ﬂaking debris and an
unﬂuted lanceolate that Story (1990,
186) believes is a Clovis point. There
were two Folsom points in the upper por-
tion of Stratum 5a. Strata 5b (Lower
Member–Third Red) and 5c (Lower
Member–Second Red) are thin layers of
red clay interstratiﬁed within Stratum 5a.
Stratum 5d (Lower Member–Ash Lens
Drag Down) is also a layer of red clay, al-
though it is much more extensive than
Strata 5b and 5c. Five hearths with
charcoal, ash, and bone lenses were
documented in Stratum 5d, and it also
contained a considerable amount of
occupational debris (including bone
needles), but no projectile points. Stra-
tum 5e (Upper Member–Clean Cave
Fill) was described as similar to Stratum
5a: “clean and sparkling white” (Redder
1985, 41). Stratum 5f (Upper Member–
Light Gray) is the “same type of deposit
but has been slightly dirtied by human
occupation” (Redder 1985, 41). Abun-
dant occupational debris—including
San Patrice and Scottsbluff projectile
points—were recovered from Stratum 5f.
Stratum 5g (Upper Member–Heavy
Gray) is a very dark midden deposit with
abundant occupational debris, San Patrice
points, four radiocarbon assays of 9500
! 200 b.p., 10,030 ! 130 b.p., 9980 !
370 b.p., and 10,310 ! 150 b.p., and a
double burial (see below).

Stratum 6 (Red Gray Mix) is believed

to be a combination of “cave deposit” and
red river sand. An anthropogenic cause
for the mixing is suggested, and a moder-
ate concentration of debris in this stratum
includes a Scottsbluff point. Stratum 7
(Rocky Red) is a reddish-brown sandy
clay with abundant angular limestone
fragments. Redder also describes “hori-
zontal ﬁngers of cave deposit” that extend
into the stratum (Redder 1985, 52), and
a proﬁle published by Young (1988, ﬁg.
2) shows a stringer from Stratum 7 pro-
jecting into Stratum 5e. Artifacts found
in this stratum include Brazos Fishtailed
(San Patrice) points and two “Edgewood-
looking” points that are assumed to be
Archaic. Because of the apparently long
period of time represented by Stratum 7,
Redder (1985, 52) thought this deposit
was an enigma. However, while the drip
line was not shown, the geometry, posi-
tion, and sediment content suggest that
this may be a homogeneous talus deposit
that accumulated over a fairly long period
of time. Stratum 7 imparts a slope on
most of the Prehistoric deposits in the
front of the shelter.

Stratum 8 (Red Sand) is in the back
portion of the shelter and is a red ﬂuvial
sand. Four substrata were deﬁned. Three
of these (Strata 8a, 8b, and 8c) were iden-
tiﬁed as cultural occupations interstratiﬁed
within Stratum 8. Stratum 8a (Double
Cemented) includes two thin calcium
carbonate– cemented sand layers with a
red clay layer between. Immediately be-
low the lower cemented sand layer is a
thin occupation zone with a low density
of stone artifacts and bone. No tempo-
rally diagnostic materials were found in
this layer. Stratum 8b (Plainview 2) is an
occupation zone cemented to sand. Four
projectile points from it were classiﬁed
as Plainview but could be Golondrina-
Barber within Kerr’s classiﬁcation. A
single radiocarbon date of 8400 ! 110
b.p. was obtained on snail shells. Stratum
8c (Plainview 1) is a layer of red sand
with small angular limestone spalls that
separates two layers of red clay below and
above. Two projectile points were found
in Stratum 8c, both of which can be
classiﬁed as Golondrina-Barber. The
fourth substratum is Stratum 8d (Red,
White Spotted). It is a red sand with scat-
tered calcium carbonate nodules that give
the layer a spotted appearance. This layer
appears to be a continuation of Stratum

8, but it is almost separated from the re-
mainder of Stratum 8 by the Archaic
midden (Stratum 10) and a looter’s hole
(Stratum 17).

The remaining strata cap and some-

times mark the disturbance of the de-
posits with Paleoindian materials (Redder
1985; Watt 1978). The sediments at
Horn Shelter No. 2 document the com-
plex accumulation of sediments as well as
the presence of prehistoric and historic
occupants for at least ten thousand years.
The Brazos River, the shelter itself, and
the various occupants have all contrib-
uted to this record.

Lipscomb (41LP1)

Lipscomb Bison Quarry was excavated

ﬁrst in 1939 by Erwin H. Barbour and
C. Bertrand Schultz from the Nebraska
State Museum (Barbour and Schultz
1941; Schultz 1943). Brief excavations
were also undertaken in 1946 by the Ne-
braska State Museum and in 1960 by
C. Vance Haynes and George Agogino
(Hofman 1995; Hofman et al. 1991).
Hofman and his collaborators renewed
investigations in 1988 and the analysis
continues (Hofman 1995; Hofman and
Todd 1990; Hofman et al. 1989a, 1991b).
Lipscomb is located near a small tributary
of Wolf Creek, itself a tributary of the
North Canadian River, in the Texas Pan-
handle. Detailed descriptions are not
available, but a proﬁle presented by Hof-
man (1995) indicates that the bone bed
was near the top of, and on the edge of, a
Late Pleistocene arroyo ﬁll that rests un-
conformably on eroded Ogallala Forma-
tion deposits (Fig. 2.31).

Bonﬁre Shelter (41VV218)

David S. Dibble excavated Bonﬁre
Shelter in 1963 – 64 (Dibble and Lorrain
1968), and it was reexcavated by Lee
Bement and Solveig Turpin in 1986
(Bement 1986). This site is a large rock-
shelter of eroded limestone in deeply en-
trenched Mile Creek in the southwest
corner of the Stockton Plateau. Mile
Creek is a short, dry tributary of the Rio
Grande, and their conﬂuence is approxi-
mately 25 km upstream from the Pecos
River conﬂuence with the Rio Grande.
The shelter is elongated (125 m long by
24 m deep) and forms a smooth crescent
overhang.

Dibble and Lorrain (1968) suggested

that Bonﬁre Shelter was eroded by the
meandering Mile Creek. In front of the
shelter are huge limestone blocks that
have collapsed from the overhang, and
these are the largest clasts that make up
an extensive talus deposit in front of the
shelter. The large talus blocks project ap-
proximately 6.5 m above the surface de-
posits in the shelter. This surface and the
buried deposits below slope down toward
the back of the shelter, and it is clear
that the talus cone formed these sloping
deposits.

Dibble identiﬁed three depositional

zones and three bone beds at Bonﬁre
(Dibble and Lorrain 1968, 24 –27). The
lowest deposit is Zone 1 (Fig. 2.32), a
rubble deposit composed of weathered
limestone spalls and light gray silt. In a
number of proﬁles Dibble identiﬁed spall
lines that marked the accumulation of
roof fall on the slope of the talus cone. In
the central portion of the site, Bone Bed
1 (Bement’s stratum H-1) sits directly on
Zone 1 deposits. Bone Bed 1 consists
only of a scattering of bone and was not
a marked concentration.

Zone 2 is a thick heterogeneous unit
of limestone spalls and silt. In most of the
shelter it sits unconformably on Zone 1
deposits, and Dibble suggested that it ac-
cumulated through roof fall and slope
wash from above the shelter and down
the talus. In the central portion of the site
Zone 2 could be subdivided. Zone 2a is
a tan to light brown silt and small lime-
stone spalls. It forms a bench along the
rear wall of the shelter. Zone 2b is a light
brown silt with fewer limestone spalls,
and it covers Zone 2a. Occasionally thin
horizontal beds could be observed in

Zone 2b. Dibble mapped Bone Bed 2 as
below and above Zone 2a deposits.

Bone Bed 2 is an extensive and moder-

ately thick accumulation of bone that is
concentrated in the central portion of the
shelter and around the ﬂanks of the talus
cone. Given the concentration and num-
ber of bison, their position in the shelter,
their existence in this deep canyon with
very limited access, and the general up-
land topography, Dibble (Dibble and
Lorrain 1968, 69 –74) effectively argued
that the bison remains in Bone Bed 2
represented the use of this site as a jump.
In the southern part of the shelter
three separate bone bed components were
recognized. Component A at the bottom
was unburned bone in sandy silt and
limestone spalls. Component B, in the
middle, was a thinner band of heavily
charred and broken bone and carbon-
stained silts. At the top, Component C
consisted of unburned bone in a sandy
silt and limestone spall matrix. Hearth 1,
with charcoal, correlated with Compo-
nent C in Bone Bed 2. Also found in
Component C was a projectile point
(specimen 392) that Kerr and Dial’s
analysis clustered with Lubbock points at
the Lubbock Lake site. A Folsom point
(specimen 327) was found in Component
A. The Bone Bed 2 radiocarbon dates
were derived from charcoal in the Com-
ponent C hearth. The other lanceolate
points were found in Bone Bed 2 but in
areas where the individual components
could not be recognized.

Plainview (41HA1)

The Plainview site was discovered in a

caliche pit in Running Water Draw in

1944 and was excavated in 1945 by Sel-
lards, Evans, Meade, and Krieger. They
excavated approximately 500 square feet
of a dense bone bed composed of disartic-
ulated and articulated bison bone that
was approximately 62 feet long, 10 feet
wide, and up to 1.5 feet thick. They did
not excavate the entire bone bed, and
only a small number of stone artifacts
were found in direct association. Later ex-
cavations in 1976 and 1977 by Eddie
Guffee (1979) demonstrated that the
bone bed was clearly larger than that ex-
posed in the original excavation. The
reader is referred to Speer (1990) for a
detailed history of these investigations.
The Plainview site is signiﬁcant because
of its potential to help clarify our ideas
regarding Paleoindian culture history,
Pleistocene bison evolution, and Paleo-
indian hunting strategies.

This discussion of the geology is de-
rived from Sellards et al. (1947) and Hol-
liday (1995d, 1997a). Running Water
Draw has cut through the Blackwater
Draw and Ogallala Formations on the
High Plains. Sellards et al. (1947, 936)
describe the valley ﬁll as consisting of
three main units: a basal zone of cross-
bedded sands and water-worn caliche
gravels a few inches to 3.5 feet thick; a
middle massive zone of compact sandy
clay 5 to 8 feet thick; and an upper dark
sandy soil 1.5 to 3 feet thick. Sellards
et al. indicate that the bone bed “rested
directly on caliche bedrock, but near the
upstream and downstream ends it was
separated from bedrock by a few inches of
the valley ﬁll” (1947, 931). They go on to
say that the “basal zone of cross-bedded
sands and water worn caliche gravels . . .

contain the bison bone bed,” but in an-
other section of the article they also indi-
cate that the “bones evidently accumu-
lated in a shallow water hole or pond
within a former channel of Running Wa-
ter Creek. That the water was shallow is
indicated by the thin layer of pond sedi-
ment with broken and poorly preserved
bones in the upper part and by the pres-
ence of abundant fresh-water inverte-
brates” (Sellards et al. 1947, 934).

Sometime after 1945 the original pit

was enlarged, and two additional pits
were excavated. In the 1970s the original
pit was ﬁlled with garbage.

Holliday (1995d, 1997a) studied

proﬁles that were visible during the 1980s
and 1990s, and his descriptions provide a
more detailed but, because of the contin-
ued destruction and alteration of the site,
limited view of the geological context of
the Plainview site. Unfortunately, the
bone bed was completely destroyed
and/or covered over by the time Holliday
began to work at the site. He suggests
that the bone bed was sitting on a caliche
bench formed by two earlier erosion
events (Fig. 2.33). The oldest and deepest
channel that eroded one edge of the
bench is ﬁlled with Stratum 1, a sand and
gravel deposit. This channel is easily cor-
related to the Sellards et al. (1947) basal
unit. A second erosional event, possibly a
later meander, is marked by a smaller
channel ﬁlled with Stratum 1m deposits.
This is an organic-rich, loamy, mud facies
of Stratum 1. These deposits could be
similar to those described by Sellards
et al. as the “thin layer of pond sediment”
(1947, 934). Overlying Stratum 1 are
very thin, discontinuous, and contorted
lenses of organic-rich mud. This is Stra-
tum 2. Above Stratum 2 is Stratum 3
with lacustrine carbonate and eolian fa-
cies, and it seals all the lower deposits and
probably the Plainview occupation. Fur-
thermore, Holliday (1997a, 109) ob-
served Roberta Speer’s excavated blocks of
bone removed by Sellards, and the bone
was within a grayish-brown sandy loam
above a gravel.

Holliday (1999, personal communica-
tion) believes that the bone bed is strati-
graphically in and above Stratum 2m and
above Stratum 1 and that the Stratum 2m
radiocarbon assay is too young. Neverthe-
less, Holliday illustrates the approximate
position of the bone bed as being on the
caliche bench and over Stratum 1m, and

he suggested that the bone bed was “asso-
ciated with Stratum 1” (1997a, 106 and
ﬁg. 3.39). Sellards et al. indicate that the
“bones evidently accumulated in a shal-
low water hole or pond within a former
channel” (1947, 934). Thus, it seems rea-
sonable to suggest that the Plainview oc-
cupation was within deposits that are
equivalent to Strata 1 and 1m and strati-
graphically below Stratum 2. This sce-
nario would indicate that the Plainview
component was coeval with the 10,940
b.p. radiocarbon assay (see below).

Devil’s Mouth (41V188)

Three excavation seasons at this site

during the late 1950s and 1960s
identiﬁed a deep sequence of alluvial de-
posits at the mouth of the Devils River
and the Rio Grande west of Del Rio,
Texas. LeRoy Johnson (1961a) conducted
initial test excavation in 1959 and re-
turned for more extensive excavations in
1961– 62 (L. Johnson 1964) in Areas A,
B, and C (Fig. 2.34). In order to resolve a
number of speciﬁc stratigraphic issues,
particularly the relationship between de-
posits in Areas A and C that contained

42 / TEXAS PREHISTORY

Paleoindian materials, William Sorrow
conducted a second set of excavations in
1967 (Sorrow 1968).

For Areas A and B, Johnson (1964,
19 –22) describes twenty-four strata and
illustrates the constructional history of
the terrace. These areas were placed on
the edge of the terrace. Johnson (1964,
19) divides the deposits into upper and
lower sections and uses as the dividing
boundary an erosional unconformity that
truncated the lower section (Fig. 2.35).
He suggests that in the upper section
Strata 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 are “alter-
nate zones of midden soil” and Strata 2,
4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are eolian sand. Pre-
historic artifacts and features are more
common in the “midden soil” strata (L.
Johnson 1964, 19). While an anthro-
pogenic contribution to these strata is
clear, the photographs accompanying his
work suggest that these are pedogenic
soils. In the lower section, Strata 14, 16,
19, and parts of 22 and 24 are silty sands,
while Strata 15, 17, and 20 are silts. Stra-
tum 18 is deﬁned as “midden soil,” and
again it is probably a result of anthro-
pogenic and pedogenic processes. Stra-

tum 21 consists of alternating bands of
sand, silty sand, and silt, and Stratum 23
is a clay layer. Prehistoric artifacts and
features were found to occur thinly in the
silty sand layers, although no artifacts
were found in Stratum 24. An Angostura
point was found in the lower portion of
Stratum 21, and Johnson (1964, 52) il-
lustrates a Lerma-like point found in
Stratum 22 that should probably be con-
sidered a preform rather than a point.
In Area C, Johnson (1964, 22 –26)
and Sorrow (1968, 12 –13) observed tan
silts and sands overlying gravel deposits.
Area C was in a truncated portion of the
terrace near the Rio Grande–Devils River
conﬂuence (see Fig. 2.34). The gravels
were divided into Upper Gravels and
Lower Gravels, and they sat unconform-
ably on water-eroded ﬂuted limestone
bedrock. The archeologically sterile Lower
Gravels were igneous and metamorphic
pebbles and cobbles. The Upper Gravels
had limestone and chert cobbles with thin
lenses of red clay and sand that dipped
toward the streams. Within the Upper
Gravels were a number of Paleoindian
points (Angostura, Golondrina, and

Baker Cave (41VV213)

Baker Cave is in northern Val Verde
County on a northeast-facing cliff eroded
by a tributary of the Devils River. The
overhang forms a large semicircular shel-
ter that is 47 by 22 m in length and
depth. The site was ﬁrst excavated by
James Word between 1962 and 1966
(Word and Douglas 1970). Excavations
were renewed by John Greer in 1968

(Greer 1968a), by Thomas R. Hester and
Robert Heizer in 1976 (Hester 1978a,
1980a, 1980b; Chadderdon 1983), and
by Ken Brown in 1984. Word and Doug-
las (1970) and Chadderdon (1983) pro-
vide the most complete and detailed pub-
lished stratigraphic descriptions. The
deposits were a complex series of inter-
locking lenses and layers of sediment, or-
ganic matter, and artifactual debris. Word
and Douglas (1970, 10 –14) grouped
the various strata into ﬁve major zones
(Fig. 2.36), the lowest of which dates to
the Paleoindian period. Sediments be-
tween occupational layers were not in-

Wilson forms) and other lithic artifacts.
These artifacts were not abraded and may
be in near-primary context. The overly-
ing tan silts and sands contain rare arti-
facts and charcoal. Johnson (1964, 25)
correlates these silts and sands in Area C
to Stratum 24 in Area A (see Fig. 2.35).
Area D was excavated by Sorrow on
the west slope of the terrace (see Fig. 2.34).
Sorrow (1968, 10 –12) described twenty-
one strata but used a letter system because
he could not directly correlate Johnson’s
Area A strata to his Area D deposits (see
Fig. 2.35). Strata A, C /D, E, F, and H
are dark silts and ﬁne-grained sands with
artifacts and ﬁre-cracked rock. Strata B, J,
L, M, N, O, Q, and T are tan silts. In the
middle of Strata M, N, and O were Bar-
ber and Thrall projectile points, while at
the bottom of these strata were nondiag-
nostic lanceolate projectile points. Strata
G, I, K are gray-tan silts. Stratum P is col-
luvium with coarse limestone spalls in
sand. Within Stratum P, Sorrow (1968,
43) recovered four Wilson projectile
points (Sorrow’s Group 1) and one pos-
sible Angostura point. Sorrow (1968,
46 – 47) obtained a single radiocarbon
date (8780 ! 310 b.p.) from Stratum P.
Stratum R is a compact red-tan silt, and
Stratum S is a thin red clay silt lens. Stra-
tum U is a compact cemented calcareous
tan silt. Stratum V is bedded igneous
sands. Stratum W is small limestone

cluded in the zones. The intervening sed-
iments were mostly sterile ﬁne-grained
sediments and roof spall, which Word
and Douglas (1970, 10) suggested origi-
nated from the shelter roof and walls.

Zone 1 contained a Golondrina occu-

pation with multiple strata separated by
sterile deposits. The occupational strata
were all similar in context and consisted
of a grayish “soil” with scattered pieces of
charcoal, a few ﬁre-cracked rocks, ﬂint
ﬂaking debris, and a few roof spalls.
Lenses of tan “soil” contained more char-

coal and may represent informal hearths.
In 1976, Hester and Heizer excavated a
large (120-cm diameter and 30-cm thick)
basin hearth or cooking pit in this zone
(Fig. 2.37). This feature was ﬁlled with
ash, charcoal, and abundant bones and
lithic artifacts, and it was capped by a
dome of burned rock. The sediment at
the base of the hearth was oxidized to a
pinkish red color. Charcoal from the
hearth was dated by radiocarbon to 9180
! 220 b.p., and a Golondrina point was
found at the southwest edge of the hearth.

Charcoal from immediately below the
Golondrina point produced an age esti-
mate of 9020 ! 150 b.p. Faunal and
ﬂoral material from the hearth has pro-
duced the most detailed account of
Golondrina subsistence (see below).

Lake Theo (41BI70)

Two bone beds were excavated by Billy
R. Harrison and his collaborators at Lake
Theo in the Rolling Plains (Harrison and
Smith 1975; Harrison and Killen 1978).
The lower bed is poorly dated but con-
tained Folsom points in clear association
with Bison antiquus, and the upper bone
bed is associated with an unﬂuted parallel
stem lanceolate point that was classiﬁed
as Plainview. The stratigraphy was ﬁrst
described by Harrison (Harrison and
Smith 1975; Harrison and Killen 1978)
but has been re-described by Holliday
(E. Johnson et al. 1982; Holliday 1997a).
Holliday identiﬁed ten stratigraphic
units and ﬁve soils (Fig. 2.38). The basal
units are a set of three ﬁning-upward
stratigraphic units that are capped by a
soil (S1). Unit 1 is ﬂuvial gravels and
sands. Above, Unit 2 has loams to silty
clay loams that probably were deposited
as overbank alluvium. The lowest soil
correlates to Unit 3, a clay, and two ra-
diocarbon dates indicate it is Pleistocene
in age. Units 4, 5, and 6 comprise an-
other set of ﬁning-upward sediments that
are also capped by a soil (S2). In the
lower portion of this Ab3 horizon is a
Plainview component, and below this (in
a Bwb3 horizon) is the Folsom occupa-
tion. Dates on organic matter in the soil
and the bone date to the Early Holocene.
Above this soil are three additional sets of
sediments, each capped by a soil (S3, S4,
and S5). Organic matter in S3 (Ab2 hori-
zon) dates to the Middle Holocene, while
organic matter in S4 (Ab1) dates to the
Late Holocene. In many parts of the site,
S4 (Ab1 horizon) and its associated depo-
sitional units (Unit 8 and Unit 9) were
removed by erosion, and Unit 10 directly
overlies S3.

Loeve (41WM133)

Excavations by Frank Eddy (1973),
Clell Bond (1978), and Elton Prewitt
(1982) exposed a thick and complex
stratigraphy at the Loeve site along the
north bank of the San Gabriel River in
eastern Williamson County. Eddy (1973)

identiﬁed three primary stratigraphic
units, labeled I, II, and III from top to
bottom. The most intensive excavations
in the Paleoindian deposits were con-
ducted by Prewitt (1982). Prewitt re-
moved deposits from stratigraphic Units I
and II. He mapped a series of gravel and
clay lenses that he believed formed as a
point bar and that comprised strati-
graphic Unit III sediments.

Prewitt (1982, 234 –36) deﬁned six
subunits of stratigraphic Unit III and la-
beled these sequentially from top to bot-
tom (Fig. 2.39). Stratum III-1 is a light
grayish-brown massive clay with dispersed
gravel stringers. This stratum forms a
transitional zone between the gravel de-
posits below and the alluvial soils above
in stratigraphic Unit II. Stratum III-2 is a
complex series of size-graded gravel lenses
interspersed with clay lenses. Stratum III-
3 is a large clay lens with occasional gravel
lenses and stringers. Stratum III-3 pinches
out up and downstream. Stratum III-4
is a complex series of size-graded gravel
lenses and occasional clay lenses. This de-
posit is clearly distinguished from upper
and lower deposits and thins downstream.
Stratum III-5 is a thick gray clay deposit
that thins downstream and appears to
merge with Strata III-2 and III-3. Stra-
tum III-6 was not clearly visible due to
slumping deposits, but it consists of size-
graded gravels that range from pebble to
small boulder sizes. Prewitt (1982, 236)
believes that Stratum III-6 is Pleistocene
in age and that the overlying deposits date
to the Early Holocene.

Prewitt (1982) recovered from Stra-
tum III-1 a modest lithic artifact assem-
blage that has Angostura projectile points.
He assigned them to the Circleville phase
(Prewitt 1981, 1982).

Levi Rock Shelter (41TV49)

Herbert Alexander (1962, 1963,
1974) ﬁrst excavated Levi Rock Shelter
for his master’s thesis, and he excavated
there again in 1974 and 1977 (Alexander
1982). Levi Rock Shelter is in the eastern
Edwards Plateau in a northern wall of a
canyon cut by Lick Creek, a tributary of
the Pedernales River.

Alexander (1963) deﬁned ﬁve strati-
graphic zones (Fig. 2.40). At the bottom,
Zone I was a loose, light tan to yellow-
tan roof spall that was grainy in texture.
Large boulders from the roof were pres-
ent in Zone I. Alexander (1963) described
Zone II as earth-like in texture, tan-gray,
and containing no spalls, and the lower
boundary was abrupt. In 1972, Alexander
described this zone as a compact gray
midden soil, but in 1982 he described it
as “light tan, compact ﬁll and was decid-
edly cultural” (Alexander 1982, 136).
Zone III was a red-orange sand lens with
very few artifacts. Zone IV was a light
gray to brown, smooth textured and com-
pact. The uppermost zone, Zone V, was a
loose tan ﬁll (Alexander 1963), or a dark
brown (Alexander 1974) to brown (Alex-
ander 1982) dusty ﬁll.

Alexander (1982) found very few arti-
facts in Zone I, and he believed these few
represented a pre-Clovis occupation. He

considered the archeological materials in
Zone II to be Clovis in age, Zone III to
be sterile, Zone IV to be Plainview, and
Zone V to be Archaic in afﬁliation. Based
on photographs provided by Bill Rich-
mond and the presence of Clovis and An-
gostura points in Zone II, the lower two
zones seem likely to be bioturbated. Cer-
tainly, much ﬁrmer evidence is needed
before a pre-Clovis occupation can be ac-
cepted at the Levi Rock Shelter.

Bexar County. The full report is unpub-

Rolfe Mandel identiﬁed ﬁve major buried
soils in a 20-m thick Applewhite terrace

(Fig. 2.41). The soils are distinguished by
slightly darker colors, but the terrace is
extremely silty throughout. The oldest
soil is the Somerset Paleosol, which dates
to approximately 30,000 b.p. Late Pleis-
tocene sand and gravel channel ﬁlls are
inset unconformably against the Somerset
Paleosol. Stratigraphically above and
welded onto the Somerset Paleosol is the
Perez Paleosol. This soil is Early Holo-
cene in age and contains the Angostura
component, with possible rock-lined
cooking ovens. Above this are the Elm
Creek, Medina, and Leon Creek Paleo-
sols. These date to the Middle and Late
Holocene and contain Archaic compo-
nents. Late Prehistoric occupations were
recovered in the modern surface soil.

Rex Rodgers (41BI42)

This bison kill site was excavated in
1974 as part of the Mackenzie Reservoir
investigations (Willey et al. 1978b). San
Patrice and unidentiﬁed lanceolate pro-
jectile points that are similar to Plainview
points were reported in association with
at least six bison. The Rex Rodgers site
is in a terrace remnant within the Tule
Creek canyon. Willey et al. (1978b, 57–
60) indicates that the bison were found in
two concentrations draped on and below
a bench of eroded ﬂoodplain alluvium
(Fig. 2.42). The higher concentration of
bone rested on the alluvium bench, silts,
and sands overlying shales and sandstones
that comprised the Late Triassic Trujillo
Formation. The lower bone concentra-
tion was on a sand and gravel layer. These
bones were covered by “light-colored
laminated and cross-bedded stream-
channel sands” (Willey et al. 1978b, 57).
The channel sands contained masses of
shale and clay as well as sandstone slabs.
The materials were believed to be talus
debris dislodged from the side of the
nearby canyon wall.

Absolute Chronology

To date, thirty-two Paleoindian sites in
Texas have been dated by radiometric ab-
solute dating techniques (Table 2.1), and
a wide variety of materials, such as cal-
cium carbonate, bone, mussel shell, sedi-
ments, and charcoal, were selected for
radiocarbon analysis. Most of these radio-
metric assays are radiocarbon dates
(n"243), but uranium series (n"4) and
optical stimulated luminescence or OSL

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

(n"6) techniques have also been used.
The technique of radiocarbon dating has
also undergone a dramatic shift from
solid carbon to accelerator mass spec-
trometry (AMS) during its ﬁrst ﬁfty
years. These changes in technique and se-
lection of varying materials have created a
chronological record with varying degrees
of accuracy, and the recent extension of
the calibrated scale to the Paleoindian pe-
riod provides a more realistic measure of
time, although calibration is not without
its own set of problems.

Table 2.1 lists all available Paleoindian

radiometric determinations. In the dis-
cussion below we selectively use these
assays based on our present selection of
reliable assays. Different authors would
probably choose a different set of dates
than that generated by our own effort
at chronological hygiene (e.g., Springs
1989; R. Taylor et al. 1996), but we de-

cided that the full set of determinations
should be presented in this synthesis.

The most signiﬁcant improvement to
the development of absolute chronologies
is the development of AMS radiocarbon
dating. Irrespective of material, this tech-
nique produces age estimates with ex-
tremely small standard deviations, and
this greatly reduces the estimated age
ranges. Also, the ability to obtain accurate
radiocarbon dates from small samples
(Stafford 1998) opens a wide vista for
chronometric applications in Paleoindian
sites in Texas, and AMS is beginning to
be used on Paleoindian samples exclu-
sively. Still, because most available radio-
carbon assays employed conventional
Beta-decay methods, the standard devia-
tion can be very large and the chronologi-
cal resolution very low.

It is apparent that obtaining greater
resolution on Paleoindian chronologies

02-A2946  4/13/04  11:50 AM  Page 47

PALEOINDIAN ARCHEOLOGY IN TEXAS / 47

will require the extensive use of AMS
methods, but this alone is not enough.
As the following discussion indicates, the
most reliable chronologies come from
those sites with good stratigraphic con-
texts that have been intensively and
chronologically sampled. These sites pro-
duce a sequence of absolute dates in dif-
ferent levels that act to constrain the en-
tire sequence through time. No longer
can we depend on sites that have only one
or a few determinations. Along with tree-
ring and coral calibration, stratigraphi-
cally constrained assays provide the best
method for determining the age and the
time spans for events and periods during
the Paleoindian stage.

The recent extension of calibrated ages

into the Paleoindian stage dramatically
demonstrates that radiocarbon time is
stretched and compressed on a calendrical
time scale (Stuiver and Braziunas 1993;
Stuiver and Reimer 1993; R. Taylor et al.
1996; Fiedel 1999). Fig. 2.43 illustrates
that the difference between calibrated and
radiocarbon years is neither stable nor
constantly changing. The decreasing por-
tions of the slope (7.5 –7.8 kyr, 8.3 –8.6
kyr, 8.75 –9.16 kyr, and 9.65 –9.95 kyr),
called valleys, represent periods when
radiocarbon years are compressed into
shorter spans, while the increasing por-
tions of the slope (7.8 –8.3 kyr, 8.6 –8.75
kyr, 9.16 –9.4 kyr, 9.4 –9.65 kyr, and
9.95 –10.4 kyr), called peaks, are periods
when radiocarbon years represent longer
spans of time. The period between 10.4
and 12.0 kyr is a fairly stable portion of
the record, called a plateau, but Fiedel
(1999) indicates that this may also con-
tain some peaks and valleys. The peak be-
tween 9.95 and 10.4 kyr is particularly
important as many events seem to occur
during or span this interval, and thus
much more time is represented in this in-
terval than the radiocarbon dates reﬂect.
The difference between calibrated
and radiocarbon year scales can be illus-
trated by the assays from Lubbock Lake
(Figs. 2.44a, b). The best estimates for
the ages are listed in the legend boxes next
to the stratigraphic units. Stratigraphic
units without ages did not produce reli-
able age estimates. The age estimates are
derived by inspecting the entire string of
assays, which are ordered chronologically
by stratigraphic unit. This arrangement
allows a visual inspection and the elimi-
nation of age estimates that overlap age

Fig. 2.43. Difference between calibrated and radiocarbon years plotted on radiocarbon time
scale.

ranges from adjacent strata. One major
difference between the two chronologies
is the total amount of time represented
by each. On the radiocarbon scale, ap-
proximately 6,250 years are present (be-
tween 12,650 and 6400 b.p.). On the cal-
ibrated scale, however, 7,777 years are
present (14,874 –7097 b.p.). This differ-
ence represents an additional 1,527 years
on the calibrated scale. Arguments con-
cerning human behavior that may be time
dependent may have signiﬁcantly differ-
ent patterns on calibrated versus radiocar-
bon time scales. Another important dif-
ference is that there seems to be a plateau
of stratigraphic units clustering around
10,000 b.p. on the radiocarbon scale.
This plateau is stretched out on the cali-
brated scale.

Obviously, calibrated scales at Lub-
bock Lake provide better chronological
resolution. However, demonstrating the
usefulness of calibrated scales at Lubbock
Lake does not necessarily provide a reli-
able strategy for the remainder of Paleo-
indian sites with radiometric ages. By the
use of stratigraphically constrained age es-
timates, roughly half the Lubbock Lake
assays can be eliminated as inaccurate or
not feasible. No other site, not even Wil-
son-Leonard, has such a well-constrained
chronological record. If half the assays
from the remaining sites are unreliable,
then we are a long way from developing
a reliable chronological record for the

Paleoindian occupation of Texas. The sit-
uation is compounded when calibrated
ages are used because of the multiple in-
tercepts problem. Thus, without a clear
pathway to a calibrated scale, we have
opted to continue to work on the radio-
carbon scale, and we fully realize the po-
tential for unreliable assays and com-
pressed and stretched time scales.

Clovis Chronology

The absolute chronology for Clovis
occupations in Texas is reasonably estab-
lished at only three sites: Aubrey, Lubbock
Lake, and Miami. Three radiocarbon as-
says from below the Clovis occupation
at Miami establish a maximum age of
11,415 ! 125 b.p. for the component,
and two radiocarbon ages above the Clo-
vis component at Miami provide a mini-
mum age of 10,345 ! 330 b.p. (Holliday
et al. 1994). At Lubbock Lake, three de-
terminations are associated with Clovis.
The ﬁrst is actually from Stratum 1B at
41LU26 and is 11,100 ! 80 b.p. (Holli-
day et al. 1983). The other two determi-
nations are from Area 2. Feature FA2-1
in Stratum 1B has been identiﬁed as a
Clovis-age feature and is associated with an
assay of 11,100 ! 100 b.p. Feature FA2-2
is identiﬁed as Clovis and associated with
an assay of 9660 ! 100 b.p. The Clovis
assignments at Lubbock Lake are based
on stratigraphic position rather than the
recovery of diagnostic projectile points.

48 / TEXAS PREHISTORY

Fig. 2.44. Lubbock Lake radiocarbon assays: (a) plotted stratigraphically on radiocarbon time scale; (b) plotted stratigraphically on calibrated
time scale.

The oldest reliable radiocarbon assays as-
sociated with Clovis are from the Aubrey
site. These are 11,542 ! 111 b.p. and
11,590 ! 93 b.p. (Ferring 1994a). Except
for the Lubbock Lake assay associated with
Area 2, Feature FA2-2, all these determi-
nations suggest that Clovis could date
within the range of 11,500 to 11,100 b.p.
It is important to note that the bone
bed component in Stratum Isi at Wilson-
Leonard is stratiﬁed below three radiocar-
bon assays in Stratum Icl (10,920 ! 70
b.p., 11,190 ! 100 b.p., and 11,400 !
110 b.p.) that suggest it may be of Clovis
age, but Clovis materials are found below
this bone bed assemblage in the Igl gravel
bar. Also, Bone Bed 1 at Bonﬁre Shelter
(Stratum H-1) is dated to 12,460 ! 490
b.p. (Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Bement
1986), and even though this component
is lacking stone tools, it may represent a
Clovis or even a pre-Clovis occupation.
The anomalously old radiocarbon dates
from the Lewisville site near Dallas are
now known to have been on a low-grade

coal that apparently was used by the Paleo-
indian group for fuel. These age estimates
can now be safely ignored and the Lewis-
ville site should be accepted as a valid
Clovis occupation (Crook and Harris
1957, 1958, 1961; Stanford et al. 1995).
McFaddin Beach produced an 11,100 !
750 b.p. age on a tusk. However, this site
consists of materials, including a Clovis
point, that have washed up on the Gulf
shore, and the context is not secure.

Folsom-Midland Chronology

In Texas the number of sites with dated

Folsom or Midland occupations is only
slightly more than for Clovis sites. These
Folsom or Midland sites include Bonﬁre
Shelter, Midland, Lubbock Lake, Kincaid
Shelter, and Lipscomb. At Bonﬁre Shelter
a single Folsom point was found in a bone
bed with unﬂuted lanceolate points. Four
radiocarbon assays (9920 ! 150 b.p.,
10,100 ! 300 b.p., 10,230 ! 160 b.p.,
and 10,280 ! 430 b.p.) were obtained
on charcoal from a hearth in the bone

bed; however, the hearth was at the top of
the bone bed in Component C and the
Folsom point was from the bottom of
Component A. These assays strongly sug-
gest that the Bonﬁre bone bed had accu-
mulated by 9900 to 10,300 b.p., but this
range provides only a terminal date for the
Paleoindian use of the shelter. The Folsom
component at Bonﬁre Shelter must be
considered undated. Furthermore, the ca.
10,000 b.p. date is associated with a form
of projectile point that Kerr suggests is
similar to the Lubbock points at Lubbock
Lake (Knudson et al. 1998).

The dating situation is more complex

at the Midland site. No wood charcoal
was dated, and some less reliable materials
were selected for radiocarbon dating. Also,
two rarely used absolute dating tech-
niques (OSL and uranium-series) were
applied at the site. Compounding this sit-
uation is the problem of association and
stratigraphy. A major stratigraphic prob-
lem is the recent recognition that two red
sand units occur both above and below

the gray sand (Holliday and Meltzer
1996), which makes it impossible to de-
termine with which red sand many of the
radiometric samples were associated.

As discussed above, Holliday and Melt-
zer (1996) suggest that the in situ Folsom
occupation at Locality 3 is at the base of
the upper Red Sand, which is possibly
older than the Gray Sand. Wendorf (et al.
1955) and Wendorf and Krieger (1959)
argued that the Folsom component was
younger than the Gray Sand. The human
remains were found on the surface of the
Gray Sand. The recent uranium-series as-
say on the human remains from Midland
(calibrated to 11,600 ! 800 b.p.) is very
close to the calibrated 2-sigma range of
the radiocarbon assays at Wilson-Leonard
that are believed to bracket the calibrated
age of the Wilson component burial
(11,005 –10,682 b.p. and 11,910 –10,996
b.p.). Also, two of the stemmed projectile
points illustrated by Wendorf et al. (1955)
may be Wilson points.

At Lubbock Lake, a Folsom com-

ponent (FA6-8) was excavated in Stra-
tum 2A LB2. No diagnostic artifacts were
found in association. Radiocarbon assays
from this stratum are 10,060 ! 170 b.p.,
10,195 ! 165 b.p., 10,360 ! 80 b.p.,
and 10,540 ! 100 b.p. Only the last as-
say was run on charcoal, and it may be
the most accurate age estimate for a Lub-
bock Lake Folsom component even
though it was collected from a nonoccu-
pational context in Trench 109. Further-
more, it is the only Folsom or Clovis as-
say from Lubbock Lake used by R. Taylor
et al. in their 1996 review of Early Paleo-
indian radiocarbon assays.

The radiocarbon dates from Folsom
components at Kincaid Shelter and Lub-
bock Lake are younger than the range of
ages now accepted as Folsom (Haynes
1992), and conﬁrming the accuracy of
these age estimates requires further assess-
ments. Unfortunately, the absolute assays
from Lipscomb (see Table 2.1) do not
help clarify the age of Folsom or Midland
components in Texas. Thus, at least in

Texas, the radiocarbon age of Folsom sites
is not well established.

Plainview Chronology

The absolute chronology of Plainview
components in the Southern Plains is not
very well known. At the Plainview site it-
self only bone, sediment, and snail shell
have been dated, and the results are not
clear cut. Holliday (1997a) argues that
the occupation surface is positioned be-
tween the upper portion of Unit Im
dated to 10,940 b.p. and the lower por-
tion of Unit 3. However, it seems reason-
able to suggest that the occupation is at
least as old as the oldest bone apatite assay
at 10,200 b.p. One interpretation of the
stratigraphy (see above) could allow an
age estimate contemporary with the
10,940 b.p. assay. This estimate would
agree with the age estimate of the pos-
sible Plainview component at Wilson-
Leonard and with the estimates for
Goshen-Plainview components at the
Mill Iron site (Frison 1996).

b.p. All of these assays are on sediment or
bone, and charcoal assays from Lubbock
Lake are desperately needed to bolster the
existing radiocarbon chronology. Com-
pared to Wilson-Leonard and perhaps the
Plainview site, the Plainview components
at Lubbock Lake appear to be fairly
young. As discussed above, Kerr and
Dial’s 1998 quantitative analysis of pro-
jectile points did not classify any of the
points at Lubbock Lake as Plainview
points. Rather, these were grouped into
Lubbock points and St. Mary’s Hall
forms, and the dating at Lubbock Lake
may support this hypothesis.

At Horace Rivers ﬁve assays average
8990 b.p. The Horace Rivers material is
clearly very young, but these points were
not available for study and it is unclear if
they can be grouped with St. Mary’s Hall
forms. The Plainview component at Lake
Theo again is dated by inferior materials
(bone and sediment). The average radio-
carbon age of this site is 9185 b.p. An-
other possible Plainview component at
the Rex Rodgers site is dated by only one
assay at 9118 ! 83 b.p. Ryan’s site has
three assays, but none is in direct associa-
tion with the Plainview component. As
discussed earlier, Bonﬁre Shelter has been
proposed as one of the best-dated Plain-
view components in Texas. These age es-
timates suggest an average age of 10,130
b.p.; however, the date is associated with
a Lubbock point (see Kerr and Dial 1998).
The bone bed component in Stratum Isi
at Wilson-Leonard is stratiﬁed below
radiocarbon assays of 10,920 ! 70 b.p.,
11,190 ! 100 b.p., and 11,400 ! 110
b.p. These assays were run on sediment,
but the entire cienega sequence is well
constrained by multiple charcoal dates in
the Leanne Soil. Only more research will
help determine if this component at
Wilson-Leonard is truly associated with
Plainview.

At present, a case can be made for pro-

posing the existence of “early” or “true”
Plainview components and “late” Plain-
view or St. Mary’s Hall components. This
case is compounded, however, by the
misclassiﬁcation of a number of parallel-
stemmed lanceolate forms, at least in cen-
tral and south Texas, as Plainview. As

60 / TEXAS PREHISTORY

Kerr and Dial’s (1998) analysis showed,
many of these forms, especially in central
and south Texas, can now be considered
to be St. Mary’s Hall, but a small number
appear to be similar to true Plainview and
date fully to the Pleistocene. Still, there
clearly are parallel-stemmed lanceolate
projectile point forms, similar to Plain-
view, that are not Pleistocene in age.

Early Stemmed Projectile
Point Chronology

In 1940 Sellards and Evans published
the results of their excavations at Berclair
Terrace in Bee County. These excavations
took place long before radiocarbon dat-
ing, but among other discoveries they re-
ported the occurrence of stemmed projec-
tile points at depths that were clearly
Paleoindian in age. Few, if any, archeolo-
gists accepted these remains as Paleo-
indian, and the signiﬁcance of this dis-
covery remained on the back pages of
Texas archeology. In the 1960s LeRoy
Johnson and later William Sorrow exca-
vated early stemmed projectile points at
the Devil’s Mouth site (L. Johnson 1964;
Sorrow 1968). These projectile points
were again found at great depths, and
Sorrow obtained an 8780 ! 310 b.p. esti-
mate for the age of this occupation. In
1982, Leland Patterson (et al. 1987;
1995) obtained a date of 9920 ! 530
b.p. for a stemmed projectile point hori-
zon at 41WH19, but many were still not
ready to accept the possibility of the exis-
tence of a stemmed projectile point hori-
zon in the Paleoindian period.

It was not until the excavation and
analysis of the Wilson-Leonard site that it
became clear that a stemmed projectile
point horizon did indeed occur within
the Paleoindian period (Bousman 1998a;
M. Collins 1998b). At Wilson-Leonard,
the Wilson component was dated from
9990 ! 70 to 9530 ! 30 b.p. The Wil-
son-Leonard data conﬁrmed Patterson’s
results from 41WH19 and indicated that
stemmed Wilson points occurred strati-
graphically below Golondrina-Barber, St.
Mary’s Hall, and Angostura forms. Inter-
estingly, Wilson points bear a close re-
semblance to Kirk projectile points from
the southeastern United States, but ap-
parently Kirk components are found to
date between approximately 9500 and
9000 b.p. (D. Anderson and Sassaman
1996; Sassaman 1996).

San Patrice and Scottsbluff
Chronology

Only three excavated and dated sites
have produced projectile points that can
be classiﬁed as San Patrice: Wilson-
Leonard, Horn Shelter, and Rex Rodgers.
Rex Rodgers has only one bone apatite
date of 9118 ! 83 b.p., and it is suspect.
The bison remains from Rex Rodgers are
very large in size, which may indicate a
Late Pleistocene age for this occupation.
Horn Shelter produced four dates of
9500 ! 200, 9980 ! 370, 10,030 !
130, and 10,310 ! 150 b.p. The San
Patrice points at Wilson-Leonard are in
the middle of Unit II, which is dated be-
tween 9500 and 8400 b.p. Evidence from
all three sites suggests that San Patrice
points date between 10,300 and 9000 b.p.
Two Scottsbluff bases were found in

Unit II at Wilson-Leonard (Bousman
1998a). Very few have been found in
buried contexts. Buckner Ranch is one
exception (Sellards 1940), and more re-
cent investigations at Landa Park in New
Braunfels are another (Arnn and Bous-
man 1997). In no case was a reasonable
age estimate produced for this projectile
point form.

Golondrina-Barber Chronology

Three sites provide reasonable chrono-
logical information on Golondrina-Barber
components. Wilson-Leonard has these
points in Unit II, dated between 9500
and 8400 b.p. Most Golondrina-Barber
points are from the lower portion of Unit
II and certainly date to the older portion
of this time range. Baker Cave produced
four charcoal samples in direct association
with Golondrina points: 9180 ! 220,
9020 ! 150, 9030 ! 230, and 8910 !
140 b.p. These dates form a very tight
range. This ca. 9000 b.p. age range is
conﬁrmed by a single radiocarbon date
(8940 ! 700 b.p.) at the Lambs Creek
Knoll site in east-central Texas (Fields
1990; see also Fields, chapter 12, this
volume).

Angostura and Thrall Chronology

Few sites have well-dated Angostura
components. At the Richard Beene site in
southern Bexar County, an Angostura
component has associated radiocarbon
assays of 8805 ! 75 and 8640 ! 60 b.p.
At Wilson-Leonard, Angostura points are
poorly stratiﬁed within Unit II (dated be-

tween 9500 and 8400 b.p.), and they ap-
pear to date to the younger portion of
this time range. The radiocarbon dates as-
sociated with Angostura components at
Levi Rock Shelter and the Loeve site are
not well constrained (see Table 2.1) and
contribute little toward deﬁning the chro-
nology of Angostura points in Texas. The
Hausman Road site in Bexar County
(Tennis et al. 1996) has an age of 7920 !
50 b.p. for an Angostura component, but
it is difﬁcult to know if this is a reason-
able age, although Angostura and Thrall
points were found at Wilson-Leonard in
deposits that postdate 8400 b.p.

Components and Site
Distributions

A number of attempts have been made

since the mid-1980s to document more
fully the distribution of Paleoindian ma-
terials in limited areas across Texas (Hes-
ter 1980a, 1980b; L. Johnson 1964; Kib-
ler 1991, 1992; Largent 1995, et al. 1991;

Meltzer 1986, 1987; Meltzer and Bever
1995; Perttula 1989a, 1993c; Prewitt
1995; Story 1990). These efforts have fo-
cused mostly on obtaining information
from avocational and professional archeol-
ogists on a broad scale.

The majority of articles on Paleoindian
archeology in Texas consist of short pieces
concerning diagnostic point identiﬁca-
tions or descriptions, and the literature is
too numerous to include here. Usually
points are tallied by county, and individ-
ual sites are not reported. This current ef-
fort differs in that we used only the sites
in the TARL ﬁles or in publications. We
fully realize that this is an incomplete rec-
ord of Paleoindian occupation in Texas,
but it represents the locales with the most
complete information. As such, these lo-
cales can be revisited and further docu-
mented. According to the records at TARL
in 1994, 456 sites have recorded Paleo-
indian components, and 714 components
are documented (Table 2.2). These rec-
ords leave much to be desired, but they

constitute one of the foundation stones
for the Paleoindian record in Texas. The
problems in these records mirror the prob-
lems in the larger Paleoindian data base.
First among these are inconsistencies
in the recorded information, particularly
in projectile point typology and compo-
nent afﬁliation. For example, we have
lumped Plainview, a true Early Paleo-
indian type, with St. Mary’s Hall, Barber,
and other parallel-stemmed lanceolate
projectile point types that clearly date to
the Holocene because these have been
consistently confused by many archeolo-
gists working in Texas over the years. It
is impossible to unravel this typological
hodgepodge with the existing data on ﬁle
at TARL. To date, we believe that only
the Plainview site, Ryan’s site, Beidleman
Ranch, Bonﬁre Shelter, and possibly the
Bone Bed point at Wilson-Leonard qual-
ify as “Plainview” components (see typo-
logical discussions above). Other “true”
Plainview sites may exist but are too
poorly documented to be accepted.

A second problem is the lack of consis-

tency used to record these sites. Ninety-
three sites do not have enough informa-
tion to determine cultural afﬁliation. A
number also lack locational information.
Other problems certainly hide just under
the surface, but it is still worth scrutiniz-
ing the record.

If we look at the number of deﬁnite
Early, that is to say Pleistocene, Paleo-
indian components (n"143 or 20 per-
cent) versus the number of probable Late
Paleoindian components (n"571 or
80 percent), it is clear that a distinct in-
crease in Paleoindian components oc-
curred during the Holocene period. It is
unclear to what degree these shifts in
component numbers reﬂect shifts in pop-
ulation, but it is not unreasonable to sug-
gest that there was an associated increase
in Paleoindian population numbers from
the Pleistocene to the Holocene.

If we look at the number of Paleo-
indian components documented per site
(Table 2.3), more than 75 percent have
only one component, and more than
91 percent have three or fewer compo-
nents. Five or more components occur
at only twenty-one sites (less than 5 per-
cent). These sparse data do not constitute
a strong record demonstrating repeated
reoccupation of sites during the entire
Paleoindian period.

Another way to look at these patterns

is to compare the number of sites by
component with single or multiple com-
ponents (Table 2.4). Along with the raw
counts and the chi-square test of signiﬁ-
cance, we have calculated the adjusted
residuals to help identify signiﬁcant varia-
tions. The chi-square test is highly signiﬁ-
cant, and the adjusted residuals with val-
ues that are greater than 2, or less than
$2, are signiﬁcant at a 0.05 level of sig-
niﬁcance. We use the adjusted residuals
to recognize three patterns in these dis-
tributions. First, among Clovis, Folsom,
Wilson, and Scottsbluff sites there is a

fairly equal distribution among sites with
single and multiple components. Most
other sites occur in signiﬁcant numbers
with other components. The exceptions
are Dalton and San Patrice components,
as well as Paleoindian components of un-
known cultural afﬁliations, which occur
most commonly as single component sites.
The distribution of all recorded Paleo-
indian sites in Texas is shown in Fig. 2.45.
Some large gaps are instantly visible.
These include the Trans-Pecos, High

Plains, far south Texas, west-central Texas,
and western north-central Texas. The
low number of recorded sites in the High
Plains is very surprising, but all these gaps
should be remembered in the following
discussions. Another point is that the
concentrations of Paleoindian sites are
mostly a reﬂection of investigation effort
and, in part, the distribution of profes-
sional and avocational archeologists (e.g.,
the cluster in the Austin area). A second
map shows the distribution of sites with

The distribution of Clovis sites is
spread throughout the entire state, sug-
gesting that the Early Paleoindian groups
occupied all regions during this well-rec-
ognized period (see Fig. 2.46b). Also, the
number of Clovis sites is perhaps surpris-
ing for this early period, but this distribu-
tion is supported by Meltzer and Bever’s
(1995) distributional study.

Although Folsom/Midland sites ap-
pear to be more common in the prairies
and grasslands (see Fig. 2.46c), they are
unexpectedly common in east Texas
(Story 1990). Many investigators have
suggested that Folsom/Midland hunter-
gatherers were specialized bison hunters
(e.g., Hofman 1991b), but their occur-
rence in east Texas, when the pollen data
from east-central Texas indicates that
woodlands would have been extensive
(Bousman 1998b), suggests a more com-
plex adaptation.

The distribution of stemmed projectile

points associated with Paleoindian occu-
pations in the southern portion of the
state is also surprising (see Fig. 2.46d).
Among other sites, these included the
early stemmed components from the
Devil’s Mouth site in the Lower Pecos,
the Wilson component from the Wilson-
Leonard site near Austin, the stemmed
points from Berclair Terrace in Bee
County, and the stemmed component
from 41WH19. These sites may or may

unknown components (Fig. 2.46a). These
are concentrated in a band that extends
from far northern east Texas to the north-
ern part of central Texas. Although we
did not look at the name of the site re-

corder, the concentration in the north-
western part of central Texas is in the
Abilene area and may relate to the early
efforts of Cyrus Ray and E. B. Sayles, when
Paleoindian typology was in its infancy.

not have stemmed projectile point com-
ponents that are coeval, but it seems clear
that all are associated with Paleoindian
components and that none are present in
the northern part of the state.

The apparent complementary pattern
between Golondrina in the southwestern
part of the state and Dalton in the north-
east (see Fig. 2.46e), along with our typo-
logical analysis that suggests these are very

similar forms, indicates that some form of
relationship exists between these two
components. With such poor dates, espe-
cially in east Texas, it is unknown if one
predates the other or not. In other sites
such as Rodgers Shelter in Missouri, Dal-
ton occupations date to 10,530 ! 650
and 10,200 ! 330 b.p. (Wood and
McMillan 1976). These dates appear to
be ﬁfteen hundred to a thousand years

older than dated Golondrina occupations
in central and southwestern Texas.

In Fig. 2.46f, the wide distribution is
due to the combination of numerous point
forms under the term Plainview. Our typo-
logical analysis suggests that “true” Plain-
view (the similarity to the terms in the
Folsom typological debate is purposeful)
dates to the Pleistocene, and similar but
much younger forms such as Barber and

recognized as intensively sharpened paral-

incorporated mostly into Barber and
St. Mary’s Hall classes. The rare occur-
rence of Agate Basin, Hell Gap, Eden, and
Firstview types is shown in Fig. 2.46g.
The similarity of Thrall forms to Hell

Gap has been mentioned, and the correct
identiﬁcation for all of these forms should
be independently veriﬁed.

San Patrice and Scottsbluff site distri-
butions are presented in Figs. 2.46h and
2.46i. Both show a strong tendency to
occur in the eastern half of Texas, where
prairies and woodlands would have pre-
dominated. Even though LeRoy Johnson
(1989) has argued that Scottsbluff groups

originated in the Plains, the evidence sug-
gests that these are not Plains Paleoindian
groups. In contrast, the distribution of
Angostura sites tends to occur in the
southern half of the state (see Fig. 2.46j).
The Lubbock point found at Lubbock
Lake (Holliday and Johnson 1990), while
apparently older, is similar to Angostura
and may be confused with this terminal
Paleoindian form.

PALEOINDIAN ARCHEOLOGY IN TEXAS / 75

These distribution maps provide a vi-
sual source of information to assess some
of the biases in the Paleoindian archeo-
logical record of Texas. For example, only
one site from the Trans-Pecos region is on
record at TARL (see also Miller and Ken-
motsu, chapter 7, this volume). Obvi-
ously this area is grossly under repre-
sented. South Texas below the Nueces
River and even the High Plains may also
be inadequately represented. Recorder bi-
ases apparently account for the comple-
mentary spatial patterns between Golon-
drina and Dalton. Nevertheless, these
maps do provide a glimpse of cultural
patterns during the Paleoindian period.

Subsistence

The study of Paleoindian archeology
has been intimately tied to questions of
diet and subsistence. As high-proﬁle Late
Pleistocene mammoth and bison kill sites
began to be examined, simple models
were developed characterizing Paleo-
indians along a continuum from Clovis
mammoth hunters to Folsom bison
hunters to generalized Early Archaic
hunter-gatherers. Historically, all lanceo-
late projectile points were equated with
big-game hunting. We now know that
these models were oversimpliﬁed. As cul-
tural and radiocarbon chronologies for
the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene
transition become more complex and
difﬁcult to interpret, so too do answers to
questions focusing on subsistence adapta-
tions of the ﬁrst Americans.

The geographic variability within
Texas provides a unique opportunity for
addressing questions of variability in
Paleoindian subsistence. Faunal data from
Texas Paleoindian sites are summarized
below by Early Paleoindian (Pleistocene)
and Late Paleoindian (post-Pleistocene)
afﬁliations. A synopsis of these faunal
samples is presented in Table 2.5. Sites
with more questionable, or previously
discounted associations, are also included
in the table, but are not elaborated on in
the text.

Early Paleoindian

As previous portions of this chapter
have emphasized, the cultural chronology
of Paleoindian archeology is by no means
straightforward. For example, our metric
analysis and interpretation of Texas Paleo-

indian points as presented here contrasts
in several cases with other published in-
terpretations of these artifacts. Thus, it
remains difﬁcult to characterize in detail
the subsistence strategies of various Paleo-
indian populations when these cultural
afﬁliations and the absolute chronologies,
themselves, are in question.

Clovis.

The earliest Paleoindian sites from
Texas have yielded signiﬁcant faunal data
illustrating that Clovis peoples exploited a
broad range of animal species. This con-
trasts with the traditional view of Clovis
peoples as strictly mammoth hunters.
Foremost among these are the Aubrey
(Ferring 1989a, 1990b, 1995b; D. Hall
1996), Lewisville (Stanford 1982, 1983;
Stanford et al. 1995; D. Winkler 1982),
and Lubbock Lake sites (E. Johnson
1987c, 1991, 1995a, 1995b; Kreutzer
1987, 1988).

Aubrey is signiﬁcant in that its Clovis

faunal sample contains more than four
thousand elements (many burned) dis-
tributed in bone clusters around hearth
areas. A broad range of large and small
taxa are present, including Bison sp., deer,
rabbit, pocket gopher, vole, squirrel,
birds, turtles, and snakes (Ferring 1989a).
A full report on the site was in progress as
of 2001.

The faunal assemblage from the
Lewisville site also reﬂects a generalized
Clovis subsistence base as illustrated in a
paper by Stanford et al. (1995) titled
“Early Paleoindian Diet Breadth as Seen
from the Lewisville Site, Texas: Critter
Buffet as an Alternative to Mammoth
Barbeque.” They note that a broad range
of both vertebrate and invertebrate spe-
cies were recovered from feature contexts,
indicating that Clovis peoples introduced
these animals into the site as part of a
broad-based subsistence economy. While
a detailed report on these assemblages has
not been published, Dale A. Winkler
(1982) described the faunal assemblage
from Dennis Stanford’s 1978 –80 excava-
tions, in part to address questions of Clo-
vis diet.

Taxa identiﬁed by Winkler include
ﬁsh, box turtle (Terrapene carolina), poi-
sonous snake (Viperidae), water snake
(Nerodia sp.), alligator (Alligator mississip-
piensis), bird (Falconiformes), shrew
(Cryptotis parva), eastern mole (Scalopus

aquaticus), rabbit (Sylvilagus cf.
ﬂoridanus), prairie dog (Cynomys ludovi-
cianus), squirrel (Sciurus cf. niger), gopher
(Geomys bursarius), mouse (Oryzomys
palustris and Peromyscus sp.), rat (Sig-
modon hispidus and Neotoma ﬂoridana),
vole (Microtus sp. and Synaptomys sp.),
canid (Canis dirus), mammoth (Mam-
muthus sp.), horse (Equus sp.), and white-
tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Re-
garding taphonomy, Winkler noted that
the assemblage is highly fragmented and
that much of the bone is burned and was
recovered from features interpreted as
hearths (D. Winkler 1982, 17–18).
Overall, the assemblage is dominated by
turtles, rabbits, wood rats, and deer.

Clovis components from the Lubbock

Lake site also yielded a diverse range of
faunal subsistence data. Eileen Johnson,
who has worked extensively at the site,
was one of the ﬁrst Texas archeologists to
discuss in detail the concept that Paleo-
indians exploited a diverse range of both
large and small animal species (E. John-
son 1977). Clovis components from the
Lubbock Lake site have produced at least
seventy-six different species, including a
broad range of ﬁsh, salamanders, frogs,
turtles, tortoises, snakes, lizards, ducks,
other birds, shrews, rabbits, sciurids, go-
phers, mice, rats, voles, muskrat, canids,
mammoth, horse, camel, bison, and other
extinct Pleistocene faunas (E. Johnson
1986a, 252).

The Clovis-age megafaunal processing

station at Lubbock Lake is designated
FA2-1 (E. Johnson 1987a, 121; E. John-
son and Holliday 1985). Seven big-game
species were recovered: mammoth, camel,
horse (two species), extinct bison, short-
faced bear, and giant armadillo. An ex-
tensive list of small taxa, representing nu-
merous habitats, was also identiﬁed (E.
Johnson 1987c, 49 –89). Mammoth re-
mains dominate the processing station.
Portions of one adult and two young
mammoth were recovered. Activities
reﬂected at the site include secondary
butchering, marrow processing, and bone
quarrying. The site is signiﬁcant in that
it shows the Early Paleoindian processing
of a broad range of both megafauna and
smaller taxa at a single locale.

Other Clovis sites from Texas with
faunal assemblages include the Gault site
(41BL323), Sand Creek, Poverty Hill
(41HQ1), and the Miami site (41RB1).

PALEOINDIAN ARCHEOLOGY IN TEXAS / 79

conditions tend to produce diverse taxo-
nomic assemblages at water holes.

The overall picture reﬂected by Texas

Clovis assemblages is that while mam-
moth hunting was certainly part of the
Clovis subsistence repertoire, a broader
range of animals was also exploited. Clo-
vis mammoth sites that have been identi-
ﬁed in the state tend to be concentrated
on the Llano Estacado.

Clovis/Folsom

The chronology of other Early Paleo-
indian faunal samples from Texas is less
straightforward than for the Clovis sites
discussed above. Samples considered here
to be Clovis/Folsom include Pavo Real
(41BX52), Kincaid Shelter (41UV2), and
McLean (41TA29).

From the Pavo Real site, Jerry Hender-

son and Glen Goode (1991) described a
Paleoindian component with three Clovis
points, seven Folsom points, and six Fol-
som preforms. Two apparent hearths
yielded a meager faunal sample of one bi-
son tooth fragment and three unidentiﬁ-
able bone fragments.

Kincaid Shelter (M. Collins 1990b;

M. Collins et al. 1989b; Hester et al.
1985) produced both Clovis and Folsom
points along with a diverse faunal assem-
blage in Zone 4. Taxa included slider
turtle (Pseudemys sp.), box turtle (Ter-
rapene carolina), alligator (Alligator sp.),
armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), pocket
mouse (Perognathus hispidus), badger
(Taxidea taxus), raccoon (Procyon lotor),
extinct horse, and mammoth. The verte-
brate taphonomy of rockshelter deposits
is always difﬁcult to interpret, but if these
taxa do indeed reﬂect human procure-
ment (a detailed study has not been pub-
lished), it again illustrates a broad subsis-
tence base among early Paleoindians.

The McLean site, reported by Bryan
and Ray (1938), Ray (1942), and Ray and
Bryan (1938), was discovered in 1929 by
Cyrus Ray about 75 km southwest of
Abilene. Ray apparently collected materi-
als from the site before a 1938 excavation.
The site is reported to have produced evi-
dence of extinct mammoths and a Clovis
point in alluvium along Mulberry Creek.
However, illustrated points include forms
that today could be classiﬁed as Clovis,
Folsom, and Golondrina (Ray 1942);
these are clearly the result of multiple oc-
cupations. No fauna remains other than

Fig. 2.47. Plan of mammoth bones at the Duewall-Newberry site (after Steele and Carlson
1989a).

Investigations are currently being con-
ducted by Michael B. Collins at the Gault
site, situated in Bell County (M. Collins
1998c). Preliminary results indicate that
mammoth, horse, and bison remains were
associated with projectile points and knap-
ping debris. Collins suggests that “Clovis
and Folsom technologies were partly con-
temporary at this site” (1998d, 9). The
Sand Creek mammoth site (E. Johnson
et al. 1994) is situated approximately
30 km downstream from the Lubbock
Lake site. The remains of a mammoth
(Mammuthus columbi) were recovered
there in Yellowhouse Canyon, eroding
from Late Pleistocene lacustrine deposits.
The partial skeleton (694 bone segments
were mapped) was associated with a chert
tool. The types of bone fracturing noted
suggested that humans may have played
a role in their breakage. The chert tool is
not diagnostic but has bifacial ﬂaking and
use wear. The site is included here as a
probable Clovis site.

Poverty Hill (41HQ1), also on the
Llano Estacado, produced a Clovis point
associated with mammoth tusk fragments.
Wayne Parker (1983) reports this as a
possible Paleoindian mammoth kill site.
The central Texas Duewall-Newberry
site (41BZ76) had no stone artifacts, al-
though detailed taphonomic analysis by
D. Gentry Steele and David L. Carlson
strongly suggests this was a Paleoindian
mammoth butchering site (Carlson and
Steele 1992; Carlson et al. 1984; Steele
1990; Steele and Carlson 1984, 1989a,
1989b). This suggestion is based on bone

breakage patterns and what has been inter-
preted as piles of bones stacked by Paleo-
indian hunters or scavengers (Fig. 2.47).
More widely known among Texas
Paleoindian mammoth sites is the Miami
site, also known as Cowan Ranch (Hol-
liday et al. 1991, 1994; J. J. Saunders
1980; Sellards 1938, 1952). The site was
the third Clovis mammoth kill site to be
investigated in North America (Sellards
1938). Evans and Sellards conducted in-
vestigations there, excavating the partial
remains of ﬁve mammoths ( J. J. Saunders
1980). They were found with three Clo-
vis points and a nondiagnostic stone tool.
The site was reinvestigated by Holliday
et al. (1991, 1994). They recovered an
additional 336 bone and tooth fragments.
Sellards (1952, 23) originally proposed
that the Miami mammoths probably died
of natural causes at a water hole during a
drought and were butchered and scav-
enged by Clovis peoples. J. J. Saunders’s
(1980) analysis of the skeletons, however,
showed that three of the ﬁve mammoths
were mature or nearly mature and two
were immature. His study suggested that
these age proﬁles compare favorably with
matriarchal family unit structures of
modern elephants, thus supporting Saun-
ders’s herd confrontation model ( J. J.
Saunders 1977), in which a single family
unit was confronted, contained, and dis-
patched by Clovis hunters ( J. J. Saunders
1980). The lack of other fauna in the as-
semblage also makes it unlikely that the
scavenging model is accurate in this case.
Shipman (1975) has noted that drought

80 / TEXAS PREHISTORY

mammoth were recovered, and the bones
were scattered. Thomas N. Campbell,
who was Ray’s ﬁeld assistant during the
July, 1938, excavation, doubts that Clovis
materials and the mammoth were in di-
rect association (Campbell, 1978 letter to
Thomas R. Hester). The fauna and Clo-
vis point association, and thus the gener-
ally accepted interpretation of McLean as
a Clovis mammoth kill, must remain in
serious question.

Folsom/Midland

Additional Early Paleoindian sites
include those classiﬁed here as Folsom/
Midland. These assemblages include Lake
Theo, Lipscomb, Lubbock Lake, Lub-
bock Landﬁll, Scharbauer (Midland), and
Shifting Sands.

Two bone beds were excavated at Lake
Theo in the Rolling Plains (Harrison and
Smith 1975; Harrison and Killen 1978).
The lower bed contained Folsom points
in association with Bison antiquus, and
the upper bone bed is associated with an
unﬂuted parallel-stemmed lanceolate
point that was classiﬁed as Plainview. The
Folsom/Midland component contained
524 bison bones from at least twelve ani-
mals, and Harrison and Smith (1975,74)
interpreted the site as a butchering station
and camp site, rather than a kill site, based
on element representation, possible bone
stacking, and the lithic assemblage. Age
estimation of the bison suggested a late
summer or early fall kill.

Lipscomb is another key Paleoindian
site, and it is cited widely in discussions
of Folsom lifeways (Barbour and Schultz
1941; Hofman 1995; Hofman and
Todd 1990, 1995; Hofman et al. 1989a,
1991b; Schultz 1943; Todd 1991; Todd
et al. 1990, 1992). At least ﬁfty individ-
ual Bison antiquus were recovered there
(Fig. 2.48). Interpretation of the site has
varied greatly over the years. It has been
described as a ﬁre drive, an arroyo trap, a
snow drift trap, and a surround (Hofman
et al. 1991b, 162). Reinvestigation of the
site was carried out in 1988 (Hofman
et al. 1991b). A notable feature of the
faunal sample is the incomplete butcher-
ing of the bison. This feature, in conjunc-
tion with limited marrow extraction from
the bison, may reﬂect a gourmet butcher-
ing strategy in which only choice parts
are removed, or it may reﬂect warm
weather conditions in which the group

could not fully exploit the meat before it
spoiled (Hofman et al. 1991b, 184). De-
tails on the topographic setting and na-
ture of the kill episode itself are yet to be
resolved.

The Shifting Sands site (41WK21)
represents another Folsom/Midland pe-
riod bison procurement site (Amick et al.
1989; Amick and Rose 1990; Hofman
et al. 1990). The site produced thousands
of Folsom/Midland artifacts and bison
bones (Bison sp.) from a series of dune
blowouts (Amick et al. 1989). More than
four hundred Folsom/Midland artifacts

and thousands of pieces of chipping de-
bris were collected. At least one bison
kill /butchery event was identiﬁed from
Area 3 (Hofman et al. 1990). Although
the bones lack butchering marks, a
butchering episode is suggested based on
the occurrence of projectile point frag-
ments, choppers, and ﬂake tools, along
with a low debris density associated with
the bones (Hofman et al. 1990, 233).
While mammoth bones were also found
at the site, these were recovered from
Area 2 and had no associated artifacts.
Additional Folsom/Midland subsis-

PALEOINDIAN ARCHEOLOGY IN TEXAS / 81

tence evidence is available from the Lub-
bock Lake site. The Folsom bison kill
there is designated FA6-8 (E. Johnson
1987a, 124). The sample includes at least
three bison (one subadult and two adults)
that were killed and processed at the lo-
cale. Processing activities associated with
the skeletons included bone stacking, car-
cass processing, limited marrow process-
ing, and expedient bone tool manufac-
ture. Eileen Johnson (1987c) interprets
most of the bone breakage as the result of
tool manufacture rather than marrow ex-
traction. Muskrat bones from the locale
have cut marks, again illustrating the ex-
ploitation of both large and small taxa by
Folsom hunters. Other freshwater ﬁsh
and turtles were also recovered here.

Another Folsom example is the City of
Lubbock landﬁll site, located in Blackwa-
ter Draw outside of Lubbock, Texas (D.
Brown 1993; E. Johnson 1993b, 1994a).
The site appears to have been occupied
repeatedly by Folsom-age peoples. A prob-
able bison butchering episode occurred,
along with possible food processing and
camping activities based on sequential
hearths and burned bone. The site had a
signiﬁcant faunal assemblage consisting of
11,078 specimens. The majority of these
were recovered from ﬁne-screen process-
ing of matrix samples, highlighting the
importance of reﬁned recovery methods
when addressing questions of subsistence
data and environmental change. Folsom-
aged fauna recovered from Stratum 2 in-
cluded catﬁsh, pond slider, frog, ground
squirrel, prairie dog, pocket gopher,
vole, muskrat, and extinct bison (Bison
antiquus).

A ﬁnal Folsom/Midland faunal assem-

blage considered here is from the Mid-
land (Scharbauer) site (Gazin 1955; Hol-
liday and Meltzer 1996; Quinn 1955;
Wendorf et al. 1955; Wendorf and Krieger
1959). As previously described, the geo-
chronology of this site is very complex
and all of the faunal sample is not neces-
sarily reﬂective of human subsistence re-
mains, nor is it associated with the Folsom
or Midland occupations. A diverse range
of extinct and extant taxa were found,
including horse, bison, peccary, camel,
antelope, mammoth, bird, turtle, sloth,
cervid, rabbit, rat, prairie dog, mouse,
and wolf (Wendorf et al. 1955, 132).
Overall, Folsom components from
Texas that do contain faunal assemblages

have included bison. However, a broad
range of taxa is also represented at many
sites. If representative of human procure-
ment, these faunal assemblages suggest
additional and diverse hunting and pro-
curement methods for Folsom hunters.
These ﬁndings are similar to those of
Daniel S. Amick (1994a), who noted that
while the Folsom diet seems to have been
primarily organized around bison pro-
curement, at least thirty-three other spe-
cies of animals have been recovered from
Folsom sites in the American Southwest.

Folsom/Plainview

Perhaps the best known of Texas Paleo-
indian sites is Bonﬁre Shelter (41VV218)
in Val Verde County (see also Turpin,
chapter 8, this volume). Dibble identiﬁed
three depositional zones and three bone
beds at Bonﬁre Shelter (Dibble and Lor-
rain 1968, 24 –27). The oldest, Bone Bed
1, consisted of a small amount of bone
not clearly associated with humans. It in-
cluded the remains of camel, horse, mam-
moth, and bison. Bone Bed III was Ar-
chaic in age, reﬂecting a modern bison
jump. Bone Bed II was a thick bison de-
posit with points typed as Plainview, along
with a Folsom point in the lower portion
of the bed and a Lubbock point in the
top of the bone bed. The bison were
identiﬁed as B. antiquus or B. occidentalis.
It is clear they were driven off the bluff
and butchered on site in the sheltered
area below. The standards of analysis set
by Dibble and Lorrain (who analyzed the
bison bone) more than thirty years ago
are hard to match even today.

Lorrain suggested that Bone Bed 2
represents several drives of small herds
throughout different seasons. It likely
represents three groups of animals killed
in separate jumps. Approximately 120 bi-
son were identiﬁed from Bone Bed 2.
Ages ranged from immature to mature.
Approximately equal numbers of males
and females were represented. The sea-
son(s) of the drives could not be deter-
mined. Butchering appears to have taken
place completely within the shelter. Ani-
mals were ﬁrst skinned and cut into large
segments that were moved to another
area of the shelter for further processing.
Other animals recovered from Bone Bed
II included pocket gopher, pocket mouse,
white-footed mouse, cotton rat, wood rat,
horse, and snake.

Plainview-Milnesand

Plainview sites from Texas with faunal

assemblages include Beidleman Ranch,
Lake Theo, Lone Wolf Creek, Wilson-
Leonard, Lubbock Lake, and the Plain-
view site. Located between two tributaries
of the Brazos River, the Beidleman Ranch
site had a bone bed of extinct bison in as-
sociation with two Plainview points. The
bone sample included “jaws, vertebrae,
leg bones, one skull, and numerous teeth”
(Suhm 1961, 208). The site, excavated
by WPA crews in 1939, was surmised
by Suhm (1961) to be the scene of a bi-
son kill.

The Wilson-Leonard site in central
Texas also produced a Plainview bison
component known as the Bone Bed Com-
ponent (Baker 1998; M. Collins 1998c;
M. Collins et al. 1993; Masson and
Collins 1995). This component dates to
greater than 11,000 b.p. (Stafford 1998),
and along with other valuable informa-
tion it provides evidence that Plainview
occupations are truly Pleistocene in age.
Excavations by TxDOT (using quarter-
inch screening) yielded 32 bison bones
and a single horse navicular from this
component, along with a diverse range
of other animals, including musk turtle,
indeterminate small mammal, medium/
large-sized mammal, large mammal, bi-
son-sized mammal, rabbit/hare, indeter-
minate artiodactyl, and large artiodactyl.
Burned bone totaled 134 specimens, in-
cluding two unidentiﬁed turtle elements
and three bison elements. Spiral fractures
were identiﬁed on a large artiodactyl frag-
ment and a bison humerus and meta-
carpal. At least two individual bison are
represented in the bone bed, including an
adult and a juvenile (based on the pres-
ence of two right astragali). Age structure
was based on dentition and epiphyseal fu-
sion. The wide range of elements present
(including low utility elements) suggests
the bison were killed and butchered at or
near the site (Baker 1998). Later excava-
tions at the site by TARL recovered an
additional 236 faunal specimens from
eighth-inch screening. The sample is
dominated by indeterminate fragments
(n"121). Taxa include turtle, jackrabbit,
cottontail, and bison.

Lone Wolf Creek was one of the ﬁrst
archeological sites that provided solid evi-
dence for the presence of Pleistocene hu-
mans in North America (Cook 1925,

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

02-A2946  4/13/04  11:51 AM  Page 82

82 / TEXAS PREHISTORY

1926, 1927; Figgins 1927; Hay and Cook
1930; Wormington 1957, 110 –11).
There, the articulated bones of an extinct
bison were jacketed and removed in block
form using paleontological excavation
techniques. Upon further excavation in
the laboratory, three Milnesand points
were recovered from the skeleton. This
site was crucial for documenting human
associations with extinct faunas and for
beginning to address the question of
Paleoindian subsistence. While the Lone
Wolf Creek projectile points are now
classiﬁed as Plainview, it was not until
two decades later that the Plainview type
site itself was excavated.

The Plainview site (41HA1) bison bed
was discovered in 1933, and caliche quar-
rying operations continued to expose
more of the bed until 1941, when mining
for the road-grade stone ceased (Speer
1990). The site was excavated in 1945 by
Glen Evans, Grayson Meade, E. H. Sel-
lards, and others. Amazingly, more than
one hundred bison were discovered in
association with human artifacts. The
deﬁnitive report was published by Sel-
lards et al. (1947). The skeletons of late-
term fetuses suggested that the bison kill
event occurred in the spring. The bison
bones were recovered from pond sedi-
ments, suggesting the bison stampeded
into the water hole. All of the lithic tools
were recovered from the top part of the
bone bed; thus Sellards et al. (1947) pro-
posed that the Plainview hunters shot
down at the herd from a bluff.

Over the decades, other investigations

have been conducted at the Plainview
site (Speer 1990). Guffee (1979), for ex-
ample, recovered an additional thirty-ﬁve
hundred bison bones and fragments from
the site, but a complete analysis has never
been undertaken. Recently, Jose Luis
Lanata and C. Britt Bousman measured
the metapodials in an attempt to deter-
mine the size of the bison and compare
these bones to other samples from the
Southern Plains. The size of the Plain-
view bison metacarpals (Fig. 2.49) shows
that these bison were very large, and in
fact larger than the measured bison from
Bonﬁre Shelter and Milnesand but not
Rex Rodgers (Bousman et al n.d.). If the
evolution of bison in the Southern Plains
reﬂected a simple unilinear decrease in
size from Bison antiquus to Bison bison,
then it is possible that Plainview is older
than Bonﬁre Shelter.

Investigations at Lake Theo in 1977
uncovered a Plainview bison component
that postdated the Folsom/Midland
sample recovered there in 1974 (Harrison
and Killen 1978). The bone bed (West
Trench 7) contained the remains of at
least three individuals (Harrison and
Killen 1978, 34). Metric analysis sug-
gested that an adult male, an adult fe-
male, and a juvenile of indeterminate sex
were represented.

In contrast to Folsom sites, the Plain-
view sites from Texas predominantly re-
ﬂect bison procurement locales to the
exclusion of other animal species. Con-
sidering that the majority of these Plain-
view sites were excavated prior to the now
common practice of ﬁne screening and
bulk matrix processing, part of this pattern
may be the result of sampling strategies.

Late Paleoindian

Late Paleoindian sites (those dating to
the Early Holocene) have produced fau-
nal samples and subsistence data from a
number of locales. These include site
41WH19, Baker Cave, Big Lake, Horace
Rivers, Lubbock Lake, Rex Rodgers,
Richard Beene, Seminole-Rose, and
Wilson-Leonard.

William McClure analyzed a Late
Paleoindian faunal sample from 41WH19
along the Texas coast (McClure 1983;
Patterson et al. 1987, 19 –26). The site
contains Paleoindian through Late Prehis-

toric archeological deposits. Stratum 3
and the upper portions of Stratum 4 are
interpreted as Late Paleoindian in age.
Area A had a mammoth or mastodon
bone fragment, although its cultural asso-
ciation is unclear. Fauna from Strata 3
and 4 of Area B included gar, bowﬁn,
freshwater drum, sunﬁsh, colubrid snake,
softshell turtle, rodents, rabbit, bison, and
deer. Patterson et al. note that “small ﬁsh,
turtles, snakes, and deer were used as
food resources during the entire occupa-
tion sequence” (1987, 25).

The Horace Rivers site (41HH23) is
reported by Robert J. Mallouf and Rolfe
D. Mandel (1997) as a late Plainview site,
although we have suggested it may repre-
sent a St. Mary’s Hall component. The
diverse faunal assemblage includes bison,
antelope, deer, rabbits, muskrats, wolves,
badgers, skunks, squirrels, prairie dogs,
birds, snakes, turtles, lizards, frogs, ﬁsh,
and mussels (Mallouf and Mandel 1997).
The faunal sample suggests these Paleo-
indians were broad-spectrum generalists
and not specialized big-game hunters.

The Richard Beene site (41BX831) in
Bexar County produced a small (n"726)
Late Paleoindian faunal sample (B. Baker
1992, 1993; Baker and Steele 1992;
Flaigg 1996; Thoms 1992, 1995; Thoms
et al. 1996; Thoms and Mandel 1992).
Only twenty-ﬁve specimens were identi-
ﬁed to the taxonomic level of class. These
faunal remains were recovered from strata

02-A2946  4/13/04  11:51 AM  Page 83

PALEOINDIAN ARCHEOLOGY IN TEXAS / 83

that yielded a wide variety of cultural ma-
terial, including intact and partially intact
features. Some of the bone is burned.
Taxa include ﬁsh, snake, small mammal,
rabbit, small rodent, gopher, wood rat,
and unidentiﬁed artiodactyl; no bison-
sized bone was present in this sample.
The sample reﬂects riparian and forest
edge exploitation.

The Wilson-Leonard site in central

Texas has multiple Late Paleoindian
components (Bousman 1998a; see also
M. Collins, chapter 3, this volume). The
Wilson component from Stratum Isi(c)
had a moderate-sized sample from quar-
ter-inch screening (n"1,847), with Ki-
nosternid turtle, bird, rodent, jackrabbit,
cottontail, cf. Canis sp., deer, and bi-
son. The sample is extensively burned
(n"1,509 or 82 percent). The eighth-
inch sample (n"1,521) had a similar fau-
nal component of Kinosternid turtle,
snake, large bird, bison-sized mammal,
shrew, jackrabbit, cottontail, cf. ground
squirrel, gopher, wood rat, and indeter-
minate artiodactyl. More than 70 percent
was also burned. TARL ﬁne screening
also recovered bird eggshell from the Wil-
son component.

A second Late Paleoindian component

from Wilson-Leonard is a mixture of
Golondrina, Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall
materials in Stratum II. In terms of fauna,
excavations by TxDOT recovered 1,542
specimens. Taxa included turtle, large
bird, bison-sized mammal, jackrabbit,
cottontail, canid, and pronghorn/deer.
Later excavations by TARL produced an
additional 4,593 elements, with ﬁsh,
turtle, lizard/snake, jackrabbit, cf. cotton-
tail, gopher, wood rat, carnivore, and
deer. These Late Paleoindian components
from Wilson-Leonard reﬂect the diverse
exploitation of riparian, forest, and grass-
land species.

Baker Cave, in Val Verde County, of-
fers unique insights into Late Paleoindian
subsistence (Chadderdon 1983; Hester
1978a, 1983, 1986a; Hester and Shafer
1995; Word and Douglas 1970). Faunal
and ﬂoral data recovered from a Golon-
drina hearth with multiple episodes of
use provide clear evidence for broad-
spectrum adaptations during the Late
Pleistocene/Early Holocene transition. As
Hester noted, “These sites have been im-
portant in dispelling the big game hunter
myth that has so commonly surrounded
the study of Paleo-Indian cultures”

(1983, 101). The Golondrina hearth pro-
duced the remains of sixteen species of
seeds and fruit, eight wood species, eleven
mammal species, six ﬁsh species, and sev-
enteen reptile species (including snakes
and lizards). This estimate of diversity is
conservative, since not all of the hearth
ﬁll has been processed and analyzed (Hes-
ter 1983). Hester (1983, 116) also makes
the key observation that while distinc-
tions can continue to be made between
Paleoindian and Archaic populations
based on lithic technologies, we cannot
continue to do so on the basis of subsis-
tence adaptations.

The Seminole-Rose site had a bison
bone bed that Hofman et al. (1990) in-
terpret as afﬁliated with Cody Complex
Firstview artifacts. No spiral fractures or
cut marks have been identiﬁed on the
bone, though some specimens are burned.
At least four bison are represented from
at least three age groups.

The Big Lake site (41RG13) in Reagan

County is reported by Turpin (1994b)
and Turpin et al. (1992, 1997). At least
ten bison were identiﬁed from a single
event kill dating to ca. 8000 b.p. The
herd, composed of calves, juveniles, and
cows, became stuck in saturated lacus-
trine clays and were dispatched. This in-
terpretation is strongly supported by the
fact that the limb bones of the bison were
still vertically embedded in the deposits.
While the taxonomy of the genus Bison
is not clear cut, the bones were smaller
than those of Bison antiquus and larger
than B. bison, falling within the size range
of female B. occidentalis (Turpin et al.
1997, 130).

The Rex Rodgers site (41BI42) also
represents a bison procurement site, al-
though its chronological assignment is
less clear (Speer 1975, 1978a, 1978b).
Chronometric dates for the bison post-
date the Pleistocene, although their large
size is more in line with earlier bison pop-
ulations. While projectile points from the
site have been described as Plainview-like,
it is possible they are St. Mary’s Hall
and/or parallel-sided stem. Six or more
bison are represented, including a juve-
nile and adult males and females. Charles
Reher (in Speer 1978b, 119) inferred a
winter kill for the bison ( January through
March) based on tooth wear.

The “Plainview” locale at the Lubbock

Lake site is designated FA6-11 (E. John-
son 1987a, 126). Although the associated

projectile points were originally typed as
Plainview, the reclassiﬁcation by Kerr in-
dicates the type to be St. Mary’s Hall
(Kerr and Dial 1998). Four primary con-
centrations contained a minimum of six
bison, with each group representing an
individual. A fetus, three subadults, and
two adults were identiﬁed. Meat and hide
processing is reﬂected. Interestingly, nine
muskrats were disarticulated and concen-
trated around the carcasses. Cut marks
were noted on four of the muskrat bones
(E. Johnson 1987a, 129). Other animals
included ducks, pronghorn, and deer.
This faunal pattern is similar to that
noted at the Lubbock Lake Folsom locale.
A second Plainview bison kill locale at
Lubbock Lake has been designated FA9-
1. Here, at least ﬁve bison are represented
(E. Johnson 1987a, 129).

Late Paleoindian (Firstview) locales at
Lubbock Lake include FA6-3, FA5-8/10,
and FA6-3(?) (E. Johnson 1987a, 129 –
31). The ﬁrst of these (FA6-3) yielded at
least seven bison stacked in bone piles.
They included three fetuses, two calves,
and two adults. The animals were in-
completely butchered, suggesting that
selective cuts of meat were chosen. The
second locale (FA5-8/10) had little sub-
sistence data. The assemblage included
percussion ﬂakes but no bone tools. At
least two bison (a fetus and a subadult)
were present. The third locale has been
interpreted both as a plant processing and
harvesting area (Bamforth 1985) and as a
camp (E. Johnson and Holliday 1981).
The area consists of a wide lithic and food
debris scatter. Animals present are prong-
horn, jackrabbit, cottontail, mallard, cin-
namon teal, gadwall, pintail, and grouse.
As with Early Paleoindian sites from

Texas, these Late Paleoindian samples
reﬂect a diversity in subsistence econo-
mies. In part, this situation is a reﬂection
of the geographic diversity and differen-
tial species availability across prehistoric
Texas, but it may also reﬂect differences
in seasonal food procuring strategies.

Discussion

Our understanding of Paleoindian
subsistence has progressed signiﬁcantly
throughout much of the twentieth cen-
tury, although much remains unknown.
Progress has come from advances in the
ﬁelds of zooarcheology and taphonomy
and through more reﬁned ﬁeld recovery
techniques. These techniques have con-

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

02-A2946  4/13/04  11:51 AM  Page 84

tributed greatly to our understanding of
the nature and context of subsistence data.
In contrast, detailed botanical evidence is
still lacking in most cases, especially from
Early Paleoindian components. Other po-
tential avenues for investigating questions
of Paleoindian subsistence include artifact
residue analysis, hair analysis (e.g., studies
by researchers at the Center for the Study
of the First Americans), and studies of
Paleoindian skeletons. As described be-
low, in fact, the results of dental micro-
wear studies of the Wilson-Leonard Paleo-
indian skeleton differ little from those of
later Archaic groups, suggesting an overall
continuity in subsistence strategies.

Human Remains

Texas has yielded several of the most
important Paleoindian skeletons recov-
ered from North America. These ﬁnds
have been crucial for understanding the
migration, biology, and burial customs of
the earliest known inhabitants of the con-
tinent. Several early reports of Pleistocene
human skeletons from the state, however,
have proven unveriﬁed or discounted.
Even these examples, though, played im-
portant roles in establishing research pro-
grams focusing on methods and questions
regarding the antiquity of humans in
North America. Overall, these early ex-
amples reﬂect the common problem in
American archeology at that time of doc-
umenting the Pleistocene presence of hu-
mans in North America (Meltzer 1993a,
1993b). The disciplines of geoarcheology,
radiocarbon dating, and zooarcheology,
which contribute extensively to today’s re-
search on human habitation, were still
very much in their infancy. In many
cases, these early skeleton-bearing strata
had been accidentally discovered by geol-
ogists, who then investigated the sites and
contributed greatly to our understanding
of the strata’s formation processes (Holli-
day 1997a).

Poorly Understood Burials
Lagow Sand Pit

Several years before the Folsom site
discovery (Figgins 1927), Shuler (1923)
reported on human remains associated
with Pleistocene faunas from the Lagow
Sand Pit in Dallas. This sand pit had
long been a source of Pleistocene fossil
specimens for paleontologists at Southern
Methodist University. Pit workers recov-

84 / TEXAS PREHISTORY

ered the remains of an adult male human
there in 1920. Chemical analysis of the
human bones and extinct camel from the
site indicated, at that time, that the hu-
man remains and extinct fauna had un-
dergone the same degree of fossilization,
suggesting they were contemporaneous
(Shuler 1923). Despite the potential im-
portance of the ﬁnd, the results were
largely ignored.

For many years previously, the phys-

ical anthropologist Ales Hrdlicka had
staunchly argued against the presence of
Pleistocene humans in North America,
setting an intellectual tone for rigorous
validation of such claims (reminiscent of
current debates regarding pre-Clovis oc-
cupations in the Americas). It was not
until Sellards (1952) reviewed the site
that it again gained notice. Shortly there-
after, Crook and Harris (1957, 1958) de-
scribed the context of the Lagow Sand Pit
human remains in their analysis of the
Lewisville site material.

This increased attention led Kenneth
P. Oakley and William W. Howells (1961)
to conduct further chemical tests on the
bones. They applied the F-U-N test to
the human and faunal remains from the
site to measure their ﬂuorine, uranium,
and nitrogen content. This test was the
same one used to prove the Piltdown for-
gery (Bowie and Davidson 1955). The
differing amounts of these chemicals
showed that the human bones from the
Lagow Sand Pit were not contemporane-
ous with the Pleistocene faunas. Crook
(1961) reinterpreted the human skeleton
as intrusive into the Upper Shuler yel-
low sand, with a possible Early Archaic
afﬁliation.

Denton Creek

The wide attention ultimately given to

the Lagow Sand Pit skeleton contrasts
with less well known examples from Texas.
Claude Albritton and Pattillo (1940), for
example, described a possible Pleistocene
skeleton from Denton Creek, a branch of
the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. The
skeleton was found in sand approximately
six feet below the surface of a terrace.
Albritton and Pattillo suggested that if it
proved to be contemporaneous with the
sand deposit, the skeleton could be Pleis-
tocene in age. The accompanying skeletal
analysis by Marcus Goldstein concluded
the skeleton was that of a female approxi-
mately sixty years old. Several medical

disorders were indicated, including ante-
mortem tooth loss, periostitis, and arthri-
tis. It was not determined in the ﬁeld
whether the skeleton was deposited along
with the ﬂuvial sands or represented a hu-
man interment intrusive into the deposit.
Goldstein’s assessment of the complete-
ness of the skeletal remains, however, sug-
gested to him that the skeleton was a hu-
man burial.

J. C. Putnam Skeleton

In 1945, Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., of
the Smithsonian Institution described a
possible Pleistocene human burial from
the Abilene, Texas, area (Roberts 1945).
The discovery was made in 1943 by boys
swimming in the Clear Fork of the Brazos
River. The ﬁnd was reported to Dr.
Cyrus N. Ray, a well-known ﬁgure in
Texas archeology (see E. Davis 1979;
Tunnell 2000). Ray and others removed
the skeleton, which was buried in a
tightly ﬂexed position on its left side. The
burial pit contained a mixture of ash and
charcoal, and the tip of a biface was re-
covered in the burial ﬁll (Roberts 1945,
10 –11). The pit was in deposits known
as Elm Creek silts, believed to be Late
Pleistocene in age (Roberts 1945, 17).
Hoping to clarify the chronological posi-
tion of the skeleton, Ray conducted an
extensive but fruitless search for animal
bones and artifacts along the river.
The heavy brow ridges and thick
frontal bone of the skeleton, which con-
trasts with more contemporary Native
American populations, suggested to Ray
and Roberts that this might represent an
early and signiﬁcant human skeleton.
The skeleton was sent to Dr. Harry L.
Shapiro, chairman of the Department of
Anthropology at the American Museum
of Natural History, who agreed, stating
that “the frontal does have an exception-
ally heavy brow ridge and an apparently
sharply receding forehead. This suggests a
primitive form of recent man” (quoted in
Roberts 1945, 45).

T. Dale Stewart, curator of the Divi-
sion of Physical Anthropology at the U.S.
National Museum, spent additional time
reconstructing and studying these re-
mains. He concluded that the “skeleton
presents no unusual features setting it
apart from other remains of known
American Indians from this region”
(Stewart 1945, 38). He did not comment
on the speculation regarding the heavy

brow ridge. As Wormington (1957, 225 –
26) noted, despite the fact that the skele-
ton was recovered from deeply buried
silts, its age remained uncertain.

The summary in Roberts’s paper

(1945, 29) is noteworthy, for it reiterated
that investigators attempting to deter-
mine the chronological age of apparently
early skeletons should have a detailed un-
derstanding of the strata in which the
bones are deposited rather than focusing
on skeletal morphology alone. This con-
cept of dating based on skeletal morphol-
ogy was reviewed several years later by
Stewart (1949).

Brazos River Skeleton and Extinct Fauna
In another case, Adams (1949) re-
ported on a ﬁnd along the Brazos River.
It contained four individuals (two female,
one male, and one infant), which he indi-
cated were associated with a hearth. Other
associated remains included extinct glyp-
todont, bison, and ground sloth. While
his report describes the osteological fea-
tures of the human skeletons in detail, no
additional contextual information was
presented to allow evaluation of their pos-
sible Pleistocene association. To our
knowledge, this association has never
been reevaluated.

Midland (Scharbauer Ranch).

The Midland site and skeleton were
discovered in 1953 when Keith Glasscock
noted human bones and projectile points
eroding from a blowout in a dry channel
of Monahans Draw, near Midland, Texas
(Albritton 1955; Holliday 1997a; Holli-
day and Meltzer 1996; McKinney 1992;
Oakley and Rixon 1958; Stewart 1955;
Wendorf and Krieger 1959; Wendorf
et al. 1955; Wormington 1957, 241– 46).
The projectile points from the site formed
the Midland type collection, a newly rec-
ognized Paleoindian point. The site had
been previously investigated in 1950 by
Sellards and Evans during a paleontologi-
cal survey, although no archeological ma-
terials were encountered at that time.

Detailed archaeological investigations
of the site were ﬁrst carried out by Alex
D. Krieger and Fred Wendorf, then with
the Museum of New Mexico. The age of
the Midland skeleton has always been
difﬁcult to interpret. The skeleton was in-
terpreted as being at least ten thousand
years old and was widely regarded as the
ﬁrst well-documented Paleoindian skele-

ton from North America (Wendorf and
Krieger 1959).

Initial test pits at the site produced ad-
ditional cranial fragments, a rib fragment,
and a metacarpal (Wendorf et al. 1955,
40 – 41). The bones were scattered over
an area of four feet by three feet wide,
and they were heavily weathered and
fragmented. No burial pit was evident.
The bones included cranial and a small
amount of postcranial material, and
Stewart (1955, 77) reconstructed the
skull in hopes of gaining information on
its “physical type.” In addition to the par-
tial cranium (the mandible was not recov-
ered), at least two metacarpals and a ﬁrst
rib fragment were identiﬁed. A possible
phalanx and metacarpal fragment were
also present. Many fragments were too
small to be identiﬁed.

The gracile features, including small
brow ridges and slight muscle attachment
areas on the occiput, indicated the skele-
ton belonged to a female. Stewart esti-
mated an age at death of thirty years based
on cranial suture closure. This age seemed
consistent with the moderate-to-extreme
wear on the eight maxillary teeth. Medical
disorders included an odontome, de-
scribed by Stewart as a possible super-
numerary tooth. Stewart (1955, 90) stated
that the remains probably represent a
single individual. The skull is relatively
long (dolichocranic), a feature common in
many Texas archeological skeletal samples.
Problems of interpreting the skeleton

have centered on chronological issues
(Holliday and Meltzer 1996). Five de-
ﬂation basins (blowouts) form the Mid-
land site. Locality 1, which yielded the
human skeletal remains, is situated along
Monahans Draw, a tributary of the Colo-
rado River system in Texas. Initial test ex-
cavations where the human bones were
found yielded other human remains and
fossil animal species. Nearby blowouts
produced Folsom points. The association
was difﬁcult to interpret, although it was
suggested (Holliday and Meltzer 1996)
that the Folsom materials in the sur-
rounding blowouts may have come from
strata overlaying the one that produced
the human remains. This situation sug-
gested that the skeleton was older than
Folsom (Holliday and Meltzer 1996,
758 –59; Wendorf et al. 1955, 41– 42).

Ultimately, the human bones were de-

scribed as resting on and just below the
eroding surface of the Gray Sand, but

dating the human bones has remained
problematic (see Holliday 1997a and
Holliday and Meltzer 1996 for a more
detailed geoarcheological interpretation
of the site). Wendorf and Krieger (1959),
armed with new radiocarbon and U-Th
assays, argued that the Midland human
skull predated Folsom and was possibly
as much as twenty thousand years old.
While Fred Smith (1976) included the
Midland skeleton in his review of North
American Paleoindian skeletons, Gentry
Steele and Joseph Powell (1992) did not
because of unresolved questions regarding
the age of the skeleton.

Reinvestigation of the site by Vance

Holliday and David Meltzer between
1989 and 1992 was carried out to further
address its geochronology and to test an
initial suggestion by Ernst Antevs that the
Gray Sand in Locality 1 might actually
represent an Early to Middle Holocene
unit (Holliday and Meltzer 1996, 64).
At the same time, McKinney (1992) pro-
posed a date of 11,600 ! 800 b.p. for the
Midland skeleton, thus concluding that
it was Clovis in age and represented the
oldest Paleoindian skeleton known from
North America. As with much of the
Midland site, this date too has been ques-
tioned (Holliday and Meltzer 1996, 769).
Holliday and Meltzer’s (1996) investi-

gations produced no clear answers, and
they found no strong evidence to support
a pre-Folsom afﬁliation for the skeleton.
Radiocarbon chronologies from other
sites on the Southern High Plains suggest
“the bone may be the same age as or
younger than Folsom (#11,000 b.p.)”
(Holliday and Meltzer 1996, 770). The
issue of whether or not the skeleton is
from a Holocene age population is unre-
solved. Further direct dating of the skele-
ton itself will be required if we are to ad-
dress these questions.

Shifting Sands

Hofman et al. (1990, 234) described
several adult human molars from Shifting
Sands, a Folsom-Midland site in western
Texas. The site is on the southern margin
of the Llano Estacado in a series of deep
blowouts. A large number of Folsom and
Midland tools, along with chipping de-
bris, have been recovered there, and one
area yielded bison remains from a kill /
butchering event.

The human molars were collected
from Area 2, apparently in anatomical

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

02-A2946  4/13/04  11:51 AM  Page 86

position. Several Folsom and Midland
points were also recovered there, as the
area had undergone deﬂation from wind
erosion. As Hofman et al. (1990, 234)
note, a deﬁnite Folsom-Midland afﬁlia-
tion for these teeth has not been estab-
lished. However, Steele (1998, table 31-
1) includes these teeth in his summary of
afﬁrmed and probable North American
Paleoindians. His table lists these teeth as
representing an individual ﬁfteen to
twenty years of age, with an estimated
antiquity of 10,000 to 8500 b.p.

Well-Documented Paleoindian Burials
Thus far, the discussion of human
remains has focused on possible or dis-
counted examples of Paleoindian skele-
tons from Texas. Two Texas archeological
sites, however, are widely recognized for
their contribution to our understanding
of Paleoindian biology and burial prac-
tices. These include Horn Shelter and
Wilson-Leonard, described below.

Horn Rock Shelter No. 2

Horn Rock Shelter No. 2 is a well-
dated and stratiﬁed rockshelter on the
Brazos River in central Texas (Forrester
1985; Redder 1985; Redder and Fox
1988; Steele 1989; Watt 1978; D. Young
1985, 1986, 1988; D. Young et al. 1987).
A double Paleoindian burial consisting of
an adult and a child was discovered in the
shelter in 1970. Radiocarbon assays from
the stratum yielding the burials ranged
from 10,310 to 9500 b.p. (Watt 1978)
(see Table 2.1). This burial represented
the ﬁrst well-dated Paleoindian skeletal
material from Texas and one of the few
such examples from North America. Sev-
eral features make it extremely important
to Paleoindian studies: the presence of
two individuals, information on burial
practices, its well-stratiﬁed and dated
context, the completeness of the skele-
tons, and the presence of grave goods.
The burials were excavated in 1970
by Frank Watt and Albert Redder. The
Paleoindian skeletons were recovered
from Substratum 5E. The burial pit origi-
nated in Substratum 5G (D. Young et al.
1987, 277). Substratum 5G also yielded
what have come to be known as ﬂuted
Brazos Fishtailed projectile points, lying
below a stratum that yielded Plainview
points. The adult has been described as
Burial One and the child as Burial Two
(D. Young et al. 1987).

86 / TEXAS PREHISTORY

The burials were recovered 4.42 m be-

low the present rockshelter surface. The
skeletons were virtually complete. The
adult and child were buried in ﬂexed po-
sitions on their left sides. The child was
facing the back of the adult. Numerous
grave goods were associated with the bur-
ial (D. Young et al. 1987, 278). The head
of the adult rested in one of three inverted
turtle shells that had been stacked on top
of each other. Two other turtle carapaces
were placed by the adult’s pelvis and face.
The vertebrae on the inside of these turtle
shells had been scraped, showing they
were intentionally cleaned (Redder 1985).
Additional grave goods included shell
beads, bird claws, sandstone slabs, antler
billets, perforated nonhuman canines,
bone and stone tools, and red ochre. The
importance of red ochre in burial rituals
in Paleoindian sites is now well recog-
nized (Roper 1991). In addition to these
materials, nineteen sandstone slabs were
used to cover the Horn Shelter burial.
The skeletons have been thoroughly

analyzed by Diane Young Holliday
(D. Young 1985, 1986, 1988; D. Young
et al. 1987). Given the rarity of Paleo-
indian skeletons, both skeletons are amaz-
ingly intact. The child is estimated to be
roughly twelve years old based on dental
eruption, dental calciﬁcation, and the lack
of fused postcranial epiphyses. It is often
difﬁcult to determine the sex of children
from skeletal material, although Young
et al. (1987, 290) interpret this individual
as male based on the morphology of cra-
nial and pelvic features. No evidence of
trauma was noted, but the right maxillary
sinus shows signs of minor infection.

The adult was estimated to be male
based on nonmetric and metric features,
as well as the presence of traditional male
tools (in this case antler billets) as grave
goods. He was estimated to be in his mid-
thirties to early forties at the time of death.
This estimate is based on epiphyseal fu-
sion, third molar eruption and wear, ec-
tocranial suture fusion, degenerative bone
changes, and auricular surface wear.

Examples of medical disorders on this

skeleton include an infection of the left
maxillary sinus, as was seen in the child.
The left third cuneiform and navicular
(foot bones) showed abnormal bone re-
sorption and deposition. A healed frac-
ture was noted on the left foot. Interest-
ingly, an odontome was noted on the
upper dentition, a feature also seen in the

Midland skeleton (Stewart 1955, 88). In
addition, the Horn Shelter adult male
had antemortem tooth loss. At the time
of death, he would have had only two or
three functional chewing surfaces on his
teeth (D. Young et al. 1987, 281, 284).
The teeth were too heavily worn to deter-
mine dental features such as Carabelli’s
cusps and shovel-shaped incisors.1 Stature
of the adult male was estimated at be-
tween 161 and 169 cm, or between 5 feet,
3 inches, and 5 feet, 6 inches, in height.
A comparison of the Horn Shelter Paleo-
indians with later central Texas skeletal
populations revealed no signiﬁcant differ-
ences in cranial features, postcranial fea-
tures, or discrete traits (D. Young et al.
1987).

Wilson-Leonard

The Wilson-Leonard site is the most
recent Texas archeological site to yield a
Paleoindian skeleton and among the most
well known (Parvin 1983; Phelps et al.
1994; Stafford et al. 1987; Steele 1989,
1994, 1998; Weir 1985). This central
Texas site is in Williamson County along
Brushy Creek. Excavated by TxDOT and
TARL throughout the 1980s and 1990s,
the site is signiﬁcant because of its strati-
ﬁed, well-dated nature, and the Paleo-
indian components are especially signiﬁ-
cant (see M. Collins 1998c).

The Paleoindian burial, designated
Burial 2 or Wilson-Leonard II, is also
known locally as the Leander skeleton be-
cause of the site’s proximity to the town
of Leander, Texas. The skeleton was dis-
covered in 1983 when archeologists with
TxDOT conducted excavations along the
planned extension of Farm Road 1431.
The burial pit of the Wilson-Leonard
Paleoindian skeleton originated in the
lower portion of what was designated the
Leanne Soil and extended into underly-
ing sediments (E20/S74 and E20/S72,
Levels 31A–34B). The skeleton appears
to date between 10,000 and 9600 b.p.

Interpreted as a female, this body was

found lying on her right side with her
head resting on her hands (Fig. 2.50).
Her legs were ﬂexed and crossed, with her
knees drawn toward her chest. The orien-
tation of the burial was roughly in a
northeast/southwest direction. Her head
was to the north and faced west. Grave
goods in the burial included a shark
tooth, a grindstone/chopper, and a lime-
stone cobble.

macroscopic and microscopic level. While
the Paleoindian sample is small, Powell
and his coauthors’ studies show that Paleo-
indians have a higher frequency of ab-
scesses than Archaic assemblages but a
lower rate of caries. The degree of alveolar
resorption between the two groups is
roughly the same.

The Wilson-Leonard Paleoindian had
frequent pits and evidence of moderate to
large striations on the teeth. The ﬂattened
tooth wear indicates either the consump-
tion of hard, gritty foods, or long-term
use of the teeth (Powell and Steele 1994),
a pattern similar to that of Archaic hunters
and gatherers. Overall, Powell and Steele
concluded that the Wilson-Leonard fe-
male—like other Paleoindians whose
skeletons have been studied—had a diet
that may not have differed greatly be-
tween Paleoindians and later hunter-
gatherers of the Archaic.

In terms of population afﬁnity, Steele
(1998, 1453) noted that Wilson-Leonard
II has shoveling of the upper incisors, a
common trait in American Indian popu-
lations but comparatively rare in Euro-
peans. Wilson-Leonard II is similar to
other Paleoindian skeletons from other
states (such as Gordon Creek, Colorado,
and Pelican Rapids, Minnesota) in having
a relatively long, narrow cranium along
with a narrow and short face with moder-
ate alveolar prognathism. Detailed multi-
variate analysis (Powell 1995; Powell and
Steele 1993; Steele and Powell 1992,
1993, 1994) indicates that the Wilson-
Leonard II and other Paleoindian skele-
tons differ from both recent North
American Indians and northeast Asians,
resembling instead a more generalized
Asian stock (Steele 1998, 1456). This dis-
tinction has important implications for
questions regarding the peopling of the
New World. These and other questions
are actively being investigated by physical
anthropologists.

Future Inquiry

In 1970, the Texas paleontologist Bob

Slaughter, then of the Shuler Museum
of Paleontology at Southern Methodist
University, published a short (and largely
ignored) paper titled “Were the First
Americans Caucasoid?” In that paper, he
suggested that the earliest Americans may
have been Caucasoid, related in some
form to the Ainu, inhabitants of the Kuril
Islands of northern Japan.

Fig. 2.50. Map of Wilson-Leonard burial of female (after Steele 1998).

The skull was crushed from post-
mortem compaction. Many other bones
were also fractured. The majority of the
hand and foot bones were missing, al-
though very little rodent activity was
noted by excavators in the burial pit.
Mechanical and chemical degradation
was extensive.

The assessment of sex was made from

the gracile cranial features, mandible
morphology, pelvic features, and the rela-
tively gracile nature of the long bones
(Steele 1998). She was probably an ado-
lescent or young adult (early twenties)
at the time of death. This estimate was
based on epiphyseal fusion, cranial suture
fusion, and third molar eruption and
wear. She was relatively short, with a
stature estimation of 158 cm (5 feet,
2 inches). This skeleton is only the sec-
ond Paleoindian female from North
America for which stature has been esti-
mated (Steele 1998).

D. Gentry Steele, of Texas A&M Uni-
versity, analyzed the skeleton and worked
in conjunction with B. P. Gatliff to pro-

duce the ﬁrst facial reconstruction of a
Paleoindian skull (Phelps et al. 1994;
Steele and Powell 1993). Based on this
reconstruction, the cranium and face of
this person are thought to have been rela-
tively narrow, showing a moderate degree
of alveolar prognathism (Steele 1998).
The only medical disorders observed were
associated with the dental arcade. These
include caries, an apical abscess, ante-
mortem tooth loss, a cracked tooth, and
alveolar resorption. Several of the teeth
also show disproportionate amounts of
wear. This skeleton is one of only two
Paleoindian burials that show cavities.
Along with the Horn Shelter male, this
female is the second Paleoindian identi-
ﬁed with antemortem tooth loss.

In an attempt to address questions of
health and specialized big game hunting
versus generalized diets for Paleoindians,
Powell et al. (1993) and Powell and Steele
(1992, 1994) examined the Wilson-
Leonard skeleton and other Paleoindian
skeletons for dental disorders and occlusal
wear. This examination was done at the

PALEOINDIAN ARCHEOLOGY IN TEXAS / 89

This suggestion takes on heightened
interest given current descriptions of the
widely publicized Kennewick Man Paleo-
indian skeleton from Washington state
(R. Taylor et al. 1998). Although widely
debated, preliminary descriptions of this
skeleton have noted its Caucasoid cranial
features. As R. Ervin Taylor and his co-
authors note, this skeleton has “raised
the possibility that some of the earliest
American human populations have no
modern descendants in the New World”
(R. Taylor et al. 1998, 1171). This and
other recent Paleoindian skeleton ﬁnds
from across the country have tremendous
implications for our understanding of the
peopling of the New World (K. Wright
1999). Comparison of such skeletons
with the well-preserved materials previ-
ously recovered from Texas should con-
tinue to prove enlightening. These con-
tributions from human paleobiology
may also lead to a revision in the Paleo-
indian lexicon; Taylor et al. (1998,
1171), for example, now differentiate
between the terms Paleoindian and
Paleoamerican.

Assemblage Comparisons and
Lithic Technology

Assemblage Patterns

The published record of assemblage
composition for reliable excavated Paleo-
indian components in Texas contains
many gaps. This situation is due to a
number of factors. First, some site reports
are not published. Second, even when site
publications exist, often they are not fully
published and complete assemblage data
are omitted. Third, many sites are known
only from surface collections, which are
not considered reliable for assemblage
deﬁnition. Fourth, archeologists often do
not devote enough effort toward isolating
components when excavating multiple
occupancy sites. Compounding these
self-made problems is the very real pres-
ervation bias in the archeological record.
Because of these limitations, it is very
difﬁcult to discuss assemblage variation
among Paleoindian components in Texas.
What follows, while brief, is a reﬂection
of the Paleoindian archeological record
with all its limitations and biases.

Table 2.6 lists the composition of
twenty-one excavated Paleoindian assem-
blages. Other excavated assemblages were
not included because the time span was
great, we were unsure about the collec-
tion methods, or the material was not
fully published. In some cases these “as-
semblages” represent mixed components.
For example, the Unit II assemblage from
Wilson-Leonard (Bousman 1998a) and
the Lake Theo assemblage (Harrison and
Smith 1975; Harrison and Killen 1978)
represent multiple components. How-
ever, the mixed component assemblages
included represent a limited time span
(Early or Late Paleoindian), and a speciﬁc
location.

The assemblages in Table 2.6 are or-

dered by the percentage of projectile
points in the overall tool assemblage.
Debitage counts were not always avail-
able, and these are included when pos-
sible but are not used in the percentage
calculations. The counts from Lubbock
Lake are based on individual feature as-
semblages presented in Table 2.7. The
Lubbock Lake assemblages were lumped

into cultural groupings because of low ar-
tifact counts and the ability to include
nonfeature-related artifacts.

A number of interesting patterns are
apparent in the assemblage information.
First, excavated assemblages are only pres-
ent from central Texas, the Lower Pecos,
and the Plains. Sites from other regions
either have not been excavated (e.g., east
Texas) or have not been fully published
(e.g., Aubrey). Secondly, most sites have
very small artifact counts. Except for the
Bone Bed, Wilson, and Late Paleoindian
components at Wilson-Leonard and the
Firstview assemblage from Lubbock Lake,
no assemblages have more than a hun-
dred stone tools. Central Texas assem-
blages are generally the largest, but these

are dominated by assemblages from a
single site, Wilson-Leonard. Plains assem-
blages are generally smaller than those
from the Lower Pecos.

Table 2.8 summarizes the information
in Table 2.6 cross-classiﬁed by region and
site function. It is no surprise that kill /
butchery site assemblages are dominated
by projectile points and unifacial tools,
except in central Texas. However, the
central Texas kill /butchery sample is
represented by only one assemblage, the
Bone Bed component at Wilson-Leonard.
Camps in all regions have low percentages
of projectile points but high percentages
of unifacial tools, core/choppers, and
pecked/groundstone tools.

The unknown function sites are the

Clovis component at Wilson-Leonard
and the Late Paleoindian component in
the Upper Gravels at Devil’s Mouth.
Both are in derived contexts, and little
can be said concerning their different as-
semblages. As most kill /butchery sites
and only one camp are in the Plains, this
region’s overall assemblage reﬂects this
bias. In central Texas, most assemblages
can be related to camp activities, and the
only kill /butchery assemblage had only
one projectile point; thus this region’s as-
semblages reﬂect this bias as well.

Table 2.9 again averages the percent-
ages presented in Table 2.6, but it cross-
classiﬁes them by region and period.
Early Paleoindian assemblages dominate
the Plains assemblages, but Late Paleo-
indian assemblages are rare in the Plains
sites. Lubbock Lake dominates the Plains
record and provides the most complete
set of assemblage information. The Early
Paleoindian assemblages are dominated
by projectile points and unifacial tools,
except in central Texas. Early Paleoindian
assemblages in the Plains have a surpris-
ingly high percentage of pecked/ground-
stone tools, and these frequencies are the
result of chopping tools in Clovis assem-
blages at Lubbock Lake. Particularly in
central Texas and the Lower Pecos, Late
Paleoindian assemblages are characterized
by fewer projectile points and a more
even distribution of tool forms. The
single Late Paleoindian assemblage in the
Plains (Firstview at Lubbock Lake) is
dominated by unifacial tools.

Technological Studies

Paleoindian technological studies are
well known but still not commonly done
in Texas. Most efforts have focused on the
production of points (Knudson 1983;
Sollberger 1985, 1988; Tunnell 1977),
but recently Michael Collins (1999b) has
investigated the production of blades in
Clovis assemblages.

Michael Collins et al. (1989b) and
Collins (1999) present studies of Clovis
biface and blade manufacture in the
Southern Plains and surrounding regions.
Clovis points are made on large elongated
ﬂakes and thinned by the removal of dis-
tinctive expanding ﬂakes that span the
entire width of the biface (Fig. 2.51).
These thinning ﬂakes can overshoot to re-
move the opposite bifacial edge. More
careful trimming retained the lanceolate

core tablets. Core tablets are present in
some assemblages. Clovis blades are mod-
erately long, have very small platforms
and indistinct bulbs of percussion, and

shape. The base is beveled to create a ﬂut-
ing platform. The ﬂutes are probably re-
moved by direct percussion. Edge trim-
ming sometimes occurs after ﬂuting, but
apparently edges are ground as the ﬁnal
production step.

Building on Earl Green’s (1963) initial

discovery and several others across the
state (see M. Collins 1990b; M. Collins
and Headrick 1992; Goode and Mallouf
1991; Henderson and Goode 1991; Houk
et al. 1997; Mallouf 1989; B. Young and
Collins 1989), Collins (1999) argues per-
suasively that prismatic blade technology
was clearly a formal component in the
Clovis lithic repertoire. Conical and
wedge-shaped blade cores occur, but
conical cores are the most common. The
platforms on conical blade cores are
roughly circular, prepared by the removal
of broad but short ﬂakes that often hinge
(Fig. 2.52). This hinging produces large
central knots on the platform. Blade scars
on the slides of the blade cores often are
missing negative bulbs of percussion, sug-
gesting to Collins that core platforms

display strong curvature. Blades were not
used in the manufacture of points, but
they were occasionally used to make end
scrapers, scrapers, and burins.

Curtis Tunnell (1977) has proposed a
staged model for the production of ﬂuted
Folsom points (Fig. 2.53). His sequence
begins with the selection of a large ﬂake
(1 on Fig. 2.53), which is then bifacially
reduced and the platform prepared on the
base for the removal of the ﬁrst channel
ﬂake (2). The channel ﬂake is removed
ﬁrst on one side (3), preparing the plat-
form again (4), and then the second
channel ﬂake (5) is removed. At that
stage, the point is trimmed and shaped,
and ﬁnally the lateral edges are ground to

produce the point’s ﬁnal form (6). Rarely,
channel ﬂakes are made into miniature
points (7). In some cases, channel ﬂakes
can overshoot (8), but if the preform is
long enough they can still be used for the
production of shorter points (9 –11).
Basal fractures also occur (12), and occa-
sionally these are still used (13) for the
production of points (14). Hinged chan-
nel ﬂakes can also occur on the second
channel ﬂake removal (15), and if the
preform is long enough, these too can be
made into short points (16). As Hofman
(1991a) and Amick (1994c, 1995) have
argued, the production of Folsom ﬂuted
points is error prone, and when raw ma-
terials are rare, unﬂuted points would

more likely be made. They also suggest
that the availability of raw materials stim-
ulates the production of Folsom and
Midland points.

The general lithic strategies of Folsom

groups in the Southern Plains involved
the production and curation of large, thin
bifaces (Boldurian 1991; Hofman et al.
1990; Stanford and Broilo 1981). Blade
production is rare or absent (M. Collins
and Headrick 1992). The biface thinning
ﬂakes detached from the large (up to 140
mm in length; see Hofman et al. 1990)
Folsom bifaces were used as blanks for
points or other tools. Amick (1994c,
1995), Hofman (1991a, 1992), and Hof-
man et al. (1990) have argued that the

production of Folsom ﬂuted points is
prone to failure, and as groups moved
away from good raw material sources,
they began to expend their curated mate-
rials, presumably in the form of these
large, thin bifaces. When raw materials
were scarce, unﬂuted (i.e., Midland)
points were more likely to be made than
the ﬂuted Folsom points, in order to con-
serve raw materials. Thus, the availability
of lithic raw materials stimulated the pro-
duction of Folsom or Midland points.

Raw Material Use

The use of nonlocal raw materials is
well known in the Paleoindian archeolog-
ical literature (Hofman et al. 1991a). Re-
searchers have proposed numerous mod-
els to account for the use of nonlocal
materials. For example, Edwin N. Wilm-
sen (1973) argued that raw materials were
exchanged across territorial boundaries
and that the frequencies of nonlocal raw
materials could be used to reconstruct the
boundaries. David J. Meltzer (1989c) at-
tempted to determine if transportation of

raw materials within large territories or
exchange across territorial boundaries
accounts for the patterns in nonlocal ma-
terials in Paleoindian assemblages. As
Meltzer recognized, equiﬁnality is a seri-
ous problem, unfortunately. Raw mate-
rial availability inﬂuenced the point pro-
duction strategies of Folsom/Midland
hunters (Amick 1994c, 1995; Hofman
1991a).

The documentation of nonlocal raw
material use is fraught with problems be-
cause of the difﬁculty in identifying stone
sources, but recent studies in the south-
ern prairies, plains, and woodlands have
helped identify and clarify the character-
istics of stone sources (see Banks 1990;
Frederick and Ringstaff 1994; Hofman
et al. 1991a; Holliday 1997a; Holliday
and Welty 1981). As Tables 2.10 –2.15
indicate, the general pattern of greater use
of nonlocal raw materials in the Paleo-
indian period, particularly the Early
Paleoindian period, is supported by the
few studies with quantitative data from
Texas. It is not surprising that raw materi-

als were transported great distances on
the Plains, where usable raw materials are
scarce and high-quality raw materials are
virtually nonexistent. However, even at
Wilson-Leonard on the eastern Balcones
Escarpment, the frequent occurrence of
nonlocal raw materials in Early Paleo-
indian components suggests the impor-
tance of transporting high-quality stone
material. Nevertheless, local sources,
such as Manning Fused Glass (K. Brown
1976, 1995b) and Pisgah Ridge chert
(D. McGregor 1993), were also utilized.
These data suggest that Paleoindian
territorial boundaries were probably quite
large, but the presence of an obsidian
point from a Mexican source at Kincaid
Shelter and an obsidian point from a New
Mexico source at Lubbock Lake demon-
strates that some form of exchange was
also utilized (Hester et al. 1988). Conse-
quently, we are at the point that Meltzer
(1989c) reached: knowing that territorial
expansion and exchange both existed but
being unable to identify the individual
effects.

A more detailed breakdown by raw
material, artifact class, and cultural afﬁlia-
tion is possible at Lubbock Lake (see
Table 2.11). These data indicate that
nonlocal raw materials are used more of-
ten in the Early Paleoindian period than

during the Late Paleoindian occupations.
Projectile points, unifaces, and bifaces are
consistently made of nonlocal materials,
but this selectivity declined through time.
Projectile points are made of nonlocal raw
materials more often than are unifaces or

bifaces. The selection of high-quality
nonlocal raw materials for projectile
points is also common at the Lake Theo,
Rex Rodgers, and Plainview sites (see
Tables 2.12 –2.14).

Engraved Stones

Engraved stones are found in Paleo-
indian contexts at the Gault site and the
Bone Bed component at Wilson-Leonard
(M. Collins 1998a; Collins et al. 1991,
1992; Hester et al. 1992). The engraved
stones from Gault (Fig. 2.54) may be as-
sociated with a Clovis component, but
the engraved stone from Wilson-Leonard
(see Fig. 2.15) is associated with the
Plainview component.

One engraved stone at Gault has a
rectangular pattern, but the other has
been characterized as depicting plants
(Hester et al. 1992, 5). Other engraved
stones have been recovered from the Fol-
som component at Blackwater Draw ( J.
Hester et al. 1972). Recently, a painted
bison skull was excavated at the Folsom
Cooper site in western Oklahoma (Be-
ment 1999). This painted skull, along
with the engraved stones from Paleo-
indian contexts in Texas, suggests that a
symbolic system that involved decorating
stones and skull painting was present in
the Early Paleoindian period in the South-
ern Plains. It seems reasonable to suggest
that these symbolic items were part of a
religious belief system, but more discover-

ies and better interpretations are needed
to further understand how this system
may have been organized.

Transitions to the Archaic

The transformations that led from the

Paleoindian to the Archaic societies are
poorly understood. Early Paleoindian
groups existed during a period when the
climate and environment, and thus the
available food resources, were markedly
different from those available to Late
Paleoindian and Archaic groups in the
Holocene period. Even within the Early
Paleoindian period, as the record of Pleis-
tocene fauna extinctions demonstrates
(Martin and Klein 1984), these societies
had to adapt to a dynamic, evolving
environment.

It is clear that the subsistence shift
from the exploitation of extinct mega-
fauna that typiﬁes Paleoindian societies
to one based on Holocene faunas marks
the most visible transformation. How-
ever, it is not a transformation that re-
ﬂects human choice as much as it is a
response to environmentally determined
availability. Evidence from the Golon-

drina component at Baker Cave, the An-
gostura component at the Richard Beene
site, and the unknown component at
Berger’s Bluff suggest that the move to-
ward more intensive exploitation and
processing of small food items in bulk
occurred at least by the Late Paleoindian
period and perhaps even earlier. There is
widespread evidence for one distinction
between the Late Pleistocene occupants
and their Early Holocene counterparts,
and that is the greater use of nonlocal raw
materials and, by inference, larger territo-
ries during the Pleistocene. With the
publication of the Wilson component at
Wilson-Leonard, the simple model of
lanceolate projectile point Paleoindian
tool-making traditions and stemmed pro-
jectile point Archaic tool-making tradi-
tions breaks down, at least in terms of
simple period deﬁnitions. Clearly, all the
societies that have been discussed above
represent small-scale egalitarian groups,
but so do the Early Archaic groups that
followed. Obviously, the groups that have
been included in the Early Paleoindian
period (e.g., Clovis, Folsom, and Plain-
view) can easily be considered as Paleo-
indian, but it is the groups listed as Late
Paleoindian that provide the more serious
problem. In strict behavioral terms, these
groups could just as easily be considered
Archaic. This issue will be debated for
years to come.

Archeology in Central Texas

Michael B. Collins

This chapter reviews the archeological
record of Native Americans in the cen-
tral Texas archeological region and con-
siders selected aspects of the nature of
the evidence and how archeologists have
studied that evidence. Previous reviews
have covered these same topics compre-
hensively (see D. Suhm 1960; D. Suhm
et al. 1954) or selectively (e.g., Black
1989b; M. Collins 1995; Creel 1991a;
G. Ellis 1994; M. Howard 1991; L. John-
son 1967; L. Johnson and Goode 1994;
Lintz 1993; W. McKinney 1981; Prewitt
1981, 1985; Weir 1976). “An Introduc-
tory Handbook of Texas Archeology”
by Suhm et al. (1954) established a for-
mal structure of archeological inquiry
for the entire state, and the diverse
data gathered over the ﬁrst half of the
twentieth century were organized and
synthesized.

Although successive metamorphoses
have rendered the particulars of the 1954
handbook virtually unrecognizable in
current practice, each revision was built
on what had gone before, so that much of
what we know today rests on sturdy foun-
dations laid a half century prior to this
writing. Typologies of ceramics and pro-
jectile points published in the handbook
have remained more intact than the other
cultural constructs. In his introduction to
the handbook, Alex D. Krieger (D. Suhm
et al. 1954, 2 –10) also established a num-
ber of the tenets of typology that continue

to underlie some artifact classiﬁcations in
the state.

The review published by Dee Ann
Suhm in 1960 is the ﬁrst metamorphosis,
beginning by offering a smaller and less
rigidly bounded delineation of “central
Texas” (D. Suhm 1960, ﬁg. 1). Among
the lasting contributions of the review are
good visual (D. Suhm 1960, ﬁgs. 2 and
3) and descriptive (D. Suhm 1960, 89 –
103) images of the nature of the central
Texas archeological data base, particularly
its key sites. Historic Indian groups in
central Texas received greater treatment,
and Suhm’s review also reﬂects the be-
ginnings of the preoccupation with pre-
historic chronology building that over-
whelmed the research effort over the next
twenty-ﬁve years and dominated subse-
quent reviews and syntheses. At the time
Suhm actually wrote her review (in 1958),
only one radiocarbon date was available
for a central Texas site (D. Suhm 1960,
88), and analyses of stratiﬁed site excava-
tions were too few to use as a basis for
establishing a chronology.

Since 1960, the several reviews that
have been written focused on topical,
temporal, or theoretical issues of central
Texas archeology. Some of these have
been more inﬂuential than others, but as
this chapter will show, none has ade-
quately considered the nature of the re-
gion’s archeological record. The vast data
base that now exists for central Texas can-

101

not be adequately synthesized and pre-
sented in the space available. This essay
attempts instead to

• critique aspects of the practice of

archeology in central Texas,

• offer a brief summation of what we

currently know, and

• consider some ways by which we might

know signiﬁcantly more (and have greater
conﬁdence in that knowledge) by the time
the next review is written.

It is necessary to critique the manner
of our work because archeology rarely an-
swers questions that have not been asked
and because the questions asked and the
ways they are addressed in any archeolog-
ical paradigm largely dictate the nature of
the substantive ﬁndings. Over most of
the second half of the twentieth century,
archeological efforts in central Texas have
excessively emphasized questions of chro-
nology, have failed to identify and sustain
a focus on but a few other issues of sub-
stance, and have not yielded adequate ex-
planations for the nature of the archeo-
logical record.

Inexplicably, the preoccupation with
chronology prevailed without the devel-
opment of a very effective methodology
for its pursuit. Speciﬁcally, although the
sondage technique was adopted, the great-
est effort has been expended on precisely
the kinds of sites with the least potential

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

03-A2946  4/13/04  11:54 AM  Page 102

for yielding good chronological infor-
mation, while sites having that potential
languished with comparatively little atten-
tion. There have been many data generated
but not much synthesis of those data.

It is encouraging to note that during
the 1990s, four trends emerged that lead
me to believe that the prospect is good
for signiﬁcantly improved research in the
archeology of the region (see G. Ellis
1994). First, we have begun to better rec-
ognize the nature of the archeological
record and how it was formed, as well as
the greater need for data quality over data
quantity. Second, preoccupation with
chronological issues has begun to give
way to a sustained concern with several
questions of human adaptation. Third,
research now reﬂects an awareness of
great data potential that had long been
overlooked, and the relevance of data to
the questions asked is being scrutinized.
Finally, archeologists working in central
Texas are noticeably less provincial than
has long been the case (Perttula 1995c).
Thus, “The future of archaeological re-
search in the Edwards Plateau and adja-
cent areas will be considerably less gloomy
if the region can get the attention it de-
serves, and if its synthesis is addressed to
a national or international audience that
will be critical of any local misadven-
tures” (L. Johnson 1991, 21–22).

Do not take what has just been said to

mean that I do not consider chronology
to be the backbone of archeological in-
quiry. Archeology is a historical science,
and constantly improving chronological
control of the past must remain a primary
objective, but only as the framework for or-
dering more substantive inquiries and ﬁnd-
ings. In this vein, much has been said
about the validity and meaning of various
temporal frameworks offered for central
Texas prehistory. In spite of the use of
terms such as phase, and the discussion of
phases in ways suggesting they have eth-
nic meaning, the foremost purpose of
such constructs has been temporal order-
ing of archeological material culture.
These constructs are based largely on
morphological (supposedly stylistic)
trends in artifact forms and, as such, are
archeological style periods, not unlike style
periods (e.g., Victorian, Greek Revival, or
Tudor) used by architects. Eileen Johnson
(1987c, 1991) has suggested that some of
our archeological style periods be called

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

patterns, and I (M. Collins et al. 1990)
have proposed the label intervals. Either
of these is better suited than phase, to
which we both object, but I continue to
prefer interval, ﬁrst because it emphasizes
the main thrust—time—and, second,
because pattern implies that we know
more about the material cultural compo-
sition of some of the time slices than I be-
lieve we do. Whatever we call the seg-
ments of our temporal framework, their
function is to order cultural change,
which is the essential basis for under-
standing cultural processes.

Central Texas as an
Archeological Area

Culture areas (Kroeber 1939) and
their archeological counterparts (e.g., as
used in G. Willey 1966) have long served
to focus attention on regions of shared
cultural traits. At any single moment in
time, culture area boundaries often can be
drawn relatively easily. Some boundaries
persist for centuries or millennia, but oth-
ers shift and blur over time. The longer
the time period under consideration, the

more arbitrary boundaries become. Much
of North America might be considered a
single culture area during Clovis times,
but by a.d. 1000 scores of areas would be
needed, with each embracing the same
degree of material culture sameness seen
in all of Clovisdom.

Any delineation of the central Texas

archeological area is highly arbitrary.
Conversely, to draw boundaries based on
careful considerations of material cultural
sameness would result in a sequence of
perhaps a dozen central Texas areas of
quite different sizes and shapes—an un-
manageable array for the purposes of this
essay. So, for the present discussion, Pre-
witt’s delineation (1981, 71, ﬁg. 2) of the
central Texas archeological area (Fig. 3.1)
has been used as a descriptive framework,
but its boundaries have not been adhered
to rigidly as regards certain archeological
and geological data that inform on key is-
sues in the local record. Also, this delin-
eation is selected with the proviso that,
like any such arbitrary construct, it is
more satisfactory for some parts of the pre-
historic record than for others.

features in central Texas are massive,
mounded accumulations of burned rocks
or “burned rock middens” (Fig. 3.3a– c).
Because they have played such a large role
in the archeology of central Texas (see
G. Ellis 1994), burned rock middens are
discussed separately, below.

The elements (artifacts and features)
that make up or accompany camp sites
sometimes occur apart from camps.
These include caches, isolated artifacts,
burials, bedrock mortars, and rock art
(see Fig. 3.3d), all of which are known to
occur in various settings (see Table 3.1).

(1986), Ian Hodder (1978), David Clarke
(1977), James Ebert (1992), and others
have noted in general, and G. Lain Ellis
(1994, 54 –56) has discussed speciﬁcally
for the central Texas culture area (see also
L. W. Ellis et al. 1995), our spatial con-
cepts can seriously impair our efforts to
interpret past human adaptations. In the
past eleven thousand years, there proba-
bly has never been any cultural group
whose key resources, geographic range, or
political sphere conformed even approxi-
mately to what archeologists designate as
“central Texas.” The concerns raised by
these writers refer primarily to investigat-
ing the prehistory of central Texas; it is
still convenient to use the cultural area
rubric when describing its archeological
record.

The central Texas archeological area is
roughly 84,300 km2, or 12 percent of the
area of the state. As of January, 1995, re-
corded archeological sites for central Texas
numbered 11,355, which could be as low
as 10 to 20 percent of the actual number,
judging from site densities in a few thor-
oughly surveyed areas. Documented sites
are in open areas on various topographic
features, along blufﬂines, in rockshelters,
and in caves; site characteristics differ
greatly, but they afford clues as to the
function or functions of any given site, or
to a component within a site (Table 3.1).
In central Texas, the most common
kind of site recognized is an accumulation
of debris (burned rock, stone chipping
residue, pottery sherds) and diverse utili-
tarian objects (grinding stones, hammer-
stones, unifaces, and bifaces), sometimes
in great quantities. Although various
more speciﬁc interpretations (“base
camps,” “extractive sites,” and so forth)
have been offered, it is probably safest to
say that the vast majority of these repre-
sent the residue from one or more periods
of habitation; in simpliﬁed terms, these
are camp sites where people stayed for a
time, regardless of their more speciﬁc pur-
poses for being at that location. Camps
are found in all settings (see Table 3.1 and
Fig. 3.2): in the open, along bluffs, in
rockshelters, and even a few in caves such
as Scorpion and Halls (Table 3.2). Fea-
tures found at camps include just about
all kinds: hearths (Fig. 3.2a), knapping
areas, graves, caches, pits, houses, and
many others. Some of the more conspicu-
ous and, therefore, most commonly noted

Cemeteries, in and away from camps, are
known in the prehistoric record of central
Texas and have been found in rockshelters
(Watt 1936), open localities (Loeve-Fox,
Frisch Auf!), and in vertical shaft caves
(Hitzfelder, Mason Burial Cave).

Few animal kill sites have been docu-
mented in central Texas. The Late Pre-
historic bison skeleton (Feature 66) at
Loeve-Fox is one possible example (Pre-
witt 1982, 73 –79). Another is inferred
from fossilized bison bones and Folsom
points dislodged by treasure hunters from
the ﬂoor of Kincaid Rockshelter, where it

seems a bison died after it was wounded
but was not retrieved by Folsom hunters
(M. Collins 1990b).

Chert has been the most important
kind of toolstone throughout the pre-
history of central Texas, and the area is
rich in the quantity and quality of this raw
material (Banks 1990). This wealth is re-
ﬂected in numerous sites where chert was
acquired (quarries), acquired and knapped
(quarry/workshops [see Fig. 3.2d]), or
just knapped (lithic scatters).

Each of these kinds of sites has its own

characteristic parameters. The diverse

kinds of sites are not equally visible to
the archeologist; their interpretive poten-
tial varies greatly; they were never equally
numerous; and they have survived the
vagaries of nature at different rates. Ef-
forts to interpret and compare patterns
of land use over time, or to estimate such
things as relative population sizes, are
heavily burdened with these sampling
issues.

As a natural area, central Texas is di-
verse. Its single most signiﬁcant feature is
a prominent fault scarp, the Balcones Es-
carpment, that arcs from northeast to

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

03-A2946  4/13/04  11:54 AM  Page 105

ARCHEOLOGY IN CENTR AL TEXAS / 105

southwest around the center of central
Texas and breaks the area into two con-
trasting subareas (Fig. 3.4a). The larger
subarea is north and west of the scarp, on
its upside. Most of this is dissected pla-
teau land of resistant limestone and thin
upland soils, but deeply eroded crystalline
rocks—the Central Texas Mineral Re-
gion—are present as well. The prevailing
vegetation is oak and juniper savanna. Of
roughly half the size of the larger subarea
is the smaller subarea, south and east of
the scarp, on its downside. This is part
of the coastal plain, a region of relatively
soft bedrock and deep soils. Most of this
subarea is prairie with deep clayey soils,
but a narrow strip along its eastern mar-
gin is post oak forest standing on deep
sandy soils.

Along the escarpment lies a great eco-
tone (see Fig. 3.4a) where natural condi-
tions are transitional between the plateau
to the west and north and the prairies to
the east and south. More importantly, it
is beneﬁcial for humans to occupy an
ecotone whence they can readily access
contrasting resources in the adjacent
biomes and capitalize on the resource
diversity of the transitional zone.

Annual precipitation decreases from
east to west across central Texas from
near 100 cm to 55 cm. The primary
water resources for pre-industrial peoples
are streams and springs. Two river sys-
tems, the Brazos and the Colorado, drain
approximately 75 percent of the central
Texas area (see Fig. 3.4b); the remaining
25 percent is roughly equally divided into
the catchments of the Nueces, San Anto-
nio, and Guadalupe Rivers (see Fig. 3.4b).
Generally, drainage is toward the south-
east. Of the 281 springs documented
for Texas, 139 (49 percent) are in the
area, including both of the state’s very
large springs (!100 cubic feet per sec-
ond), and 12 of the state’s 17 large (10 to
100 cubic feet per second) springs (Brune
1975).

Change, as it is everywhere, is and al-
ways has been unrelenting across the land
of central Texas. Wind, water, and gravity
move earth material from place to place;
lakes, streams, and springs ﬂourish and
fail; caves and rockshelters form, enlarge,
degrade, and collapse. The delicate bal-
ances between soils, climates, plants, and
animals are ceaselessly being adjusted.
Terra ﬁrma is but an illusion.

Landscape Evolution from
Earthquakes to Earthworms

Foremost among deﬁciencies in the
methodology by which most of the cen-
tral Texas archeological record has been
built is an inadequate recognition of the
dynamic nature of the physical environ-
ment. Landscape evolution has profound
implications for archeological inquiry.
Issues of long-term changes in climate
(Bryant 1977; Bryant and Shafer 1977;
Bryant and Holloway 1985) and biotic
communities (e.g., Dillehay 1974) have
received considerable attention from
archeologists, but these issues are like
words without music when played against
a static terrain. A few examples will illus-
trate the importance of integrating arche-
ological inquiry with an understanding of
landscape change—whether one is study-
ing a region or a single sit

Most archeological surveys, until re-
cent years, were conducted without the
explicit objective of discovering buried
sites (e.g., Shafer et al. 1964). Even
though awareness of the need for subsur-
face reconnaissance has increased (e.g.,
J. W. Saunders et al. 1992), much of our
archeological data base was generated
without this awareness and is signiﬁcantly
biased as a result. Corollary to discovering
buried sites is the recognition that in some
areas landscape change has been sufﬁcient
to obliterate sites. The important point
here is that geologic and pedogenic pro-
cesses have nonrandomly altered, buried,
and destroyed sites (e.g., Abbott 1995).
Examples from different areas of central
Texas are instructive.

Fluvial Systems

Simpliﬁed depictions of site distribu-
tions from archeological surveys in three
reservoirs along the Colorado River clearly
illustrate one aspect of this bias. In two of
the three project areas (Figs. 3.5 and 3.6),
virtually no sites were recorded on the
inside of bends in the river ( Jackson
and Woolsey 1938; Shafer 1967). In the
third area (Fig. 3.7), only a few sites,
“ephemeral and not worthy of excava-
tion” (M. Collins 1995, 368) were noted
on the inside of bends (Texas Archeologi-
cal Research Laboratory [TARL] ﬁles).
Are we to infer that people almost never
chose to live on the inside of river bends?
No, I suggest we are to infer instead that
the surveys failed to discover sites buried

ARCHEOLOGY IN CENTR AL TEXAS / 107

upper reaches of small streams (Blum and
Valastro 1989; M. Collins et al. 1990).
S. Alan Skinner (1974) found larger sites
typically occurring along the main trunk
of the Guadalupe River, with small sites
being more characteristic of the tributar-
ies. He interpreted this situation to reﬂect
an Archaic settlement pattern with base
camps on the large river linked to extrac-
tive sites in the smaller valleys. However,
this conclusion cannot be valid because
the archeological record formed differ-
ently along the main trunk and its tribu-
taries. Exposed Early Archaic sites are
extremely infrequent in the main Guada-
lupe valley, probably because most of
them are deeply buried in Late Holocene
alluvium, whereas in the upper reaches of
tributaries, where little deposition has oc-
curred since the Early Holocene, compo-
nents dating throughout the Archaic are
present, often mixed together in multi-
component sites on long-stable surfaces
(M. Collins et al. 1990, 13 –15).

Finally, recent mapping and dating of
allostratigraphic units in the valley of the
Colorado River downstream from the
Balcones Escarpment (Blum 1992) has
shown that major changes have taken
place in a much shorter time frame than
previously inferred (e.g., Baker and Pen-
teado-Orellana 1978).1 During the cul-
turally relevant past (ca. 12,000 b.p. to
the present), four periods of Colorado
River valley geomorphic history can be
recognized, based on Blum’s ﬁndings
(1992), as relevant to the formation of
the archeological record in the eastern
part of central Texas.

At approximately twelve thousand
years ago, the river had downcut in its
older valley ﬁll and was cutting into
bedrock. High surfaces of the older ﬁll
(the Eagle Lake Alloformation that had
built up during the period between
18,000 and 15,000 b.p.) were exposed as
terraces along the river as possible locali-
ties for any very early sites to form. Sig-
niﬁcant portions of this landform were
subsequently cut away, but scores of
square kilometers are still present in the
central Texas stretch of the lower Colo-
rado River valley. From then until about
thirty-ﬁve hundred years ago, the valley
ﬂoor aggraded, forming a unit mapped as
Member 1 of the Columbus Bend Allo-
formation. This unit dates from about
eleven thousand to thirty-three hundred
years ago and often exceeds 10 m in

Fig. 3.7. Site distributions in the lower reaches of Marshall Ford (Lake Travis) basin; note that
relatively few sites were mapped on the inside of river bends; sites 41TV208, 229, 240, 307, and

1995).

on the interior of the river bends. Since
streams almost invariably cut on the out-
side of their bends and deposit on the in-
side, a sequence of prograding deposits
forms on the interior of bends. These are
referred to as “point bars” and are often
the ideal depositional environment for
the formation of stratiﬁed sites. Such
sites, however, are commonly invisible or
decidedly meager in appearance at the

surface, exactly the pattern seen in the
three surveys.

Another aspect of site distributional
data in the valleys of major streams is that
even along a single stream, different his-
tories of deposition often occurred in dif-
ferent areas. Almost no Early Holocene
ﬁll is exposed in the larger stream valleys
in the central Edwards Plateau, and al-
most no Late Holocene ﬁll occurs in the

thickness. Deeply stratiﬁed sites contain-
ing Paleoindian to Late Archaic period
components, such as the Vara Daniel site
in Austin’s Zilker Park (Ricklis et al.
1991), formed in this unit. This unit was
then partly cut by the river. Member 2 of
the same alloformation then aggraded
against, and partly over, Member 1 be-
tween about sixteen hundred and a thou-
sand years ago. Member 2 often exceeds
12 m in thickness and contains Late Ar-
chaic to early Late Prehistoric sites; these,
too, were present at the Vara Daniel site
(Takac et al. 1992). There are a few hun-
dred square kilometers of Members 1
and 2 of the Columbus Bend Alloforma-
tion in central Texas, concealing an un-
told number of buried archeological
components.

The river downcut again, approxi-
mately a thousand years ago, before de-
positing its most recent unit, Member 3
of the Columbus Bend Alloformation,
which is inset against the older Members
2 and 1. Blum (1992, 193) noted mod-
ern artifacts (e.g., barbed wire) in this
member, but radiocarbon ages back to ca.
500 b.p. (Blum 1992, table 6.4) indicate
that some buried Late Prehistoric compo-
nents could be present. Accelerated depo-
sition in the last one hundred years (Blum
1992, 193) is probably attributable to
disruption of the natural vegetation by
grazing and farming, and this activity
may have buried most late sites.

For the archeologist, the horizontal ex-

tent of ﬂuvial deposits may be as impor-
tant as their temporal coverage. Deposits
of any particular age might occur only in
extremely limited areas favorable for dep-
osition, might be massive and extensive,
or might be moderately widespread.
Knowledge of these conditions is essential
to discovering sites and to interpreting
their frequencies relative to other sites
and by time periods.

“Eocene” Sand Sheet and the
Big Brushy Formation

Along the eastern margin of the cen-
tral Texas archeological area is a narrow
strip of deep sandy land (see Fig. 3.4c),
generally mapped as Eocene age on geo-
logic maps (Barnes 1981). As in much of
eastern Texas, prehistoric sites found in
this setting commonly are either buried
or exposed by some kind of land distur-
bance (see K. Brown 1986; A. Taylor

108 / PR AIRIES AND PLAINS

1987). Just outside the central Texas area,
but in the same sand belt, recent geo-
archeological work has deﬁned a Holo-
cene unit (the Big Brushy formation), a
widespread sand mantle of variable thick-
ness that in places contains buried archeo-
logical remains (see Bianchi 1984; Bous-
man and Fields 1988; Perttula et al. 1986).
This work sheds light on the kinds of for-
mation processes that might be expected
in the central Texas part of the sand belt.
Basically, in the words of C. Britt Bous-
man and Ross C. Fields regarding the Big
Brushy formation, “Sand thickness is
viewed as having a direct bearing on the
preservation and interpretability of the
archeological record, with thick sands
having the potential to contain intact,
stratiﬁed cultural deposits and thin sands
having a greater likelihood of contain-
ing eroded, displaced cultural materials”
(Bousman and Fields 1988, 195). Fur-
thermore, since the Big Brushy formation
is thought to have eolian and colluvial
facies, it has the potential of reﬂecting
changes in environmental conditions
over time.

Blackland Prairie

That band of the coastal plain just east
of the Balcones Escarpment known as the
Black Prairie or Blackland Prairie is an
area of deep soils ultrarich in clay, called
ultraclay soils. Sites formed in these soils
are subject to extreme disruption through
soil processes (pedoturbation). Soil text-
books (e.g., Boul et al. 1989) even use
Houston Black Clay, the prevalent soil
series in the Blackland Prairie, as repre-
sentative of the adverse properties of ultra-
clay soils (see Fig. 3.4d). Extreme plas-
ticity when wet, deep vertical cracking
when dry (Dufﬁeld 1970a), and a pro-
pensity to roll like a slowly boiling thick
liquid (producing soil features called gil-
gai ) are the factors that threaten site in-
tegrity. Gilgai movement in soil is like
that in dough as it is kneaded. In deep
Houston Black Clay, the rolling motion
typically extends downward about 1.5 to
2 m and produces distinctive shear fea-
tures, called slickensides, between masses
of soil that move past each other. I have
seen pieces of modern metal and glass
dragged to the bottom of gilgai (a down-
ward distance of more than 1.5 m) by
this process, showing that the rolling time
of gilgai is on the order of decades. If ex-

cavations encounter large slickensides (of-
ten observable in irregular planes 25 to
50 cm or more across) in a site, that site,
in all likelihood, is badly disturbed.

Bluffs and Colluvial Slopes

Much of central Texas is dissected
limestone plateau land, and there are also
areas where hills of granite, sandstone,
and other rock types occur. Hillsides and
valley walls in all of these are subject to
degradation in the form of slope move-
ment, or colluviation. At least one site
(41ML64 in McLennan County) has
been documented as partially disrupted
by a landslide (M. Collins and Holliday
1985). Where overhangs (rockshelters)
occur, these, too, degrade and collapse
over time (M. Collins 1991b). Sites on,
or at the toe of, slopes are subject to
movement or burial by colluviation. As
rockshelters degrade and collapse, sites
within them are buried in detritus. All of
these factors profoundly shape the arche-
ological record.

Ubiquitous Processes

Minor surface deformation events, as
well as earthquakes with magnitudes up
to 5 on the Richter scale, occur in the
area (Davis et al. 1989; Osmond 1963).
The consequences of seismic and tectonic
activity during the Late Quaternary (see
E. Collins 1982; E. Collins et al. 1980)
may have inﬂuenced human history or
the archeological record of that history in
central Texas. Known consequences of
earthquakes include degradation of rock-
shelters and blufﬂines (M. Collins 1991b),
soil liquefaction or ejection events, and
the alteration of stream courses (Rapp
1986; Schumm 1977; Talwani and Cox
1985).

Pedoturbation occurs to some extent

in all soils. Common forms include
the action of tree roots, brush, and her-
baceous vegetation; the burrowing of
animals; and the constant action of earth-
worms. Dens of the social insects, partic-
ularly ants, can also cause extensive dam-
age to sites.

As the landscape aggrades, soil forma-
tion and the disruptive forces that accom-
pany it are lessened proportionally to the
rate of aggradation. Conversely, cessation
of aggradation intensiﬁes disturbance in
the soil zone. It also invites the mixing
of archeological evidence from multiple

ARCHEOLOGY IN CENTR AL TEXAS / 109

periods of occupation, called palimpsests
(see Ferring 1986b). It is important to rec-
ognize that any surface upon which ar-
cheological materials rest was stable, at
least brieﬂy. If that surface is buried, ag-
gradation resumed after a time of stability.
Not all buried surfaces are equal, since
the time of stability can vary from days to
millennia before deposition resumes.

Archeologists do not always discern
the differences among buried archeologi-
cal surfaces, placing too much emphasis
on the fact of burial and not enough
on the nature of the interval of stability
(lacuna or hiatus) that preceded burial.
Palimpsest sites can become buried and
be just as mixed as their counterparts at
the present surface.

A particular pitfall is that of pene-
contemporaneity, or burial at the same
time. At any moment, the land surface
will be composed of surfaces that have
been exposed for different lengths of time.
If widespread deposition abruptly covers
part of that land surface, the preceding
interval of stability will have been of
greater duration in some areas than in
others, but the overlying sediments will
all be of the same age. Any attempt by
archeologists to use the age of a deposi-
tional unit to estimate anything other
than the minimum age of underlying
archeological materials is at risk.

Chronology and Other
Accomplishments

It has become fashionable to criticize
efforts to build an archeological chronol-
ogy for central Texas. Wilson W. McKin-
ney (1981); Duane Peter et al. (1982); Le-
Roy Johnson (1987, 1991; L. Johnson and
Goode 1994); Stephen L. Black (1989b);
Michael Collins (1994a; M. Collins et al.
1991); and G. Lain Ellis (1994), among
others, have all found fault with the lead-
ing chronological schemes proposed by
Frank Weir (1976) and by Elton Prewitt
(1981, 1985). There are signiﬁcant ﬂaws
in both, but these are also two remarkable
and signiﬁcant contributions to the arche-
ology of the region, not so much as chro-
nologies but as attempts to integrate and
synthesize large amounts of archeological
data. It is also important to remember
that Weir and Prewitt did not lack for
prototypes (notably those of L. Johnson
et al. 1962 and of Sorrow et al. 1967).

LeRoy Johnson et al. (1962) and Sor-
row et al. (1967) proposed local archeo-
logical chronologies, each on the basis of
a few sites. The data from the Footbridge,
Oblate, and Wunderlich sites were not
robust chronologically, but an effort was
made to bring central Texas chronological
thought into closer agreement with that
being used in the eastern United States
(L. Johnson et al. 1962; L. Johnson and
Goode 1994). The Evoe Terrace and
Landslide sites (Sorrow et al. 1967) af-
forded better chronological evidence, es-
pecially with the beneﬁt of earlier ﬁnd-
ings at the nearby Youngsport site (Shafer
1963). Sequencing of diagnostic chipped
stone tools, especially projectile points,
was emphasized in these efforts.

Weir (1976) and Prewitt (1981, 1985)
proceeded beyond chronologizing projec-
tile point types; sought to ﬁnd temporal
patterning in site types, features within
sites, and assemblages of artifacts; and of-
fered suggestions to explain some of the
patterns they discerned. G. Lain Ellis
(1994) presents an insightful critique of
Weir’s and Prewitt’s efforts.

It is a credit to Weir’s and Prewitt’s
skills in the art of archeological analysis
that such comprehensive schema could be
developed when many of the data they
used were from sites with (a) mixed com-
ponents, (b) poor stratiﬁcation, (c) un-
clear associations among artifacts and be-
tween artifacts and features, and (d) weak
associations between samples dated by ra-
diocarbon and the target archeological
manifestations. Weir (1976) relied on
only 46 radiocarbon dates, the vast ma-
jority of which were from sites outside of
central Texas; Prewitt (1985) had 147 ra-
diocarbon dates.

Considerable use has been made of
Weir’s and especially of Prewitt’s chrono-
logical schemes, and revisions have been
proposed (e.g., M. Collins et al. 1991;
L. Johnson and Goode 1994; Ricklis and
Collins 1994). The work of verifying and
improving the regional archeological
chronology will always remain unﬁnished.
Recent efforts, especially the more rigor-
ous use of absolute dating (see L. Johnson
and Goode 1994), show promise for sub-
stantial improvements. Importantly, the
caveat posted by LeRoy Johnson (1987)
regarding Prewitt’s chronology must con-
tinue to be heeded.

Many sites in central Texas are deﬁcient

or totally lacking in suitable organic ma-
terials for conventional radiocarbon dat-
ing. Use of AMS (accelerator mass spec-
trometry) in radiocarbon dating has
enhanced the capability of the technique
and brings more sites within the scope of
radiocarbon dating.

Alternatives to radiocarbon dating and
application of radiocarbon techniques to
a wider array of materials are also impor-
tant developments. Archeomagnetic
(Eighmy 1993), optically stimulated lu-
minescent (Stokes 1992), thermolumi-
nescent (M. Collins 1994c, 499 –501),
and in rare cases even obsidian hydration
(Stevenson 1992) procedures may hold
promise for dating certain recalcitrant
sites in the area. Dating of organic con-
stituents of bone, soil, sediments, snail
shells, travertines, and other carbonate
rocks using radiocarbon techniques are
becoming more useful as the chemistry
of each becomes better known and the
problems associated with assaying these
materials become less serious.

Burned rock middens, because they
are numerous and conspicuous in central
Texas, have long received a large share of
archeologists’ attention. After decades of
limited success in understanding what
these sites represent in human behavioral
terms, recent efforts employing more
thoughtful research strategies and im-
proved techniques for gathering and ana-
lyzing data have begun to extract infor-
mation that promises to answer some
questions and frame others more clearly.
Perhaps the single most fundamental con-
ceptual advance in burned rock midden
research is recognition that burned rock
middens likely formed in several different
ways. The recovery of detailed data on
the structure, composition, content, and
context of middens in order to have data
on explicitly deﬁned material expressions
of different aspects of human behavior is
the approach that has long been lacking
in burned rock midden research (Black
et al. 1997; M. Collins 1991a, 1994b;
Creel 1991a; Goode 1991; Hester 1991b;
M. Howard 1991; Prewitt 1991; Potter
and Black 1995; Potter et al. 1995).

Archeology in central Texas has also
seen the development of sophisticated re-
search into the technology of stone tool
manufacture and use. A trend that began
in the late 1960s (e.g., Sorrow 1969) and
has become almost routine (e.g., Ensor

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

03-A2946  4/13/04  11:54 AM  Page 110

and Mueller-Wille 1988) is the inclusion
of technological ﬁndings in lithic artifact
descriptions. This practice has included
efforts at sourcing cherts (e.g., Quigg and
Peck 1995) and obsidians (e.g., Hester
et al. 1985) along with sustained consid-
erations of how people acquired stone and
worked it, as well as how they used, main-
tained, and recycled the resultant objects.
What has not occurred is any regional
synthesis of the diverse descriptive data
that have been amassed. Debitage analy-
sis, properly done on assemblages of high
contextual quality, contributes otherwise
unknowable information about prehis-
toric knapping behavior (see M. Collins
1994a; Ensor and Mueller-Wille 1988;
Quigg and Peck 1995; Ricklis 1994b).
Although ceramics are far less com-
mon than lithic artifacts in central Texas,
concern with ceramic technology and the
cultural implications of pottery-making
behavior has recently emerged (e.g.,
L. Johnson 1994; Perttula et al. 1995b;
Reese-Taylor et al. 1994). This develop-
ment is an important one that, if sus-
tained, will produce valuable results con-
cerning the prehistoric central Texas
archeological record.

Archeologists in central Texas have in-
creasingly considered the processes of site
formation and incorporated the ﬁndings
into their interpretations (e.g., Potter and
Black 1995). This is not a research goal
in its own right, but it is an essential ele-
ment in sound archeological inquiry, and
it should become a routine part of any
site investigation. An outstanding early
example of the site-formation-process
perspective is that of Kelley and Camp-
bell (1942), which considered the rela-
tionship between rates of alluviation and
the formation of burned rock middens.
Unfortunately, this perspective did not
prevail in the region, and only recently
has it become very common.

Butzer (1982) notes that the archeo-

logical record can be viewed on three
contrasting scales—micro, meso, and
macro. Research at each scale has its own
set of strengths and weaknesses. Archeo-
logical inquiry in central Texas has heavily
emphasized the mesoscale, which usually
encompasses a single site and its immedi-
ate setting. Unfortunately, archeological
patterns are more vulnerable to disrup-
tion at the mesoscale than at either the
microscale or the macroscale (M. Collins

110 / PR AIRIES AND PLAINS

et al. 1991a). A few studies at the macro-
scale, where archeological data patterns
covering wide areas are sought, have been
concluded, and they incorporate data
from central Texas (Creel 1991a; Howard
1991; Largent and Waters 1990; Meltzer
1987, 1989; Meltzer and Bever 1995),
but considerable gain could be expected
from more such studies.

Historically, archeological excavations
in central Texas have emphasized the ver-
tical dimension, a direct outgrowth of the
emphasis placed on the building of an
archeological chronology. Growing inter-
est in recovering evidence of human be-
havior has led to increasing use of wide-
area excavations on “living surfaces” (e.g.,
at the Slab, Loeve-Fox, Higgins, Camp
Pearl Wheat, Mustang Branch, Turkey
Bend Ranch, Sleeper, and Rush sites, to
name a few). These shifts in emphasis
constitute one of the most positive devel-
opments in the regional paradigm, but
much is yet to be done to bring this ap-
proach to full fruition. Principally, the
ﬁrst requirement is that any archeological
array thought to be a “living surface” be
assessed for length of exposure. The pri-
mary aim in excavations of this sort is to
ﬁnd horizontal patterning within a single
component of short duration. Ideally,
that is a surface lived upon by only one
cultural group, who left material clues of
the spatial organization of their activities
where those patterns have not been sul-
lied by subsequent occupations of the
same surface (see Ferring 1986b; L. John-
son 1987). Rapid burial of such surfaces
is the surest process by which such condi-
tions are produced, and comprehensive
geologic evidence is the best indicator
that burial was swift and sure. Good ex-
amples of these conditions having been
met are for Late Prehistoric components
at the Rush (Quigg and Peck 1995) and
Mustang Branch (Ricklis 1994a, 1994b)
sites. Obviously, “living surfaces” can be
reused, as at the Slab site, where multiple
components are clearly indicated at the
same level in the site (Patterson 1987).
Difﬁculty arises when it is unclear how
long a surface remained exposed and how
many episodes of use may be represented
by the archeological materials on that sur-
face (M. Collins 1994a).

A great advantage of horizontal expo-
sures in archeological sites is the opportu-
nity to fully investigate entire features in

their horizontal contexts. Thoughtful in-
quiry into the form, function, and con-
tent of burned rock features, and the be-
haviors responsible for their creation (see
Thoms 1989) is burgeoning in central
Texas (M. Collins 1991a; M. Collins et al.
1990; L. Johnson 1991; Potter et al.
1995). Explicit criteria for recognizing
ovens, open hearths, rock disposal heaps,
and other behaviorally signiﬁcant kinds
of burned rock features are emerging, al-
though consensus on these interpretations
does not yet exist. The use of geomagnetic
evidence to determine whether or not any
given burned rock has been moved since
it was last heated and cooled is one tech-
nique that holds promise in this area of
inquiry (Gose 1994). The greater use of
comparative ethnology and ethnographic
analogy (Thoms 1989) has also been a
major beneﬁt to this line of inquiry. It is
too early to know what the potential of
investigations in this vein might be.
Wide area excavations have also

brought about more interest in the nature
of prehistoric structures in central Texas
(L. Johnson 1997; Lintz et al. 1995). For
examples, at the Lion Creek, Slab, Turkey
Bend Ranch, Mustang Branch, Currie,
Rocky Branch, and Zatopec sites, possible
evidence of structures has emerged. These
structures suggest the presence of domi-
ciles or other architecture from Early Ar-
chaic to Late Prehistoric times. The na-
ture and functions of domestic structures
have been among the more neglected top-
ics in central Texas archeology, but these
recent developments should bring about
increased awareness and interest in the
subject. New ﬁndings will then follow in
due course.

Faunal remains and, less often, ﬂoral
remains have long been identiﬁed and re-
ported when recovered from archeologi-
cal sites in central Texas ( Jelks 1962; Mc-
Donald 1974; Sorrow et al. 1967; Weir
1979). In the last few years, investigators
have emphasized closer scrutiny of faunal
taphonomy and have made more con-
certed efforts to recover and interpret eco-
nomically important ﬂoral remains, in-
cluding pollen and phytoliths as well as
macroﬂoral specimens (Black and Mc-
Graw 1985; Hester 1973; Holloway
1988; M. Howard 1991; Jelks 1962).
Bone breakage is no longer lamented as
interfering with taxonomic classiﬁcation
but is seen as an eloquent expression of

ARCHEOLOGY IN CENTR AL TEXAS / 111

the cultural and natural forces that have
operated on the assemblage (Masson and
Holderby 1994). These views are essen-
tial to understanding the human behav-
iors and adaptations behind the regional
archeological record, and thus they inte-
grate closely with the investigation of liv-
ing surfaces and burned rock features.
Archeologists in central Texas have
been mindful of the need to understand
the relationship between cultural history
and past climatic conditions (Bryant and
Holloway 1985; Bryant and Shafer 1977;
Gunn and Mahula 1977). Integration of
the two lines of evidence (see Bryant and
Shafer 1977) has not been particularly
successful, however, in part because the
better environmental records have not
been found in archeological sites (Blum
1992) and because neither record has
been consistent and precise.

An almost complete vacuum exists be-

tween the prehistoric and ethnographic
records of native peoples in central Texas.
In the 1990s, considerable progress was
made in explaining this gap and focusing
attention on issues that are perhaps sub-
ject to meaningful investigation. No
longer are the Jumanos ( J. Kelley 1947)
or the Tonkawas (D. Suhm 1960) con-
sidered to be possible descendants of the
authors of Toyah prehistoric manifesta-
tions; no serious scholar still considers
Cabeza de Vaca’s path to have crossed
central Texas (Campbell and Campbell
1981). The present territory of central
Texas was not the long-term ancestral
homeland of any indigenous group for
whom an ethnographic account exists.
The ethnographically well-known Co-
manche, Apache, Wichita, Kiowa, and
even the Tonkawa arrived in central Texas
just before or during the early European
contact period (Campbell 1988; New-
comb 1961, 1993). Historic records doc-
ument the presence of numerous other
groups during the ﬁrst decades of Euro-
pean contact but provide very little infor-
mation about them. Concerted ethnohis-
toric work (see multiple listings by T. N.
Campbell under Indian group names in
Branda 1976; Campbell 1988; Campbell
and Campbell 1985; Newcomb 1993)
has gleaned valuable but incomplete in-
formation on these peoples who mostly
vanish from historical view by the early
eighteenth century. Thus, we have an
early part of the Historic period, essen-

tially a protohistoric period, consisting of
historic glimpses of indigenous peoples,
and a later Historic subperiod during
which relocated, acculturated remnants of
earlier groups as well as very recently ar-
rived groups are known from more com-
plete historical records and, in some
cases, later ethnographic studies. These
facts greatly reduce but do not eliminate
the usefulness of any direct historical ap-
proach to the prehistory of central Texas
(M. Collins and Ricklis 1994; Newcomb
1993).

The Gisement

Six features and 35 artifacts recovered
in an excavation of the Camp Pearl Wheat
site in Kerr County, Texas (M. Collins
et al. 1990), tell us more about Archaic
lifeways than the large burned rock mid-
den and its 1,282 artifacts documented at
the John Ischy site in Williamson County
(Sorrow 1969). The difference is in data
quality. At John Ischy, multiple compo-
nents were hopelessly mixed as they accu-
mulated in a midden on a long-stable land
surface, whereas at Camp Pearl Wheat the
land surface was stable for only a brief
time, during which people occupied the
site on one or a very few occasions and
their leavings were buried before later cul-
tural materials could be added. Sorrow
could detect patterns in the distributions
of certain artifact classes across the John
Ischy site—for example, manos were
more abundant just outside of the mid-
den than within or farther away from it
(Sorrow 1969, 50 –51 and ﬁg. 27)—but
there was no way to know if this situation
reﬂects behavior that continued through-
out the thirty-two hundred or so years
(my estimate) of the site’s use or for only
some portion of that time.

In contrast, all or part of a single, inte-

grated, functional artifact assemblage is
probably represented at the Camp Pearl
Wheat site in an isolable component.
This artifact assemblage contributes to an
emerging regional pattern of site types
and distributions that reﬂect subsistence
behavior during the Early Archaic (see
discussion below).

Localities where low-energy natural
deposition is active during or between
episodes of human occupation afford the
optimum conditions for the isolation of
discrete assemblages of material cultural

remains. Such localities become stratiﬁed
archeological sites with one or more
isolable archeological components sealed
between strata of natural deposits. When
archeological methods of investigating
such sites are integrated with those from
the earth sciences, the results are superior
to any that derive from archeology alone.
Europeans studying the prehistory of the
Old World, especially in France, have
long recognized and practiced this inte-
grated approach to site-speciﬁc as well as
regional studies. (A good discussion as re-
gards rockshelters appears in Laville et al.
1980, and A. G. Brown [1997] addresses
the issue for ﬂuvial site settings.)

A site with stratiﬁed archeological and

geological layers is referred to in French
as a gisement (plural, gisements) (both pro-
nounced “geeze-mohn,” with the “gee”
as in “gee whiz”). Increasingly over the
last forty years in Old World prehistory
the methodology for excavating and in-
terpreting gisements has emphasized the
interdisciplinary approach, covering geol-
ogy, soil science, paleontology, palynol-
ogy, archeology, and whatever other ﬁelds
are appropriate. Had archeologists in cen-
tral Texas over the last forty years concen-
trated on the discovery and comprehen-
sive analysis of gisements even a small
fraction as much as have their counter-
parts in Europe, the record at hand today
would be more complete, chronology
would have been much more easily con-
trolled, better constrained assemblages
would exist for each time interval, and
the regional archeological sequence would
be integrated with a paleoenvironmental
sequence. Data of this improved quality
would have long ago fostered the kinds
of substantive research just now begin-
ning to emerge in the region.

Gisements can form in caves, rock-
shelters, dunes, or any area of natural,
low-energy deposition. As a practical
matter in central Texas, most gisements
have formed in the alluvium of stream
valleys.

Gisements and
Central Texas Archeology

Contrary to an appearance that gise-
ments might be scarce in central Texas or
that none was known until recently, the
problem has been that most archeologists
have simply not appreciated the value of

112 / PR AIRIES AND PLAINS

the ones that have been found and have
not rigorously sought others. Also, it is
common for gisements in central Texas to
have denser cultural deposits in the upper
layers and sparser ones at depth (e.g., as at
the Landslide and Wilson-Leonard sites).
I have no doubt that countless times the
excavators of such sites stopped digging
either when artifact counts dropped off or
when a sterile deposit was encountered
(see the account of the previous testing of
the Camp Pearl Wheat site [M. Collins
et al. 1990]). In those cases, any deeper
components went undetected.

Deep stratiﬁed sites, with one, several,

or many isolable cultural components,
have been documented since at least the
1930s (for example, the Merrell Site, ex-
cavated in 1934 and 1935 [Campbell
1948] and Rob Roy, dug in 1938 and
1939 [A. Jackson 1939]), and a few have
been important in the development of
the local record (notably Youngsport,
Landslide, Kyle, Smith, Loeve-Fox, and
Jetta Court). Nonetheless, in spite of
archeological work begun at least by
1918 (Pearce 1932b, 48), only about
thirty-one gisements with one or more
securely isolated archeological compo-
nents have been reported in central Texas
(Figs. 3.8 and 3.9a and b).

I have characterized the components at

these sites as having either very high or
moderately high integrity on arbitrary
and somewhat subjective criteria. Com-
ponents with high integrity (depicted in
solid shading in Fig 3.9a) show evidence
of rapid burial, lack evidence for exten-
sive postdepositional disturbance, and
consist of a relatively homogeneous
archeological assemblage (especially of di-
agnostic artifact forms). Components of
moderately high integrity (lightly shaded
in Fig. 3.9a) are either slightly deﬁcient
in one or more of these criteria, the
sample is too small for a high-conﬁdence
assessment, or there is not enough infor-
mation to assess integrity fully.

Several aspects of the information in
Fig. 3.9a require comment. Three main
periods, Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric, are used approximately in the
conventional sense to depict what have
long been inferred to be signiﬁcant shifts
in adaptations; these inferences may not
be entirely sound, but the periods are,
nonetheless, useful in organizing the
archeological record. Subdivisions of

these periods into subperiods are also
based on adaptive shifts thought to reﬂect
changes in subsistence strategies. In this
presentation, the subdivisions of the Ar-
chaic follow the recent revisions proposed
by L. Johnson and Goode (1994). Early
and late subperiods of the Paleoindian
and Late Prehistoric periods are used in
this presentation to reﬂect distinctive
archeological patterns.

The ﬁner subdivisions (style intervals)

are dependent primarily on diagnostic
projectile point styles (“types”) that

change for reasons not really understood
at our present level of knowledge. These
subdivisions, too, follow approximately
the scheme offered by L. Johnson and
Goode (1994) and derive from the syn-
theses of Weir (1976) and Prewitt (1981,
1985). As already observed, some style
intervals are better constrained than oth-
ers—that called Toyah being probably
the best, and that called Taylor, perhaps
the poorest.

trayed in radiocarbon years before the

The Late Paleoindian and Middle Archaic
subperiods are represented by the fewest
components (four and ﬁve, respectively);
that means that 6.5 percent of the com-
ponents are in the Late Paleoindian sub-
period, comprising 10 percent of the se-
quence, and that 8.2 percent are in the
Middle Archaic subperiod—16.5 percent
of the sequence.

Twelve geological, palynological, or
paleontological records (see Fig. 3.9b) in
and near the central Texas archeological
area reﬂect a consistent but generalized
environmental sequence (see Table 3.2).
Alternating intervals of comparatively
mesic or xeric conditions have been in-
ferred by Bousman in the pollen se-
quences from bogs in east-central Texas
(M. Collins and Bousman 1993) and by
Rickard S. Toomey from the vertebrate
faunal record of Hall’s Cave (Toomey
1993; Toomey et al. 1993). The bog-
pollen sequence is not well controlled
chronologically; however, the available
dates indicate relatively constant rates of
sedimentation, from which Bousman in-
terpolated the depicted sequence. Bous-
man’s interpretation of the reported
pollen data from Weakly and Boriack
bogs considered the relative frequency of
grass to arboreal pollens. In doing this, a
climatically sensitive aspect of the pollen
record emerges from the complete spec-
trum that otherwise contains numerous
taxa, of which the abundances are more
likely reﬂective of localized conditions
around the bogs.

In Hall’s Cave a deeply stratiﬁed,
abundant, high-resolution sequence of
small animal remains was found. Toomey
excavated 3.7 m into the ﬁll of Hall’s
Cave and recovered thousands of faunal
specimens (more than twelve thousand
had been cataloged in 1993, with many
more remaining to be cataloged). Only
the upper 2 m of the Hall’s Cave se-
quence is considered here, and the cli-
matic history depicted is based only on
the relative proportions of the least shrew
(Cryptotis sp. [which requires a relatively
moist habitat]) to the desert shrew (No-
tiosorex sp. [found in more arid habitats])
following Toomey (1993) and Toomey
et al. (1993). The Hall’s Cave sequence
I have used here is controlled by 41 radio-
carbon dates on bone provided by Thomas
Stafford (1995, 1997, personal communi-
cations; there are now almost 150 dates)

references).

present, the convention generally fol-
lowed by geoarcheologists. This conven-
tion facilitates use of uncalibrated dates
from the literature of the geological sci-
ences and from that of earlier archeologi-
cal projects. It also allows any calibration
to be applied. As a better, stratigraphi-
cally constrained archeological sequence
emerges, higher-precision radiocarbon
procedures along the lines advocated by
L. Johnson and Goode (1994) will have
greater efﬁcacy.

Sixty-one components of moderately

high to high stratigraphic integrity are
reported for the thirty-one central Texas
gisements presented in Fig. 3.9a. Addi-
tional components of lesser integrity oc-
cur at a number of these sites, but these
are not included. As seen in a cumulative
percentage graph of these components
by subperiod (Fig. 3.10), the record is
weighted toward the recent end with
nineteen (31 percent) of the sixty-one
components assigned to the Late Prehis-
toric period (the last one thousand years,
or 8.7 percent of the local prehistory).

and by three charcoal dates (Toomey
1993). Because of the large number of
dates, the fact that the dates are almost
perfectly stratigraphically consistent, and
the generally high internal agreement be-
tween radiocarbon ages determined on
different chemical fractions of the same
bone, this sequence can be considered
one of the best-dated and most environ-
mentally sensitive records in North
America. Concern expressed by L. John-
son and Goode (1994, 22) in regard to
dates on the earthen ﬁll of Hall’s Cave is
clearly dispelled by the bone-organic
chronology. When it is fully reported, the
Hall’s Cave biostratigraphy will be a land-
mark contribution to Quaternary studies.
These pollen and faunal records both

indicate an early xeric interval ending
near 12,000 b.p. (closely correlating with
the “Clovis Drought” noted in Haynes
1991) followed by a signiﬁcant period of
relatively mesic conditions. Each record
then indicates a long Middle Holocene
interval of relatively xeric conditions,
which were slightly ameliorated at roughly
its midpoint. That the two records are
not synchronous probably results largely,
if not entirely, from inaccuracy in the
ages interpolated for the bog-pollen se-
quence. In general terms, the Middle
Holocene xeric interval lasted approxi-
mately ﬁve thousand years— close to half
of the local prehistory. The effects of
Middle Holocene aridity are seen widely
in central Texas, often in the form of
stream incision, but precise dating is of-
ten difﬁcult (see Abbott 1994).

Late Holocene conditions returned to
being more mesic. The pollen and faunal
indicators are inconsistent only in the lat-
est Holocene, when a ﬁnal swing toward
xeric conditions appears in the Hall’s Cave
fauna. Other than relatively small samples
of the species (and, therefore, possible
sampling error) on which Toomey based
his interpretations, the inconsistency is
not readily understood. It is possible, of
course, that contrasting conditions could
exist because the pollen record is from the
easternmost edge of the area and the fau-
nal record is from more nearly the west-
ernmost edge.

The relative abundance of bison in
and near central Texas has been inferred
from occurrences in archeological sites
(Dillehay 1974; Prewitt 1981, 1985;

03-A2946  4/13/04  11:54 AM  Page 115

ARCHEOLOGY IN CENTR AL TEXAS / 115

Erosion undoubtedly destroyed many
archeological sites, and many others, on
stable surfaces, resulted in palimpsests of
long duration. The approximately ﬁve
thousand years of the Middle Holocene
xeric interval— 43 percent of the record
—are represented by only about seven-
teen (22 percent) of the sixty-one compo-
nents in Fig. 3.9a.

Downcutting of valleys occurred
widely in the Middle Holocene, leaving
former valley ﬂoors above the reach of
most ﬂooding and bringing deposition on
these surfaces to a virtual halt. Major soils
that formed on these long stable surfaces
are documented over wide areas in the
valleys of central Texas during the Middle
Holocene, and many sites, especially
burned rock middens, reside on those
surfaces. It is from these numerous, highly
visible, artifact-rich sites that much of
the archeological record for the Middle
Holocene has been derived.

Returning for a moment to the poorly
deﬁned Taylor-style interval, the question
to be answered by future research is
whether its archeological scarcity reﬂects
a cultural reality or results from gaps in
the archeological record brought about by
erosion and reduced deposition during
the Middle Holocene. This poorly repre-
sented interval is left on Fig. 3.9a to un-
derscore this aspect of the record and to
provide a tempting target for sound
archeological dismissal or veriﬁcation.

Fortunately, all central Texas streams
did not respond in exactly identical fash-
ion to the Middle Holocene xeric interval,
and neither erosion nor nondeposition
are absolute in any ﬂuvial system —there
is always deposition somewhere. Deposits
of Middle Holocene age are present but
less abundant and less conspicuous than
those of the Early and Late Holocene
ages. Corollary to this, there are un-
doubtedly sites of Middle Holocene age,
in good geologic context, still waiting to
be discovered. The search for them will
need to be conducted using sampling de-
signs based in geomorphology (see Blum
and Lintz 1993, 313; Mandel 1992, 79 –
83; Nordt 1992, 68 –80).

In the Late Holocene, valley ﬁlling
prevailed, but one widespread episode
of downcutting occurred ca. 1000 b.p.
(S. Hall 1990). In part because the evi-
dence is better preserved, the Late Holo-

M. Collins et al. 1990). There is a general
correlation between bison occurrences
and comparatively mesic portions of the
bog-pollen and Hall’s Cave faunal records.
The geologic records are based on
ﬂuvial sequences where episodes of valley
ﬁlling alternate with periods of erosion
and/or stability and soil formation. Geo-
logic sequences portrayed in Fig. 3.9b are
based on data of varying completeness
and precision (particularly as regards dat-
ing). Geologists working with Quater-
nary-age sequences vary widely in their
application of the concept of soils (some
emphasizing soil formation and reporting
every minor soil, others emphasizing sedi-
mentary process and reporting only ma-
jor soils). Local conditions in each ﬂuvial
system differ, and circumstances deter-
mining the amount of radiocarbon dating
that can be applied are unequal. Further-
more, investigators allocate their radio-
carbon resources differently, some tar-
geting soils, others preferring to date
sediments. For these reasons, the depic-
tions in Fig. 3.9b must be viewed only as
indicating the general trends and are not
be taken to represent detailed, precisely
dated alluvial sequences.

Consistently, the valleys of central

Texas (and much of North America
[Haynes 1991, 1992, and 1993]) were
downcut and scoured of sediment in the
Late Pleistocene, approximately ﬁfteen
thousand to twelve thousand years ago.
Valley ﬁlling followed during the ensuing
mesic interval, and it is in these sedi-
ments that a number of the important
Early Paleoindian sites have been found.
Erosion and stability (with soil for-
mation) are more characteristic of the
Middle Holocene, during the long xeric
interval. This interval was ﬁrst recognized
in North America on the basis of exten-
sive evidence for erosion and arroyo cut-
ting in the southwestern United States,
and this interval has been called the Al-
tithermal (Antevs 1955). Whether or not
the interval was signiﬁcantly warmer, it
does seem to have been drier, and the pa-
leoenvironmental record of central Texas
was clearly inﬂuenced by dry conditions.
It is yet to be determined exactly what the
consequences of this xeric interval were in
terms of human ecology. It is abundantly
clear that the archeological record has
been signiﬁcantly and adversely affected
by the Middle Holocene xeric conditions.

cene record includes several less signiﬁcant
interruptions to deposition (see Fig. 3.9b).

Some years ago, Stephen A. Hall
(1986) reviewed an entirely different set
of geologic data and recognized essen-
tially the same aspects of the Quaternary
record as revealed by the data summa-
rized here in Fig. 3.9. He presented an
insightful synthesis of those data in an ef-
fort to inform archeologists on the nature
of the data base with which they were
working. The essence of the synoptic
graph from that presentation (Stephen
Hall 1995, personal communication) is
reproduced here as the far right column
of Fig. 3.9b. It is noteworthy that Hall
perceived these patterns in valleys primar-
ily north and northeast of central Texas,
indicating the geographic extent of this
general sequence.

A Brief Synthesis of the
Prehistory of Central Texas

This section brings together several
lines of evidence and offers a generalized
cultural history of central Texas. Ideally,
the empirical basis for this effort would
come solely from the sixty-one isolable
components arrayed in Fig. 3.9a, but two
limitations stand in the way of that ap-
proach. First, there are comparatively few
paleoenvironmental data from those com-
ponents, and those that are available are
neither consistent nor systematic. Second,
archeological assemblages recovered from
short-term components tend to be small,
and sampling error is probably respon-
sible for gaps in the data. There is a need
for many more such components if we
are to have a less rareﬁed record.

Pre-Clovis

Herbert Alexander (1982) is the only

author to explicitly use the term “pre-
Clovis” in reference to an archeological
assemblage from a central Texas site (the
Levi Rock Shelter). There is no question
that humans made the purported pre-
Clovis artifacts at Levi, but the assem-
blage is not coherent, was recovered from
unclear stratigraphic context, and lacks
several consistent radiocarbon dates. In
addition, the associated fauna is a mix of
extinct and extant species. A human pres-
ence of great antiquity has been proposed
to account for selected fractured stones
from Friesenhahn Cave (Krieger 1964),

116 / PR AIRIES AND PLAINS

for the absence of caudal vertebrae among
mammoth remains at the Waco Mam-
moth site ( J. Fox et al. 1992), and for a
“pre-sapiens” human form at Hitzfelder
Cave (Givens 1968a, 1968b). None of
these suggestions has been sustained with
sufﬁcient evidence for general acceptance.
This is not to say that some future ﬁnd
might not prevail as a pre-Clovis site.

In addition to meeting the widely rec-
ognized criteria of stratigraphic integrity,
unambiguous human evidence, and se-
cure dating, two factors must be over-
come in any search for sites earlier than
Clovis. The ﬁrst is geomorphological.
Most valleys in much of North America
were scoured to bedrock during the time
immediately before Clovis, meaning that
there is little chance of ﬁnding compo-
nents stratigraphically beneath Clovis in
ﬂuvial contexts. Outside of alluvial valley
settings, sites would either be on upland
landforms or in rockshelters. Upland lo-
calities rarely produce good stratigraphic
contexts, and rockshelters of pre-Clovis
age may be highly degraded (M. Collins
1991b). The second is cultural. It is not
known what might constitute the pre-
Clovis material cultural assemblages, and,
lacking these criteria for its recognition,
the evidence will almost certainly have
to come from the unlikely context of
strata underlying a Clovis archeological
component.

Paleoindian

Paleoindian sites and isolated artifacts
are fairly common in central Texas. Con-
cepts of Paleoindian lifeways in North
America generally and in central Texas
particularly are changing rapidly. The
simple cultural sequence of big-game
hunting “cultures”— Clovis, Folsom,
Plainview, and Cody (Krieger 1947b;
Sellards and Evans 1960; D. Suhm et al.
1954; Wormington 1957)—is no longer
adequate to accommodate the diverse
material cultural assemblages, projectile
point styles, and indicated subsistence
behaviors now documented during what
has been traditionally recognized as the
Paleoindian period, that is, earlier than
ca. 8800 b.p.

It is necessary to draw upon some data

from outside of central Texas to ade-
quately portray these developments, but
this is warranted because new results are
emerging at a rapid tempo from Paleo-

indian research in the Americas, there is
no cultural manifestation during Paleo-
indian times conﬁned to central Texas
alone, and, although sites in central Texas
are contributing evidence to the broader
developments, there are important ideas
emerging elsewhere with implications for
our understanding of the local Paleo-
indian evidence.

In this discussion, because the fun-
damental criteria for deﬁning “Paleo-
indians” (best articulated in Worming-
ton’s proposed concept of a Paleoeastern
Tradition [1957]) as nomadic big-game
hunters are being challenged, the Paleo-
indian period is deﬁned as a temporal
span from ca. 11,500 to 8800 years b.p.
This deﬁnition allows the issue of Paleo-
indian lifeways to be considered more
objectively. As already noted, an Early
and a Late subperiod of the Paleoindian
period are proposed for central Texas
(see Fig. 3.9a).

The Paleoindian period began as the

Pleistocene waned, when now-extinct
forms of large animals were among the
prey taken by Early Paleoindian hunters.
Projectile points in use during the Early
Paleoindian subperiod were primarily, if
not exclusively, of the lanceolate form and
typically were ﬂuted, Clovis and Folsom
being the deﬁned types.

Clovis is the earliest well-deﬁned cul-

tural horizon in central Texas. It is as-
sumed on the basis of dating at sites else-
where in North America that a Clovis
culture existed in central Texas between
approximately 11,200 and 10,900 b.p.
(Haynes 1992). Kincaid Rockshelter,
Wilson-Leonard, Gault, Horn Shelter
No. 2, Pavo Real, and Crockett Gardens
are where the principal Clovis compo-
nents have been documented in the area,
and surface ﬁnds of distinctive Clovis
points are reported from a number of
other localities (Meltzer 1987; Meltzer
and Bever 1995). Generally in North
America, Clovis manifestations are the
most diverse in the Paleoindian period,
with types of sites including kill, quarry/
stone-working, cache, camp, ritual, and
burial. The artifact inventory includes
chipped stone artifacts produced using
bifacial, ﬂake, and prismatic-blade tech-
niques (Fig. 3.11), always on high-quality
and often on exotic stones (M. Collins
1990b). Engraved stones (M. Collins
et al. 1991, 1992), bone and ivory points,

a bone shaft straightener, stone bolas, and
ochre are reported from Clovis contexts
(Collins n.d.).

Subsistence in Clovis times was based
on diverse fauna (including large herbi-
vores such as mammoth, bison, and horse
as well as smaller animals such as water
turtles, land tortoises, alligator, mice,
badger, and raccoon). The diet presum-
ably also included an array of plants
(M. Collins et al. 1989b).

A paved ﬂoor at Kincaid Rockshelter
reﬂects a greater investment of labor than
nomadic hunters could afford on a ﬂeeting
habitation. (Enough stones, totaling more
than two metric tons, were brought in
from the nearby riverbed to cover 10 m2
of the muddy shelter ﬂoor [M. Collins
1990b; M. Collins et al. 1989b].) Caches
of Clovis artifacts (in Texas and elsewhere
in North America [M. Collins n.d.]) are
suggestive of hunting and gathering
rounds that returned groups to the same
places more reliably than is the case with
nomadic hunters of big game.

Overall, the data indicate the Clovis
lifeway to have been that of well-adapted,
generalized hunter-gatherers with the
technology to hunt big game but not to
rely exclusively on it. Either their travels
or their contacts with other groups en-
abled them to acquire exotic stone from
great distances. Ironically, more is known
of these earliest Paleoindians than of
those who came later.

In contrast to Clovis lifeways, subsis-
tence in Folsom times seems to have been
more reliant upon specialized hunting of
big game (bison). Sites with Folsom-age
components in central Texas include
Horn Shelter No. 2, Pavo Real, Wilson-
Leonard, and Kincaid, the latter two of
which show evidence of bison hunting.
Camp, stone-working, and kill sites are all
that have been documented, mostly in or
near grassland habitats. These, along with
a tool kit of Folsom points, end scrapers,
and large ultrathin bifaces, are the trap-
pings of hunters (Fig. 3.12a, b, d, e). Di-
agnostic artifacts in Folsom times are the
large thin bifaces, ﬂuted Folsom points,
and thin unﬂuted (Midland) points.
Wilson-Leonard produced a thin,
unﬂuted point (Fig. 3.12c) in association
with bison bones and several bifaces
ﬂaked in the manner of Folsom bifaces.
This point, and the Goshen assemblage
of the Northern Plains (Frison et al.

1996), is part of a growing sample of
point styles that do not adhere to the
long-inferred sequence of Clovis-Folsom-
Plainview.

An urgent problem in and beyond
central Texas regards what constitutes
“Plainview” and where that manifestation
ﬁts chronologically. Much that has been
called Plainview—a plethora of unﬂuted,
lanceolate dart point forms—fails to
match the type-site points in thinness and
ﬂaking technology (see, e.g., Chandler

1994; Hester 1990b; Redder 1985). A se-
rious revisiting of existing typological and
contextual evidence bearing on this prob-
lem is needed as are new and better data.
I am beginning to suspect that true Plain-
views (as at the Plainview site and some

At Wilson-Leonard, the unﬂuted lanceo-
late points previously identiﬁed as Plain-

distinct from points at the Plainview type
site and date to the interval between 9500
and 8000 b.p. These points from Wilson-
Leonard are placed in the late Paleoindian
subperiod and referred to as Golondrina
(Fig. 3.12h), Barber (Fig. 3.12i), and St.
Mary’s Hall (Fig. 3.13a) (M. Collins

tailed, and Rodgers Side-Hollowed) (see
Fig. 3.12f ). The San Patrice–like points
occur at Wilson-Leonard and at Kincaid,
and both they and Daltons occur at Horn
Shelter No. 2 in central Texas. Daltons
are dated in the middle Mississippi valley
at ca. 10,500 to 9500 b.p. (Morse and
Morse 1983) and are close to that age at
Horn Shelter No. 2 (ca. 9980 –9500 b.p.
[Redder 1985]). San Patrice–like Rex
Rodgers points are associated with a Clo-

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

vis point and an unﬂuted lanceolate point
in what appears to be a single-event bison
kill site in the Texas Panhandle (Willey
et al. 1978b). They occur in a deposit
dated between 9980 and 9500 b.p. at
Horn Shelter No. 2 (Redder 1985) but
remain undated at Kincaid (M. Collins
1990b). Everything about the fauna, as-
sociated artifacts, and features (including
a double burial) found with San Patrice
(Brazos Fishtailed) and Dalton points at
Horn Shelter No. 2 suggests an Archaic-
like, hunter-gatherer cultural manifesta-
tion (Redder 1985). For Fig. 3.9a I have
tentatively regarded this material as tran-
sitional, between Early and Late Paleo-
indian; future work or new ﬁnds will help
clarify the picture.

Three style intervals—Wilson, Golon-

drina-Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall—are
here proposed for the late subperiod of
the Paleoindian period (see Fig. 3.9a).
These style intervals are moderately
well deﬁned at the Wilson-Leonard site
(M. Collins 1998c; Masson and Collins
1995). The Wilson component is the
better represented and is characterized as
having corner-notched, Archaic-like Wil-
son dart points (see Fig 3.12g) (Masson
and Collins 1995; Weir 1985) in associa-
tion with features, a burial, artifacts, and
faunal remains more Archaic than Paleo-
indian in appearance. Dates for this com-
ponent are ca. 10,000 to 9650 b.p. (Mas-
son and Collins 1995).

The Archaic-like character continues
for the Golondrina-Barber and St. Mary’s
Hall components, dated between 9500
and 8000 b.p. All three of these compo-
nents (Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and
St. Mary’s Hall) have burned rock fea-
tures, but the size of the features and the
amounts of rock present are decidedly less
than that in Archaic features of younger
ages. The subperiod here called Late
Paleoindian is in many ways archeologi-
cally intermediate (or “transitional”) be-
tween Early Paleoindian and the Archaic;
the question to be answered is how accu-
rately this material culture–based impres-
sion reﬂects their respective human adap-
tations. One suggestive indication of the
transitional nature of this cultural interval
is the continuity of the Angostura dart
point (see Fig. 3.13b) and similar forms
(see Fig. 3.13c, d) from the Late Paleo-
indian into the Early Archaic periods.

ARCHEOLOGY IN CENTR AL TEXAS / 119

For more than seventy-ﬁve hundred
years the basic Archaic mode of life pre-
vailed in central Texas. There are distinc-
tive changes to be seen within the Archaic
archeological record, but it is not clear
how signiﬁcant these changes really were
at the times they occurred. It is clear,
however, that in the broadest sense this
long span represents a basic adaptation
that was successful. A priority in the in-
vestigation of the Archaic record is to bet-
ter understand the fundamentals of that
adaptation and to determine the signiﬁ-
cance of the variations seen over time
and across space. In brieﬂy reviewing the
Archaic of central Texas, the cultural
chronological framework proposed by
L. Johnson and Goode (1994) is adopted
with minor adjustments.

The early part of the Archaic, from
ca. 8800 to 6000 b.p., is here subdivided
into the three projectile point style inter-
vals: Angostura (see Fig. 3.13b), early
split-stem (see Fig. 3.13e, f ), and Martin-
dale-Uvalde (see Fig. 3.13g–k) (see also
Fig. 3.9a). Open camp sites (including
Loeve, Wilson-Leonard, Richard Beene,
Sleeper, Jetta Court, Youngsport, Camp
Pearl Wheat, and Landslide) as well as a
cave (Hall’s Cave) occupied at the far
reach of daylight contain noteworthy
components of the Early Archaic. Nu-
merous dart points and Guadalupe tools
attributable to the Early Archaic also are
present in Kincaid Rockshelter, but in
mixed contexts.

It is unclear if the distributional data
are representative, but a number of au-
thors have noted a concentration of Early
Archaic components near the eastern and
southern margins of the Edwards Plateau
(Black 1989b; G. Ellis 1994; L. Johnson
1991; L. Johnson and Goode 1994;
W. McKinney 1981). Large and varied
burned rock features (at the Sleeper,
Camp Pearl Wheat, Wilson-Leonard,
Richard Beene sites), domestic structures
(Turkey Bend Ranch), and caches (Lind-
ner) are known from the Early Archaic.
Grooved or notched stones variously in-
terpreted as net sinkers or bola stones
(Boyd and Shafer 1997) appear in the
Early Archaic (see Fig. 3.13l, m). Grind-
ing and hammering stones, Clear Fork
(see Fig. 3.13n) and Guadalupe bifaces
(Fig. 3.14a) (both inferred to be special-
ized tools, probably for woodworking),
along with a variety of unifacial and

dred and ten thousand years old, one at
Wilson-Leonard and one at Horn Shelter
No. 2, have produced three of the better-
preserved early human skeletons of North
America (Steele 1998; Steele and Powell
1994). Both of these contained objects
of a utilitarian as well as an ornamental
nature.

Archaic

Two-thirds of the prehistory of central
Texas is “Archaic” in character. Archeolo-
gists have viewed the Archaic as a time
when the hunting and gathering of local

resources was intensiﬁed relative to that
in Late Paleoindian times. The material
culture shows greater diversity, especially
in the application of groundstone tech-
nology. A hallmark of the Archaic in cen-
tral Texas is extensive use of heated rocks,
present archeologically as various forms
of hearths, ovens, middens, scatters, and
other features. Multiple tons of heat-
altered rocks occur at many Archaic sites
in the region. The full gamut of uses for
these rocks can only be guessed at from
available evidence, but thoughtful inquiry
into this problem is increasingly common.

bifacial chipped stone implements, are
also reported from Early Archaic compo-
nents. Subsistence data are sparse for the
subperiod, but hunting of deer, exploita-
tion of various small animals, including
ﬁsh, and the cooking of bulbs in earth
ovens are indicated.

If the currently known site distribu-
tional data reﬂect land use in the Early
Archaic, then this was a time when
people were living in the better-watered
parts of the live-oak savanna habitats on
the Edwards Plateau. Acorns, deer, and
turkey are conspicuous among live-oak

savanna resources, but geophytes (e.g.,
onions, prairie turnip), other nuts (e.g.,
pecan, walnut), berries (e.g., agarita and
hawthorn), fruits (e.g., grapes, plums,
persimmons), and grass seeds, along with
a host of small terrestrial, amphibious,
and aquatic animals, round out a diverse
and reliable subsistence base.

Pollen and ﬂuvial geologic evidence
portrays an oscillation from mesic through
extremely xeric and back to mildly xeric
conditions during the Early Archaic (see
Fig. 3.9b). Bison (and perhaps antelope)
were evidently scarce or absent. What

mix of other foods constituted the staple
diet(s) during the Early Archaic is un-
known at this time.

The appearance during the early split-

stem interval (as at Wilson-Leonard) of
specialized cooking appliances that use
quantities of stone as heating elements
reﬂect a sophisticated technology for ex-
ploiting the oak-savanna resource base.
These features almost certainly represent
the technological antecedents of the
larger burned rock middens that become
a hallmark of later intervals in the Archaic
of central Texas.

The middle subperiod of the Archaic,

from ca. 6000 to 4000 b.p., too, is fur-
ther subdivided into three style inter-
vals: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor,
and Nolan-Travis (see Figs. 3.9a and
3.14b –g). The earlier two of these inter-
vals reﬂect a shift in lithic technology
from that which had prevailed earlier.
Bell-Andice-Calf Creek and Taylor are
thin, basically triangular bifaces with
long thinning ﬂakes emanating bifacially
from the base; Taylor bifaces remain un-
notched whereas Bell-Andice-Calf Creek
bifaces are characterized by deep, narrow
basal notches. All of these thin-bladed
forms would serve equally well as knives
or as tips of lances, spears, or darts. Im-
pact fractures common on the Bell-
Andice-Calf Creek forms attest to their
use as weapon tips.

Climate during the earliest interval
(Bell-Andice-Calf Creek) was somewhat
mesic. It was a time when bison were
hunted, leading L. Johnson and Goode
(1994) to surmise, correctly, I think
(M. Collins 1994a, 94), that these thin
bifaces were part of a specialized bison-
hunting weaponry, probably brought to
the region by peoples moving southwest-
erly from the prairie, prairie margins, and
woodlands west of the Ozarks (see Wyck-
off 1995). A tantalizing hint of function-
ally different sites is seen in this interval,
with a greater diversity of tool forms oc-
curring at the Landslide site than at the
Barton site’s Bell-Andice component.
Notable at Landslide are more wood- and
bone-working kinds of tools and espe-
cially milling equipment, which is absent
from the Barton site. It seems apparent
that more diverse tasks were undertaken
at Landslide than at Barton. Large burned
rock features—hearths as well as rock
ovens—are inferred for the interval, par-

ARCHEOLOGY IN CENTR AL TEXAS / 121

ticularly at the Barton site. In a very sub-
jective sense, components of this interval
seem to me to show less intensive use than
that indicated at earlier-interval compo-
nents, particularly those of the early split-
stem interval. Perhaps greater mobility as-
sociated with bison hunting is indicated.

By the later Middle Archaic Taylor and

Nolan-Travis intervals, bison have disap-
peared from the record and more xeric
climate conditions have returned. In fact,
this transition culminates toward the end
of the Nolan-Travis interval in what ap-
pears from the record to have been the
onset of the most xeric conditions ever
experienced by humans in central Texas.
Interestingly, Taylor and Nolan-Travis
components again have the appearance of
either long-term or intensive use, or both.
Burned rock middens debut (best seen at
the Wounded Eye site in Kerr County,
where Taylor bifaces dominate the assem-
blage recovered from a small burned rock
midden). Another technological shift is
seen in the production and morphology
of Nolan and Travis projectile points, as
they have comparatively thick and often
narrow blades (especially on Travis points)
with stems and shoulders; distinctive
beveling of the stems is characteristic of
Nolan points.

L. Johnson and Goode (1994, 26)
suggest, as Prewitt (n.d.) had earlier sug-
gested, that burned rock middens at this
time were more frequently being used to
cook xerophytes such as sotol, which may
have thrived in central Texas as conditions
became drier. This practice does not nec-
essarily signal an end to extraction of the
more typical oak-savanna ﬂoral and fau-
nal resources; it could be merely a shift in
emphasis with concomitant adjustments
in subsistence technology, strategic plan-
ning, and scheduling (see Bousman
1993).

The Late Archaic, ca. 4000 to 1300 or
1200 b.p., began as effective moisture was
at its lowest in central Texas, but gradu-
ally the climate became substantially
more mesic (see Fig. 3.9b). Six style inter-
vals have been postulated for the Late Ar-
chaic (see Fig. 3.9a). The Late Archaic is
well represented by investigated sites, in-
cluding a number with components in
good stratiﬁed contexts, although well-
stratiﬁed components are almost com-
pletely unreported for the earliest Bul-
verde style (see Figure 3.14h) interval.

Rockshelter); h, Ensor dart point (Wilson-Leonard site); i, corner-tanged knife (Wilson-Leonard
site); j, tubular stone pipe (Collins site).

Middle Archaic subsistence technology,
and the burned rock middens resulting
from a portion of it, continue well into
the Late Archaic. In fact, during the sec-
ond style interval (best known for its Ped-
ernales points), the growth of burned
rock middens was at its greatest, espe-
cially in the eastern parts of the area. It
appears, however, that xeric vegetation
and whatever reliance people placed upon
it gradually disappeared from those parts
of central Texas between 3500 and 2500
b.p., and burned rock midden growth

slowed but did not cease. The xeric vege-
tation remained, and continues to re-
main, in the western reaches of the area
where its exploitation involved the regu-
lar use of communal earth ovens into
Late Prehistoric times (Black et al. 1997;
Goode 1991).

Among distinctive material traits of
the Late Archaic in central Texas are di-
verse dart point styles (Fig. 3.15a–h and
Fig. 3.16a, b), “corner-tanged” knives
(see Fig. 3.15i), and cylindrical stone
pipes (see Fig. 3.15j). Marine shell orna-

L. Johnson and Goode (1994) have of-
fered a succinct account of the main cul-
tural aspects of the Late Archaic on the
eastern Edwards Plateau. In so doing,
they distinguished between early (Late
Archaic I) and late (Late Archaic II) sub-
periods. Their provocative ideas need not
be repeated here other than to mention
some highlights. Diverse and compara-
tively complex archeological manifesta-

tions toward the end of the Late Archaic
attest to the emergence of kinds of hu-
man conduct without precedent in the
area. Among factors that have been cited
as contributing to these developments are
increasing population size (Prewitt 1981;
Weir 1976) and stimuli from religious
practices in the eastern part of the conti-
nent (L. Johnson and Goode 1994). Much
remains to be learned about the hunter-
gatherers of central Texas in Late Archaic
times, and the questions prompted by the
interpretations of L. Johnson and Goode

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

(1994) will require thorough and com-
prehensive archeological investigations
using data of the highest possible integrity.

Late Prehistoric

Archeologists working in central Texas
have not been able to clearly interpret the
extent and importance of the material
cultural change that occurred in the re-
gion ca. 1200 b.p. This is the somewhat
arbitrary break commonly made between
the long Archaic period and its successor,
the Late Prehistoric. Previously this was
referred to as the “Neo-American Stage”
(D. Suhm et al. 1954, 20) in the expecta-
tion that all three deﬁning traits (pottery,
bow and arrow, and agriculture) would
eventually be recognized. It now appears
that generally for central Texas, only the
bow and arrow appeared initially, pot-
tery was added later, and agriculture (or,
at least, the possession of tropical culti-
gens) came last and was of quite minor
importance.

Because basic hunting and gathering
subsistence continued, what is here called
the Late Prehistoric has also been labeled
the “Neo-Archaic” (Prewitt 1981) or the
“Post-Archaic” (L. Johnson and Goode
1994). Two subperiods, early and late
(see Fig. 3.9), are here recognized in the
Late Prehistoric ( Jelks 1962); these corre-
spond to the Austin and Toyah “phases”
(I will continue to use the term “inter-
val”) of long-standing use in the system-
atics of the local prehistory (Prewitt
1981). More than projectile point style
change distinguishes Austin from Toyah
manifestations, and the subperiod level of
designation is intended to reﬂect the im-
portance of these differences. I agree with
L. Johnson and Goode (1994, 39 – 40)
when they note that an equally satisfac-
tory solution would be to place the break
between the Archaic and the Late Prehis-
toric at ca. 800 b.p., when Toyah replaces
Austin as the prevailing archeological
conﬁguration. This distinction is, how-
ever, not as easily made for other regions
of the state (see below).

The most apparent change seen at the
beginning of the early Late Prehistoric (or
Austin interval) is from a prevalence of
dart points to that of arrow points and,
inferentially, from use of the atlatl and
dart to that of the bow and arrow (see
Fig. 3.16c). Evidence is seen of wide-
spread hostilities in the form of what are

03-A2946  4/13/04  11:55 AM  Page 123

ARCHEOLOGY IN CENTR AL TEXAS / 123

thought to be numerous incidents of
arrow-wound fatalities (Prewitt 1974).
Otherwise, comparatively little change is
noted from terminal Late Archaic pat-
terns, particularly in subsistence behavior.
Recent scrutiny has found evidence that
in western central Texas burned rock
middens continued to be produced in
what may have been the cooking of sotol
(Black et al. 1997; Goode 1991).

The late subperiod of the Late Prehis-
toric is expressed as a single style interval,
designated on Fig. 3.9a by the Perdiz ar-
row point (see Fig. 3.16f, g). However, it
has long been recognized that in central
Texas the Toyah archeological manifesta-
tion consists of a constellation of material
culture traits (see Fig. 3.16e–j). Notable
among these traits are pottery (both local
and imported from the Caddoan area),
large thin bifaces, Perdiz arrow points,
and end scrapers and prismatic blades;
the stone tool assemblage is associated
with the hunting of bison as well as deer
and antelope.

The occurrence of these distinctive
traits on about the same time line across a
wide area of the state distinguishes the
Toyah as an archeological “horizon.” A
question that arises is whether such a
horizon is the spread of a people across
the landscape or the spread of ideas and
their adoption by different peoples. LeRoy
Johnson (1994) and Robert A. Ricklis
(1994b) have recently brought forth dif-
fering views on Toyah lifeways. In keep-
ing with traditional interpretations, John-
son sees Toyah materials as the artifacts of
particular folkways—the products of a
single ethnic group. Ricklis, in contrast,
observes that the cultural materials that
deﬁne Toyah represent tools and tech-
nologies that can be spread among differ-
ent groups rather easily—that is to say,
Toyah is a technocomplex. The issue
hinges on how similar lithic and ceramic
objects and their technologies of produc-
tion have to be to represent the work of a
single ethnic group. In the absence of lin-
guistic evidence (which is precluded by a
pre-contact truncation of Toyah culture)
or more robust archeological data, the is-
sue will not be resolved since the answer
to the question just posed is too subjec-
tive. No time in the prehistory of central
Texas is represented by more gisements,
and the prospects for discovering more
and better Toyah components are good.

The debate framed by Ricklis and John-
son is the kind of anthropological issue
that is so rare in the history of central
Texas archeology. Because it is both in-
triguing and substantive, such a debate
can be expected to continue, grow, and
be reﬁned, and perhaps in the future
even resolved to some degree with robust
new data.

Historic Period

Historic archeology differs from pre-
historic archeology in that past people,
places, and events can be investigated
from the vantages of written accounts as
well as tangible archeological records. In
the case of central Texas, the collision of
multiple indigenous and European cul-
tures produced complex and rapidly
changing events that are chronicled spot-
tily in the early documents and seen spar-
ingly in the archeological record. With
time, both the written and archeological
records become fuller, but by the middle
nineteenth century, little but the Euro-
pean-derived cultures remained.

I consider three subperiods in the
Historic period of central Texas— early,
middle, and late. In the ﬁrst two, vestiges
of both indigenous and European peoples
and cultures are represented; in the third,
the indigenous peoples have virtually
disappeared.

The early Historic subperiod in central

Texas begins in the late seventeenth cen-
tury with the ﬁrst documented arrival of
Europeans (Berlandier 1969; Bolton
1915; Newcomb 1961). Although there
are documentary glimpses of the indige-
nous groups in and near central Texas,
political consequences of the arrival of
Europeans were already in motion, most
notably the southern advance of mounted
Apaches. For the indigenous peoples,
little more than group names, locations,
and limited descriptions exist. Concerted
ethnohistorical research (see multiple en-
tries by T. N. Campbell under Indian
group names in Branda 1976; Campbell
1988; Hester 1989a, 1989b; Newcomb
1961, 1993) has been used to piece to-
gether important yet incomplete accounts
that reveal several distinctive features of
native cultures in central Texas between
ca. 1690 and 1720.

In these earliest historical accounts,
numerous displaced groups are found in
and near central Texas, some having gone

northeastward to escape Spanish oppres-
sion, others having ﬂed southeastward
ahead of the Apache incursion. Their life-
ways had been affected substantially by
the political accommodations to this new
propinquity and possibly by social dis-
ruption brought about by the mortality
of European-introduced diseases. The
French and the Spaniards vying for the
territory that is now Texas often manipu-
lated the indigenous groups for their own
political purposes. Also, native patterns of
mobility had been altered by the acquisi-
tion of horses. It is obvious that these ac-
counts do not provide direct analogs to
prehistoric patterns. Instead, they repre-
sent a time of drastic cultural change and
political conﬂict to be investigated in its
own right.

There may be some indigenous cul-
tural patterns that prevail through this
time and thus afford insights into prehis-
toric lifeways of the aboriginal inhabitants
of central Texas (M. Collins and Ricklis
1994). Small band-sized residential camps
are indicated, but so are large, diffuse en-
campments composed of peoples with
mixed ethnic afﬁliations. It is not clear
whether the large, diffuse camps or politi-
cal amalgamations occurred prehistori-
cally, but to judge from the apparent ease
and frequency of these occurrences his-
torically, it is possible that large camps
shared by different ethnic groups had
precedents in prehistory.

Hunting, particularly of bison but also
of deer and antelope, is repeatedly noted
in Spanish and French documents, as is
the extensive use and exchange of bison
products. Much of the mobility and
hunting behavior of peoples was in re-
sponse to the movements and densities
of bison populations. Though the histori-
cally observed behavior was affected by
the use of horses, the same was probably
true to some extent of pedestrian peoples
whenever bison were present in the area.
Of particular importance to Late Pre-
historic archeology are the many accounts
of Hasinai Caddo traveling into central
Texas to hunt bison and at times camping
with indigenous groups. The fairly com-
mon presence of Caddoan ceramics and
of local pottery with Caddoan style deco-
ration in Toyah interval sites of central
Texas (see discussion in Perttula et al.
1995b) suggests that this was a long-
standing pattern.

At a very general level, the early His-
toric subperiod informs prehistoric arche-
ological inquiry on two topics. First, in-
digenous peoples clearly were more
cosmopolitan than most archeologists
seem to think. Second, large and dis-
persed encampments, exceeding the usual
parameters of “a site,” may have been
fairly common.

The middle Historic subperiod, when
much of the record on aboriginal peoples
is in reference to remnants of native
groups living in the Spanish missions, be-
gan in about 1730 and ended in about
1800 as the mission system was failing
(Hester 1989a, 1989b). Central Texas lies
mostly outside of the Spanish Colonial
sphere, and the mission Indian subperiod
is manifest primarily at the missions in
Bexar County (Campbell and Campbell
1985). Interesting continuities from pre-
historic times and new behaviors resulting
from acculturation are reﬂected in the
material culture of the mission Indians
(D. Fox 1979).

Shoshonian-speaking Comanches,
who had become consummate equestri-
ans by 1800, began to spread into north-
western Texas from the High Plains to-
ward the end of the middle Historic
subperiod (Wallace and Hoebel 1952).
Their presence in central Texas is docu-
mented mostly from the hostile view of
Euro-American settlers.

The late Historic subperiod, extending

into the twentieth century, encompasses
minor numbers of mission Indians, far-
ﬂung nomadic native groups (primarily
the Comanches) until the late nineteenth
century, and a rich archeological record of
the European-derived cultural presence
(D. Fox 1983). As the Comanche pres-
ence in central Texas waned in the mid-
to late nineteenth century, more than
eleven millennia of Native American
presence in the area came to an end.

Conclusions and Comments
on Future Research

Central Texas was occupied by Native

American hunter-gatherers more or less
continuously for longer than eleven thou-
sand years. During that time the net
change in population was from zero to a
pre-contact ﬁgure that may have been as
high as 150,000 (based on a very approxi-
mate hemisphere-wide estimate of 2.1 per-

124 / PR AIRIES AND PLAINS

sons per square kilometer [Dobyns
1966]). Whatever the actual ending ﬁg-
ure, and however nonlinear the rate of in-
crease, it is an absolute certainty that over
time more and more people lived in and
around central Texas. Without doubt,
population growth increasingly con-
strained subsistence and mobility options
and may have fostered political conﬂict,
but it also led to a cosmopolitan condition
where more knowledge, commodities,
words, and mates could be exchanged.

Exchange in each of these domains of
culture is likely to have comparatively low
archeological visibility except when non-
perishable commodities are exchanged or
knowledge is transmitted that is reﬂected
in durable items of material culture. The
more exchange occurs, no matter its
form, the more likely it is to have archeo-
logical visibility.

In the course of central Texas prehis-
tory, archeological evidence for the ex-
change of ideas and exotic commodities
becomes more visible in the later part of
the Late Archaic and reaches its greatest
expression in the Toyah interval (assum-
ing that exotic lithics in Paleoindian times
more often represent high mobility).
When Late Archaic sites in central Texas
contain exotic obsidian and marine shells,
and when there are interments inﬂuenced
by Hopewellian burial ceremonialism,
the indigenous population is not living in
isolation. Unseen behind these tangibles
are undoubtedly culture brokers, travel-
ers, multilingual interpreters, and diplo-
mats—the prehistoric counterparts of the
likes of Juan Sabeata, Sacagewea, and the
Turk. To have reached sufﬁcient levels for
archeological expression in the Late Ar-
chaic, when did distant connections ﬁrst
develop? I doubt the natives of central
Texas were ever isolated—a key element
in my views of the local prehistory that
follows.

Horticulture or agriculture had come

to be practiced in all directions (Meso-
america, the Southwest, Southeast, and
Plains) during what in central Texas was
still the Late Archaic. Early European
settlers found central Texas optimal for
farming (Fehrenbach 1968), and much of
it is farmland today. A shift to horticulture
or agriculture by natives of the region was
not precluded by natural conditions of
soil or climate. Nor was it precluded out
of ignorance on the part of its inhabitants.

These conclusions argue for the alterna-
tive interpretation that efﬁcient technolo-
gies for hunting and gathering prevailed
and that the resource base was both rich
and diverse. Central Texas was one of
those places in the world where the labors
and limitations of food production could
be looked upon with disdain. What then
are the ingredients of that technology and
the characteristics of that resource base?
The axiom that specialization is the path
to extinction seems to be borne out by its
corollary, namely eleven thousand years
of successful, generalized exploitation of a
diverse resource base in central Texas.
The adaptability of hunter-gatherer sub-
sistence in central Texas is underscored by
the swings in climate (see Fig. 3.9b) from
relatively mesic (ca. 11,500 to 8800 or
8500 b.p.) to xeric (ca. 8800 or 8500 to
3000 or 2800 b.p.) with a brief ameliora-
tion (ca. 6800 to 5500 b.p.), and back to
mesic again (ca. 2800 to 1000 b.p.),
which was followed by a brief drying in-
terval near 1000 b.p. Since ca. 1000 b.p.,
the climate seems to have been rather
moderate compared with the more mesic
and more xeric periods of earlier times.
From the earliest arrival of peoples
into the area, which present evidence
places near the middle of the twelfth mil-
lennium b.p., until ca. 8800 b.p., condi-
tions were relatively mesic, and the arche-
ological record reﬂects hunter-gatherers
of moderately high mobility. Camp sites
of these Paleoindians usually have simple
ﬁreplaces with little or no use of rock.
During Folsom times, there may have
been a substantial reliance on bison hunt-
ing, but otherwise Paleoindian subsis-
tence seems to have been rather general-
ized. A small human population and
reasonably abundant plant and animal re-
sources would seem to best account for
the evidence.

Beginning around eighty-eight hun-
dred years ago, large ﬁreplaces with quan-
tities of burned rocks appear and signal
important changes in adaptations, usher-
ing in what we refer to as the Archaic
(Black et al. 1997). It is in the Archaic
that we see the development and perse-
verance of archeological patterns dis-
tinctive to central Texas; a conspicuous
element in that distinctiveness is the ex-
tensive use of rock in a variety of ﬁre-
places. It is apparent that these rocks were
used primarily for their heat-storage ca-

pacity in most cases, and this practice is
central to the long history of Archaic
adaptations (Black et al. 1997).

There is a clear correlation between
mesic climatic indicators and the archeo-
logical occurrence of bison remains.
There is less clear but suggestive evidence
that burned rock features (middens and
complexes of earth ovens) grew at faster
rates in the more xeric intervals. In gen-
eral, large hot-rock cooking appliances
are needed for plant foods requiring long
periods of cooking, whether baking or
steaming. The labor and fuel required for
efforts of this kind are efﬁcient only if a
large volume of food is cooked. It follows
that the existence of the large hot-rock
cooking appliances is prima facie evidence
of bulk processing of starchy plants, be
they sotol bulbs, prairie turnip roots, cat-
tail roots, acorns, or wild onion bulbs.
But it is important to consider that once
the effort is made to construct and fuel a
hot-rock cooking appliance, it can be
used to cook almost any kind of food—
plant or animal—wherein lies the adapt-
ability of these facilities.

As the abundance of various plant
foods changes seasonally or in response to
longer-term climatic shifts, rock ovens
can be used to bake or steam, as appro-
priate, the most available bulk staple aug-
mented with anything from river mussels
or turtle meat to hawthorn or persimmon
fruits. It would appear, in this vein, that
at those (mesic) times when bison were
more abundant, somewhat less reliance
was placed on the bulk processing of
plant foods. One of those times was when
Calf Creek, Bell, and Andice bifaces were
in vogue, and another was when Marcos,
Montell, and Castroville points were
common. L. Johnson and Goode (1994)
offer the suggestion that makers of Calf
Creek and related point forms migrated
into the region as bison ranges spread.
Relatively little use of hot-rock appliances
is seen during the Bell-Andice-Calf Creek
style interval, and possibly even during
the interval identiﬁed by Marcos, Mon-
tell, and Castroville forms, but this use is
far less evident.

Central Texas environments are and
have been far from uniform, and the fore-
going generalizations will not apply
equally over the region, and not at all in
some places. Certainly such potentially
important resources as desert succulents,

bison, acorns, and riverine plants and ani-
mals have varied greatly in number over
time, and archeological understanding of
their importance will emerge locally, not
regionally.

During the late (Toyah) interval of the
Late Prehistoric, when bison hunting and
mobility were evidently at their highest
levels since Folsom times, the ancient
practice of using large hot-rock appli-
ances came to an end. Once again, as in
the Bell-Andice-Calf Creek interval, there
is good evidence that the Toyah interval is
the archeological expression of bison
hunters who migrated into the area and
neither depended very much on other lo-
cal resources nor adopted the technology
for their exploitation.

Such are a few general interpretations
of the prehistory of central Texas. Should
any of these be found worthy, they could
guide future archeological investigations
in a general sense, but as framed they are
too general to be tested directly. Instead,
archeological effort in the area needs to
be directed toward more basic tasks that
include accumulating speciﬁc evidence
relevant to these generalizations.

First, a very small percentage of the
archeological data base of central Texas
derives from well-stratiﬁed contexts. To
correct this deﬁciency, gisements need to
be targeted as widely in space and as fully
along the temporal vector as possible. Ar-
tifact assemblages and paleoenvironmen-
tal data of high resolution derived from
such contexts can provide the evidence
needed to address most of our currently
recognized archeological issues.

As assemblages with greater integrity
and higher data quality are investigated,
more comprehensive data recovery and
analytical techniques must be applied.
First, the basics of archeological evidence
must be better met, and second, the per-
spective of comparative ethnology should
be used to structure inquiry.

The basics of archeological inquiry are

relatively simple: obtaining well-docu-
mented, representative samples of archeo-
logical assemblages and controlling for
the relative and absolute dating of those
assemblages. An initial effort at this task
has been made in central Texas.

I suggest that a comparative-ethnologi-

cal perspective is needed because in cen-
tral Texas we have learned relatively little
about the human lifeways that came and

went in the region for nearly twelve thou-
sand years. We need to have an organiza-
tional framework for our investigations
that deﬁnes objectives and directs effort
toward those objectives in the greatest
need of attention. An obvious framework
is comparative ethnology. The elements
of culture that ethnologists compare can-
not all be known from extinct cultural
systems, but a subset of those that realisti-
cally can be at least partially recon-
structed out of archeological evidence is
useful. A matrix table with cultural traits
across the top and our archeological in-
tervals arrayed up the left side would con-
stantly remind us of our major data gaps.
Within each cell of the matrix is a re-
search objective that must be carefully
considered in terms of what archeological
evidence is needed and how that evidence
would best be obtained. Traits from the
general (e.g., subsistence, settlement pat-
tern, or transhumance) to the speciﬁc
(e.g., burial practices, ornaments, and
woodworking tools) need to be included.
Obviously, the evidence required to sat-
isfy any speciﬁc objective will not be
found just because it is listed in the ma-
trix. What is important is that research
will proceed with that objective in mind,
the essential evidence needed to satisfy
the objective will have been thought out,
and in the long run our efforts will be
more productive by being allocated more
appropriately.

A signiﬁcant element in our lack of
progress to date is redundancy. We keep
digging up the same kinds of evidence us-
ing the same techniques. Targeting other
aspects of the archeological record and
using a greater array of procedures are
priorities. Another impediment is how
we conceive evidence. We see deer bones
and dart points and infer that game was
taken with weaponry that employed darts.
We rarely consider alternative or comple-
mentary paraphernalia or strategies, such
as the use of nets, snares, or dogs. We sel-
dom ask, much less try to answer, ques-
tions like, “What was made using those
tools we infer to be adzes or gouges?
Were people making canoes, shelter,
wooden mortars? If so, what were they
doing with them?”

Explicitly deﬁned research objectives
on the macro-, meso-, and microscales
of investigation are starting points. Fuller
use needs to be made of the more so-

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

03-A2946  4/13/04  11:55 AM  Page 126

phisticated techniques of dating and
archeometry—techniques that usually
are not warranted unless applied to data
from superior contexts. These suggestions
carry a price. The costs of doing archeol-
ogy, even mediocre archeology, continue
to rise, and unless substantive new infor-
mation is gained on nearly every attempt,
those costs are not justiﬁed. Only by
eliminating redundant efforts and target-
ing quality data with explicit research ob-
jectives and well-conceived plans for data
recovery and analysis can we expect to
make those substantive contributions.
Because archeologists working in central
Texas have begun to evaluate site data for
their integrity, to move beyond the single-
minded pursuit of chronology building,
to give thought to data and analytical re-
quirements for other research objectives,
and to recognize important kinds of evi-
dence previously ignored, conditions are
right for making real progress in under-
standing the local prehistory.

The Prehistory of South Texas

Thomas R. Hester

The southern Texas archeological area
(Fig. 4.1) has been the subject of synthe-
sis in a book-length treatment by Hester
(1980b; see also Hester 1995), an
overview of the western Gulf Coast Plain
(Story 1985), two papers that dealt with
the interior and coastal portions of this
region (Black 1989a, 1989b), and a re-
gional synthesis written in the context of
the Loma Sandia (41LK28) analysis
(Black 1995b). This chapter focuses on
the interior of the south Texas region,
usually referred to as the Rio Grande
Plain, the Nueces Plain, or the South
Texas Plains. The northern boundary can
be placed at the Balcones Escarpment, the
western edge set artiﬁcially at the Rio
Grande, the northeastern boundary
would be the Guadalupe–San Antonio
Rivers drainage system, the eastern
boundary would be the juncture with the
Coastal Bend, some ﬁfty to sixty-ﬁve
kilometers inland from the modern Gulf
of Mexico shoreline, and the southern
boundary would be at the mouth of the
Rio Grande. Stephen L. Black (1989a,
ﬁg. 19) noted ﬁve “biogeographical areas”
in the region: the Rio Grande Plain, the
Rio Grande Delta, the Nueces-
Guadalupe Plain, the Sand Sheet, and the
Coastal Bend. As noted above, I will not
deal with the Coastal Bend region in this
synthesis (see Ricklis, chapter 5, this vol-
ume). Another suggested set of subdivi-
sions for this region was proposed in the
ﬁrst South Texas Archeological Palaver in

1988. The “South Texas Planning Re-
gion” was divided into the Middle Nue-
ces Zone, the Brasada (McGraw et al.
1987), the Sand Sheet, and the Rio Bravo
corridor, which encompasses the archeol-
ogy of both sides of the Rio Grande. This
particular conﬁguration did not include
the Rio Grande delta, leaving it as part of
the coastal strip extending up the coast
from Brownsville.

The earlier syntheses have summarized
various facets of the ecology of the south
Texas region (see also Jurgens 1980).
Hester (1981) has noted the variation in
plant and water resources across the re-
gion, distinguishing between high-density
(resource) areas and those of low density.
These areas manifest different archeologi-
cal records.

The difﬁculty in describing, in any de-
tail, the hydrology, vegetation, and fauna
of the region results from wholesale
modiﬁcation of the south Texas environ-
ment during the Historic period. Hester
(1980b) has outlined these, as has Grant
D. Hall (1985; see also G. Hall et al.
1982, 1986). The principal changes can
be brieﬂy summarized here. First, the
mesquite and other thorny shrubs that
dominate the brush country today spread
(or at least increased in density) within
Historic times (e.g., Doughty 1983,
122 –23; C. Fisher 1977, 183). However,
mesquite was clearly present in riverine
zones as early as 6000 b.p. This statement
is based on wood species identiﬁcation of

127

hearth charcoal done by Richard G. Hol-
loway (1986); Christopher J. Jurgens
(1980) suggests that the typical riverine
environmental pattern in that area today
was in place by 300 b.c. There is consid-
erable debate in the literature over the ex-
tent of mesquite on the Rio Grande
Plain, based on early Historic accounts.
Some report vast grasslands, while others
note that mesquite was rather widely dis-
tributed (e.g., Inglis 1964; Lehmann
1984; Weniger 1984). Various factors
contributed to the spread of mesquite, es-
pecially overgrazing and the lowering of
the water table. The latter was aggravated
with twentieth-century deep well irriga-
tion. The irrigation pumps dried up
springs that had fed perennial streams,
perhaps for millennia. A county park
with abandoned bathhouses sits, like an-
cient ruins, adjacent to a 1920s swim-
ming hole, on formerly spring-fed Car-
rizo Creek in Dimmit County (Brune
1981, 165 – 66).

The animal population has also been
signiﬁcantly altered. Gone are the bison,
pronghorn, bear, wolf, and jaguar that
were present in southern Texas up to
the beginning of the twentieth century
(Doughty 1983, 54, 76). In contrast, ad-
ditions to the species list for the area in-
clude armadillo (in the nineteenth cen-
tury) and javelina; the latter apparently
ﬁrst appeared ca. a.d. 1400 (e.g., at site
41MC222; see G. Hall et al. 1986, 215)
but began to ﬂourish in the eighteenth

century, based on faunal records from
Spanish Colonial missions (e.g., David-
son and Valdez 1976). Except for Late
Prehistoric sites, faunal preservation is of-
ten poor in south Texas. A faunal study of
three Choke Canyon sites by D. Gentry
Steele and Christi Hunter (1986) looks at
diet, hunting patterns, and environmen-
tal reconstruction, topics not easily dealt
with in most faunal assemblages else-
where in the region.

One aspect of long-term environmen-

tal change on the Rio Grande Plain has
been the movement of stream channels

through time. Rivers like the Nueces and
the Frio, and their major tributaries, have
often cut widely across their valleys, creat-
ing a dendritic pattern. Some channels
can be traced and roughly dated by arche-
ological remains on their banks (e.g., at
Chaparrosa Ranch; see Hester 1978a).
In the Choke Canyon Project, Bunker
(1982) studied in detail the movements
of the Frio River, and in their unpub-
lished manuscript on the East Chacon
Project (Zavala and Uvalde Counties),
A. Joachim McGraw and Dennis A.
Knepper (1983) have proposed shifts in

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

the Nueces River channel, as well as in its
tributaries in their study area, since Late
Pleistocene times.

South Texas archeology is beginning

to beneﬁt from geomorphological re-
search, especially in the terraces along the
Rio Grande (M. Collins 1991c) and in
the Rio Grande Delta (M. Collins et al.
1989a). Other studies were also carried
out at Choke Canyon (Bunker 1982)
and Loma Sandia (Holliday 1995b), but
much remains to be done across the
region.

Evidence of climatic change in the re-
gion is also hard to obtain. R. L. Robin-
son (1982) used phytolith data from
Choke Canyon Reservoir to offer a pat-
tern of short- versus tall-grass occurrence
through time, perhaps reﬂecting alternat-
ing wet and dry episodes. While tree-ring
coring has helped to give drought histo-
ries for part of Texas since 1698 (Stahle
and Cleaveland 1988), this procedure has
had only preliminary application in south
Texas (Gunn 1985).

The history of archeology in southern
Texas has been reviewed in detail by Mal-
louf et al. (1977) and most recently by
Black (1989a, 40 – 44). In essence, little
work was done in the region prior to the
late 1960s. Since that time, a number of
important sites have been excavated (see,
e.g., Black 1986; Highley 1986; Mont-
gomery 1978); a major reservoir study
was carried out at Choke Canyon (Live
Oak and McMullen Counties), providing
twelve volumes on the prehistory, history,
and ethnohistory of that area; a number
of cultural resource management surveys
(and occasionally, test excavations) have
been done (including a large-scale survey
of the proposed Cuero I reservoir; see
D. Fox et al. 1974); and site reports and
artifact distributional studies have been
reported in the pages of La Tierra, the
quarterly journal of the Southern Texas
Archaeological Association. A series of
major surveys, archival studies, and ex-
cavations have also taken place along the
Medina River in southern Bexar County
at the locus of the proposed Applewhite
Reservoir (McGraw and Hindes 1987;
Thoms 1992). This study area is on the
northern periphery of southern Texas, as
were the excavations at 41ME34 to the
west (Hester 1990a). However, both have
chronological data that help to build on

PREHISTORY OF SOUTH TEXAS / 129

the cultural-historical framework of
southern Texas.

The native peoples of southern Texas

are traditionally called Coahuiltecans
(Newcomb 1961). However, they in-
cluded Coahuilteco speakers (L. Johnson
and Campbell 1992) and groups that
spoke perhaps six other languages (God-
dard 1979) and a language known as
Sanan, reported by LeRoy Johnson and
T. N. Campbell (1992). The south Texas
hunting and gathering lifeways are hard
to reconstruct from Spanish documents.
The descriptions by Newcomb (1961)
provide a general view of their existence,
but for more details, the studies by
Campbell, gathered in a volume in 1988,
are highly recommended. The Indians of
the Rio Grande delta have been studied
by Martin Salinas (1990), and McGraw
et al. (1991) shed new light on a number
of south Texas groups encountered by the
Spanish along the Camino Real and re-
lated early trails. The native peoples be-
came culturally extinct in the eighteenth
century (Hester 1989a) as a result of
Spanish-introduced diseases, raiding by
Apaches and Comanches, the Spanish
missionization process, and their accul-
turation as farmers. After the missions
were secularized in 1794, many of these
missionized Indians lost their lands to
“avaricious townspeople,” as was the case
at San Antonio de Valero (Almaráz 1989,
38 –39; de la Teja 1995).

The Nature of the South Texas
Archeological Record

Evidence of human occupation in
southern Texas is extremely abundant yet
has proven quite challenging in terms of
dating and interpretation. Open occupa-
tion sites dominate the site types, and they
are usually found to be heavily eroded,
with abundant surface debris such as chert
ﬂakes, land snails, mussel shells, scattered
hearthstones, and eroding hearths. Black
(1989a, 46 – 48) provides a detailed dis-
cussion of south Texas site types and
features within sites (e.g., lithic caches,
hearths, pits, bone clusters, and activity
areas).

These sites have been a boon for arti-
fact collectors, since large numbers of pro-
jectile points are deﬂated onto a common
surface. It is not uncommon for south

Texas projectile point collections to range
into the many thousands of specimens.
Thus, arrowhead collecting is a popular
pastime, as this author found at the tender
age of seven. Today, much of the ranch-
land in south Texas is leased for hunting,
and arrowhead collecting is often featured
in urban sports pages as an activity to
while away the time during deer-hunting
outings. This practice results in large
numbers of projectile points being indis-
criminately collected and “exported” by
hunters to Houston, San Antonio, and
beyond. Of course, local collectors have
been active for decades; Harry J. Shafer
and Edward P. Baxter (1975) point to the
absence of points at surface localities in a
McMullen County study area (see also
D. Robinson et al. 1992).

The south Texas open camp sites are
very difﬁcult to excavate. Unlike central
Texas camp sites where cultural debris is
often concentrated in a small area and
where a few test pits can provide chrono-
logical information, the typical streamside
south Texas open site is really an “occu-
pation zone” (Hester 1981)—long, nar-
row strips of occupation. Excavations will
detect components of different age in
horizontally separated parts of the site,
seldom overlapping to any great extent.
The task of excavating these kinds of sites
was evident at Choke Canyon, where
small test pits yielded little and our
strategy of open, block excavations
(Figs. 4.2 and 4.3) improved both recov-
ery and studies of horizontal patterning
(supplemented by machine stripping; see
K. Brown et al. 1982), but they produced
far fewer data than we had expected
(Hester 1986b). The same is true for sites
on Chaparrosa Ranch, where block exca-
vations again failed to yield little beyond
scattered hearths and occasional diagnos-
tics (Hester 1978b; Montgomery 1978).
This is not to say that such occupation
zones are insigniﬁcant and not worthy of
excavation. Rather, we have to think in
terms of larger blocks and the use of
backhoes and geomorphological input for
planning excavation placement. By con-
trast, Late Prehistoric sites in southern
Texas are often dense concentrations of
features, faunal remains, and artifacts,
and they have been productively studied
through the use of block excavations
(Black 1986; Highley 1986).

Another common type of site is related

to lithic procurement. On the high ter-
races of the Nueces-Frio drainage sys-
tems, Uvalde gravels are extensively ex-
posed. Here, one ﬁnds loci of tested
cobbles, debitage, and bifaces abandoned
during reduction (Hester 1975a). In the
Duval County area, C. K. Chandler and
L. Lopez (1992) report an outcrop of
quartz arenite (Goliad formation) used by
Archaic knappers. Along the Rio Grande
in the Laredo region, James Warren
(1989) has reported “lithic reduction
sites” in the uplands, along with larger
“lithic procurement/quarry sites” that
cover up to ﬁfteen hundred acres (see also
K. Miller 1995). Near the Rio Grande,
multicolored Rio Grande gravels are re-
duced. Such sites in south Texas have not
been adequately studied; indeed, some-
times they are not even given site num-
bers due to their broad horizontal extent
(see Warren 1989). I would argue, how-
ever, that much more could be done with
them, especially in terms of deﬁning local
lithic reduction sequences (Hester 1975a;
Kotter 1980). They should not be ig-
nored or dismissed as unimportant by
cultural resource management surveys.

Temporary camp sites are often found

in the uplands or along high terraces.
Characterized by a few hearths or scattered
burned rock, ﬂakes, and an occasional
diagnostic, they are clearly an important
part of regional settlement patterns, albeit
of speculative function at this time. War-
ren (1989) also notes “intermediate camp-
sites,” which, based on his deﬁnition,
appear to represent similar short-term
activities.

Deeply stratiﬁed open camp sites do
occur in southern Texas. Excavations at
41LK31/32 at Choke Canyon (R. Scott
1982) provide one example (Fig. 4.4).
While little could be contributed to re-
gional culture history at this site, it did
yield abundant data on intrasite activities
(i.e., a chert-reduction area and concen-
trations of mussel and ﬁsh remains) and
large, well-preserved hearths with abun-
dant charcoal for both dating and wood
species identiﬁcation. Such stratiﬁed sites
also occur in the middle Guadalupe River
drainage, including Johnston-Heller (Bir-
mingham and Hester 1976), Willeke
(41VT17), and Berger Bluff (41GD30, on
Coleto Creek). To date, only Berger Bluff

has been partially excavated (D. Brown
1983; K. Brown 1987, 1996). I have also
seen stratiﬁed sites at the mouths of ma-
jor creeks emptying into the Rio Grande
in Webb County; no excavations have
been done at these sites.

Cemetery sites are present in southern

Texas and are rather common in the
Coastal Bend. The Loma Sandia site
(41LK28 [A. Taylor and Highley 1995])
is the best known, having yielded a large
number of burials with associated mortu-
ary caches. Loma Sandia once appeared
to be anomalous, with its concentration of
burials and numerous grave goods. Now,
we know of two or more such cemeteries
in the Falcon Reservoir area of south
Texas and adjacent northeastern Mexico,
again with many burials and grave goods
paralleling those of Loma Sandia. Un-
fortunately, lack of enforcement of an-
tiquities laws and treaties have left these
Falcon Reservoir sites at the mercies of
collectors and looters, and only a couple
of devoted avocational archeologists have
made the effort to document and scien-
tiﬁcally record these burials. This ﬁasco at
Falcon Reservoir, during low-water epi-
sodes in the 1980s and 1990s, is evidence
of the failure of the International Bound-
ary and Water Commission to live up to
its responsibility to protect archeological
sites (although one minor survey was
done by O’Neill et al. [1992]) on both
sides of this reservoir. None of these
kinds of sites were detected by the limited
Falcon Reservoir salvage efforts in the
early 1950s (e.g., Cason 1952), and de-
spite state and federal laws and interna-
tional treaties, motorboat looters have
largely erased a critical archeological
record.

Other burial sites have been docu-
mented in recent years. These include the
Haiduk burial (Mitchell et al. 1984),
with Late Archaic diagnostics at a site in
Karnes County; several disturbed burials
at the Shrew site (Labadie 1988); a burial
in Lavaca County (Hester 1994a) with
an associated Gahagan biface, reﬂecting
trade with others in east or southeastern
Texas; and a Late Prehistoric burial in
Frio County (Hester et al. 1993b) with
an associated Scallorn arrow point. One
burial salvaged by James B. Boyd at Fal-
con Reservoir had a Caracara point (Boyd
et al. 1997b; R. Saunders and Hester
1993; E. Turner and Hester 1993) deeply

embedded in a vertebra; other burials in
that area have also yielded Caracara points
as mortuary inclusions. Boyd and Hester
are awaiting radiocarbon dates to help
place this point type, and these burials, in
the appropriate temporal niche within the
Late Prehistoric. Stable isotope studies,
designed to reveal dietary information,
have also been undertaken by Jeffery
Huebner.

Sites with rock art are extremely rare
in southern Texas. Overhangs with picto-
graphs (Fig. 4.5) are known from Webb
County (e.g., Hester 1986c), and Boyd
has photodocumented several pictograph
sites on the Mexican side of the Rio
Grande in the Falcon Reservoir area. A
major petroglyph site known as the Fron-
tón de Piedras Pintas (Osorio Morales
1983) lies about ﬁfty kilometers from the
border near Paras, Nuevo León; it has
been visited in recent years by Rose Tre-
viño (from Laredo), who has extensive
photographic records from the site. Other
pictograph sites are known to occur in
overhangs or on bluffs along the Nueces
River between Uvalde and La Pryor (e.g.,
the Bee Bluff pictograph and petroglyph
site reported by Ray Smith [1987], per-
sonal communication; records on ﬁle at
TARL). A petroglyph site is also reported
by Smith east of Uvalde, just south of the
Balcones Escarpment.

At several sites, painted pebbles have
been found. These pebbles and rock art
are thought of as typical of Lower Pecos
rockshelters (Shafer 1986). However, a
number have now been documented at
sites on the coastal plain in southern
Uvalde and northern Zavala Counties
(Fig. 4.6; Hester 1977a; Ray Smith 1987,
personal communication; records on ﬁle
at TARL). The dates of the rock art sites
and the painted pebbles are unknown.

As the south Texas archeological record

vanishes, from natural erosion, reservoir
projects, urban expansion, relic collect-
ing, and hobbyist activities, there is a spe-
cial need to document collections as thor-
oughly as possible. The members of the
Southern Texas Archaeological Associa-
tion, especially C. K. Chandler, Wil-
liam W. Birmingham, E. H. Schmiedlin,
Jimmy L. Mitchell, and others (who have
documented, for example, the Bromley
Cooper collection in a series of papers)
are to be commended for their efforts.
Others, like James B. Boyd, are recording

04-A2946  4/14/04  12:22 PM  Page 133

PREHISTORY OF SOUTH TEXAS / 133

and documenting sites and artifacts with
great precision and are openly sharing
these data with professional archeologists.
This effort needs to be greatly intensiﬁed.
Unfortunately, there is the erroneous be-
lief among many collectors in the region
that professionals can “conﬁscate” their
collections; this belief is patently untrue,
but it can restrict documentation tasks.
Landowners such as Radcliffe Killam of
Laredo have made collections available for
documentation (Bettis 1997), while some
families have donated major collections
for long-term curation and research (e.g.,
at TARL, the Bromley Cooper and Dr.
Pat Riley collections). This type of dona-
tion is to be especially encouraged.

Cultural-Historical Framework

The characteristics of the south Texas
archeological record, and the comparative
lack of intensive excavations, all contrib-
ute to a chronology that remains poorly
known. L. Johnson and Goode (1994)
have offered a revised chronology for the
central part of Texas, derived from more
than seventy years of excavations and re-
cent major research efforts that have
yielded better stratigraphic and radio-
carbon ages. Unfortunately, we cannot
provide the sort of ﬁne-tuned chronology
for southern Texas that has been produced
for central Texas. What can be offered at
present is a general framework for the
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric,
and Protohistoric periods. Our knowl-
edge of the culture history is improving,
both through ﬁeld and laboratory re-
search and by cross-dating artifact types
with other areas, and speciﬁc examples
are given here. However, we still have to
rely on the basic chronological divisions
provided by G. Hall et al. (1986) and by
Black (1989a).

Paleoindian

It has long been known that ﬂuted
points of the Clovis and Folsom types oc-
cur in south Texas (Hester 1968, 1977b).
The presence of Clovis points (Fig. 4.7)
suggests that the earliest occupation be-
gan around 11,200 years ago.

In the case of both of these types, in-

tensiﬁed collection documentation in
south Texas has provided much addi-
tional information on their distribution
and their variability in morphology and

raw material. For example, large Clovis
specimens made of translucent brown
Edwards Plateau chert (see Fig. 4.7a) have
been found at sites in Wilson and Dim-
mit Counties (Kelly 1988). Another from
Atascosa County provides insight into
manufacturing techniques (see Fig. 4.7b,
b!; Hester et al. 1993a). One Clovis base
was found at a locality on Southern Island
on the Mexican side of Falcon Reservoir;
reportedly, up to twenty-two other Paleo-
indian points were collected from that site
(notes on ﬁle with the author, TARL).

No mammoth kill or butchering sites
attributable to Clovis peoples have been
found in south Texas, although the Late
Pleistocene fauna and possibly associated
lithics in the deposits of the Berclair Ter-

race in Goliad and Bee Counties remain
an enigma (Sellards 1940). Mammoth re-
mains are commonly found as secondary
deposits along south Texas creeks (T. C.
Hill, Jr., 1971, personal communication;
Kay Hindes 1995, personal communica-
tion), as well as in the paleochannel of
the Palo Blanco River of Kenedy County
(R. Suhm 1980). Kenneth M. Brown
(1990) reports the geomorphological
context of elephant remains buried in
gully ﬁll at the interface of the south
Texas–Edwards Plateau regions north of
the San Antonio airport. However, no ar-
tifacts were found in association with the
elephant remains.

Folsom artifacts are also widely re-

ported across the Rio Grande Plain

(Fig. 4.8; Chandler and Kumpe 1994a;
see also Largent and Waters 1990, al-
though the distribution map therein is
not a wholly accurate representation of
the geographical or numerical distribu-
tion of Folsom materials in the area). Nu-
merous brief papers have appeared in La
Tierra documenting specimens from the
region encompassing the drainage of the
Rio Grande (Chandler and Kumpe
1994b; Cole Moore 1995, personal com-
munication; notes on ﬁle at TARL) and
east and south on the coastal plains (e.g.,
Chandler and Lopez 1992). Folsom point

preforms or failures have been found in
collections in Webb County (Bettis 1997;
see Fig. 4.8c, d) and near Falcon Lake
( James B. Boyd 1995, personal com-
munication; notes on ﬁle at TARL; see
Fig. 4.8e, f ). Aside from localities with
two or three Folsom points (Hester 1968),
no Folsom camp or kill sites have been
located. The nearest, on the edge of the
Balcones Escarpment in Bexar County, is
Pavo Real (41BX52; see Henderson and
Goode 1991); Clovis materials are also re-
ported from this site.

Certainly the most intriguing Paleo-

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

indian site to have been excavated in the
region is Berger Bluff (41GD30) in Go-
liad County (K. Brown 1987, 1996).
Buried more than eight meters below the
surface along Coleto Creek (and now in-
undated by Coleto Creek Reservoir), ex-
cavations on a ledge or bench deposit un-
covered a hearth, an in situ chipping area,
cores, two small pits, and an unﬁnished
(or rejected) triangular biface; there were
no projectile point diagnostics. Eight ra-
diocarbon dates were obtained, averaging
around 9500 b.p., although both earlier
and later dates were obtained. Associated
with the cultural material was a consider-
able bone deposit of small mammals, rep-
tiles, and amphibians. Detailed research
by Kenneth Brown (1996) indicates that
these animals were collected and eaten by
human foragers, perhaps by what Brown
suggests was a task group of women and
children. The Berger Bluff fauna, as well
as tiny snails obtained by water screening,
is fully Holocene in character but con-
tained some species that are no longer
present in the area today. Three species
of snails, now extirpated in the Coleto
Creek/southern Texas area, are more typi-
cal of colder waters or of marshes more
typical of the eastern United States.

Later Paleoindian patterns in southern
Texas are represented by large numbers of
projectile points (see Fig. 4.9; Hester
1977b, 1987; Weir 1956). However, ty-
pological problems abound in distin-
guishing between Plainview (ca. 10,000
b.p.) and Golondrina (ca. 9000 b.p. [Hes-
ter 1983]). Clearly, there are points that
would ﬁt within the range of Southern
Plains Plainview points, and many of
the Golondrina forms are quite distinct
(Fig. 4.9d, e, but see Fig. 4.10, a cache of
Golondrina points from southern Uvalde
County, reﬂective of variation within the
type, ranging from the ﬁnished form to
heavily resharpened [Hester 1994c, 41]).
Thomas C. Kelly (1982), using speci-
mens from south Texas, provided a sta-
tistical approach to distinguishing be-
tween the two types. In addition, there
are many parallel-sided points that have
been called Plainview (see Fig. 4.9a, b)
but are usually smaller and more narrow
than those from the type site and related
localities. For example, at St. Mary’s Hall
in Bexar County, excavations in 1977 re-
vealed a discrete camp site and chipping
locality with distinctive points. While
these points have been called Plainview in

several papers (e.g., Hester 1990b), I am
now convinced that they are not of this
type. My reassessment is based on strati-
graphically recovered points from the
Wilson-Leonard site in Williamson
County, where similar points appear to
date after Golondrina (see Bousman et al.,
chapter 2, this volume). Anne Kerr (1995,
personal communication) calls these
St. Mary’s Hall points. A better picture
of the relationships among several central
and south Texas Late Paleoindian types
may be possible now that the Wilson-
Leonard data have been analyzed and
published (see M. Collins 1998c).

Another Paleoindian type known from

Devil’s Mouth (L. Johnson 1964) and
Wilson-Leonard (Michael B. Collins
1995, personal communication) is also
present in south Texas. This is the early
stemmed or Wilson type (E. Turner and
Hester 1993). Bettis (1997) reports one
specimen from Webb County.

Extremely common in southern Texas

is the Angostura type (see Fig. 4.9f, g).
Recent excavations in the area of the Ap-
plewhite Reservoir in southern Bexar
County have uncovered a buried Angos-
tura component radiocarbon dated to
approximating 9800 b.p. (Thoms and
Mandel 1992). This date is in line with
those for Angostura from Wilson-Leonard
(M. Collins 1995, personal communica-
tion; M. Collins 1998a). Possibly related
to Angostura is the early stemmed lanceo-
late form (E. Turner and Hester 1993)
found in some numbers in Victoria
County (Birmingham and Hester 1976)
and perhaps in the Late Paleoindian/
Early Archaic cache reported from Loma
Sandia (A. Taylor and Highley 1995).

Scottsbluff points (see Fig. 4.9h), typi-

cal of the Plains and into eastern Texas
(E. Turner and Hester 1993), are scattered
across southern Texas (Chandler and
Hindes 1993; Hester and Hill 1971a),
with a notable concentration in the Vic-
toria County area. Based on cross-dating
with artifacts from the Plains, these points
are thought to date between 8800 and
8400 b.p. (Gunnerson 1987).

A typological problem that is present in

south Texas Paleoindian studies involves
the so-called Lerma type (as deﬁned by
MacNeish 1958). These narrow, bi-
pointed specimens may or may not be of
Paleoindian age (E. Turner and Hester
1993). An unpublished manuscript by the
late T. C. Kelly (1989) remains the best

ico. A point classiﬁed as Lerma was found
at the base of a stratiﬁed site on the Nue-
ces River (41ZV263) by Gibson (1981),
but it is not chronometrically dated.
The best opportunity in southern
Texas to ﬁnd the Late Paleoindian forms
in context, and to gain other than typo-
logical or distributional data for them, are
the deep sites noted earlier in Victoria
County, especially Johnston-Heller and
Willeke. Work at the River Spur site
(41VT112) in 1993 (Cloud et al. 1994b)
suggested that this was a stratiﬁed Paleo-
indian site. However, excavations by
Michael B. Collins and myself in June
and July, 1995, indicate that these materi-
als were in a lag (secondary) deposit.

Early Archaic

In dealing with the Early Archaic, I
draw heavily from a paper prepared for
a conference on the Archaic of southern
North America (Hester 1989b). We are
still a long way from having a sufﬁcient
number of excavated sites and applicable
radiocarbon dates to develop a detailed
description and chronology of this early
period in southern Texas.

To summarize the Early Archaic pat-
terns in the 1989 paper, I offered deﬁni-
tions of two widespread horizons. The
ﬁrst was termed the early corner-notched
horizon, followed by the early basal-
notched horizon (the latter has afﬁnities
to the Calf Creek horizon in Oklahoma
and Arkansas [Wyckoff 1995]). The dates
established for these horizons parallel the

chronological parameters provided for re-
lated phenomena in central and Lower
Pecos Texas (see Collins, chapter 3, and
Turpin, chapter 8, both in this volume).
My goal in offering these two concepts
was to emphasize the broad cross-regional
distributions of the index-marker projec-
tile points of these horizons in the Texas-
Mexico borderlands.

In southern Texas, the early corner-
notched horizon is the least well known.
It is typiﬁed by corner-notched dart points
with recurved or notched bases. Typolog-
ically, these would ﬁt within the Martin-
dale-Uvalde-Baker-Bandy continuum
(Fig. 4.11a– c; see also R. McReynolds
1993) and some specimens of the Gower
type (Ricklis and Cox 1991). While
points of this horizon are seen in collec-
tions from the region (e.g., Hester and
Whatley 1992), their site distribution is
poorly understood. In the excavations at
Choke Canyon reservoir, site 41LK51
yielded a Bandy-style point along with
thin triangular bifaces and from a con-
text 20 cm below a radiocarbon assay of
5130 to 4450 b.c. At Chaparrosa Ranch,
points of this horizon are on high terraces
overlooking Turkey and Chaparrosa
Creeks. As noted above, settlement pat-
terns for the Early Archaic are unknown;
perhaps these peoples operated as small
bands, highly mobile and wide-ranging
because of the arid climate inferred for
part of this time frame (W. McKinney
1981; Story 1985). McGraw and Knep-
per (1983) in their survey of the East
Chacon area found Guadalupe tools to
be “water-proximate,” while the general
Early Archaic settlement paralleled that
of the previously mentioned Chaparrosa
Ranch and the Paleoindian site distribu-
tion in this area.

The early corner-notched horizon
markers may encompass the bifurcated
base points found by Thoms (1992) at
the Richard Beene site (41BX831), which
had a radiocarbon date of about 7000
b.p. Interestingly, James Karbula (1995,
personal communication) has found what
appear to be identical points at the Eckols
site in Travis County, stratigraphically be-
low a component with Martindale points
(Karbula 1993). It may be that these bi-
furcated points are a central Texas and
not a south Texas form, but this is just
speculation given the meager amount of
data on hand. From typological cross-
dating, the temporal span of the early

corner-notched horizon may be from
ca. 6000 to 3500 b.c.

Associated with this earliest Archaic
horizon appear to be Guadalupe tools
(see Fig. 4.11d, e; Hester and Kohnitz
1975; see also Prewitt 1981, 78). Al-
though found mostly in the San Anto-
nio–Guadalupe River basins (Black and
McGraw 1985), they also occur along the
Rio Grande, along the middle Nueces
drainage (K. Brown 1985, 1989; Night-
engale et al. 1989), and in the Zavala
County region (Highley 1984). Based on
radiocarbon dates for Guadalupe tools

along the southern edge of the Balcones
Escarpment, the Guadalupe tools fall
somewhere between 4700 and 3300 b.c.
(e.g., Hester 1990a, 1).

The subsequent early basal-notched
horizon includes specimens with deep
basal notches, large barbs, and distinctive
long stems (Fig. 4.12a–g). The recog-
nized types include Bell and Andice of
the Calf Creek horizon. Early triangular
bifaces are probably also part of this hori-
zon (Hester and Whatley 1992); some of
these are preforms for Bell /Andice, while
others may have been used as knives

(Black and McGraw 1985), and yet oth-
ers bear impact ﬂutes indicative of their
use as dart points. Based on my excava-
tions in Uvalde County (at the La Jita
and Smith sites [Hester 1971; Hester
et al. 1989a]), it looks as if the early trian-
gular form may ﬁrst appear in the early
corner-notched horizon and perhaps con-
tinues into the later horizon.

The early basal-notched horizon ex-

tends from the southern Texas coast,
across the Rio Grande Plain, and into
northeastern Mexico east of the Sierra
Madre Oriental ( James B. Boyd collec-
tion; Chandler and Kumpe 1993; notes
on ﬁle at TARL). A. Fox and Hester
(1976) reported Andice points from
41VT17 in Victoria County, and in sev-
eral papers in La Tierra Bell. Andice
points are noted as derived from surface
contexts in south Texas (e.g., Chandler
and Kumpe 1993; Hester and Whatley
1992). Ricklis and Cox (1991) report
Bell points from the McKinzie site
(41NU221) at the mouth of the Nueces
River; these specimens, and three un-
stemmed points, are linked to radio-
carbon assays of ca. 3600 –3000 b.c.
(see Ricklis, chapter 5, this volume). In
general, the early basal-notched horizon
likely dates in this rough time frame.
Other recognizable traits of this horizon
are large unifacial Clear Fork tools (Hes-
ter and Kohnitz 1975), as well as smaller
forms (G. Hall et al. 1982, ﬁg. 79) and
multinotched “eccentric” Bell /Andice
specimens, found as far south as Falcon
Reservoir (see Fig. 4.12h; Hester 1990c).
In the Falcon Reservoir, the large Andice/
Bell stems are sometimes reworked into
projectile points (Boyd collection; notes
on ﬁle at TARL).

Although L. Johnson and Goode
(1994, 5) include the latter part of this
range in their central Texas “Middle Ar-
chaic,” I prefer to follow G. Hall et al.
(1986) in deﬁning the south Texas Middle
Archaic period with the onset of speciﬁc
regional cultural patterns ca. 2500 b.c.,
emphasizing unstemmed dart points and
smaller bifacial and unifacial beveled
tools. Of course, the way in which I have
modeled these two horizons, in deﬁning
broad cultural patterns across several parts
of Texas, may be too simplistic as we learn
more about the southern Texas Early Ar-
chaic. For example, at site 41LK31/32,
the early occupation dated at 3380 –
3350 b.c. yielded diagnostics of neither

horizon. While there were several well-
deﬁned features, abundant mussel and
Rabdotus shell, cores, debitage, and fau-
nal remains, the only “formal” artifacts
were three unstemmed thin biface frag-
ments (G. Hall et al. 1986, 397). The
diet appeared to focus on freshwater mus-
sel, Rabdotus snails, turtles, and freshwa-
ter drum (R. Scott 1982).

Middle Archaic

G. Hall et al. (1986) date the Middle

Archaic between 2500 and 400 b.c. As
just noted above, this period represents a

regional material culture pattern easily
seen in the archeological record. Triangu-
lar dart points, known as Tortugas and
Abasolo (Fig. 4.13a, b), dominate the
projectile point assemblage. Some of
them may have been used as “knives”;
however, studies of triangular point as-
semblages from south Texas by Karbula
(1991) and Bettis (1997) reveal high fre-
quencies of impact fractures at the tip.
Another regionally speciﬁc type is Carrizo
(E. Turner and Hester 1993), illustrated
in Fig. 4.13c. Utilitarian lithics include
smaller unifacial distally beveled tools

04-A2946  4/14/04  12:22 PM  Page 139

PREHISTORY OF SOUTH TEXAS / 139

the Lower Pecos (Langtry), and the cen-
tral coastal plain (Morhiss). Assemblages
that include Middle Archaic materials
(and those of both earlier and later peri-
ods) from the middle Nueces drainage
are published (Nightengale et al. 1989;
P. Ward 1984; Woerner and Highley
1983), western south Texas (e.g., 41DM59
[Hester and Whatley 1992]), the Shrew
site (Labadie 1988), and Falcon Lake
(Kotter 1980; R. Saunders 1985). Many
of the tubular sandstone pipes (Fig. 4.16)
found across south Texas may also date to
this era (Chandler and Kumpe 1993;
Hester 1969a). A buried and as yet unex-
plored Middle Archaic component ap-
pears to be present at 41ZV37 (Inman
et al. 1995), with one radiocarbon date
of 1880 –1831 b.c. (Tx-8112-calibrated);
a unifacial distally beveled tool (Clear
Fork uniface) was associated with this
component.

Settlement patterns in the Choke Can-

yon and Chaparrosa study areas, along
with those at East Chacon (McGraw and
Knepper 1983), suggest that Middle Ar-
chaic open camp sites are to be found
along present or former stream channels.
In later Middle Archaic times, sites are
present on ﬂoodplains, low terraces, and
natural levees of present stream courses.
Middle and Late Archaic sites in Starr
County have been characterized by Nun-
ley and Hester (1975, 13) as “gallery” (on
terraces or arroyo banks) and “bower” (in
hilly areas overlooking the arroyos and
their tributaries).

Dietary information is meager because

of poor faunal preservation. However,
data from Choke Canyon (e.g., R. Scott
1982), recovered from wood species
identiﬁcation of charcoal from well-
constructed hearths, suggest use of the
beans and nuts of mesquite, acacia, oak,
and hackberry. G. Hall et al. (1986)
surmise that it is during this time that
plant resources were heavily utilized,
as reﬂected by an increase in formal
hearths, earth ovens, and burned rock
accumulations.

Disposal of the dead in the Middle
Archaic, especially late in this period
(ca. 800 – 600 b.c.), apparently involved
cemeteries. Loma Sandia stands out as
the best known example (A. Taylor and
Highley 1995), with 205 burials and
more than 400 features documented at
the site, many of these including clusters
of grave goods found with individual

sites. These are unifacial “gouges” of the form termed Dimmit by Nunley and Hester (1966).

(the Dimmit form [Fig. 4.14] of Nunley
and Hester [1966]), in some areas made
in high frequencies from gray quartzite
(Hester et al. 1973; see also Inman et al.
1995). Some distally beveled tools are
also bifacial. There is much reworking
and resharpening of these tools, which
appear to have been used largely in wood-
working tasks (Hester et al. 1973; see
C. Howard 1973 for experimental data).
Along the Rio Grande between Eagle Pass
and Falcon Reservoir, the artifacts are of-
ten made on cortex ﬂakes, with the dorsal
side ﬂaked and the ventral side remaining
as cortex (Chandler 1974). While G. Hall
et al. (1982, ﬁg. 79) have proposed a se-
quence of these distally beveled forms
focusing on Early versus Late Archaic

(Fig. 4.15), it is likely that localized ex-
amples of these tools, along with exten-
sive resharpening and other modiﬁcation
(e.g., for hafting) have left a functional
and technological puzzle that will require
much research to sort out. One example
is the Nueces tool (see Fig. 4.13e, f; Hes-
ter et al. 1969b; Nightengale et al. 1989;
E. Turner and Hester 1993), which can
be lunate to trapezoidal in outline, largely
reﬂecting the extent of resharpening of
the beveled bit.

Middle Archaic sites, especially in the
northern part of south Texas (Nunley and
Hester 1966), are often identiﬁed by the
presence of stemmed points that can be
cross-dated with points from central Texas
(Pedernales and Lange; see Fig. 4.13d),

burials (Fig. 4.17). Contents of these
clusters, often tightly packed as if in a
net, hide bag, or basket, included triangu-
lar points (Tortugas, though with larger
and smaller forms, and Abasolo); Lange,
Morhiss, and Pedernales points; medium-
sized “gouges” (mostly unifacial distally
beveled tools); ﬂakes; cores; fragments of
marine shell (including conch); tabular
pieces of sandstone (it seems like just
about everyone had to be buried with
small pieces of unmodiﬁed sandstone);
and tubular sandstone pipes (see Hester

1980b, 116). In contrast to the dates for
Tortugas points at this site, a single assay
from 41ME34 puts a Tortugas-like point
at 3398 –3362 b.c. (calibrated); Hester
(1990a, 1) does not consider it to be early
triangular, although the dates are more in
line with that form.

However, there are apparently other
cemeteries in the region, based on as yet
unpublished data from Falcon Reservoir.
The Southern Island site (or sites?), on
the Mexican side of the river, has yielded
many burials with numerous grave goods.

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

These goods include tubular stone pipes
and triangular dart points (as at Loma
Sandia), along with Oliva shells and bone
beads (Boyd et al. 1997b).

Late Archaic

The Late Archaic is better known, dat-
ing from 400 b.c. to around a.d. 600/700.
Several excavated components have been
published or at least described in prelimi-
nary fashion. For example, at 41ZV10
in western south Texas, Hester (1978b)
found Shumla, Ensor (Fig. 4.18a), Mar-
cos, and Montell points stratigraphically
below Late Prehistoric occupations. In-
terestingly, the Marcos and Shumla
points were in deposits below those con-
taining Ensor and Montell. The Shumla
type, best known from the Lower Pecos,
is also a widespread marker of the Late
Archaic in southern Texas. A very high
percentage of the south Texas specimens
are made of heat-treated chert (Hester
and Collins 1974). Olmos bifaces, small
triangular gouge-like tools with special-
ized resharpening techniques, appar-
ently date mainly to the Late Archaic
although they may have continued to
be used in Late Prehistoric times (see
Fig. 4.18d–h; see also Shafer and Hester
1971).

At Choke Canyon, forty-four sites
yielded diagnostics of the Late Archaic,
including Ensor, Frio, Ellis, Fairland, and
Marcos points. Sites have extensive de-
posits of ﬁre-cracked rock, both hearths
and earth ovens (these continue from the
latter part of the Middle Archaic), and
grinding implements (manos, metates)
are commonly found. These implements
may reﬂect further intensiﬁcation of the
exploitation of mesquite and acacia beans
(as well as other plant resources) after
these species appeared (and perhaps
spread) during the Middle Archaic.
However, at site 41LK67, Feature 8
was found, a large accumulation of ﬁre-
cracked rock (55 kg), with considerable
quantities of mussel shell. Kenneth
Brown and his coauthors note that “the
cooking of mussels may have been at least
one of the functions” (K. Brown et al.
1982, 24). (Feature 8 was radiocarbon
dated at 400 b.c.) At Choke Canyon,
Middle and Late Archaic faunal remains
suggest exploitation of small animals
(rodents, rabbits, turtles, ﬁsh, lizards,
and snakes) and deer. Rabdotus snails

and mussel shells are common, reﬂecting
their collection as food sources.

Late Archaic camp sites are almost al-
ways located adjacent to present stream
channels or adjacent sloughs (e.g., High-
ley 1986; Kelly with Hester 1979; Mc-
Graw and Knepper 1983; Warren 1986).
There is clear evidence that in Late and
Middle Archaic times lithic procurement
sites were very common on high terraces
and ridges containing Rio Grande gravels
(Kelly with Hester 1979; Warren 1986)
or Uvalde gravels (M. Davis 1992; Hester
1975a). There is no doubt that these
same chert resources were also used in
Paleoindian and Early Archaic times (e.g.,
Berger and Associates 1989). In areas
where these outcrops did not occur (e.g.,
McGraw 1979, 24), stream pebbles, grav-
els, siliciﬁed wood, and quartzite were
exploited.

Elsewhere in southern Texas, especially
in Webb and La Salle Counties, Desmuke,
Matamoros, and Catan points appear
to be markers of the Late Archaic (see
Fig. 4.18b, c), along with Olmos tools.
I suspect that we will eventually ﬁnd (as
the data suggest from 41ZV10) that the
Late Archaic can be broken into two
parts, or that it would be wise to use the
concept of a “terminal Archaic” for sites
with Ensor, Frio, Catan, and Matamoros
points in particular. This concept makes
sense because these point types often
show up in the early Late Prehistoric sites
in the region (see Creel et al. 1979).

Cemeteries may have continued to be
used in this period, as they were on the
Texas Coastal Bend (e.g., the Oso ceme-
tery, 41NU2) and in Bexar County
(41BX1; Lukowski 1988). However, iso-
lated burials with grave goods provide
other insights into burial patterns. On the
lower Nueces, in the area of present Lake
Corpus Christi, a single burial associated
with Ensor points was found (Hester
1989c). In Karnes County, the Rudy
Haiduk site burial, with corner-tang bi-
faces, Marcos points (see Fig. 4.18i, j),
and other Late Archaic indicators has
been published (Mitchell et al. 1984),
and another, with an Ensor point in
the chest area, was reported by Huebner
et al. (1996). A burial found by McGraw
(1983) in a Holocene Rio Grande terrace
south of Laredo may also date to this pe-
riod. The disturbed burials at the Shrew

site are likely Late Archaic (Labadie places
Burial 1, with the associated large trian-
gular, edge-polished biface [Fig. 4.19a],
in the “latter part of the Archaic” [Labadie
1988, 110]).

There may have been increased trade

with central Texas in the Late Archaic.
Large, small-stemmed bifaces (Fig. 4.20a,
b; see Hester and Green 1972) are found
occasionally, such as a specimen from
Frio County, and one with a cache of ﬁfty
bifaces (Fig. 4.20c–g), many made of Ed-
wards chert (M. Collins 1995, personal
communication), found with a burial at
Falcon Reservoir in late 1994. Large tri-
angular bifaces (see Fig. 4.19b) of Ed-
wards chert are found in several areas
of south Texas (e.g., the Riley cache
[Fig. 4.21]) (K. Miller 1993; see also
Hester and Barber 1990).

Late Prehistoric

The Late Prehistoric in southern Texas
has been extensively studied and reported
(see summaries in Black 1986, 1989a;
Highley 1986). It shares cultural patterns
with central Texas to a certain extent, es-
pecially in the occurrence of the Toyah
horizon in the region (Black 1986). The
earlier parts of the Late Prehistoric are less
clear. For example, “dart points” such as
Ensor, Matamoros, Catan, and Zavala of-
ten occur in what are otherwise Late Pre-
historic contexts, some even in very late
contexts. These points are small and surely
could have been used with the bow and
arrow. Whether they were “recycled” by
Late Prehistoric hunters or were made and
used as part of the bow and arrow system
is hard to tell (evidence for the latter comes
from 41LK106 [Creel et al. 1979]).

If we use the central Texas sequence as

an analogy, we can argue that Edwards
and Scallorn points (Fig. 4.22a– c) repre-
sent the ﬁrst diagnostics of the Late Pre-
historic period. At Blue Bayou (41VT94),
Huebner and Comuzzie (1992) report a
Scallorn point in a Late Prehistoric ceme-
tery radiocarbon-dated in the sixth cen-
tury a.d. Another Scallorn point (see
Fig. 4.22c) was found with a burial in
Frio County (Hester et al. 1993b). Scal-
lorn points, and arrow points resembling
Edwards (E. Turner and Hester 1993),
are widespread in south Texas, but we
know so little of their cultural context that
it is unclear as to their afﬁnity with cen-

plicated by their apparent co-occurrence
with Perdiz points at sites like 41ZV155
(Tortuga Flat [Inman et al. 1998]), and
with pottery, straight-stemmed arrow
points, and late radiocarbon dates at
41MC222 (G. Hall et al. 1986). A dis-
tinctive artifact that does appear at this
time is the arrow shaft straightener
(Fig. 4.22d), made of limestone and often
broken from repeated reheating in the
arrow-straightening process (E. Turner
and Hester 1993).

The introduction of pottery is another
thorny issue. At one time it was thought

that bone-tempered pottery was intro-
duced by the Spanish missionaries
(D. Suhm et al. 1954). Subsequently,
Hester and Hill (1971b) conclusively
demonstrated the prehistoric origins of
this pottery (see also Black 1982). It has
been assumed that it was largely intro-
duced via the Toyah horizon (Black
1986). However, at 41LK106 (Creel
et al. 1979), there is bone-tempered pot-
tery associated with Matamoros points at
a hearth in Unit B. Though not directly
radiocarbon dated, other dates for the
Late Prehistoric at 41LK106 are compar-
atively early, ca. a.d. 860 –1250.

Further uncertainties about Late Pre-

historic internal chronology are seen
along the Rio Grande below Laredo.
Here, Starr points are common but un-
dated. They apparently have several vari-
ants about which little is known. Another
type, Caracara (Fig. 4.23; R. Saunders
and Hester 1993; see also Fox with Hes-
ter 1979, ﬁg. 17), is also mostly undated,
but recent burials with associated Cara-
cara points found at Falcon Reservoir
have yielded calibrated radiocarbon ages
that range from about a.d. 1000 to 1400
(Boyd et al. 1997b). Toyah points are also
found with some frequency in that area
and are occasionally seen at other south
Texas sites. These are assumed to date
very late in the Late Prehistoric period,
but we know nothing about what cultural
pattern they might represent.

Across southern Texas, including por-

tions of the Coastal Bend (see Ricklis,
chapter 5, this volume), the best docu-
mented Late Prehistoric pattern is the
Toyah horizon (Black 1986), dating be-
tween a.d. 1250/1300 and 1600/1650.
Several Toyah open camp sites have been
excavated, including Hinojosa (41JW8;
Black 1986), 41LK201 (Highley 1986),
41ME19 (Hester and Kelly 1976), and
the material culture reported from surface
contexts at Berclair (41GD4; Hester and
Parker 1970). Cultural traits include Per-
diz points (Fig. 4.24), small end scrapers
(sometimes made on blades), ﬂake knives
(again, some made on blades), beveled

favors the latter idea (see also Hester
1975b) and thus proposes the use of the
term “horizon” when referring to Toyah
manifestations.

Supportive of Black’s argument is the
presence of selected Toyah traits in con-
temporary Late Prehistoric sites in parts
of south Texas. For example, in the
Chaparrosa Ranch area, along Tortugas
Creek in Zavala County, and south into
Webb, Zapata, and other counties, sites
often yield Perdiz points, bone-tempered
pottery, beveled knives, or some combi-
nation of Toyah traits (e.g., 41ZV155
[Inman et al. 1998]). However, the whole
assemblage is not present at south Texas
sites, and often, bison is absent (or poorly
represented) in the faunal list (e.g.,
41ZV10 [Hester 1978a]).

There are also sites like 41MC222
(Skillet Mountain No. 4 [G. Hall et al.
1986]), in the Choke Canyon area, that
have produced bison (indeed, it appears
to be a bison-butchering station) and
bone-tempered pottery but have stemmed
arrow points that are not Perdiz and an
absence of beveled knives, end scrapers,
and the like. Scallorn and Edwards points
are present, however.

I suspect that native peoples of Late
Prehistoric times had adopted all or some
of the traits of the central Texas Toyah, or
even that central Texas hunting parties
ventured onto the coastal plain (see Hes-
ter and Parker 1970). The uneven diffu-
sion of Toyah traits across the region
indicates that they should be considered
horizon markers and not part of a phase
(L. Johnson 1987).

The latter part of the Late Prehistoric,
which includes Toyah, also has evidence
of south Texas connections to a north-
south Plains trade network. Recognizable
remnants of such trade are the bits of
Idaho (Malad) obsidian that show up in
southern Texas at this time (Hester et al.
1991).

Equally intriguing as a problem of
cultural interaction is the archeological
record in the Rio Grande delta during the
Late Prehistoric (Hester 1969a, 1988b,
1994b). Numerous sites and their assem-
blages have been recorded and studied by
A. E. Anderson (1932), Richard S. Mac-
Neish (1958), and others (Hester 1978c,
1994b; Prewitt 1974a). This cultural pat-
tern, known as the Brownsville Complex
(see Ricklis, chapter 5, this volume) is

resented. While there is abundant bison
bone, white-tail deer may have been more
extensively hunted, along with pronghorn
and a variety of smaller game. Processing
areas and bone discard locales are noted
at 41LK201 and 41JW8. Turtles, fresh-
water mussels, and land snails continue to
be a part of the diet.

Toyah sites are located along present
stream channels or nearby sloughs (e.g.,
41LK201), sometimes buried just below

the surface of natural levees paralleling
the streams. This pattern exists for other
Late Prehistoric sites in much of south-
ern Texas (e.g., Mariposa [Montgomery
1978] and in the East Chacon study area
[McGraw and Knepper 1983]).

Black (1986, 1989a) reasons that the
Toyah archeological record represents ei-
ther population movement or the cultural
diffusion of traits (perhaps largely associ-
ated with bison hunting practices). He

PREHISTORY OF SOUTH TEXAS / 149

noted for the manufacture of great num-
bers of shell ornaments (Fig. 4.27a– c, g).
Numerous artifacts of bone were also
made (Fig. 4.27d–f, h–j). The Browns-
ville Complex groups utilized clay dunes
for camp sites and for cemeteries (e.g.,
Hester et al. 1969a; Prewitt 1974a). They
were hunters (using Cameron and Starr
points [E. Turner and Hester 1993]), gath-
erers, and ﬁshers, but we know little else
about them (Kibler [1994, 62] suggests
they were “logistical collectors”; see also
Ricklis 1990).

Anderson, early in his research, also
noted the occasional discovery of artifacts
from what he termed the “Huaxtec” (notes
on ﬁle at TARL). In 1917, he recorded a
conch whorl ornament with an engraved
human face that was clearly not locally
made. He also found several large pottery
vessels, or portions thereof, and he knew
enough about Mexican cultures to link
these to the “Huaxtec.” These identiﬁca-
tions were conﬁrmed and the vessels par-
tially illustrated by John Alden Mason
(1935; Hester 1988b, 3). Ekholm (1944)
published what is still the deﬁnitive study
of archeology in the Huasteca region,
and he also noted the presence of vessels
from this Mesoamerican culture in the
Rio Grande delta. In MacNeish’s 1958
survey of Tamaulipas along the coastal
plain south of Brownsville, he revisited
some of Anderson’s sites and found more
Huastecan pottery.

In addition to the Mesoamerican ce-
ramics, Anderson also collected several
bits of obsidian and some pieces of jadeite
and serpentine. These, too, were items of
material culture exotic to the lower Rio
Grande delta. Later studies, such as exca-
vation of the Floyd Morris cemetery site
in Cameron County (M. Collins et al.
1969), uncovered a large tubular jadeite
bead (see Fig. 4.27n) with Brownsville
Complex materials. Surveys by Robert J.
Mallouf yielded two additional obsidian
ﬂakes in Willacy County (41WY40), and
D. William Day (1981) recovered several
obsidian ﬂakes from 41WY72.

Where did these artifacts originate
and how did they get to the Rio Grande
delta? The ceramics include ollas, bowls,
and many fragments of vessels and sherds.
Some have black-on-white decoration
while others are polychrome. These
pieces are clearly from the Huasteca and

date to Periods V and VI of Ekholm’s
(1944) sequence. This period is the Early
and Late Postclassic, from ca. a.d. 1000
to 1520 (G. Willey 1966, 90). In terms
of context, they come from at least six-
teen sites. Most of the complete vessels
occurred with burials, although Anderson
and MacNeish both collected Huastecan
sherds from delta sites with no apparent
burial associations. One of the ollas came
from a site known as Tanque Salado (see
Fig. 4.28), likely associated with a female
burial. On it is a motif almost identical to
one illustrated on a Huastecan vessel re-
covered by Ekholm (1944, ﬁg. 131). An-
other olla was found with a child’s burial
(Cayo Atascoso clay dune site) in 1928 in
Cameron County. Three other vessels, all
from the Tamaulipan side of the delta,
were with or near burials; they included a
Huastecan bowl and substantial portions
of two ollas from the Loma de la Pesca
and La Loma Atravasada sites.

The polychromes, described as Tancol
Polychrome by Ekholm (1944, 433), and
the Huasteca Black-on-White, are proba-
bly all from Period VI, dated between
a.d. 1200 and 1520. However, a corru-
gated sherd may date to the Las Flores
phase, or Period V, the Early Postclassic
(ca. a.d. 1000 –1200, again based on
Ekholm’s study (1944, 395).

The geologic sources of several obsid-
ian ﬂakes from the delta have been pinned
down with precision, with the techniques
of nuclear chemistry used by the Texas
Obsidian Project (Fig. 4.29; Hester et al.
1991). For example, a tiny ﬂake of black
opaque obsidian found by Anderson in
Cameron County is linked to the Za-
cualtipan source in the state of Hidalgo.
Seven obsidian ﬂakes from 41WY72 are
all of green obsidian (Day 1981). Visu-
ally, these appeared to be from the Pa-
chuca, or Cerro de las Navajas source,
the most famous in ancient Mexico.
X-ray ﬂuorescence analysis conﬁrmed
this (Kibler 1994, 16). Finally, two ﬂakes
found by Mallouf at 41WY40 have also
been identiﬁed as to source, although
when we ﬁrst analyzed them in the late
1970s, their source was unknown. Re-
cently, however, David O. Brown of
Austin provided obsidian samples from a
source known as Ojos Zarcos in Queré-
taro state not far from Guanajuato. Col-
leagues at the Lawrence Berkeley Labora-

geologic sources of these pieces are un-
known. They would have to come from
beyond the Huasteca, perhaps in Oaxaca
or any number of other areas where
jadeite and serpentine are known in cen-
tral and southern Mexico. What is im-
portant here is their occurrence; though
they are not true jade, they are “green
stone” of the sort very important in Meso-
american cultures.

What processes might have been in-
volved in trade or contact between the
Brownsville Complex and ancient Meso-
america? First of all, it is safe to say that
the main conduit was the Huastecan cul-
ture, the northern edge of which is about
ﬁve hundred kilometers down the Gulf
Coast from the delta (see Fig. 4.29). Dur-
ing the Early Postclassic, the Huasteca
maintained trade relations with the Toltec
empire. Late Postclassic Huastecan cul-
ture was part of the Aztec empire and

paid tribute to it (Hosler and Stresser-
Pean 1992). Clearly, then, the region was
closely linked with central Mexico. In the
Late Postclassic, it is equally clear that the
well-known Aztec traders, known as the
pochteca, interacted with the Huastecs.
Indeed, it is said that the markets of the
Huasteca competed with those of Aztec
Tenochtitlán (Fagan 1984, 66). Through-
out the Postclassic the Huastec merchants
could have obtained obsidian and jade
through Toltec or Aztec trade networks.

But how and why did these Huastecan
commodities reach the Brownsville Com-
plex? There is a series of frontier Meso-
american villages in the Sierra de Tamauli-
pas dug by Richard S. MacNeish and Guy
Stresser-Pean. At ﬁrst glance, they look to
be likely intermediaries. MacNeish (1958)
notes Huastecan Period VI “trade ware”
in late sites in the Sierra de Tamaulipas,
and Stresser-Pean’s 1977 study of the site

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

of San Antonio Nogalar in the southern
Sierra de Tamaulipas also illustrates late
Huastecan ceramics.

There is also the broad ﬂat coastal
plain east of the Sierra de Tamaulipas that
could have been traversed by Huastecan
merchants, or perhaps travel was by boat
along the coast. MacNeish (1947) found
what he termed Huastecan camp sites
north of the Río Soto la Marina and near
the Laguna Madre, only 250 kilometers
south of the Rio Grande. What drew the
Huastecans north to the delta? I believe it
was the shell ornament production of the
Brownsville Complex. We cannot yet re-
solve the “chicken-or-the egg” dilemma
of which came ﬁrst—the shell beads or
the Huastecs. Doubtless the hunters and
gatherers making the prodigious num-
bers of shell ornaments were after more
than a few pots, obsidian ﬂakes, and poor
quality jadeite. There were surely other
commodities that have not been pre-
served. And, were the Huastecs only in-
terested in the shell beads for themselves?
Brownsville-style Oliva tinklers occur
among the Huastecs (Ekholm 1944) and
are depicted on Huastecan stone sculp-
ture, and MacNeish (1947) states that
Brownsville Complex shell ornaments are
common in Huastecan sites. But are these
ornaments from the delta or made by the
Huastecs themselves from Gulf Coast
shell in their region? We cannot answer
this question with the paucity of modern
excavation data from the Huasteca or the
Rio Grande delta. It is interesting to note
that commodities especially favored by
the Aztecs for their Tenochtitlán markets
were marine shells and marine shell orna-
ments, perhaps largely supplied through
Huastec tribute.

Protohistoric

Lesley Adkins and Roy A. Adkins
deﬁne “protohistory” as “the transition
period between the prehistoric and his-
toric periods denoting a phase for which
few written records are available, and for
which most evidence is derived from ar-
chaeology” (1982, 242). In the archeol-
ogy of the Plains, the Protohistoric con-
cept is often used (e.g., Baugh 1986). It
includes sites up to ca. 1750 at which
southwestern Indian and some European
trade goods appear, but this concept also
recognizes that Euro-American explorers
and settlers had not yet entered the area

04-A2946  4/14/04  12:23 PM  Page 151

PREHISTORY OF SOUTH TEXAS / 151

in sufﬁcient numbers to have “impacted
the economy of the Southern Plains peo-
ples” (Baugh 1986, 183). This situation is
exactly the same as that in south Texas in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
before the Spanish explorers and mission
system “impacted the economy” of the
Late Prehistoric groups.

There are a number of sites that fall
into this era. Especially well known are
several in Zavala County (Hester and Hill
1975) with radiocarbon dates in this time
frame. Only sixty kilometers to the west,
missions were established at what is now
Guerrero, Coahuila, in the early eigh-
teenth century (Eaton 1981), drawing
their neophytes in part from this very
area. Thus, in south Texas, the Protohis-
toric period seems an apt term for Native
American sites dating after Cabeza de
Vaca’s unfortunate shipwreck and the
even more unfortunate arrival of Span-
iards in the 1600s. These initial entries
had no lasting effect on the native groups
(unless it was the initial introduction
of disease, so rampant in the eighteenth
century), and few written records about
them exist. Strictly speaking, the native
cultures at this time are neither Late Pre-
historic nor Historic, and thus, despite
the views of some colleagues (Hindes
1995; McGraw et al. 1991, 116, 118),
I think the Protohistoric is a cultural-
historical concept. Absolute dates are not
signiﬁcant; rather, it is the opportunity to
address important issues of culture pro-
cess that makes this period important.
Once we learn more about this critical
time frame, we can talk with more clarity
about the continuity, or lack thereof, of
native culture into the mission setting
(Hester 1989d). For example, given the
long tradition of bone-tempered pottery
production in south Texas, extending
back to a.d. 800 –1000, I think it is con-
fusing to refer to the mission-era bone-
tempered material as “Goliad” unless it
has designs or motifs that are deﬁnitely
of mission origin. Clearly, the Toyah

ceramic traditions were still in place south
of San Antonio and toward the coast.
Such pottery seems to have disappeared,
however, at the Protohistoric sites in the
Chaparrosa Ranch area, perhaps one rea-
son no bone-tempered ware is present in
the Guerrero missions.

Concluding Remarks

This chapter has attempted to summa-
rize the present status of research in south
Texas prehistory. There are numerous re-
ports in the cultural resources manage-
ment literature that I have doubtless
missed, and I apologize to their authors
for these inadvertent exclusions. Many
works, however, contain either negative
evidence or limited information, and I
simply did not have room, within the
scope of this chapter, to include these
results.

The cultural-historical emphasis of
much of this chapter provides the only
logical way that we have of organizing the
available archeological data. As noted on
several occasions, we have few large proj-
ects on which to draw for discussions of
settlement, subsistence, and behavioral
change (e.g., D. Fox et al. 1974; Hall
et al. 1986). Other sets of archeological
data, such as those from Chaparrosa
Ranch, have been presented in prelimi-
nary summaries (Hester 1978b) but have
still not been analyzed in a complete and
comprehensive manner.

An effort was made in the late 1980s
to use a different approach to the synthe-
sis of archeological information from cen-
tral, Lower Pecos, and southern Texas
(Hester et al. 1989b). The Southwest Di-
vision Corps of Engineers, working with
the Arkansas Archeological Survey, com-
missioned overviews of the major parts of
the Southwest and Southern Plains. The
concept of “adaptation types” (Fitzhugh
1975) was employed (Hester 1989e), and
while there were problems with this ap-

proach, I think some useful new view-
points were obtained.

For example, the “specialized hunter”
adaptation type reﬂected the focus (we as-
sume) of Clovis and Folsom as well as
those of the Toyah horizon at the other
end of the time spectrum. “Holocene
hunters and foragers” encompassed the
cultural patterns of south Texas peoples
from Late Paleoindian times up through
the Late Holocene, including the early
Late Prehistoric and the Protohistoric.
Lumping the archeological phenomena of
southern Texas into these broad groups
does have a certain appeal. However, to
look at issues such as climate change,
shifts in resource focus, and the spread of
horizons (or ethnic groups/phases), we
still must press on with obtaining the em-
pirical data so badly needed for future
progress in understanding the ancient
cultures of this region. We do not have
enough substantive information to enter
even a simple debate over whether these
peoples were “collectors” or “foragers”
(see Bettinger 1991; see also Bousman
et al. 1990). Using the geoarcheological
approach has much potential for under-
standing site formation processes. Im-
proved data recovery methods, such as
ﬁne-mesh water screening and ﬂotation,
may lead to better samples of botanical
remains (as we are now learning by pro-
cessing old soil samples from central
Texas burned rock middens; Stephen L.
Black 1995, personal communication).
Long-term microwear research of lithic
tools, with experimental components, is
vital; casual observations and ruminations
about edge beveling and function are no
longer sufﬁcient for studying the use and
curation of tools. Ethnohistoric research
pioneered by T. N. Campbell needs to be
continued through careful scholarship.
Yet with this, and more, in the ﬁnal ap-
praisal, we need more well-excavated,
stratiﬁed sites and more chronometric
dates for associated cultural and ecologi-
cal remains.

Prehistoric Occupation of the Central and Lower Texas Coast
A Regional Overview

Robert A. Ricklis

In 1960, Thomas N. Campbell published
an archeological synthesis of the central
and lower Texas coasts (T. N. Campbell
1960). At that time, it was possible to
identify, for the central Texas coast, basic
Archaic and Late Prehistoric (or, as then
termed, “Neo-American”) cultural pat-
terns involving human occupation of the
shoreline and exploitation of shellﬁsh and
ﬁsh resources. Chronology was strictly
relative, since no radiocarbon dates had
yet been obtained in the area, and a cul-
tural sequence could be deﬁned only on
the basis of the stratigraphic positions of
identiﬁable artifact assemblages.

Based upon previous excavations at a
few key sites such as Kent-Crane (41AS3),
Johnson (41AS1), and Live Oak Point
(41AS2) on Copano Bay, and Webb Is-
land (41NU1) in upper Laguna Madre,
Campbell (1947, 1952, 1956, 1958a,
1960) suggested a bipartite chronology in
which an Archaic Aransas focus preceded
a Neo-American Rockport focus. The
former was characterized by shoreline
shell middens yielding a variety of stone
dart point forms (later assignable mainly
to the Kent and Ensor types as deﬁned by
D. Suhm and Jelks 1962), various bone
tools, including awls and pins with en-
graved geometric decorations, and a suite
of shell tool forms consisting of perforated
oyster shells, conch columella gouges, bi-
pointed columella sections, adzes cut and
ground from conch whelk body whorls,
and knives/scrapers of edge-ﬂaked sunray

venus clamshells. The Aransas focus was
also negatively deﬁned by the absence of
arrow points and ceramics.

The Rockport focus, linked with the
historic Karankawa Indians of the region
(T. N. Campbell 1960), was identiﬁed on
the basis of several arrow point types and
more or less abundant sandy-paste ceram-
ics, often decorated and/or coated with
asphaltum, a natural tar that washes up
on Gulf of Mexico beaches. On the basis
of the virtually consistent presence of sand
in ceramic clay bodies and the occasional
use of geometric incised line decorations
below vessel rims, Campbell (1961) sug-
gested that central coast ceramic technol-
ogy diffused from the upper Texas coast.
Subsequent work on the central coast
provided additional insight into questions
of prehistoric chronology and adaptive
patterns (see summary review in Shafer
and Bond 1985). Dee Ann Story’s 1967
work at two sites in the region (Story
1968) was the ﬁrst professional excava-
tion there since the earlier work reviewed
and reported by Campbell. At the Anaqua
site (41JK8) on the lower Lavaca River,
Story identiﬁed an important Late Prehis-
toric component with plain, sandy-paste
ceramics similar to upper coast Goose
Creek Plain (D. Suhm and Jelks 1962),
in apparent association with Scallorn
and Granbury (Scallorn preforms?)
arrow points. At the Ingleside Cove site
(41SP43) on Corpus Christi Bay, Story’s
excavations revealed stratiﬁed deposits

155

with a Late Archaic shell midden overlain
by a midden pertaining to the Late Pre-
historic Rockport manifestation. These
excavations provided the ﬁrst radiocarbon
dates for the central coast. Four samples
(three on scallop shell and one on wood
charcoal) were assayed and appeared on
the basis of uncorrected dates to place
the terminal Archaic component at
ca. a.d. 1100 –1250 (see Story 1968, 40).
In 1974, James E. Corbin published a
relative chronology for the central coast,
based mainly upon a seriation of dart and
arrow point types. For the Archaic, he
suggested that the known dart point types
were too varied and spanned too long a
time to ﬁt the relatively tight temporal re-
quirements of a “focus” (Corbin 1974).
On this basis, Corbin suggested that the
term Aransas Complex was more appro-
priate, since the concept of a “complex”
did not imply a clearly bounded spatial
and temporal cultural expression. In a
slightly later paper, Corbin (1976) sug-
gested that Archaic occupation of the
coast probably began ca. 2000 b.c., with
the establishment of modern sea level.
For the Late Prehistoric, Corbin’s seriation
suggested a chronology of several arrow
point types, with Scallorn and Fresno
preceding Perdiz, which was in turn fol-
lowed during the period of European
contact by the Bulbar stemmed type.

At the time of Campbell’s 1960 article,
the lower coast was even more poorly in-
vestigated than was the central coast. The

archeological record, known primarily
from sites in the Rio Grande delta area,
in fact consisted only of surface-collected
artifacts that could be related in part to
materials from northern Tamaulipas,
Mexico. It was recognized that a long
Archaic occupation, characterized by tri-
angular and subtriangular dart points,
preceded a Neo-American one with un-
stemmed arrow points and a regional
shell industry. Later work has been inter-
mittent, and the lower coast remains
poorly known.

The Central Texas Coast

The central coast, as here deﬁned, in-
cludes the shoreline zone (including the
barrier islands), and the coastal plain to a
point approximately forty to ﬁfty kilome-

ters inland from the mainland strandline,
between the Colorado River on the north
and the northern margins of Bafﬁn Bay
on the south (Fig. 5.1). The rationale for
this geographic deﬁnition is twofold.
First, this is the area of the Late Prehis-
toric Rockport phase, which can be quite
accurately delimited on the basis of the
distribution of a distinctive artifact as-
semblage. Second, while there is internal
environmental variability, the area is
uniﬁed by the presence of ﬁve similar,
major bay estuarine systems protected by
a continuous barrier island chain, in con-
trast to the prograded Brazos-Colorado
River delta to the north and the shoreline
of the lower coast, which has no bays.
The following discussion presents,
ﬁrst, a brief overview of what is currently
known about the evolution of the central

coast as an exploitable environment. This
overview is followed by a summary of the
current archeological data base, presented
chronologically from the Early Archaic
through the Late Prehistoric, along with
discussions of fundamental long-term
patterns of human adaptive change.

The Paleoindian stage is not treated
here, for two reasons. First, the period is
represented along the coast only by spo-
radic surface ﬁnds of time-diagnostic
Early and Late Paleoindian dart point
types (see Hester 1980a); to date, no in-
tact subsurface Paleoindian components
have been found at excavated sites (though
the reader may refer to Lewis 1988, 1994
for discussions of a Late Pleistocene faunal
assemblage, with possible evidence of hu-
man presence, on Petronila Creek south-
west of Corpus Christi). Second, the scat-
tered Paleoindian artifacts found within
the modern central coast area do not per-
tain to a contemporaneous coastal occupa-
tion, since the terminal Pleistocene shore-
line was situated a considerable distance
seaward of the present coast, due to lower
global sea level. When subsurface Paleo-
indian components are found intact in
the region, they will represent terrestrial /
riverine rather than coastal adaptations.

The Holocene Evolution of the
Central Coast Environment

The central coast is part of the broad
Gulf Coastal Plain (Fenneman 1938), a
nearly ﬂat physiographic unit that rises
very gradually from the coast to the in-
terior. The surface geology consists of
sandy clays and clayey sands deposited by
major ﬂuvial-deltaic systems during the
Pleistocene interglacials. The most recent
geological unit is the Beaumont Forma-
tion, a thick accumulation of Pleistocene
clays and sands that is the geological foun-
dation of the present coastline. The Ingle-
side unit of the Beaumont is a long, nar-
row deposit of sandy clays, representing a
Pleistocene barrier or strandplain; this de-
posit overlies the main part of the Beau-
mont Formation along the modern strand-
line (L. Brown et al. 1976; Solis 1981).
During the last glacial maximum, ca.
20,000 b.p., sea level was as much as one
hundred meters lower than at present,
since much of the global water supply was
locked in massive continental ice sheets
and extensive montane glaciers. At this
time, coastal streams downcut deeply

OCCUPATION OF CENTR AL AND LOWER TEXAS C OAST / 157

into the Beaumont Formation. After ca.
18,000 b.p., global warming resulted in
rapid sea level rise, so that by ca. 9000 b.p.
the river valleys along the central Texas
coast were inundated by transgressive ma-
rine waters, thus creating the prototypes
of the modern bay systems (L. Brown
et al. 1976; Byrne 1975; McGowen et al.
1976).

Although there is not complete agree-
ment on the timing of Holocene sea level
rise, there is a general consensus that ma-
rine transgression was stepwise, with peri-
ods of rapid rise interrupted by intervals
of markedly slowed rise, slight regression,
or sea level stillstand ( J. Anderson and
Thomas 1991; Curray 1960; Frazier
1974; H. Nelson and Bray 1970; Paine
1991). The more recent geologic studies
have suggested that sea level rose relatively
rapidly prior to 9000 –8000 b.p., and
then again between 7000 and 6000 b.p.
(Frazier 1974; Paine 1991). Paine (1987,
1991) has suggested a rapid rise to an ap-
proximately one-meter highstand be-
tween ca. 4400 and 2600 b.p., and recent
work by John B. Anderson et al. (1992)
has suggested ﬁnal rise and inundation of
river valleys ca. 4000 b.p. There is general
agreement that modern stable sea level
was established around 3000 b.p., give or
take a few centuries ( J. Anderson et al.
1992; L. Brown et al. 1976; Frazier 1974;
McGowen et al. 1976; Paine 1991).

The modern coastal environment be-
gan to emerge with the establishment of
stillstand ca. 3000 b.p. With a stable sea
level, wave action and longshore drift de-
posited sand and shell offshore, and dis-
connected Middle Holocene transgressive
barriers began to coalesce to form the
modern, continuous chain of regressive
barrier islands, which probably approxi-
mated their present form by 2500 –
2000 b.p. (see, e.g., L. Brown et al. 1976).
The development of the mature barrier
chain created a series of highly protected
lagoons and estuarine embayments, and
ongoing sedimentation resulted in the ex-
tensive back-barrier shallows of the mod-
ern estuarine environment. The emer-
gence of broad, quiet-water shallows
played a key role in estuarine ecology,
since vegetated shallows and marshes pro-
vide important nutrients for the rich
aquatic food chain, as well as crucial nurs-
ery and spawning grounds for ﬁsh (see,
e.g., Matlock 1990; Odum et al. 1974;
Perret et al. 1980; Reagan 1985). Thus,

the modern central coast environment is
characterized by highly productive, shal-
low-water estuaries protected from the
high-energy wave action of the open Gulf
by a continuous barrier chain.

The terrestrial environment is varied
according to local soil and hydrological
conditions. For the most part, the barrier
islands are treeless and characterized by
stabilized sand dunes that support various
grasses, and fringed on their land sides
with salt marsh plant communities. Sandy
soils on the mainland shore support
dense mottes of live and blackjack oak
(F. Jones 1983). Farther inland are the
coastal prairies, essentially ﬂat upland ar-
eas covered with grasses and scattered
clumps of mesquite and, on sandy soils,
live oak (F. Jones 1983). Faunal species in-
clude various reptiles, amphibians, mam-
mals, and birds (see Blair 1950), and bi-
son were present in signiﬁcant numbers
on the coastal prairie in Late Prehistoric
and Early Historic times, as indicated by
archeological and historical documenta-
tion (see Huebner 1991; Ricklis 1990,
1992a).

The Chronology of
Human Occupation

A Brief Consideration of Taxonomy

In light of chronological data acquired
in recent years, it is apparent that the cul-
tural history of coastal adaptation in the
region was both longer and more com-
plex than can be adequately represented
by a simple bipartite chronology involv-
ing an undifferentiated Aransas focus and
a Late Prehistoric Rockport focus. While
Campbell’s early work identiﬁed the
broadest outlines of regional chronology
and described major artifact classes, it is
now clear that the Archaic occupation of
the region has far greater time depth than
once assumed and that distinct periods of
occupation with concomitant adaptive
changes would be masked by the contin-
ued use of a single taxonomic label for
the entire Archaic period. Thus, the
Aransas focus, or as it has more recently
been termed, the Aransas Complex (Cor-
bin 1974; Prewitt et al. 1987; Shafer and
Bond 1985; Steele and Mokry 1985),
should be set aside in favor of a chrono-
logical perspective that ﬁts the currently
available empirical evidence.

Richard A. Weinstein (1992, 1994)
has suggested a chronology of “phases”

for the central coast. This chronological
construct is not employed here. Most of
Weinstein’s phases are largely conjectural,
insofar as distinctive artifact assemblages
remain poorly deﬁned and/or cannot be
placed within deﬁnable temporal or geo-
graphic limits on the basis of the available
archeological evidence. In some cases, en-
tire phases are based on only a single pro-
jectile point type that has yet to be found
in a securely dated context. As LeRoy
Johnson (1987) has correctly pointed out,
a “phase” must represent, at the very
least, a well-deﬁned spatial-temporal unit
of archeological culture and, at best, a
strongly inferred sociocultural entity. At
present, these criteria can be met only
by the Late Prehistoric Rockport phase,
which is geographically discrete and
which is in large part, if not entirely, the
archeological correlate of the ethnically
and linguistically distinct Karankawa
groups who inhabited the central coast
region in Early Historic times (Newcomb
1961, 1983; Ricklis 1990, 1996).

Radiocarbon Dating
on the Central Coast

Most of the radiocarbon dates now
available from discrete site components in
the region are derived from assays on es-
tuarine shell species found within shell
middens. It is, therefore, important to
point out that shell samples provide reli-
able results that are useful in placing site
components within a chronological
framework. This fact has been discussed
elsewhere (Ricklis 1993a; Ricklis and Cox
1991), and the present chapter is not the
place for a detailed reiteration of these
ﬁndings. Sufﬁce it to say that paired
samples of shell and wood charcoal, when
extracted from the same cultural deposi-
tional unit or feature, produce virtually
identical results, once the radiocarbon
ages on shell are corrected for the delta
13C fraction (Table 5.1, date nos. 7–13,
all of which are from a single, stratigraph-
ically discrete deposit of densely packed
shell). Similar results were recently ob-
tained on oyster shell and hearth charcoal
samples from a discrete zone of Late Pre-
historic archeological deposits at the
Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) on Galves-
ton Island; when the shell assays were
corrected for 13C, the radiocarbon ages
were statistically identical to those ob-
tained on the charcoal samples (Ricklis

Note: Calibrations based on Stuiver and Pearson (1986) and Stuiver and Reimer (1993). Asterisk next to corrected age indicates that correction for 13C is
estimated at #400 years, based on numerous AMS assays for 13C on various estuarine shell species (see text). Excludes data from ambiguous (possibly
mixed) stratigraphic contexts (see text).

1994a, 107). Paired samples of wood
charcoal and oyster shell from 41KL71
on Bafﬁn Bay (Ricklis n.d.) provide simi-
lar results for the earlier part of the occu-
pational sequence. This paired sample at
the site was extracted from a 5-cm thick,
highly discrete cultural stratum buried
some 2 m below the modern surface
within cumulic eolian clay dune sedi-
ments. The 2-sigma (95 percent conﬁ-
dence level) calibrated age ranges on these
samples overlap, with the age range of the
oyster shell at 5904 –5407 b.p. and that
of the charcoal at 5595 –5309 b.p. To
such speciﬁc results in paired charcoal-

shell samples can be added the fact that
multiple dates on shell samples from
within stratiﬁed depositional sequences
produce internally consistent results.
Based on these results for true paired
samples from discrete depositional con-
texts, it appears that estuarine shells from
the shallow-water, protected estuaries of
the Texas coast region can be appropri-
ately adjusted by atmospheric calibration.
A predominantly atmospheric carbon
reservoir appears to be indicated, similar
to that posited for shallow lakes (Stuiver
et al. 1986, 980).

All radiocarbon dates from the central

coast that can be determined with conﬁ-
dence to have come from stratigraphically
discrete contexts are shown in Table 5.1.
The radiocarbon data are also reﬂected
in Table 5.2, which lists discrete strati-
graphic components at shoreline sites and
shows their age ranges as indicated by one
or more corrected and calibrated radio-
carbon assays. These data do not include
three early dates from possibly mixed
stratigraphic contexts. Two dates on shell
from 41JK35, reported by Weinstein,
were extracted from 10-cm arbitrary lev-
els that may have cross-cut more than a
single stratigraphic zone (Weinstein 1994,

(Ricklis 1995d). Because of the uncertain
contexts of these dates, they are not listed
in Table 5.1 or incorporated into the fol-
lowing discussion. Unless otherwise indi-
cated, all radiocarbon age ranges on shell
presented below are corrected for the 13C
fraction and dendrochronologically cali-
brated at 1-sigma of error. Since charcoal
dates are not signiﬁcantly altered by 13C
correction, they have been calibrated di-
rectly from the uncorrected assay results.

The Early Archaic

The earliest demonstrable human oc-
cupation and exploitation of the central
coast shoreline, as noted above, can now
be placed considerably earlier than once
assumed. Numerous sites are currently
assignable to the Early Archaic period,
prior to the establishment of modern sea
level stillstand and the emergence of the
modern estuarine environment. Two ma-
jor periods of Early Archaic occupation
are indicated: ca. 7500 – 6800 b.p. and
ca. 5800 – 4200 b.p.

Evidence for Shoreline Occupation,

Occupation during this time interval
is well established on the basis of radio-
carbon dates on discrete stratigraphic

components at several sites in the Nueces
Bay area (Fig. 5.2). Cultural components
consist of thin but dense lenses or strata
of oyster shells (Crassostrea virginica) rest-
ing at the base of Holocene silty cumulic

soils that rest unconformably on eroded
surfaces of the Pleistocene Beaumont For-
mation (Figs. 5.3 and 5.4). At 41SP136
and 41SP153, both situated on upland
margins overlooking the north shore of

there (Ricklis 1993a), and a third speci-
men was excavated from within a discrete
dense Early Archaic oyster stratum at
41NU266 (Ricklis 1995d).

Aside from shellﬁsh (mainly oysters),
faunal remains are almost entirely lacking
from Early Archaic components. This
condition is probably in large part the re-
sult of the complete decay of bone. On
the other hand, ﬁsh otoliths, which are
remarkably resistant to decay in the silty
soils of the area, are nearly absent; the
only specimen, representing a spotted
seatrout, comes from 41NU266 (Ricklis
1995d). Fishing may not yet have played
a signiﬁcant role in the subsistence econ-
omy. This important question can be ad-
dressed only by extensive future excava-
tions of site components of the period.

Shoreline Occupation, ca. 5800 – 4200 B.P.
Better documentation is available for
this period of Early Archaic coastal occu-
pation, although much important work
remains to be done. Sites are considerably
more numerous than for the previous
part of the Early Archaic period. As of
this writing, ﬁfteen discrete stratigraphic
components can be assigned to the latter
part of the Early Archaic period on the

Fig. 5.3. Excavation proﬁle, 41SP153, north shore of Nueces Bay, showing three discrete shell
strata within Holocene cumulic silty soil.

Nueces Bay, three corrected and cali-
brated age ranges on oyster shell and one
on scallop shell fall into this period (see
Tables 5.1 and 5.2). At a third site,
41NU266 on the uplands overlooking
the south shore of Nueces Bay, similar
oyster strata at several different locations
produced age ranges falling between 7381
and 6737 b.p. (Ricklis 1995d; Warren
1993; Table 5.1 herein). Finally, an oyster
shell midden at 41NU281, exposed by
construction activities on the uplands
overlooking the Nueces River delta, pro-
duced an age range of 7525 –7390 b.p.
(Ricklis 1995a).

Aside from the fact that estuarine
shellﬁsh were obviously exploited, very
little is known of this period. Excavations
have been too limited to produce much
useful archeological information. A scant

amount of chert debitage and a chert core
from 41SP153 and a few utilized ﬂakes
from 41NU266 are the only lithic arti-
facts documented from excavated compo-
nents of the period. However, surface
ﬁnds of Early Archaic points resembling
the Uvalde type (Fig. 5.5) and an exca-
vated specimen of the Gower type from
41SP154 on Nueces Bay, near 41SP153
(found in a somewhat later component
where it may represent reuse and subse-
quent loss/discard [Ricklis 1993a, 33 –
36]) may eventually prove to pertain to
this early period. Interestingly, the edge-
ﬂaked sunray venus clamshell knife/
scraper, common at later sites (Fig. 5.6),
is now well documented for this pe-
riod. Two specimens were recovered at
41SP153 in an unquestionable context
within the earliest basal shell stratum

basis of twenty-four individual radiocar-
bon assays (Fig. 5.7; see also Tables 5.1
and 5.2). Sites include: 41NU184 (Rick-
lis and Gunter 1986), 41NU221 (Ricklis
1988), 41NU266 (Ricklis 1995d; Warren
1993), and 41NU267, near 41NU266
(Ricklis 1995d), all along the lower Nue-
ces River and delta; several sites on the
northern shore of Nueces Bay (41SP15,
41SP136, 41SP148, 41SP153, and
41SP156 [Ricklis 1993a; Ricklis and Cox
1991]); one site (41KL71) on the north
shore of Bafﬁn Bay (H. Smith 1984); an
early component at 41SP120 on Ingleside
Cove (Ricklis 1993a); and the basal shell
stratum at 41JK24, overlooking the
Lavaca River delta (Weinstein 1994).

All components of this period are once

again more or less thin (5- to 25-cm
thick) shell deposits, usually consisting of
oyster (though brackish-water Rangia ﬂex-
uosa shells predominate in what were
probably more river-inﬂuenced areas at
41NU184 and 41NU221). Artifacts are
not abundant, and some sites have pro-
duced only shells and occasional chert
ﬂakes and ﬁsh otoliths. However, there is
some variability in both thickness of de-

posits and density of artifacts, which sug-
gests an as yet poorly understood, corre-
sponding variability in the intensity
and/or duration of occupations along
the central coast. At the McKinzie site
(41NU221), for example, a fairly ex-
tensive and relatively thick (15 –20 cm)
shell deposit, with three radiocarbon age
ranges falling between 5919 and 5336 b.p.,
yielded hundreds of chert ﬂakes, utilized
ﬂakes, a chert end-side scraper, and ﬁve
chert dart points (two Bell, one early
triangular, one Tortugas, and one un-
stemmed, rounded-base form). This com-
ponent also produced two shell imple-
ments, one a perforated oyster shell, the
other an edge-modiﬁed oyster shell (Rick-
lis 1988).

Although relatively extensive excava-
tion (24 m2 in units) at the Means site
(41NU184) produced only chert deb-
itage, at least a dozen early triangular dart
points (see E. Turner and Hester 1993)
have been collected from the surface of
that part of the site where a dense Rangia
ﬂexuosa midden was exposed by cultiva-
tion. This site also produced a post mold
pattern representing a small arc-shaped

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

hut wall or windbreak, 3.2 m across
(Ricklis and Gunter 1986). A cluster of
Rangia ﬂexuosa, possibly associated with
the structure, yielded a corrected and cali-
brated age range of 5592 –5325 b.p.

Several artifacts, in addition to chert
debitage, were recovered from a discrete
shell stratum at 41SP156 on the north
shore of Nueces Bay (Ricklis 1993a), with
age ranges spanning the time interval be-
tween 5592 and 4614 b.p. A Gower point
from this stratum, mentioned above, may
predate the dated shell deposit, although
its position securely embedded within
dense shell suggests it was (re)used by the
people responsible for deposition of the
shells. The distinctive barb section of an
Andice point (see Fig. 5.5f ) probably
pertains to this stratum; while it was
found on the surface of a machine cut
that transected the site, it appeared to
have eroded from the dated shell stratum.
Chert debitage and an early triangular
dart point (see Fig. 5.5h) were excavated
from deep colluvial soil at 41NU267,
near 41NU266 and the south shore of
Nueces Bay. The level that produced the
early triangular point also contained oys-
ter shells yielding a corrected and cali-
brated radiocarbon age range of 4986 –
4862 b.p. (Ricklis 1995d). Finally, a
Bell dart point from the Swan Lake site
(41AS16), although collected from the
surface, is believed to have eroded from a
wave-reworked Early Archaic shell mid-
den at that site (Prewitt and Paine 1988;
Prewitt et al. 1987).

Limited subsistence data are available

for this time period. Fish otoliths have
been recovered from several site compo-
nents (41NU184, 41NU221, 41NU267,
41SP156, and 41SP148). Species repre-
sented are black drum (Pogonias cromis),
spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus),
redﬁsh (Sciaenops ocellata), Atlantic
croaker (Micropogon undulatus) and cat-
ﬁsh (Aureus felis?). Though estuarine ﬁsh
were not abundant at any site (the larg-
est, n$32, was from the McKinzie site
[41NU221]), it is clear that procuring
them was part of the subsistence econ-
omy by this time. Although relevant de-
posits are generally still too old to contain
preserved bone, it can be assumed that
hunting was carried out since dart points
are present. At 41NU267, faunal bone
was preserved within well-drained, collu-
vial ﬁne sand, and bones of ﬁsh, deer, and

05-A2946  4/13/04  11:59 AM  Page 165

OCCUPATION OF CENTR AL AND LOWER TEXAS C OAST / 165

rodents were recovered using ﬁne-mesh
screens (Ricklis 1995d).

There are some limited seasonality
data available for this period as well. Sea-
sonality analysis of oyster shells from sev-
eral sites on the north shore of Nueces
Bay suggests that most shellﬁsh gathering
took place in the winter through early
spring (Cox 1994; Cox and Cox 1993).
Since this time of year, when plant foods
were scarce and game was low in body
fat, would have been potentially stressful
for prehistoric hunter-gatherers, shellﬁsh
may have served as an important seasonal
backup source of calories and protein.
Seasonality analysis of ﬁsh otoliths from
the McKinzie site (Ricklis 1988) suggests
that ﬁshing was an activity primarily of
the fall through winter/early spring.

The increased number of sites during
this time interval may indicate an overall
growth in population, in keeping with a
postulated population increase in much
of Texas during the Archaic period (Story
1985). However, it should be noted that
most of the components of both Early
Archaic periods rest on an eroded Beau-
mont (Pleistocene) surface and that much
evidence for the earlier of the two periods
may simply have been removed by Early
to Middle Holocene erosion. Future geo-
archeological research, designed to place
occupations within the context of a dy-
namically changing terrestrial landscape,
will be required if we are to have a ﬁrm
understanding of long-term relative pop-
ulation trends in the region.

The Middle Archaic:
An Apparent Hiatus in
Shoreline Occupation

One of the striking characteristics of
the available radiocarbon data is a virtual
lack of dense shell deposits dating to the
interval between ca. 4200 and 3100 b.p.
(see Fig. 5.7). This dearth probably is not
the result of a sampling bias, since the
lack of dates is directly reﬂected in the ac-
tual physical stratigraphies at various sites,
where physical evidence for occupation
between strata dated to before 4200 b.p.
and after 3100 b.p. is not present. Occu-
pational strata have been identiﬁed within
intact, cumulic soil proﬁles at twenty-
three sites (producing a combined total of
forty-seven discrete, radiocarbon-dated
strata), yet no single component falls into

the time interval in question (see Table
5.2). The sole possible exception is a light
scatter of oyster shell at the bottom of
41SP177 on the north shore of Nueces
Bay, with oyster shells dated to an age
range of 3835 to 3643 b.p. (Ricklis 1993a,
36 – 44). However, the sparse shell rests
within a well-sorted massive deposit of
ﬁne sand that may represent an old beach-
line, since the site is within 1.2 m of mod-
ern sea level. Thus, the dated oyster shells
may have been deposited naturally. Even
if the shells represent human activity, oc-
cupation must have been quite ephem-
eral, judging by the absence of artifacts
and faunal bone, both of which are abun-
dant higher in the deposit, where far more
abundant oyster shell has yielded an age
range of 3156 to 2843 b.p.

Future research should be conducted
with an eye to locating components dat-
ing to between 4200 and 3100 b.p. How-
ever, even if such are found, the present
data base is sufﬁciently large to suggest
that they will be few relative to the nu-
merous site components dating earlier
and later in time. This time interval ap-
pears to have seen relatively little occupa-
tion of the shoreline, the ecological impli-
cations of which are discussed further on.

The Late Archaic,
ca. 3100 –950  B.P.

The beginning of the Late Archaic on
the central coast, as here deﬁned, corre-
sponds to the approximate time at which
sea level stabilized at its modern position,
ca. 3000 b.p. Beginning at about this
date, there is a continuous series of radio-
carbon-dated site components at shore-
line locations (see Tables 5.1 and 5.2 and
Fig. 5.7). Major sites are considerably
larger than the known sites of the Early
Archaic, have thicker middens, and yield
a greater range and quantity of artifacts,
all of which suggest more frequent and/or
intensive occupations than previously and
perhaps a higher regional population den-
sity as well.

There is evidence for a signiﬁcant in-

tensiﬁcation of estuarine resource use
during the two millennia of the Late Ar-
chaic, a trend probably keyed to increas-
ing biotic productivity in coastal estuar-
ies. Beginning ca. 3000 b.p., shellﬁsh
gathering appears to have become, once
again, a more or less important subsis-

tence activity. Faunal preservation is gen-
erally good for the Late Archaic, and it is
clear that ﬁshing was carried out, along
with hunting for game, especially white-
tailed deer. By ca. 2000 b.p., there was a
marked increase in the importance of
ﬁshing, as indicated by dramatic increases
in the numbers of ﬁsh otoliths and bones
per unit volume of midden deposit.

The largest investigated sites of the
Late Archaic are located near the sea-
ward ends of bays. The Kent-Crane site
(41AS3), on the southern margin of Co-
pano Bay (see Fig. 5.2), extends along the
top of a shoreline bluff for nearly one
kilometer. This site consists of a massive
and dense shell midden containing shells
of a variety of moderate-to-high salinity
mollusks; the most common species are
oyster, scallop, sunray venus (Macrocallista
nimbosa), quahog (Mercenaria campechen-
sis), and lightning whelk. At the time of
the site’s original excavation in the early
1940s, the midden was in places as much
as 1.8 m thick (Campbell 1952). During
more recent testing, a sample of quahog
shell was extracted from the base of the
midden for radiocarbon dating. This test
produced an uncorrected age of 2210 !
60 years (Cox and Smith 1989), which
corrects and calibrates to a 1-sigma age
range of 2773 to 2740 b.p. (Ricklis and
Cox 1991). Since this dates the very
bottom of the midden, it can be postu-
lated that the site saw initial occupation
at this time.

The Mustang Lake Site (41CL3; see

Fig. 5.2) is situated on the mainland
shore of Mustang Lake, a small lagoon
separated from San Antonio Bay by Late
Holocene spit accretion under conditions
of modern, stable sea level. Survey and
testing here (Ricklis 1994b) showed that
a dense oyster shell midden extended
along the shoreline for approximately two
kilometers. Testing under the author’s di-
rection in 1988 and again in 1994 re-
vealed a very dense shell deposit with a
thickness of 1.3 m. Shell, bone, and lithic
artifacts were found throughout the de-
posit, but sandy-paste pottery sherds were
present only in the top 20 cm. A radio-
carbon date from the base of the midden
indicates that initial occupation began at
the same time as at Kent-Crane: shells
from the basal level produced an age
range of 2764 to 2727 b.p. Four other ra-

OCCUPATION OF CENTR AL AND LOWER TEXAS C OAST / 167

usually at depths ranging between 30 and
80 cm, are dense shell midden deposits
that, on the basis of radiocarbon assays,
place the main Late Archaic occupation
in the ﬁrst millennium a.d. (see Table
5.2). The terminal Archaic, represented
by a stratigraphically discrete deposit of
particularly dense shell at 41SP120, is se-
curely dated to ca. 950 b.p. (a.d. 1000)
on the basis of seven radiocarbon assays
(three charcoal and four shell) with
1-sigma age ranges spanning the time in-
terval between 1161 and 743 b.p. (and
with six of the seven calibrated intercept
points clustering tightly between 943 and
915 b.p.). Four Late Archaic dart points

(two Catan and two Matamoros) were
found resting within the dated deposit
(Fig. 5.10); arrow points were absent.

Subsistence patterns during the Late
Archaic involved a dramatic increase in
ﬁshing ca. 2000 b.p. This trend is best
indicated by the relative abundance of
otoliths in midden deposits, since otoliths
are resistant to decay under most condi-
tions and thus will not be underrepre-
sented for early time periods. As may be
seen in Fig. 5.11, the numbers of otoliths
per cubic meter of excavated deposit in
the Corpus Christi Bay area shows a dra-
matic increase after ca. 2000 b.p. Simi-
larly, in the thick midden at Mustang

Fig. 5.11. Bar graph showing numbers of ﬁsh otoliths per cubic meter of excavated site deposit,
from sites on Nueces and Corpus Christi Bays. Note the dramatic increase in abundance after
ca. 2000 B.P.

excavation levels show that the midden
continued to accumulate at a more or less
constant rate until at least ca. 1400 b.p.
(Fig. 5.8). However, the presence of a
Scallorn arrow point in the 10- to 20-cm
level suggests that occupation actually
continued somewhat later, since the type
dates to ca. 1250 – 600 b.p. in Texas (Pre-
witt 1981, 1985; E. Turner and Hester
1993). The Scallorn point and sandy-
paste pottery sherds may have been asso-
ciated with Rangia cuneata clamshells,
which were most abundant in the top
10 cm and which are, as yet, undated.
One of the most extensive and pro-
ductive known locales of Late Archaic
occupation is at Ingleside Cove on the
northeastern shore of Corpus Christi Bay.
Two sites have been reported here: 41SP43
(Story 1968; Ricklis 1990, 1996) and
41SP120 (Ricklis 1988, 1990, 1993a,
1996). These sites (see Fig. 5.2) were ac-
tually parts of a single continuous cultural
deposit that extended for several hundred
meters along the top of the bluff over-
looking the shoreline, prior to segmenta-
tion by modern residential construction.
At both 41SP43 and 41SP120, dense
Late Archaic shell middens rest within a
ﬁne sand cumulic soil (Fig. 5.9). The
most abundant shell species are oyster,
scallop, lightning whelk, quahog, sunray
venus, and cross-barred venus (Chione
cancellata). Overlying the Late Archaic
shell deposits at both sites is an extensive
deposit of Late Prehistoric cultural mate-
rials. Fish bones and otoliths have been
found in profusion in both Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric components; the
most common species are black drum,
redﬁsh, spotted seatrout, and Atlantic
croaker. Also present are bones of white-
tailed deer and, less commonly, other
mammals and birds (see Ricklis 1990,
1996; Story 1968). A relatively long list
of radiocarbon dates (eight from 41SP43
and fourteen from 41SP120) clearly indi-
cates that the major occupation of the
sites began shortly after 2000 b.p.

The earliest evidence of Late Archaic

occupation at Ingleside Cove is repre-
sented by a thin but stratigraphically dis-
crete lens of oyster and quahog shell at
41SP120 (Ricklis and Cox 1991). This
lens was found near the base of the cu-
mulic sandy soil at a depth of 1 m, and
on quahog shells it produced a corrected
and calibrated radiocarbon age range of
3157 to 2948 b.p. Higher in the soil,

Lake on San Antonio Bay, otoliths show
by far the greatest abundance in the up-
per 60 cm; radiocarbon dating of shells
from the 55- to 60-cm level produced an
age range of 2303 –2052 b.p. (Fig. 5.12).
The increased economic importance of
ﬁshing at this time can probably be linked
to the emergence of the modern estuarine
environment. After the attainment of
modern stable sea level ca. 3000 b.p.,
continuous barrier islands formed, seem-
ingly reaching essentially their modern
conﬁguration ca. 2500 –2000 b.p. Con-
comitantly, broad back-barrier vegetated
shallows emerged, providing extensive
spawning and nursery grounds for the
economically important ﬁsh species that
have historically abounded in central
coast bays and lagoons (e.g., Lorrio and
Perret 1980; Matlock 1990; Perret et al.
1980; Reagan 1985; Sutter et al. 1986).
The emergence of such broad, vegetated
shallows led to the estuarine ﬁsh carrying
capacity increasing considerably, and hu-
man populations shifted to greater eco-
nomic focus on ﬁsh procurement.

There is some evidence to suggest that

major shoreline ﬁshing camps such as
41SP120 and Mustang Lake were most
intensively occupied during the fall
through winter/early spring as part of a
basic settlement pattern involving cool-
weather shoreline occupation and warm-
season riverine hunting camps. This pat-
tern, better documented for the Late
Prehistoric period, is discussed below.

The Late Archaic artifact assemblage
consists of a rather wide array of items of
stone, bone, and shell. Several types of
ﬂaked stone dart points pertain to the pe-
riod (Fig. 5.13). At the Kent-Crane site,
most dart points can be assigned to either
the Kent or Ensor types, and an examina-
tion of the information presented by
Campbell (1952) indicates that Kent
points are more commonly found in the
lower part of the midden, while Ensor
points are better represented in the upper
part. Since the base of the midden dates
to ca. 2700 b.p., the Kent points fall at
or somewhat later than that date. Kent
points (and one specimen each of the
Godley and Marcos types), were found
eroding from the oyster midden at
41SP177, which produced a calibrated
age range of 3156 –2873 b.p. The Ensor
points at Kent-Crane are presumably
contemporaneous with specimens from
central Texas, dated between ca. 1750

sible ﬂint-ﬂaking tools (see, e.g., Corbin
1963; Hester 1980b, 121). Bone pins
with engraved geometric designs are doc-
umented from several sites, including
Kent-Crane (Campbell 1952), 41SP120,
and 41CL3 (see Fig. 5.16b, c). Small cy-
lindrical bird bone beads are also part of
the assemblage.

There is clear evidence for the use of
basketry in the Late Archaic in the central
coast. Basketry-impressed burned clay
nodules have been recovered at the Tucker
site (41NU46) near Corpus Christi, from
a stratum with hearth charcoal dated to
ca. 3000 b.p. (H. Smith n.d.; three char-
coal dates from this stratum are listed in
Table 5.1, nos. 40 – 42). Fragments of as-
phaltum with basket impressions are re-
ported from the Johnson and Kent-Crane
sites on Copano Bay (Campbell 1947,
1952; Cox and Smith 1989), from the
Late Archaic midden at 41SP120 (Ricklis
1990), and from the preceramic levels of
the midden at Mustang Lake (Ricklis
1994b). In all cases, baskets appear to
have been woven using a basic twining
technique.

As a ﬁnal note concerning the Late Ar-
chaic, it should be mentioned that ceme-
teries are present, perhaps for the ﬁrst
time in the region. As discussed elsewhere
(Hall 1995a, 1995b; Story 1985), the use
of cemeteries may have accompanied the
emergence of well-deﬁned group territo-
ries, a systemic response to growing re-
gional population density. The cemeteries
known from the coast range in size from a
few clustered interments to large cemetery
sites containing the remains of hundreds
of individuals. Unfortunately, radiocarbon
dates are not available from cemeteries
that were clearly used by coastal popu-
lations; several dates were obtained on
burials at the Blue Bayou site (41VT94),
but stable isotope analysis on human
bone suggested that the population sub-
sisted on a noncoastal diet (Huebner and
Comuzzie 1992).

Limited bioarcheological analyses have
been carried out on skeletal samples from
the central coast. For Native Americans,
Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric populations
were relatively tall and robust (Comuzzie
et al. 1986; Powell 1989), which are physi-
cal characteristics generally attributed to
the Early Historic Karankawa Indians of
the region. An examination of skeletal
material from 41NU2 on Oso Bay at
Corpus Christi showed that approximately

Fig. 5.14. Whelk shell body whorl adze. Surface ﬁnd, north shore of Nueces Bay.

and 1400 b.p. (Prewitt 1981, 1985).
Small, thick, unstemmed dart points as-
signable to the Catan and Matamoros
types (see Fig. 5.9) are well dated to ca.
950 b.p. at 41SP120, and presumably
these types are representative of the ter-
minal Archaic period in the region. There
is no hard evidence to indicate, as some-
times suggested, that these types persisted
into the Late Prehistoric period. Other
lithic items (e.g., knives, scrapers, Clear
Fork gouges, and Olmos bifaces [see
E. Turner and Hester 1993]) are known
from probable Late Archaic contexts (e.g.,
Campbell 1947, 1952; Steele and Mokry
1985; Story 1968) but are never abun-
dant, most likely because shell was used as
a surrogate tool material at shoreline sites,
which were at considerable distances from
riverine chert sources (see discussion in
Ricklis and Cox 1993).

The shell tool industry during the Late

Archaic shows a fair degree of diversity.
Perforated oyster shells and edge-ﬂaked
sunray venus clamshell knives/scrapers,

documented for the Early Archaic, con-
tinued to be made. A range of conch shell
tools, on the other hand, seems to appear
only during the Late Archaic. (Early Ar-
chaic sites have yet to produce conch tools
or conch fragments that could be inter-
preted as tool-manufacturing debris.)
Adzes (Fig. 5.14) were manufactured
from body whorls of large lightning
whelks (see Mokry 1980). Bi-pointed
conch columellae, or central spires, are
quite common in Late Archaic deposits
(Campbell 1952; Ricklis 1990; Story
1968); these may be awls or perforators,
or perhaps they were used as ﬁshing gear
(i.e., spear points or gorges). Conch shells
were used as hammers (Fig. 5.15a), and
gouges (Figure 5.15b, c) were fashioned
from the stout columellae of large light-
ning whelks and Florida horse conches
(Pleuroploca gigantea).

Bone artifacts (Fig. 5.16) are well doc-
umented for the Late Archaic. Awls were
made from deer long-bone splinters and
ulnas; deer ulnas were also used as pos-

24 percent of the burial population had
suffered from endemic treponematosis,
a chronic condition that may have been
transmitted to such a large proportion
of the population during periods of sea-
sonal group aggregation ( Jackson et al.
1986).

The Late Prehistoric,
ca. 950 –250 B.P.
(A.D. 1000 –1700)

Several changes mark the beginning of
the Late Prehistoric period. As elsewhere
in Texas (Hester 1975b, 1980b; Prewitt
1981, 1985; D. Suhm et al. 1954), rela-
tively thick and heavy stone dart points
give way to light, thin arrow points, sig-
naling the replacement of the dart and
atlatl by the bow and arrow. Ceramics,
although possibly in very limited use in
the terminal Archaic (see Ricklis and Cox
1991), become common during this pe-
riod. On the basis of changes in major
artifact form/types, as well as probable
shifts in subsistence patterns, the Late Pre-
historic can be divided into two subperi-
ods (discussed below chronologically in
terms of calendar years, due to temporal
proximity to the Early Historic period).

The Initial Late Prehistoric,
A.D. 1000 –1250/1300

The beginning date for this period is
based on ﬁndings at 41SP120, where the
terminal Archaic is well dated to ca. a.d.
1000 and an initial Late Prehistoric com-
ponent has produced, from a discrete
stratigraphic unit, two dates on shells
with calibrated ages of 928 –738 and
926 –741 b.p., or a.d. 1022 –1212 and
a.d. 1024 –1209 (Ricklis 1993a, 51).
Profuse ﬁsh bones and otoliths were
found in association with the dated shells,
as were a number of triangular arrow
points morphologically assignable to the
Fresno type (Fig. 5.17; see D. Suhm
and Jelks 1962; E. Turner and Hester
1993). Scattered fragments of deer bone
indicate some importance for hunting
at this time.

In the northern part of the central
coast region, the side- or corner-notched
Scallorn arrow point type (Fig. 5.18d) ap-
pears to mark this time period. Scallorn
points have been recovered at Mustang
Lake (41CL3) (Ricklis 1994b) and 41CL2
(Weinstein 1992) in the San Antonio Bay

area and in abundance at the Kendrick’s
Hill site (41JK35; Weinstein 1994; Wein-
stein 1994, personal communication) and
the Anaqua site (41JK8; Story 1968),
both on the lower Lavaca River estuary.
At Anaqua, the Scallorn points were ap-
parently in association with plain, sandy-
paste pottery.

Ceramics seem to have undergone a

discernible, intraregional evolution.
Weinstein (1992, 94) suggests that plain,
sandy-paste pottery similar to the Goose
Creek ceramics of the upper Texas coast
are earlier than asphaltum-coated/deco-
rated ceramics. As already mentioned,
this kind of pottery was found by Story

(1968) at the Anaqua site in association
with Scallorn arrow points, so it presum-
ably is earlier than the asphaltum-treated
Rockport ceramics commonly associated
with the later Perdiz arrow point type. An
analysis of decoration attributes and sur-
face treatment of Rockport ceramics from
41SP120, according to depths within the
excavated deposit, suggested in a prelimi-
nary way that Rockport Black-on-Gray
decorated wares were somewhat later than
plain pottery and that the common ver-
tical “squiggle” designs found on Rock-
port pottery seem to have increased in
popularity with time (Ricklis 1990,
appendix A).

The Final Late Prehistoric,
ca. A.D. 1250/1300 –1700

Beginning around a.d. 1250 or 1300,
a distinctive artifact assemblage emerges
on the central coast. The diagnostic traits
of the assemblage are a lithic industry
consisting of arrow points, mainly of the
Perdiz type (Fig. 5.19), small unifacial
end scrapers, thin bifacial knives that are
sometimes alternately beveled, small elon-
gate chert drills, and a prismatic blade-

core technology (Fig. 5.20). Ceramics in-
clude bowls, jars, and constricted-neck
ollas, often coated and/or decorated with
asphaltum (Fig. 5.21d–h). Other kinds
of decoration include geometric incised
designs below rim exteriors (Rockport In-
cised [see Fig. 5.21a-b]) and lip modiﬁca-
tion in the form of neatly executed square
notches (Rockport Crenelated), which
give a crenelated effect to vessel rims (see
Fig. 5.21c). Examination of samples of

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

rimsherds from several sites (Ricklis 1990,
1995a) suggests that simple lip bands of
asphaltum are commonly found on bowls
and jars (Rockport Black-on-Gray I) and
that vertical wavy lines or squiggles are
commonly added to the exteriors of
small-mouth ollas and bottle-like vessels
(Rockport Black-on-Gray II; Fig. 5.22).
Cylindrical ceramic smoking pipes, some-
times bearing asphaltum decoration, are
also present. Additionally, Rockport phase
components have produced bone artifacts
such as points, awls, deer ulna ﬂaking
tools, and small cylindrical bird bone
beads. Shell tools include edge-ﬂaked
sunray venus clamshell knives/scrapers
and whelk shell adzes (Ricklis 1990).
Judging from the distribution of
Rockport pottery, the Rockport phase
can be geographically deﬁned with a fair
degree of accuracy. In a survey of the
Matagorda Bay and lower Colorado River
area, Gayle J. Fritz (1975) found that
Rockport ware sherds, with characteristic
asphaltum surface treatment, were com-
mon around Matagorda Bay but gave way
to plain sandy-paste and/or grog-tempered
ware, similar to the pottery of the upper
Texas coast, in the Colorado River delta
area. The southern limit of Rockport
ware is essentially the northern shore of
Bafﬁn Bay; several sites there have pro-
duced fairly abundant Rockport sherds,
whereas only a few sherds have been re-
ported from sites on the southern shore
of the bay (see Hester 1969a; H. Smith
1984). The inland extent of Rockport
pottery is only about forty kilometers
from the mainland shoreline. Sites farther
inland are invariably characterized by a
predominance of bone-tempered plain-
ware diagnostic of the inland Toyah phase
or horizon (e.g., the Berclair site in Go-
liad County [Hester and Parker 1970],
the Hinojosa site in Jim Wells County
[Black 1986], or the Burris site in Victo-
ria County [J. Huebner 1989, personal
communication]). Signiﬁcantly, a survey
along the Aransas River in northern San
Patricio County showed that Late Prehis-
toric sites with Rockport pottery, and
sites with predominantly bone-tempered
plainware, were both present at a point
about forty kilometers from the mainland
strandline. Similarly, at site 41RF21 in
Refugio County, also approximately forty
kilometers from the mainland shoreline,
both Rockport and Toyah components

were identiﬁed on the basis of spatially
discrete concentrations of Rockport and
bone-tempered plainware sherds (Ricklis
1989, 1990, 1996).

In terms of adaptive patterns, it is clear
that ﬁshing continued to be of major im-
portance during the Rockport phase, since
Rockport materials have been found in
association with abundant ﬁsh remains at
numerous sites (e.g., Ricklis 1988, 1990,
1996; H. Smith 1984; Story 1968; Wein-
stein 1992). Major ﬁshing camps are
found on the mainland shorelines of bays
and lagoons, as well as on the landward
sides of barrier islands. Fishing may have,
in fact, reached its greatest economic im-
portance at this time, judging by the peak
in ﬁsh otolith density at 41SP120 during
the Late Prehistoric (see Fig. 5.11).

It is perhaps signiﬁcant that no major,

dense shell middens have yet to be re-

ported for discrete Rockport phase com-
ponents. At both the 41SP120 and
41SP43 sites at Ingleside Cove, Rockport
phase middens were found to overlie Late
Archaic shell middens; the Rockport de-
posits contained abundant ﬁsh remains
and artifacts but only scattered shell de-
bris. Similarly, at 41CL2 on Guadalupe
Bay, abundant Rockport phase materials
were found to overlie an earlier, dense
shell midden (Weinstein 1992; Wein-
stein 1992, personal communication).
Major Rockport phase components have
been identiﬁed at the Kirchmeyer site
(41NU11) on Oso Bay (Headrick
1993) and at the Packery Channel site
(41NU219) at the north end of Padre
Island (Warren 1984; author’s personal
ﬁeld observations), where only scattered
shell debris is present. Hypothetically,
ﬁshing may have become sufﬁciently pro-

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

ductive to render shellﬁsh gathering a
very minor subsistence activity, a possibil-
ity that merits future investigation.

Around a.d. 1250/1300, bison hunt-
ing appears to have become a signiﬁcant
subsistence activity among central coast
groups, as it did in inland Texas. Numer-
ous small Rockport phase hunting camps
have been documented within about forty
kilometers of the mainland shoreline, pri-
marily along the uplands overlooking
stream valleys (e.g., Carlson et al. 1983;
Ricklis 1988, 1990, 1996). Fish and
shellﬁsh remains are generally scarce or
absent at these sites where the predomi-
nant faunal remains are bones of deer and
bison. Where faunal samples are adequate
for determination of the relative impor-
tance of various taxa, bison is found to
have provided the greatest bulk of usable
meat weight, with white-tailed deer as an
important secondary meat source (Ricklis
1990, 1996).

The repeated presence of Perdiz arrow
points with bison bone at Rockport phase
riverine camps (Ricklis 1990, 281–85)
suggests that these sites date to or after ca.
a.d. 1250/1300, the generally accepted
time of the appearance of the type across
much of Texas (L. Johnson 1994; Mal-
louf 1987; Prewitt 1981, 1985; Ricklis
and Collins 1994; E. Turner and Hester
1993). This inference is supported by
three radiocarbon dates from the Mellon
site (41RF21) situated on a tributary of
Copano Creek in Refugio County. Here,
dense deposits of bison and deer bone
(Fig. 5.23) were found in association with
Rockport ware pottery sherds and both
Perdiz and Scallorn arrow points (Ricklis
1989, 1990, 1996). Assays run on two
samples of bison bone and a sample of as-
sociated charcoal produced 1-sigma cali-
brated age ranges of 742 – 660, 768 – 675,
and 790 –576 b.p., or a.d. 1208 –90,
1182 –1275, and 1160 –1374. The re-
spective intercept points of the three dates
are a.d. 1267, 1252, and 1265. The fact
that both Scallorn and Perdiz arrow points
were found in close association with the
dated bones and charcoal suggests that
Perdiz points were quickly replacing the
older Scallorn type at this time.

In fact, the Rockport phase lithic as-
semblage (see Figs. 5.19 and 5.20) differs
little from that seen in the contemporane-
ous inland Toyah phase (Prewitt 1981) or
horizon (Black 1986). Perdiz is the pre-

OCCUPATION OF CENTR AL AND LOWER TEXAS C OAST / 175

tionally, it has been hypothesized that,
since the large shoreline sites are relatively
few and the small prairie-riverine sites are
more numerous, there was a seasonal ag-
gregation of population at major ﬁshing
camps and a spring-summer dispersal
into smaller groups at hunting camps
along the edges of stream valleys.

This pattern had signiﬁcant ecological

correlates (Ricklis 1988, 1990, 1992b,
1996). The largest economically impor-
tant ﬁsh species, redﬁsh and black drum,
tend to aggregate in large numbers during
their respective fall and winter/early
spring spawning seasons, thus providing
the kind of predictable and concentrated
food resources required to support rela-
tively large human groups. On the other
hand, by mid-spring, various plant spe-
cies found along stream ﬂoodplains and
upland prairies emerged as exploitable
food resources, and important game ani-
mals such as white-tailed deer and bison
increased rapidly in body weight and fat
content. Since many plant foods were
widely distributed across the landscape,
and since game tended to be mobile
and/or dispersed, the spring-summer
camps were probably occupied for rela-
tively short periods of time within more
or less highly mobile warm-season settle-
ment patterns. Available ethnohistoric
documentation appears to support these
inferences of seasonal settlement and re-
source-use strategies; archival sources sug-
gest that the Early Historic Karankawas
resided during the fall and winter in large
shoreline camps of four hundred to ﬁve
hundred or more people but camped
along stream courses during the spring
and summer, in bands averaging about
ﬁfty-ﬁve individuals (Ricklis 1990, 1992b,
1996).

Long-Term Environmental and
Human Adaptive Change
on the Central Coast

It is possible to construct a model of
long-term human response to a dynami-
cally evolving Holocene coastline. A strik-
ing aspect of the archeological chronology
is the clustering of radiocarbon dates
from shoreline sites into the three major
periods discussed above. As was seen in
Fig. 5.7, age ranges derived from strati-
graphically discrete occupation compo-
nents cluster between 7500 and 6800 b.p.,

Fig. 5.23. Concentration of bison and deer bone, Mellon site (41RF21), on branch of Copano

dominant arrow point type in both as-
semblages, and both assemblages contain
more or less abundant unifacial chert end
scrapers, bifacial (sometimes alternately
beveled) knives, and prismatic blades (see
Hester and Shafer 1975 for a discussion
of blade-core technology in the Rockport
phase). The only difference between the
two lithic assemblages is in the respective
forms of ﬂaked stone drills or perforators:
Toyah drills are made on ﬂakes or blades
in which the proximal end has an ex-
panded conﬁguration because it is left un-
worked, whereas Rockport phase drills,
although also made on ﬂakes or small
blades, are elongate or cylindrical in
shape. Blades and scrapers from Rockport
phase sites tend to be smaller than many
Toyah counterparts, but this differential
probably reﬂects the use of small-size raw
materials in a region with limited lithic
resources (see Ricklis and Cox 1993).
A similar diminution of lithic forms is
noted at the Toyah horizon Hinojosa site,
where the small size of stone tools is at-
tributed to a local scarcity of usable cherts
(Black 1986).

The available evidence strongly sug-
gests that Rockport phase people were
adopting most of the items of a wide-
spread lithic technological package at
about the same time it appeared across
much of Texas. This situation seems to
reﬂect a correlation between the appear-

ance of abundant bison on the coastal
prairies—part of a general and wide-
spread increase in bison populations in
Texas (see, e.g., Dillehay 1974; Huebner
1991)—and the adoption of a techno-
complex well suited to the procurement
of large game and the processing of meat
and hides (see Black 1986; Creel 1991b;
Hester 1975b; Mallouf 1987; Ricklis
1992a).

Settlement and subsistence patterns
during the Rockport phase involved, to
some signiﬁcant degree, shifting seasonal
emphases, with occupation of shoreline
ﬁshing camps during the fall through
winter/early spring and later spring
through summer residences at hunting
camps commonly situated along the up-
land margins of stream valleys (Ricklis
1988, 1990, 1992b, 1996). Seasonality
analyses of ﬁsh otoliths from large shore-
line sites (41NU11, 41SP43, 41SP120,
41CL3) place most ﬁsh deaths in the fall
through early spring, a pattern that ap-
pears to have emerged at least as far back
as the latter part of the Late Archaic. Sea-
sonality analyses of oyster and Rangia
cuneata shells also suggest winter or very
early spring occupations at 41SP120 and

5800 and 4200 b.p., and after 3100 b.p.
The absence of dated, clearly discrete
occupational components ca. 6800 –
5800 b.p. and 4200 –3100 b.p. suggest
two time intervals, each lasting about a
millennium, during which there was little
shoreline occupation, or at least a signiﬁ-
cant reduction of occupation to the ex-
tent that it is not clearly represented in
the current radiocarbon chronology. As-
suming that prehistoric peoples would ex-
ploit a rich estuarine environment when
and where it was available, we may infer
that the two intervals of reduced shore-
line occupation reﬂect a corresponding
reduction in the exploitable biomass of
central coast estuaries.

Estuaries are one of the most produc-
tive types of environments, rivaled in pri-
mary biotic productivity only by tropical
rainforests (Odum 1971; Whittaker
1975). They are, however, ecosystemi-
cally fragile, insofar as high primary pro-
ductivity and a rich food chain depend
on certain crucial conditions. High pho-
tosynthesis occurs in extensive, shallow,
sunlit waters with relatively low turbidity.
Extensive shallows are also crucial in that
they supply large amounts of organic nu-
trients through decay of aquatic vegeta-
tion and marsh plants (Odum et al. 1974).
When the geometry of shallow-water es-
tuaries is signiﬁcantly altered such that
the nutrient-rich shallows are destroyed
or greatly reduced in area, there are corre-
sponding negative effects on the biotic
productivity of the entire ecosystem. On
the Texas coast, for instance, artiﬁcial de-
struction of shoreline shallows has been
shown to reduce populations of shrimp—
a major primary consumer and an impor-
tant link in the estuarine food chain—
by 80 percent and more (Mock 1966).
Similarly, it has been documented that
destruction of shoreline salt marshes
through either draining or ﬂooding has
resulted in reductions of molluscan and
crustacean populations by as much as
90 percent (Cooper 1974). Inundation
of nutrient-rich brackish water marshes
by transgressive high-salinity waters has
severe detrimental effects on brackish
marsh ecosystems (Pezeshki et al. 1987).
In light of these basic principles of
estuarine ecology, it may be highly signiﬁ-
cant that the periods of relatively inten-
sive human shoreline occupation corre-

spond to postulated times of relatively
stable sea level during the Holocene
(Fig. 5.24). Under stable sea level condi-
tions, ongoing bay-bottom sedimentation
produces extensive shallows along bay
margins (see, e.g., Dalrymple et al. 1992),

of the sort conducive to high photosyn-
thesis and establishment of widespread
shoreline vegetation communities. At the
same time, deposition of river-borne sedi-
ments creates broad, prograding deltas
that support extensive and nutrient-rich

OCCUPATION OF CENTR AL AND LOWER TEXAS C OAST / 177

marshes. High photosynthesis rates and a
rich supply of organic nutrients support
high primary consumer populations (e.g.,
crustaceans, mollusks), which in turn
provide the ecological basis for a high ﬁsh
biomass. Additionally, the same vegetated
shallows that provide nutrients also offer
ideal conditions for ﬁsh spawning and
nursery grounds for economically impor-
tant species such as black drum, redﬁsh,
spotted seatrout, and Atlantic croaker
(Lorrio and Perret 1980; Perret et al.
1980; Matlock 1990; Reagan 1985; Sut-
ter et al. 1986).

During times of Holocene marine
transgression, when sea level may have
risen three meters or more per century
( J. Anderson and Thomas 1991), sea level
changes would have outpaced bay sedi-
mentation, greatly reducing the area of, if
not effectively destroying, critical shore-
line shallows and deltaic marshes. Overall
photosynthesis rates would have been re-
duced, both by a general deepening of
bay waters and by increased turbidity, as
protective barriers were breached and/or
submerged and bays became exposed to
high-energy wave action from the open
Gulf. Concomitantly, average salinities
would have increased as estuaries came
under greater marine inﬂuence, resulting
in reductions of economically important
low-to-moderate salinity mollusks (e.g.,
oysters, rangia). In short, the bays of the
Texas coast would have more nearly ap-
proached the biotic conditions of the
open ocean, which is well known to be
far less productive than protected shallow-
water estuaries (Odum 1971; Perlman
1980; Whittaker 1975).

There is general agreement that mod-

ern stable sea level was attained on the
Texas coast by ca. 3000 b.p., give or take
a few hundred years ( J. Anderson et al.
1992; L. Brown et al. 1976; Frazier 1974;
Paine 1991). It is almost certainly rele-
vant that the ﬁnal period of human shore-
line occupation and estuarine resource
use begins at this time, since modern sea
level stillstand resulted in the formation
of the continuous chain of barrier islands
and the extensive shallow-water environ-
ment, which has historically been a rich
in shellﬁsh and ﬁsh resources. As already
observed, the archeological data strongly
suggest a marked increase in ﬁshing
around 2000 b.p., which was probably an

adaptive response to increased ﬁsh bio-
mass made possible by the emergence of
highly extensive, protected shallows be-
hind the modern barriers.

There is also a growing body of geo-
logic evidence that suggests a period of
rapid sea level rise just prior to the estab-
lishment of the modern stillstand. Jeffrey
G. Paine has presented evidence for a
rapid rise to an approximately one-meter
highstand after ca. 4400 b.p. (Paine 1987,
1991; Prewitt and Paine 1988). Anderson
and others have posited a rapid sea level
rise ca. 4000 b.p., based largely on seismic
data from the Sabine-Trinity River paleo-
channel offshore from the present upper
Texas coastline ( J. Anderson et al. 1992;
Thomas and Anderson 1994). The tim-
ing of this period of rapid sea level rise
corresponds well with the hiatus in the
archeological chronology of shoreline oc-
cupation, from ca. 4200 to 3100 b.p.

Although the details of earlier Holo-
cene sea level rise remain less well deﬁned,
there is consensus among geological re-
searchers that marine transgression along
the Texas coast was a discontinuous, step-
wise process, with episodes of rapid rise
interrupted by periods of relative still-
stand, markedly slowed rise, or even slight
reversal ( J. Anderson et al. 1992; Curray
1960; Frazier 1974; H. Nelson and Bray
1970; Paine 1991; Thomas and Anderson
1994). It can be postulated, therefore, that
the major periods of Early Archaic occu-
pation, ca. 7500 to 6800 b.p. and 5800 to
4200 b.p., correspond to times of high es-
tuarine biotic productivity during periods
of stable sea level. The apparent hiatus in
occupation between ca. 6800 and 5800
b.p. may match a period of rapid sea level
rise, since some researchers have suggested
stillstand during the eighth millennium
b.p. followed by marine transgression
ca. 7000 to 6000 b.p. (Frazier 1974, as
modiﬁed by Paine 1991; see Fig. 5.24).

While ongoing interdisciplinary stud-
ies will help to better deﬁne the interrela-
tions between stepwise sea level rise, bi-
otic productivity, and human adaptation,
it is highly probable that the cultural his-
tory of the central coast region was keyed
to fundamental biophysical processes in-
herent in the dynamic evolution of the
Holocene coastline. The region’s suitabil-
ity for human occupation was seemingly
not a long-term constant but instead ﬂuc-

tuated in response to local and regional
changes that were linked to environmen-
tal change at the global scale (Ricklis and
Blum 1997).

The Lower Texas Coast

The lower Texas coast (see Fig. 5.1)
can be environmentally divided into two
major subareas. From the southern shore
of Bafﬁn Bay to the middle of Willacy
County, the coastal zone is part of the
south Texas sand sheet, an area in which
Pleistocene sediments of the Beaumont
Formation are blanketed with Holocene
sands, the result of surplus shoreline sand
deposition by prevailing southeasterly
winds. This area, which is characterized
by a hummocky terrain of stabilized sand
dunes supporting short grasses and mottes
of live oak (L. Brown et al. 1977), is vir-
tually unknown archeologically. A few
poorly documented sites are recorded
around ephemeral ponds; these have pro-
duced sparse, surface-collected materials
in the forms of scattered chert debitage,
occasional projectile points, lumps of
burned clay, marine shell fragments, and
rare pottery sherds (Bousman et al. 1990;
Hester 1969a; site ﬁles, Texas Archeologi-
cal Research Laboratory [TARL], the
University of Texas at Austin).

Paleoindian materials have been docu-
mented at the La Paloma Mammoth site
(41KN78), located in clayey sand allu-
vium of the ancient Palo Blanco River in
the northwestern part of the sand sheet
(R. Suhm 1980). Several dart points, in-
cluding one possibly ﬂuted lanceolate
specimen, were found in possible associa-
tion with bones of mammoth and Bison
antiquus. Three radiocarbon assays on
bone collagen and apatite fractions date
the animals to the tenth millennium b.p.
Unfortunately, the dart points were re-
covered from backbit piles, so direct asso-
ciation with the Pleistocene fauna is
problematic.

To the south of the sand sheet is the
Rio Grande deltaic plain, a dry, subtropi-
cal area that includes all of Cameron
County, southern Willacy County, and
eastern and southern Hidalgo County
(Fig. 5.25). Several physiographic zones
are included within the area. Geologi-
cally, the mainland comprises both Pleis-
tocene ﬂuvial-deltaic sediments and Ho-

locene ﬂuvial-deltaic sediments deposited
at the mouth of the Rio Grande. Upland
vegetation consists of various grasses,
prickly pear cactus, and clumps of mes-
quite, spiny hackberry, and other thorn-
brush species ( Johnston 1955, 1963).
The area is bounded on the south by the
Rio Grande and its modern ﬂoodplain
and delta. Prior to environmental alter-
ations associated with modern land-use
practices, the delta area supported exten-
sive ﬂuvial woodlands containing arboreal
species such as elm, ash, hackberry, mes-
quite, and palmetto palms. The mainland
strandline is a complex interdigitation of
Pleistocene and Holocene ﬂuvial-deltaic
sediments, clay dunes, and wind tidal
ﬂats. Eolian sedimentation during the
Holocene deposited the shoreline clay
dunes, many of which have been shown
to contain archeological deposits (Prewitt
1974a). Offshore is Padre Island, which
formed between ca. 3400 and 2000 b.p.,
subsequent to establishment of modern

sea level stillstand. The island is virtually
treeless and is characterized by stable and
active sand dunes. Between the mainland
and Padre Island is lower Laguna Madre,
a shallow-water lagoon rich in ﬁsh re-
sources. Because the Rio Grande dis-
charges from a prograded deltaic lobe di-
rectly into the Gulf of Mexico, lower
Laguna Madre receives little fresh water
through stream discharge, and thus tends
toward hypersalinity and supports little in
the way of economically useful shellﬁsh
species (L. Brown et al. 1980).

Archeological research in the delta area
was initiated in the ﬁrst half of the twen-
tieth century by A. E. Anderson, an avo-
cational archeologist who made extensive
surface collections from more than 350
sites in Cameron and Willacy Counties
(Anderson 1932; notes and collections on
ﬁle at TARL). Anderson’s collections are a
remarkable record of prehistoric material
culture in the area and contain numerous
small triangular and subtriangular dart

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

and arrow points, tiny circular unifaces
and bifacially ﬂaked pin-like drills, a wide
range of shell tools and ornaments, and
pottery sherds from the Huastecan area
of northeastern Mexico. The Huastecan
sherds are few in number relative to the
size of the collection and probably repre-
sent some sort of exchange between local
folk and people living to the south in the
Huasteca (Campbell 1960; MacNeish
1958; Mason 1935; Hester 1980b, 160).
The abundant shell artifacts include conch
adzes and columella gouges, edge-ﬂaked
sunray venus clamshells, and various bead
and pendant forms made from conch col-
umellae and body whorl sections.

Based upon examination of Anderson’s

collection, E. B. Sayles (1935) assigned
archeological materials from the delta area
to the Brownsville phase, which he char-
acterized as a coastal cultural expression
with a specialized shell industry. Later,
R. S. MacNeish (1958) suggested a sepa-
rate designation, the Barril Complex, for
relatively late cultural materials immedi-
ately to the south in northeastern Tamau-
lipas. He also suggested that both the
Brownsville and Barril Complexes were
preceded by an aceramic Repelo Complex,
though he believed the latter to be better
represented south of the Rio Grande.

The Brownsville Complex, which may
pertain largely to the Late Prehistoric pe-
riod, ca. a.d. 1000 and later (Hester
1980b, 160), is apparently conﬁned to
the area of the Rio Grande delta (e.g.,
Cameron and Starr Counties). The com-
plex is marked by the aforementioned
shell assemblage, small lithic tools, and
unstemmed arrow point types (see
E. Turner and Hester 1993). Discrete
cemeteries are known for the Brownsville
Complex (Hester 1969b, 1980b).

Little is known of the antecedents of
the Brownsville Complex (G. Bailey 1990;
Day et al. 1981; Mallouf et al. 1977).
Numerous sites have been documented in
Cameron and southern Willacy Counties,
and many have produced a few lithic arti-
facts, including an occasional triangular
or subtriangular dart point. Radiocarbon
dates from discrete occupation compo-
nents are scarce, however. In part, this
scarcity probably reﬂects the sparse nature
of cultural debris on most of the investi-
gated sites, but it is presumably also due
to a lack of hearth charcoal and a general
dearth of other datable organic material

such as shell. Several dates are reported
by Gail L. Bailey and C. Britt Bousman
(1990) from sites along a major west-to-
east trending drainage ditch in Hidalgo
and Willacy Counties. At 41HG128,
chert ﬂakes were recovered in possible
association with Late Prehistoric char-
coal ranging in age from 480 to 120 b.p.
A human burial at 41WY113 produced
a date of 1088 b.p. on bone collagen,
and most of the artifacts at the site ap-
parently date to after 1260 b.p. (Bousman
et al. 1990, 138 –39). Collins, Hall, and
Bousman (1989a) reported much older
dates of 3622 b.p. and 3215 b.p. from
41HG118 near the inland margin of the
greater delta area; assays were run on the
organic fraction of Holocene cumulic
soils that were believed to be contempo-
raneous with nondiagnostic cultural ma-
terials. These researchers point out the
potential of dates derived from soils in
an area nearly devoid of other datable
materials. Finally, testing at the Horse
Island site (41CF29) on the lower Laguna
Madre mainland shoreline resulted in the
recovery of a human burial that produced
a 1-sigma calibrated age range of 1352 –
1261 b.p. on human bone (Eling et al.
1993).

The poor understanding of areal chro-
nology is matched by a general lack of in-
sight into synchronic patterns of prehis-
toric resource use and settlement patterns.
Although various researchers have noted
that sites are situated in different topo-
graphical settings and environmental
zones (Bousman et al. 1990; Mallouf et al.
1977; Prewitt 1974a), the relatively small
number of excavations and only sparse
data on subsistence and seasonality pro-
vide little empirical basis for inferences
concerning intraregional variations in sub-
sistence activities at different sites within
different ecological zones. It seems clear
from the available ethnohistorical data
that the native peoples of the delta area
subsisted by hunting, plant gathering, and
ﬁshing (Salinas 1990), and there is noth-
ing in the known archeological record to
suggest otherwise. Thus, it can be assumed
that prehistoric groups were more or less
mobile, establishing temporary/seasonal
camps with proximity to economically
useful resources.

Steve A. Tomka and Britt Bousman
(1990) identiﬁed several resource zones
within the area (see Fig. 5.25) and ranked

them according to biotic productivity.
These different zones are the Rio Grande
ﬂoodplain and delta, the coast, the low-
land plain, the upland plain, and the sand
sheet. Since these zones are based primar-
ily on assumed productivity, they differ in
some ways from earlier sets of environ-
mental zones based largely on geomor-
phic criteria (Day et al. 1981; G. Hall
et al. 1987; Mallouf et al. 1977).

Tomka (1990) has suggested that dif-

ferent resource zones would have seen
variable intensity of occupation according
to the spatial concentration and pre-
dictability of biotic resources. He presents
three alternative models of prehistoric
land use, based on assumptions that (a)
hunter-gatherers in the area were more or
less highly mobile in their settlement and
subsistence patterns and (b) resource
zones would have been used according to
the optimal availability of highly ranked
food resources. Tomka further suggested
that mobility would have operated within
one of three hypothetical patterns of
group territoriality, as follows:

1. Groups moved about within a single
large territory. In this model, intra-areal ter-
ritorial boundaries did not exist; people
moved throughout the Rio Grande deltaic
plain with free access to any of the several
resource zones.

2. Rio Grande territorial groups. Here,
each of several groups operated within its
own territory. Territories were elongate and
parallel and ran north-south, and each pro-
vided direct access to the Rio Grande ﬂood-
plain along its southern edge. Only the
easternmost territory provided access to
the coast.

3. Coastal territorial groups. Again, there

were several parallel, elongate territories,
but in this case they ran east-west, so that
each provided free access to the coast. Only
the southernmost territory included the
Rio Grande and its wooded ﬂoodplain
and delta.

Tomka and Bousman (1990) at-
tempted to test the three models using
lithic data from sites in three (sand sheet,
upland plain, and lowland plain) of the
ﬁve resource zones. They based their
analyses on twelve lithic artifact catego-
ries, which they postulated would be dif-
ferentially distributed within the region
according to patterns of lithic material

transport that reﬂected movement of
goods and people according to one or an-
other of the territoriality models. The
working assumption was that, since lithic
raw material sources were found only on
the upland plain at the inland margin of
the delta region, the kinds of lithics on
sites in different locales would have to
reﬂect established mobility patterns, since
raw material would have been unavailable
in most places. Each of the twelve lithic
categories was assigned an expected value
for a given resource zone, and its actual
representation at a site was then deter-
mined to be greater or less than the ex-
pected value. Ideally, one of the three ter-
ritorial models would be supported when
the actual values matched those predicted
according to the spatial parameters of the
model.

None of the spatial models was either
clearly conﬁrmed or negated by the lithic
data, however, suggesting that either (a)
none of the territorial models reﬂect the
actual spatial organization of prehistoric
adaptive patterns, or (b) the distribution
of lithic materials is not a reliable indica-
tor of prehistoric patterns of settlement
and biotic resource procurement. It may
be relevant to note that the distributions
of lithic artifacts on Late Prehistoric sites
along the central Texas coast do not con-
form in a patterned way to basic settle-
ment and subsistence patterns as deﬁned
on the basis of independent criteria; the
movement of lithic materials through the
system apparently did not depend on
the mobility patterns involved in the pro-
curement of biotic subsistence resources
(Ricklis and Cox 1993).

Regardless of the utility of lithic analy-
ses for deﬁning patterns of biotic resource
procurement, the environmental zones
deﬁned by Tomka and Bousman may
eventually provide the most useful basis
for elucidating prehistoric subsistence and
settlement patterns. Deﬁning these basic
patterns in the Rio Grande delta area will
depend upon the acquisition of data on
subsistence and seasonality from a num-
ber of sites within each resource zone.

Research ﬁndings at the Horse Island

site (41CF29) on the Laguna Madre
mainland shoreline (Eling et al. 1993)
suggest that analyses of marine ﬁsh oto-
liths can provide crucial information on
the seasonality of ﬁshing on the lower
coast. Eling examined one hundred black

drum otoliths from test excavations at the
site and found that most ﬁsh died during
the late fall through spring. Relatively
little ﬁshing seems to have taken place
during the summer/early fall part of the
annual cycle. More data from other sites
in the area will be needed to determine
if this was a recurrent seasonal pattern
along the lower coast. It is interesting that
Early Historic Spanish documents suggest
that native peoples in northern Tamauli-
pas engaged in ﬁshing mainly during the
winter, when inland plant resources were
minimal in terms of seasonal productivity
(Salinas 1990, 117). Additional archeo-
logical seasonality studies may show that
coastal ﬁshing was an important winter
subsistence focus, as it apparently was to
the north along the central Texas coast.
Another point that emerges from
ethnohistorical research is that the Rio
Grande delta was a rich biotic zone that
supported a relatively high human popu-
lation density. Even as late as the middle
of the eighteenth century, after native
populations had generally been reduced
by Old World epidemic diseases, the area
may have been home to as many as ﬁfteen
thousand people (Salinas 1990, 138). It
remains to be determined whether indige-
nous populations were as highly mobile
as assumed by Tomka (1990) or whether
the rich resource zones of the delta proper
and the Rio Grande and its ﬂoodplain
woodlands, along with the productive
ﬁsheries of lower Laguna Madre, sustained
relatively large groups for signiﬁcantly

180 / COASTAL GROUPS

long segments of the annual cycle. Con-
ceivably, populations may have aggregated
seasonally during the cooler months in
these zones and then dispersed into
smaller bands to gather plant foods and
hunt during the summer, as suggested by
the very limited ethnohistorical data.

Sites in Cameron County tend to ex-

hibit higher densities of cultural debris
than sites situated farther from the Rio
Grande delta (M. Collins 1990, personal
communication). It may be that most
professionally investigated sites show low
densities of material and thus suggest rel-
atively short-term occupations by highly
mobile groups only because they are lo-
cated in marginal areas that have fortu-
itously been investigated within the
framework of cultural resource manage-
ment projects (e.g., the various sites re-
ported in inland Willacy and Hidalgo
Counties along artiﬁcial drainage ditches
[see Bousman et al. 1990; M. Collins
et al. 1989a; Day et al. 1981]). Indeed,
Hester (1969b, 163) has suggested that
sizable cemeteries in the southern part
of the region, in proximity to the Rio
Grande, may represent coastal-riverine
occupations by groups that practiced only
limited mobility and buried their dead at
favored locations. Systematic investiga-
tions of sites in more highly productive
resource zones on the lower Texas coast
may then give a signiﬁcantly different pic-
ture of aboriginal adaptive patterns than
is currently available from the archeologi-
cal record of the region.

The Archeology of the Native American
Occupation of Southeast Texas

Robert A. Ricklis

The area of southeast Texas straddling
major environmental ecotones was occu-
pied by nonagricultural native populations
from Paleoindian times through the pe-
riod of early European contact. The cul-
ture history for coastal and inland south-
east Texas is reviewed here, with emphasis
on differences in prehistoric artifact as-
semblages in the context of long-term
environmental change and basic human-
ecological patterns of subsistence, settle-
ment, and demography. Attention is
devoted to recent key ﬁndings that signiﬁ-
cantly augment earlier regional overviews.
Generally, the currently available data sug-
gest that southeast Texas offers an archeo-
logical record of both intra-regional cul-
tural development and linkages with
developments in adjoining regions.

The Area and Scope of Interest

Southeast Texas includes the upper
Texas coast, from the Sabine River south-
westward to the Brazos River delta, as
well as the adjacent inland coastal plain
(Fig. 6.1). This environmentally diverse
area was home to hunting-and-gathering
populations from Paleoindian times up to
and into the Early Historic period of
Euro-American exploration and coloniza-
tion. The region straddles two broad eco-
tones: along a roughly east-west transect,
the vast woodlands of southeastern North
America give way to the more or less
open grassland prairies of the midconti-

nent; from north to south, the Gulf of
Mexico coastal zone presents a mosaic of
landforms, bays, lagoons, and riverine es-
tuaries that have broad salinity gradients
and a mix of low marshy areas that inter-
face with well-drained higher ground and
attendant variations in ﬂora.

The most detailed archeological work

in the area has been done in the coastal
zone, for which cultural chronologies and
models of long-term cultural and demo-
graphic change have been developed
(Ambler 1967, 1970, 1973; Aten 1983;
Patterson 1987, 1991a; Wheat 1953). In-
vestigations in the adjacent interior of
southeast Texas have been less successful
in deﬁning long-term cultural patterns, in
large part because work has been focused
on archeological sites with temporally
mixed deposits and also because investi-
gations have had less continuity in re-
search perspectives and goals. Thus, the
greater part of this chapter focuses on the
coastal zone, for which it is possible to of-
fer a fairly coherent summary of the pre-
historic cultural history.

This regional overview is by necessity
selective, given the quantity of archeolog-
ical data generated in recent decades.
Therefore, the approach here is to sum-
marize available information, with partic-
ular attention given to important ﬁndings
that postdate the detailed overviews of re-
gional research (Guy 1990) and prehis-
tory (Aten 1983; Story 1990) presented
elsewhere.

The Environment

The implicit theoretical perspective
here is human-ecological, insofar as cul-
tures are complex adaptive systems in
continuous interaction, via the human
ecosystem, with the temporal dynamics
and spatial variability of their environ-
ment. Southeast Texas is part of the
Western Gulf Coastal Plain (Fenneman
1938). The coastal zone is ﬂat, except for
incised stream channels and low stabilized
dunes, ridges, and swales fringing seaward
barrier island shorelines. Moving inland,
topography becomes slightly rolling, al-
though local relief is never great.

Except for localized Holocene eolian
and alluvial deposits, the surface geology
of the ﬂat coastal zone consists of broad
ﬂuvial deltaic sandy and silty clays of the
Pleistocene Beaumont Formation. The
ﬂat topography is broken only by local-
ized dune and ridge-and-swale formations
on barrier islands and by incised stream
valleys containing Holocene alluvium
and terminal Pleistocene silty clay alluvial
Deweyville terraces (Aten 1966; W. Fisher
et al. 1972). Moving inland, stream val-
leys are partly ﬁlled with Holocene allu-
vium, and numerous small natural sand
mounds occur on ﬂoodplains.

Climate is generally mild, with hot
summer months and cool-to-warm win-
ters. During the winter months, frequent
cold fronts move through the area, push-
ing temperatures to near or below freez-

182 / COASTAL GROUPS

ing. There is a signiﬁcant moisture gradi-
ent from east to west, so that the eastern
part of the area experiences an average
annual precipitation of ﬁfty-four inches,
while the western sector averages about
forty inches (Carr 1967).

Several major vegetation zones can
be identiﬁed in the region (see Fig. 6.1).
Along the coast, marsh plant communi-
ties occupy low-lying, inundated, or
poorly drained areas, while higher and
better-drained ground generally supports
shortgrasses. In river delta areas at the
mouths of major streams such as the
Brazos, San Jacinto, and Trinity Rivers,
brackish marshes interdigitate with water-
tolerant arboreal vegetation (e.g., cypress)
and in better-drained areas, with mixed
hardwood forests. On coastal uplands be-
tween streams and low-lying marshes are
extensive tallgrass coastal prairies. Farther
inland, the western part of the area is
characterized by upland oak savannas and
prairies on slightly rolling terrain. To the

east, the interior supports more or less
dense longleaf pine forest, along the west-
ern margin of the extensive southern U.S.
pine woodlands (Diamond et al. 1987).

The Texas coast is a low-relief coastline
marked by a series of shallow-water estu-
arine embayments. Like such areas else-
where, these estuaries are characterized by
high primary productivity (Odum 1971;
Whittaker 1975) that provided prehistoric
peoples with abundant and predictable
aquatic resources (see, e.g., Bernstein
1993; Perlman 1980; Yesner 1980). On
the upper Texas coast, major protected
bay/lagoon systems are Sabine Lake and
the Galveston Bay system with extensive
back-barrier lagoons and shallow, low-
salinity secondary bays. The open Gulf is
connected to the estuaries by a few nar-
row tidal passes, near which bay/lagoon
waters tend to have moderate-to-high
salinities. Toward river-inﬂuenced areas
with the bays, salinities are lower, so that
the estuaries are characterized by variable

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

salinities and corresponding changes in
ﬂoral and faunal biota according to the
salinity preferences of species.

A number of economically important

marine ﬁshes inhabit the estuaries, in-
cluding black drum, redﬁsh (or red drum),
seatrout, and sheepshead (Hoese and
Moore 1977; Shew et al. 1981). These
ﬁsh are tolerant of a wide range in salinity,
and their bones and otoliths have been
identiﬁed in archeological contexts from
the barrier islands inland to brackish wa-
ter deltaic areas. Also ranging throughout
the estuaries are gar ﬁsh, the prehistoric
exploitation of which is indicated by bones
and scales at shoreline sites throughout
the area.

The wooded ﬂoodplains from stream
mouths and farther inland are home to
various economically useful animals,
most notably white-tailed deer, as well as
various smaller mammals and reptiles.
Herds of antelope and bison roamed the
inland prairies in the western part of
southeast Texas in Late Prehistoric and
Early Historic times.

Patterns of
Paleoenvironmental Change

Recent research in southeast Texas and
nearby areas has highlighted two kinds of
fundamental, long-term environmental
changes, both of which probably have
signiﬁcant implications for understanding
human adaptations within the region.
Relevant to both inland and coastal areas
are major ﬂuctuations in climate. Impor-
tant for elucidating long-term patterns of
coastal settlement and estuarine resource
use is the evolution of the coastline dur-
ing the Holocene and concomitant shifts
in biotic productivity.

A Brief Overview of
Long-Term Climate Change

Although there is a dearth of informa-
tion from southeast Texas per se, studies
in neighboring areas suggest broad tem-
poral trends in climate. Since the south-
east Texas area straddles the transition
from moist eastern woodlands to the
drier prairies to the west, major past ﬂuc-
tuations in climate may have signiﬁcantly
affected the distributions of ﬂoral and
faunal resources within the region.

Extensive studies of fossil pollen from
the eastern United States indicate that in
terminal Pleistocene times, ca. 18,000 –

06-A2946  4/13/04  12:02 PM  Page 183

OCCUPATION OF SOUTHEAST TEXAS / 183

10,000 years b.p., generally moister and
cooler conditions than those of the pres-
ent prevailed in south-central North
America. Consequently, the eastern wood-
lands extended farther west than today,
and all of the southeastern part of present
Texas was within a broad belt of mixed
oak–hickory–southern pine forest. In-
creasing temperatures and aridity charac-
terized the Hypsithermal Interval of the
Middle Holocene, ca. 8000 – 4000 b.p.,
and open grasslands came to characterize
the central plains, with oak savannas
along the transition zone with the eastern
woodlands (Delcourt and Delcourt
1981).

Pollen data from east-central Texas
bog sites are in agreement with this gen-
eralized model and provide some infor-
mation on climate changes during the
later part of the Holocene. Michael B.
Collins and C. Britt Bousman (with Pert-
tula 1993) have synthesized pollen data
from Boriak and South Soefje bogs (from
Bryant 1969, 1977; Holloway and Bryant
1984; Holloway et al. 1987) to show a
generally high arboreal pollen between
ca. 17,000 and 8000 b.p., followed by a
signiﬁcant reduction in arboreal pollen
from 8000 to 5000/4000 b.p. and an in-
crease after ca. 4000 b.p. They interpret
these data to indicate a gradual shift to
drier climate during the Middle Holo-
cene and a return to relatively mesic con-
ditions in the Late Holocene. They also
cite stable isotope data from sediment
samples in the Jewett Mine area of east
Texas as generally supporting their in-
terpretation of the pollen data (M. Col-
lins and Bousman with Perttula 1993,
59 – 64).

From farther west in the central Texas

area, a variety of indicators tend to sup-
port the general model offered by M. Col-
lins and Bousman (1993). At Hall’s Cave
on the Edwards Plateau, faunal data, par-
ticularly the proportional changes be-
tween the least shrew and the desert
shrew, suggest a trend toward drier cli-
mate after ca. 8000 b.p., with a peak in
aridity around 5000 – 4000 b.p. and then
more mesic conditions by ca. 3000 b.p.
(see also M. Collins, chapter 3, this vol-
ume). Also for central Texas, LeRoy John-
son (1995) suggests on the basis of allu-
vial depositional sequences that the
climate was relatively dry between ca.
6000 and 3000 b.p.

It has yet to be determined to what ex-

tent these changes affected the relatively
moist region of most of southeast Texas.
However, recent ﬁndings at the Eagle’s
Ridge site (41CH252) in the Trinity
River delta area suggest a drier-than-
modern climate during the Middle Holo-
cene. At the base of a Late Holocene cu-
mulic soil of largely eolian origin Lee
Nordt and colleagues (1998) found a
weathered and eroded surface of a Late
Pleistocene Deweyville terrace, suggesting
reduced vegetation cover and presumably
drier conditions prior to a return to more
mesic conditions with increased ground
cover and a Late Holocene depositional
regime (Ricklis 1998a).

Holocene Sea Level Rise and the
Evolution of the Coastal Environment

During the Late Pleistocene, when sea
level was some one hundred meters below
its present position, southeast-ﬂowing
streams along the Texas coastal plain
downcut to create a series of subparallel
incised valleys. As global temperatures in-
creased after ca. 18,000 b.p., worldwide
glacial melting resulted in rapid sea level
rise. By ca. 9000 b.p. the coastal valleys
were inundated by marine waters to
form the precursors of the modern bays
(L. Brown et al. 1976; Byrne 1975;
W. Fisher et al. 1972). Sea levels then
rose to approximately modern levels by
ca. 3500 –3000 b.p.

Recent global models of glacial melt-

ing and sea level rise suggest a gradual
pattern of the rise and approximation of
modern sea level by ca. 5000 b.p. (Tush-
ingham and Peltier 1991, 1992). How-
ever, detailed sea level curves must be
constructed at the regional scale, since
global models tend to mask interregional
variability (Fairbridge 1992). While eu-
static sea level change had to have been
globally uniform, regional geologic vari-
ables (i.e., hydroisostatic rebound and
coastal subsidence) resulted in differences
in the timing and rate of relative sea level
rise on speciﬁc coastlines.

For the northwest Gulf Coast, various
geologic studies have suggested that Ho-
locene sea level rise was discontinuous,
with episodes of rapid rise alternating
with periods of slow rise, stillstand, or
slight regression (Curray 1960; Frazier
1974; H. Nelson and Bray 1970; Paine
1987, 1991). More recent studies of seis-
mic and core data from Galveston Bay
and adjacent offshore areas conﬁrm the

earlier research, insofar as a stepwise, dis-
continuous rise is broken by intervals of
more or less stable sea level as indicated
by diagnostic bay/lagoon and offshore
sediment facies ( J. Anderson and Thomas
1991; J. Anderson et al. 1992; M. Thomas
and Anderson 1994). These ﬁndings can
be summarized to suggest the following
basic pattern of Holocene sea level change
(from M. Thomas and Anderson 1994):

1. Rapid sea level rise before 10,000 b.p.,

with a subsequent stillstand of uncertain
duration;

2. Resumed rapid rise to another still-

stand or period of slow rise between
ca. 8700 and 7000 b.p.;

3. Rapid rise after 7000 b.p., followed
by a mid-Holocene stillstand beginning by
ca. 6000 b.p.;

4. Before 3500/3000 b.p., rapid sea
level rise followed by attainment of modern
sea level.

For the central Texas coast, Jeffrey G.

Paine (1987, 1991) has posited an ap-
proximately one-meter highstand prior to
ﬁnal sea level stabilization in the Late Ho-
locene, based on radiocarbon-dated clay
dune sediments on the shoreline of Co-
pano Bay. Paine interprets the dated sedi-
ments to be currently at elevations too
high for active clay dune development,
meaning that sea level was somewhat
higher than modern mean sea level when
the dune sediments were deposited
through eolian transport of clay particles
from shoreline mud ﬂats. Since the sedi-
ments date to between ca. 5300 and
2600 b.p., Paine suggests that the postu-
lated highstand occurred sometime dur-
ing that interval, perhaps most likely after
ca. 4400 b.p. If this was the case, it may
be suggested that the highstand correlated
with the period of ﬁnal rapid sea level rise
suggested by the ﬁndings of J. John B.
Anderson and M. A. Thomas, sometime
prior to modern stillstand at ca. 3500/
3000 b.p.

Dated geologic sediments from the
Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66) on Galves-
ton Island provide relevant data that sup-
port the postulates of a mid-Holocene
stillstand followed by a sea level high-
stand prior to attainment of modern sea
level. A geologic cross section at this site
revealed deposits of water-worn estuarine
shell (oyster, scallop, whelk) and sand to
elevations of two to three meters above

modern mean sea level. The shell and
sand deposits were unconformably over-
lain by approximately sixty centimeters of
shell-free, organic-rich, eolian ﬁne sand
containing cultural materials dating to af-
ter ca. 2000 b.p. (Ricklis 1994a, 6 –9).
Two samples of estuarine shell were ra-
diocarbon dated (corrected for 13C /12C
and calibrated), with 1-sigma age ranges
falling between 5990 and 5300 b.p. Since
these shells were of common estuarine
(as opposed to high-salinity marine) spe-
cies, they suggest the existence of a mid-
Holocene estuarine environment with
protective barriers of the kind that would
develop during a period of stable sea level.
The subsequent redeposition of the shells
to form the highest core of Galveston Is-
land suggests a highstand. The shift to an
eolian depositional regime by the Late
Holocene is indicated by the eolian ﬁne
sand soil that caps the island core. The
lower ridge and swales seaward of the is-
land core provided a ready sediment
source for the ﬁne sand soil mantle, and
presumably they represent seaward accre-
tion under conditions of the slightly lower
modern sea level stillstand.

A provisional relative Holocene sea
level curve for the upper Texas coast is
presented in Fig. 6.2, the archeological
relevance of which is discussed later. Ac-
tual sea level elevations at any given time

are not shown because although core and
seismic data indicated deﬁnite depths be-
low modern sea level for facies associated
with Holocene stillstands, subsidence of
uncertain rates makes precise past sea
level positions difﬁcult to deﬁne.

Paleoindian Evidence
in Southeast Texas
(ca. 11,500 – 8000 B.P.)

Archeological excavation of a Paleo-
indian site has yet to be undertaken in
southeast Texas. Numerous Paleoindian
artifacts, particularly projectile points,
have been surface-collected in the region
(see L. Johnson 1989; Story 1990). Al-
though diagnostic points have also been
found in excavated contexts (e.g., Patter-
son 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953), these have
been mixed with materials of later (Ar-
chaic) periods.

The scattered ﬁnds include projectile
points representing both Early and Late
Paleoindian manifestations (see Bousman
et al., chapter 2, this volume). The earlier
ﬂuted point traditions are represented by
Clovis and Folsom points. Clovis speci-
mens, dated across much of North Amer-
ica to ca. 11,500 b.p., tend to occur along
major stream drainages. A number of
Clovis points have been found at the Mc-
Faddin Beach locality (Long 1977); al-

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

though this site is currently on the Gulf
shoreline east of Bolivar Peninsula, dur-
ing terminal Pleistocene times when sea
level was lower than today, it was situated
on a tributary stream drainage. Isolated
Folsom points have been recovered from
excavations at site 41WH19 in Wharton
County (Patterson et al. 1987) and at two
sites in Harris County (Patterson et al.
1987, 1990), while Larry Banks (1992)
reports a specimen from McFaddin Beach.
Later Paleoindian occupation is repre-
sented by ﬁnds of San Patrice and Scotts-
bluff points (L. Johnson 1989; Story
1990), again mostly along major streams.
In the more western part of southeast
Texas, Plainview and Angostura points
have been found (Patterson 1995).

Because no discrete Paleoindian com-
ponents have yet been found or investi-
gated within southeast Texas, little can be
concluded about adaptive patterns except
that they doubtless involved some mix of
hunting and gathering. The fact that most
recovered points are of high-grade lithic
materials that are scarce or absent in
southeast Texas suggests a widespread
movement of peoples and materials.
LeRoy Johnson (1989) has suggested that
deteriorating climatic conditions on the
Great Plains during the Early Holocene
prompted Paleoindian peoples to move
into the margins of the eastern woodlands,
where some degree of interaction and ac-
culturation took place between the new-
comers and resident Paleoindian groups.

The Archaic Stage in
Inland Southeast Texas
(ca. 8000 –1500 B.P.)

The Archaic in Texas is generally

deﬁned by pre- or nonhorticultural adap-
tations and pre-ceramic and pre–bow-
and- arrow hunting technologies (e.g.,
Hester 1980a; Prewitt 1981; D. Suhm
et al. 1954). Numerous Archaic sites have
been found in inland southeast Texas,
mainly along stream courses. Often mixed
with post-Archaic remains, the Archaic
components at these sites are represented
by various types of ﬂaked stone dart points
and other lithic tools.

Dee Ann Story (1990, 222) notes that

although there are some similarities be-
tween the dart point assemblages of south-
east Texas and more northerly part of east
Texas, there are enough differences to
suggest two distinct sequences. She points

06-A2946  4/13/04  12:02 PM  Page 185

OCCUPATION OF SOUTHEAST TEXAS / 185

to the absence in southeast Texas of Early
Archaic types such as Palmer, Johnson,
and side-notched points related to the
Graham Cave and Big Sandy types. Story
(1990) also notes that later central Texas
types such as Pedernales are sometimes
found in southeast Texas and that during
the Late Archaic, Kent and Gary types
predominate, which is not the case in
northeast Texas.

The very general outlines of a dart
point chronology have been worked out
for southeast Texas (Fig. 6.3). Story
(1990, 221–23) suggests that a typo-
logical cluster of expanded-stem types
dominates the Early Archaic (before

ca. 6000 b.p.); included in this group are
early side-notched and early stemmed
forms and corner-notched points of the
Keithville, Neches River, and Trinity
types (see also Ensor 1990). These are
followed by massively barbed points of
the Bell /Calf Creek series, as well as un-
stemmed Tortugas points and stemmed
Wells points. Leland W. Patterson (1995)
suggests that Bell /Calf Creek points are
found mainly within the prairie zone of
the central-to-western part of the region,
which accords with their general distribu-
tion from southern and central Texas
into Oklahoma and beyond (see, e.g.,
M. Collins 1994a, 90 –100).

Fig. 6.3. General dart point sequence of major types in southeast Texas.

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

A variety of Middle Archaic types is
reported from the area, including Yar-
brough, Bulverde, Travis, and, in the
western sector, Pedernales. The predomi-
nant Late Archaic types are Kent and
Gary, with Ensor and Godley points
common in the western reaches of south-
east Texas. It is generally thought that the
Kent form precedes that of the contract-
ing stem Gary, though the two types may
overlap chronologically (Ensor 1990; En-
sor and White 1998; Story 1990).

A general dearth of faunal and macro-
botanical remains at inland Archaic sites
precludes the drawing of inferences about
adaptive patterns beyond the assumption
of some mix of hunting-and-gathering
subsistence practices. A shift to the use of
poorer quality and more local lithic re-
sources in Late Archaic times suggests re-
duced group mobility and more tightly
deﬁned group territories (Story 1990).

Several Middle to Late Archaic ceme-

tery sites have been reported from the
coastal prairies in the western part of
southeast Texas. Most notable are the
large cemeteries at the Ernest Witte site
(41AU36) in the lower Brazos River
drainage, which contained two strati-
graphically distinct cemeteries, designated
Group 1 and Group 2 (G. Hall 1981).
The Group 1 cemetery, containing the
remains of sixty-one individuals, was the
earlier, with two uncalibrated (and per-
haps not entirely reliable) dates of 3270 !
70 b.p. and 4120 ! 100 b.p. on bone
apatite. Most burials were in extended
position, with heads oriented to the
southeast. Few burials contained grave
goods.

The Group 2 cemetery, of Late Ar-
chaic age, was considerably larger, con-
taining the remains of 145 individuals in
extended position with heads commonly
oriented to the northeast (G. Hall 1981).
Chronological control is weak, since only
two radiocarbon dates on human bone
apatite were obtained. The two dates, cor-
rected for 13C /12C, are 2470 ! 130 b.p.
and 1590 ! 80 b.p. These calibrate, fol-
lowing Stuiver and Reimer (1993), to
1-sigma age ranges of 2750 –2350 b.p. and
1550 –1360 b.p. Grant D. Hall (1981, 53)
deemed the later date to best represent the
age of the cemetery, based on the pres-
ence of Fairland and Ensor dart points in
graves. However, the points were not
abundant, and the large number of buri-
als and the fact that some intruded into

06-A2946  4/13/04  12:02 PM  Page 186

others suggest long-term use of the locale,
as noted by Story (1990, 240).

A wide array of grave goods was pres-
ent with the Group 2 interments. Lithics
included dart points, corner-tanged
knives, groundstone “boat stones” and a
gorget, bone (hair?) pins, and conch shell
beads and pendants. The distributions of
offerings according to age and sex suggest
an essentially egalitarian social organiza-
tion, though Hall (1981, 88) suggested
that a couple of burials with relatively
large amounts of goods might represent
high-status individuals.

Although Ernest Witte is the largest-
known Late Archaic cemetery in the area,
other cemeteries with grave goods and of
Late Archaic age have been documented
in the general area. These include the
Crestmont site in Wharton County (Ver-
non 1989), the Albert George site in Fort
Bend County, the Morhiss site and Blue
Bayou sites in Victoria County (G. Hall
1995a, 49 –50; Huebner and Comuzzie
1992), and the Goebel site in Austin
County (G. Hall 1995a, 52 –53).

Clearly, by Late Archaic times ceme-
teries were an integral part of cultural be-
havior along the inland margins of the
coastal prairie zone. Story (1985) has sug-
gested that the establishment of discrete
cemeteries served as expressions of group
territoriality in a systemic response to
regionally growing populations. Hall
(1995b) concurs and hypothesizes that
the ﬂoodplains of regional streams pro-
vided a superabundance of food resources
(e.g., nuts) that contributed to overall
population growth.

The Coastal Archaic
(ca. 5000 –2200 B.P.)

In his seminal work on the upper
Texas coast, Lawrence E. Aten (1983)
noted that intensive shoreline occupation
and resource extraction emerged with the
attainment of modern sea level stillstand
after ca. 4000 b.p. While this theory is
probably generally valid, subsequent ﬁnd-
ings suggest a longer history of coastal re-
source use in the area. Deposits of arche-
ological shell at site 41GV53 near Clear
Lake (a secondary bay connected with Gal-
veston Bay) have yielded mid-Holocene
radiocarbon ages (Hines 1992), and re-
cent ﬁndings at the Eagle’s Ridge site in
the Trinity River delta area have indicated

more or less intensive shellﬁsh (Rangia
cuneata, oyster) gathering by 4500 b.p. or
shortly thereafter (Ensor 1998a). Analyses
of rangia shells from cores slightly off-
shore suggest the presence of shell mid-
dens along now-submerged upland
stream margins, pointing to probable oc-
cupation of the Early Holocene coastal
margin (Gagliano 1977; Stright 1986,
1990). Given these ﬁndings, it is likely
that considerable evidence for Early to
Middle Holocene shoreline occupation
now rests under transgressive marine wa-
ters and later Holocene bay, estuarine,
and alluvial sediments.

The best evidence for relatively early
Archaic occupation comes from 41GV53
(Hines 1992) and the Eagle’s Ridge site
(Ensor 1995, 1998a). At 41GV53, four
discrete strata of rangia middens were
identiﬁed (Hines 1992; Howard et al.
1991). The uppermost shell stratum,
Zone B, contained artifacts and radiocar-
bon-dated rangia shells pertaining to the
Late Prehistoric period. The immediately
underlying Zone C was a relatively thick
shell midden radiocarbon dated to the
last millennium b.c. and containing Kent
dart points. The lowest two shell strata,
Zones D and E, yielded respective ages
(corrected for 13C /12C but uncalibrated)
of 3900 –3600 b.p. and 5000 – 4200 b.p.
(Hines 1992, 13 –14).

At Eagle’s Ridge extensive excavations
in a dense stratiﬁed shell midden resulted
in recovery of the most complete Archaic
sequence yet identiﬁed for the upper
Texas coast. Numerous small hearth fea-
tures and a large sample of artifacts rang-
ing in age from the Early Archaic through
the Early Ceramic period were found in
stratigraphic superposition (Ensor and
Ricklis 1998).

The site consists of an elongate, dense

shell midden (mostly Rangia cuneata,
but also some oyster) resting on the mar-
gin of a Deweyville terrace immediately
east of the Charlotte swamp. The site is
moderately large, covering an area of ap-
proximately six thousand square meters.
Testing (Ensor 1995) and subsequent
extensive excavation (Ensor and Ricklis
1998) revealed three major strata. Stra-
tum 1, 25 to 30 cm thick, was a dark
brown, organically enriched silty clay soil
devoid of shell. Abundant evidence of
Early Ceramic period occupation was
found in the lower part of Stratum 1.

Stratum 2 was a fairly thick (50 cm) shell
midden. At the central part of the site,
Stratum 2 was a single shell midden zone
with no discernible breaks. Around the
margins of the site, however, Stratum 2
was clearly separated into upper (Stratum
2-A) and lower (Stratum 2-C) parts, with
a thin (10 cm) intervening zone of shell-
free silty clay soil designated as Stratum
2-B. Stratum 2-C produced abundant
evidence of Middle Archaic occupation,
while Stratum 2-A contained Late Ar-
chaic materials. Although the two sub-
strata could not be discerned at the core
of the site, there was a clear break in the
kinds of artifacts found, indicating that
the Middle and Late Archaic components
were distinct across the entire site. The
underlying Pleistocene Deweyville terrace
clay was designated as Stratum 3. Late
Paleoindian as well as Early and Middle
Archaic materials were found on the sur-
face of Stratum 3, indicating long-term
deposition/accumulation of materials on
a stable or deﬂated surface.

The lower part of the Stratum 2 (and
2-C) shell midden produced a variety of
Middle Archaic dart point types, includ-
ing Yarbrough, Bulverde, Carrollton,
Morhiss, Palmillas, and Travis; Yarbrough
and Bulverde were the most common.
Other lithics include unifacial micro-
liths, small bifacial drills or perforators
(Fig. 6.4), cores, biface fragments, uti-
lized ﬂakes, and debitage (Ensor and
White 1998). In general the ﬂaked lithics
were of high-grade materials of extralocal
origin, most prominently Edwards chert.
Bone preservation was good throughout
Stratum 2, and bone artifacts from the
Middle Archaic zone include projectile
points (including the socketed deer meta-
podial form), awls, a rectangular imple-
ment (a gaming piece?), beads, and mis-
cellaneous pieces of cut or grooved bone
(Ensor 1998b). Shell artifacts include a
barrel-shaped conch columella bead, cut
rangia and gastropod shells, and perfo-
rated oyster and rangia valves (Ensor
1998b).

The upper part of Stratum 2 (includ-
ing 2-A), representing a Late Archaic oc-
cupation, produced a lithic assemblage in
marked contrast to that from the Middle
Archaic component. The preponderant
raw material was a poor-to-fair grade
siliciﬁed wood that probably originated in
stream gravels within the southeast Texas

over that for the earlier Archaic. Aten
(1983) has suggested a signiﬁcantly grow-
ing population by the end of the Archaic,
perhaps in part the result of new and more
efﬁcient extraction technologies such as
ﬁsh weirs (though empirical evidence for
such is lacking from the region). The sta-
bilization of sea level by ca. 3000 b.p. and
the attendant formation of extensive estu-
arine shallows behind emergent Late Ho-
locene barrier islands may have provided
the ecological basis for increased human
carrying capacity and population growth.

Holocene Evolution of the
Coastal Environment and
Human Shoreline Occupation
during the Archaic

Recent research on the central coast of
Texas has suggested that prehistoric occu-
pation of the shoreline zone and intensity
of estuarine resource procurement were
not long-term constants but rather ﬂuctu-
ated in response to ecological changes
linked to patterns of Holocene sea level
rise (Ricklis 1993a, 1995b, 1995d; Rick-
lis and Blum 1997; Ricklis and Cox
1991). Since eustatic sea level rise is a
uniform global phenomenon, it is reason-
able to expect that, within the limits of
local geologic variables, a similar long-
term pattern should also have been mani-
fest on the upper Texas coast.

On the basis of the corrected and cali-
brated radiocarbon ages from forty-seven
stratigraphically discrete shell midden
components on the central coast, three
major periods of shoreline occupation
have been suggested: ca. 7500 – 6800 b.p.,
ca. 5900 – 4200 b.p., and after ca. 3100
b.p. (Ricklis 1993a; Ricklis and Blum
1997; Ricklis and Cox 1991; see also
Ricklis, chapter 5, this volume). These
time intervals are separated by approxi-
mately one-thousand-year breaks in the
chronology of shell midden deposition
(ca. 6800 –5900 b.p. and 4200 –3100
b.p.), suggesting a signiﬁcant reduction
of shoreline occupation. Given that the
great majority of the central coast sites are
on uplands well above the elevation of
physical processes that would obscure or
remove evidence of occupation (e.g., in-
undation, shoreline sedimentation, or
erosion), it is unlikely that the chronolog-
ical hiatuses are the result of differential
preservation or visibility of sites.

area (see Ensor and White 1998, 334 –
36). The Late Archaic dart point assem-
blage (Ensor and White 1998) showed
remarkably little variability, consisting
mostly of specimens of the Kent type
along with a small number of Palmillas
points and, in the top few centimeters, a
few Gary points (possibly associated with
the earliest Ceramic period occupation at
the site). Late Archaic bone artifacts in-
clude awls, points, modiﬁed antler tines,
a bead, a drilled canine tooth, and pieces
of cut or grooved bone. Worked shell
consisted of a discoidal bead, cut rangia
valves, and perforated oyster and rangia
valves (Ensor 1998b).

Analysis of the abundant and well-
preserved faunal remains from Eagle’s
Ridge produced similar results in both
the Middle and Late Archaic samples.
White-tailed deer constituted the highest
percentage (80 percent or more) of the
animal biomass. Fish were second in im-
portance, though representing only about
10 percent of the biomass. Important es-
tuarine species include black drum, red-
ﬁsh, sheepshead, seatrout, mullet, and At-
lantic croaker. Various freshwater species
were also represented. The small remain-
der of the procured biomass was made up
of various other mammals and reptiles.
Unfortunately, these analyses did not ac-
count for shellﬁsh, so it is unclear precisely
what proportion of the meat diet com-
prised rangia and oyster. Judging by the
profusion of shells in Stratum 2, it is likely

that estuarine bivalves contributed signiﬁ-
cantly to the Middle and Late Archaic
diets at the site.

By Late Archaic times, after ca. 3000
b.p., there is abundant evidence for hu-
man occupation and estuarine resource
use on the upper Texas coast, particularly
in the Galveston Bay area. Numerous
rangia shell middens that date at least in
part to this period have been reported
(e.g., Ambler 1967, 1970; Aten 1983;
Aten et al. 1976; Dillehay 1975; Gadus
and Howard 1990; Gilmore 1974; Wein-
stein and Whelan 1987). Nearly all sites
are along the shores of secondary bays
or in the estuarine zones around river
mouths and delta areas. There is observ-
able variation in the size and thickness
of shell midden deposits, suggesting, as
noted by Tom Dillehay (1975), intersite
differences in group size and occupational
intensity. Clearly, estuarine resources
(ﬁsh, shellﬁsh) were signiﬁcant compo-
nents in the prehistoric subsistence econ-
omy, though the presence of terrestrial
mammal and reptile remains at most sites
indicated a mix of exploited resource
zones.

Because sites are considerably more
numerous for the Late Archaic than for
previous periods, a signiﬁcant population
growth has been suggested. Patterson
(1987, 1995) has noted that by Late Ar-
chaic times the number of recorded sites
in the coastal zone, relative to the lengths
of the time intervals involved, increases

188 / COASTAL GROUPS

Since estuarine resources tend to be
abundant, concentrated, and predictable,
and, especially in the case of shellﬁsh, eas-
ily procured, it is reasonable to assume
that the major breaks in occupation rep-
resent periods during which shoreline
zones were insufﬁciently productive to
sustain relatively intensive human occu-
pation. With this premise in mind, it has
been suggested that the periods of occu-
pation represent times of relatively stable
Holocene sea level, during which ongoing
bay sedimentation created broad estuarine
shallows with high photosynthetic pri-
mary productivity and abundant organic
nutrients from plant detritus generated by
shoreline marshes and shallow-water
grassﬂats (Ricklis 1993a; Ricklis and
Blum 1997; Ricklis and Cox 1991). In
turn, abundant organic detritus and phy-
toplankton provided the basis for a rich
food chain of primary and secondary
consumer populations (e.g., crustaceans,
molluscs, and ﬁsh). Such conditions are
generally recognized as the basis for rich
estuarine resources along shallow-relief
coastlines (see, e.g., Bernstein 1993;
Odum 1971) of the kind that tend to
support relatively high hunter-gatherer
population densities (see, e.g., Perlman
1980; Widmer 1988; Yesner 1980).

By contrast, the apparent hiatuses in
shoreline occupation likely correlate with
times of reduced biotic productivity. In
fact, as discussed earlier, recent geologic
research has suggested periods of unsta-
ble, rapidly rising sea level that approxi-
mate the timing of the hiatus in shoreline
occupation indicated for the central coast;
periods of stillstand are suggested for
ca. 8700 –7000 b.p., 6000 – 4000 b.p.,
and after 3500 b.p.; intervening episodes
of rapid sea level rise are placed after
ca. 7000 b.p. and after ca. 4000 b.p. Be-
cause the episodes of rapid rise correlated
temporally with breaks in shoreline occu-
pation, it can be posited that rapidly ris-
ing sea level negatively affected estuarine
ecosystems through the inundation of
shoreline shallows and the destruction or
signiﬁcant reduction of ecologically criti-
cal shallow-water marshes and grassﬂats.
It has been demonstrated that increased
salinities resulting from marine transgres-
sion have dramatic impacts on marshland
biota (Cooper 1974; Pezeshki et al. 1987),
and that destruction of shoreline shallows
virtually eliminates populations of pri-
mary consumers (such as shrimp) that

form important links in the estuarine
food chain (Mock 1966).

A review of the chronometric data for
shoreline shell midden sites in the Galves-
ton Bay area in fact indicates a temporal
hiatus in the fourth millennium b.p.,
with a resumed shoreline occupation by
ca. 3000 b.p. At 41GV53 (Hines 1993)
and at Eagle’s Ridge (41CH252), well-
dated occupational sequences show clear
breaks prior to 3000 b.p. These breaks are
shown in Fig. 6.5, which depicts the plots
of centroids for the corrected radiocarbon
ages from the two sites. The same hiatus
in the radiocarbon sequence is seen in the
collected radiocarbon data from the entire
Galveston Bay area, as shown in Fig. 6.6.
The great majority of radiocarbon dates

from the Galveston Bay area are derived
from assays on samples of Rangia cuneata
shell, since wood charcoal is generally
scarce in archeological deposits. Because
there is currently no ﬁrm consensus as to
how to adjust/calibrate rangia dates after
they have been corrected for 13C /12C,
Figs. 6.5 and 6.6 show the centroids of
the corrected dates without further ad-
justment. (In cases where published assay
results do not include the 13C /12C correc-
tion, a total of three hundred years has
been added to the uncorrected age, since
this ﬁgure closely approximates the aver-
age correction factor for numerous rangia
samples from various sites in the area [see
Ensor and Ricklis 1998; Gadus and How-
ard 1990; Weinstein 1991].)

Some archeologists in the area have

used a marine calibration for rangia

(Hines 1993; Kibler et al. 1996), while
others have employed a “freshwater” cor-
rection factor to adjust for the assumed
effect of inorganic carbon from dissolved
carbonates (Aten 1983; Ensor 1995),
both of which result in adjustments of
the corrected date toward the present by
two hundred or more years. I (in Ensor
and Ricklis 1998) have suggested that
these adjustments may be inappropriate,
since (a) rangia was gathered from shal-
low estuarine waters that were largely
isolated from marine upwelling of old
organic carbon; (b) the freshwater correc-
tion factor is only assumed and has not
been empirically tested; (c) most “paired”
shell-charcoal samples from the area that
purportedly show divergences between
ages of wood charcoal and ages of shell,
and that are the basis for estimating ma-
rine and freshwater corrections, come
from arbitrary excavation levels or gross
stratigraphic units and thus cannot be
shown to be associated within truly con-
temporaneous depositional contexts, and
(d) true paired samples from discrete con-
texts on the Texas coast (sealed lenses or
thin occupational zones rather than arbi-
trary levels or gross stratigraphic units)
have produced virtually identical ages,
once shell is corrected for 13C /12C (Rick-
lis 1994a, 1995b; Ricklis and Blum
1997). These factors strongly suggest that
an atmospheric calibration may in fact be
more appropriate, since shallow and pro-
tected estuaries, like smaller lakes (Stuiver
et al. 1986), may represent an essentially
atmospheric carbon reservoir.

OCCUPATION OF SOUTHEAST TEXAS / 189

provided the context for coastal adaptive
patterns during the post-Archaic or Ce-
ramic period.

The Ceramic Period

By deﬁnition, the Archaic period in
southeast Texas ends with the introduc-
tion of ceramics. It is generally accepted
that pottery ﬁrst appeared along the
coast around two thousand years ago
through diffusion of ceramic technology
from Louisiana and/or the Lower Mis-
sissippi Valley (Aten 1983, 1984; Shafer
1975a; Story 1990). The earliest upper
Texas coast pottery thus has a Tchefuncte
cast (see Aten 1983; Phillips 1970; Wein-
stein 1986), with thick vessel walls,
poorly wedged, contorted, and untem-
pered paste, and at least in some cases,
ﬂat bases. In inland southeast Texas, pot-
tery was introduced several centuries
later, probably disseminating from the
coastal zone where sandy-paste wares
of the Goose Creek series (Aten 1983;
D. Suhm and Jelks 1962) had come into
prominence.

While the earliest pottery serves as a
time marker and indicates extraregional
interaction and inﬂuence, and may also
have increased efﬁciency in food process-
ing (Aten 1983), there are currently no
indications of major changes in lifeways
during the Early Ceramic period. The re-
current presence of ceramic components
overlying earlier Archaic ones along bay-
shores and river drainages suggests funda-
mental continuities in settlement and sub-
sistence patterns (see Ambler 1967; Aten
1983; Aten et al. 1976; Ensor 1987, 1995;
Ensor and Carlson 1988; Gadus and
Howard 1990; Hines 1993; R. Moore
1994, 1995; Nash and Rogers 1992;
Weinstein and Whelan 1987; Wheat
1953).

Two perspectives have been articulated
to broadly deﬁne Ceramic period cultures
in southeast Texas. Shafer (1975a) and
Aten (1984) have suggested a general
afﬁliation with the Woodland cultures of
the eastern United States, noting that
pottery not only disseminated from that
direction but also retained various stylis-
tic attributes similar to pre-Mississippian
period ceramics of Louisiana and the
Lower Mississippi Valley. On the other
hand, Story (1990, 256) suggests that
southeast Texas is archeologically distinct,
with a fairly homogeneous ceramic

Fig. 6.6. Radiocarbon data (centroids corrected for 13C/12C and uncalibrated) from shoreline
shell midden sites in the Galveston Bay area (from Aten 1983; Ensor and Ricklis 1998; Gadus
and Howard 1990; Hines 1993; Weinstein 1991; Weinstein et al. 1989).

Until there is a better understanding
of shell midden site formation processes
that potentially mix noncontemporane-
ous shell and charcoal and until a large
number of clearly paired shell-charcoal
samples are available from the upper
Texas coast, there will be questions about
how to adjust shell dates. Sufﬁce it to say
at this point that, regardless of the kind of
adjustment used, the currently available
data appear to indicate a ﬁve-hundred-
year or more hiatus in shell midden depo-
sition during the fourth millennium b.p.

Judging from the data shown in

Fig. 6.6, the postulated occupational hia-
tus on the upper Texas coast was about
half the duration of that suggested for
the central coast. Localized differences
in estuarine sedimentation rates and the
geometry of estuarine basins may par-
tially account for this, since these factors
bear on the relation between changing sea
level and the extent of high-productivity

shallows. On the other hand, if the cor-
rected shell dates for the upper coast are
calibrated atmospherically, the temporal
hiatus there would fall between ca. 3900
and 3100 b.p., thus more nearly match-
ing that for the central coast. (Given the
timing of ﬂuctuations in atmospheric 14C,
corrected ages falling between 3000 and
2500 b.p. would change little when cali-
brated, while ages older than 3500 b.p.
would increase by several hundred years
or more [Stuiver and Reimer 1993].)
In any case, the currently available
data suggest a considerable time depth for
shoreline occupation and estuarine re-
source use on the upper Texas coast, with
a signiﬁcant break in the fourth millen-
nium b.p. As on the central coast, con-
tinuous occupation began with the estab-
lishment of relatively stable sea level and
essentially modern, high-productivity es-
tuaries by ca. 3000 b.p. At that time there
emerged the ecological conditions that

assemblage made up of sandy-paste (and
later, grog-tempered) vessels, a minority
of which were decorated with relatively
simple geometric incised motifs in narrow
bands under rim exteriors (thus diverging
from typically Woodland pottery with at-
tributes such as cordmarked surfaces,
cord-wrapped stick decoration, and in
Middle Woodland times, zoned stamp-
ing). Story (1990) has coined the term
Mossy Grove Tradition/Culture (Fig. 6.7)
to designate the Ceramic period in the
area and has noted its approximate geo-
graphic isomorphism with distinct ethnic
and linguistic groups of Early Historic
times (i.e., Attakapan-speaking Bidai,
Akokisa, and others [see Aten 1983;
Newcomb 1961]). Similarities through
time between pottery of the Mossy Grove
Tradition and coastal Louisiana, the Early
Historic home of the Attakapa proper,
certainly suggest a fundamental linkage
that supports Story’s model as a useful
heuristic framework.

The Ceramic Period on
the Upper Texas Coast

Aten (1983) has placed the appearance

of pottery in the Galveston Bay area at
ca. a.d. 100, based on radiocarbon-dated
rangia shell from site components of his
Clear Lake period, which he dates from
a.d. 100 to 425. He further suggests that
pottery appears by around 70 b.c. to the
east in the Sabine Lake area (at the mouth
of the Sabine River), based on a single ra-
diocarbon date on rangia shell.

The Clear Lake period is marked by
a mix of pottery types, including Tche-
functe Plain, occasional examples of
Tchefuncte Stamped (rocker stamped);
Mandeville Plain (Fig. 6.8); O’Neal
Plain, var. Conway; and Goose Creek
Plain, var. Anahuac. As mentioned above,
Tchefuncte ware is thick walled and ex-
hibits contorted paste; in the Galveston
Bay area, it lacks temper or signiﬁcant in-
clusions of sand and frequently exhibits
vertical or oblique ridge-and-furrow sur-
face treatment (see Fig. 6.8a, c). Mande-
ville Plain is the same as Tchefuncte Plain,
except that the paste is sandy, probably
due to natural sand inclusions in the clay.
Tchefuncte and Mandeville vessels were
simple jars or deep bowls, sometimes
with ﬂat bases (see Fig. 6.8b), but they
lack the four small feet often found in
Lower Mississippi Valley samples (see
Ellis and Ensor 1998; Phillips 1970,

163). Goose Creek Plain, var. unspeciﬁed,
which Aten places at the end of his Clear
Lake period and which later became the
predominant pottery type, is relatively
thin walled, with well-wedged, homoge-
neous sandy paste. Goose Creek Plain,
var. Anahuac, is an intermediate and
probably transitional type, exhibiting a
somewhat contorted paste and often
thick walls but generally being thinner
with better clay wedging than Mandeville
Plain (Aten 1983; Ellis and Ensor 1998;
Ensor 1995).

Ceramic Period Chronology

Aten (1983) has devised a series of
named periods that last between 225 and
350 years. Aten’s periods are deﬁned on
the basis of (a) changes in pottery types
or in the proportional representation of
types (see Aten’s discussion of typological
seriation [1983, 283]) and/or (b) the in-
troduction or disappearance of a few key
nonceramic artifact forms, such as sock-
eted bone points, arrow or dart points,
and small ﬂaked lithic drills (Table 6.1).

Galveston Bay area, this chronology is
suggested to have approximate correlates
to the east in the Sabine Lake area, to the
west around West Bay and the Brazos
River delta, and inland in the Conroe-
Livingston area (Aten 1983).

Aten’s chronology, particularly the seri-

ated changes in pottery, has been widely
employed as a means of temporally order-
ing sites on the upper Texas coast, but the
deﬁned periods are not particularly well

dated. Only nine site components in-
cluded in Aten’s seriation are radiocarbon
dated, and in all but one of these nine
cases the actual radiocarbon ages diverge
from the temporal placement in the seri-
ated sequence by several hundred years
(Fig. 6.9), which renders problematic the
time periods that last only two or three
centuries.

Also, more recent research has shown

that the key nonceramic traits used by

are from Aten (1983); radiocarbon dates are as presented by Aten, that is, they are adjusted to-
ward the present by 225 years for inferred effect of dissolved freshwater carbonates and not
calibrated.

Aten as time markers actually have far
longer time spans than was once appar-
ent. The socketed bone point (Fig. 6.10),
which Aten believed dropped out of use
in regional assemblages at the end of his
Mayes Island period, has been found in
contexts dating to his Turtle Bay and
Round Lake periods (Gadus et al. 1990),
as well as having been found in a Middle
Archaic context at the Eagle’s Ridge site
(Ensor 1998b). The small ﬂaked lithic
drill /perforator, suggested by Aten to be
a marker of the Turtle Bay and later peri-
ods, has recently been found in some
abundance in Middle and Late Archaic
zones at Eagle’s Ridge (Ensor and White
1998; see Fig. 6.4 herein).

Because in most cases the site-speciﬁc
radiocarbon data do not ﬁt well with the
placement of sites within the sequence of
named periods, and because time ranges
for key nonceramic traits are far longer
than the periods for which they were de-
ﬁned by Aten, there are clear problems in
dividing the post-Archaic archeological
sequence into discrete, relatively short pe-
riods. For this reason, the Ceramic period
is discussed here in terms of broad time
intervals that have relevance to identiﬁ-
able patterns of change on the upper
Texas coast and beyond (Fig. 6.11). At
the same time, it is apparent that Aten’s
temporal placement of sites according to
seriated ceramics approximately parallels
the relevant series of radiocarbon-dated
site components (see Fig. 6.9), suggesting
that his ceramic seriation remains a useful
relative chronological tool.

Diachronic Trends during the
Ceramic Period on the Coast

The Early Ceramic Period

As mentioned above, there is consider-

able evidence for continuity in site loca-
tions and basic settlement/subsistence
patterns between the end of the Archaic
and the Early Ceramic periods; sites con-
tinue to consist mostly of rangia middens
along secondary bay margins or riverine
estuaries. The beginning of the period is
thus currently recognizable only on the
basis of changes in certain artifact classes.
Limited data on lithics suggest that the
Kent point of Late Archaic times was su-
perseded by the contracting-stem Gary
type (see, e.g., Aten 1983; Ensor and
White 1998). The introduction of Tche-

deville sherds were most common in the
top few centimeters of the Stratum 2 ran-
gia shell midden, while Goose Creek
Plain, var. Anahuac, along with a few
sherds of Goose Creek Incised and Goose
Creek Plain, var. unspeciﬁed, were clus-
tered at the base of the overlying nonshell
Stratum 1 (Ellis and Ensor 1998; Ensor
1995, 1998a).

Rangia shells at the very top of Stra-

tum 2 at Eagle’s Ridge produced cor-
rected radiocarbon ages of ca. 2000 –
2500 b.p. (Ensor and Ricklis 1998), sug-
gesting that the earliest pottery at the site
may date to this time; however, the pre-
cise age of the samples will depend on how
they are further adjusted/calibrated (see
discussion in Ensor and Ricklis 1998).
Given these ﬁndings, it is possible that the
earliest pottery in the Galveston Bay area
is coeval with the Tchula period ceramics
in Louisiana, dated at ca. 600 b.c.– a.d. 1
(see, e.g., Weinstein 1986), obviating the
need to invoke a major “lag” in the diffu-
sion of ceramics from coastal Louisiana
into southeast Texas (as suggested by
Aten 1983). The base of Stratum 1 at
Eagle’s Ridge is dated by consistent radio-
carbon assay results on deer bone collagen
to ca. 1800 b.p. The relative abundance
in this zone of Goose Creek Plain, var.
Anahuac, along with sherds of Goose
Creek Incised, suggests an evolution of
Goose Creek ware out of Tchefuncte/
Mandeville pottery (Ellis and Ensor 1998;
Ensor 1995), supporting Aten’s postulated
shift in ceramics within the time range of
his Clear Lake period.

By this time, the pottery in the Gal-
veston Bay area exhibits little similarity
to contemporaneous (Marksville) material
in Louisiana. Sandy-paste Goose Creek
Plain predominates, and Goose Creek In-
cised exhibits very simple designs usually
consisting of one to three parallel hori-
zontal incisions under rim exteriors (Aten
1983, 218, 283). The more elaborate in-
cised designs and zoned stamping of the
Marksville ceramics are absent and vessel
shapes are simple jars or deep bowls with
rounded or conoidal, noded bases. The
ubiquity in the area of simple, sandy-
paste pottery provides a general link with
the Early Ceramic period in east Texas
(see Perttula 1995a; Story 1990), where
simple sandy-paste ceramics are predomi-
nant prior to the emergence of horticul-
tural Caddoan adaptations and an associ-

functe and Mandeville pottery suggests
signiﬁcant links with the coastal Louisi-
ana area and, presumably indirectly, with
developments in and around the Lower
Mississippi Valley. Richard Weinstein
(1986) has in fact suggested that the Gal-
veston Bay area was but one part of a
broad coastal interaction sphere during
the Tchula period.

Aten (1983) noted that his Clear Lake

period could be roughly divided into
early and late parts, with the former char-
acterized by Tchefuncte and Mandeville
ceramics and the latter marked by the
emergence of Goose Creek pottery. This
chronological division has been substanti-
ated by the recent ﬁndings at the Eagle’s
Ridge site, where Tchefuncte and Man-

ated elaboration of pottery (see Perttula,
chapter 13, this volume). During this
time, the upper Texas coast seems to have
experienced little effect from develop-
ments taking place in the Lower Missis-
sippi Valley and southern Louisiana, as
marked there by the appearance of
Marksville ceramic attributes and, in
places, burial mounds (although small
quantities of Marksville pottery types oc-
cur in the Sabine Lake area [Aten and
Bollich 1969]).

pearance of bison bone in faunal assem-
blages by ca. a.d. 1250/1300, along with
a lithic technocomplex consisting of Per-
diz arrow points, unifacial end scrapers,
blade-core lithic technology, thin bifacial
knives (often alternately beveled) and
expanded base drills/perforators made
on ﬂakes and prismatic blades (see,
e.g., Black 1986, 1989a; Hester 1975a,
1980b; L. Johnson 1994; Ricklis 1992a,
1994b; Ricklis and Cox 1993). The
nearly consistent co-occurrence of bison

bone and this lithic assemblage suggests a
signiﬁcant shift to bison hunting and a
concomitant adoption of a technological
package well suited to the procurement of
large game and the processing of meat
and hides (see, e.g., Black 1986; Creel
1991b; L. Johnson 1994; Ricklis 1992a,
1994b).

At Mitchell Ridge, several Initial
Late Prehistoric Scallorn arrow points
(Fig. 6.12a) were found in middens and
in a burial. The burial was that of an

The Late Prehistoric Period

By around a.d. 700, the introduction
of the bow and arrow on the upper Texas
coast is evidenced by the appearance of
small, light straight- and expanded-stem
stone arrow point types (Alba, Catahoula,
and Scallorn types; see E. Turner and
Hester 1993). Following the generally es-
tablished framework for Texas archeology,
the appearance of arrow points can be
taken to mark the beginning of the Late
Prehistoric period (see, e.g., Hester
1980b; Prewitt 1981, 1985). Patterson’s
(1991a, 1995) suggestion that unifacial
arrow points were present by ca. 4000 b.p.
has not received general acceptance. Simi-
larly, his argument (Patterson 1991a) that
the generally late Perdiz type was present
by ca. a.d. 600 in southeast Texas is ques-
tionable, given the widespread appear-
ance of the type across Texas only after
ca. a.d. 1250 (e.g., L. Johnson 1994;
Mallouf 1987; Prewitt 1985; E. Turner
and Hester 1993). Patterson’s (1991a)
early placement of this type appears to be
based on its co-occurrence with earlier
projectile point types in vertically mixed
site deposits (see discussion in Ricklis
1993b).

Recent ﬁndings at the Mitchell Ridge
site (41GV66) on Galveston Island sug-
gest that the Late Prehistoric can be di-
vided, as elsewhere in Texas, into two
subperiods. At Mitchell Ridge, an Initial
Late Prehistoric subperiod (Ricklis 1994a)
is associated with the introduction of the
bow and arrow, as represented by Scallorn
arrow points. The Final Late Prehistoric
subperiod at the site to a degree corre-
sponds with changes taking place through-
out most of Texas, as marked by the ap-
pearance of the Toyah phase (Prewitt
1985) or horizon (Black 1986) in inland
areas as well as the Rockport phase on the
central Texas coast (Ricklis 1992b, 1995b,
1996). These changes involved the ap-

adolescent female in semiﬂexed position;
two Scallorn points (one embedded in a
vertebra) were associated, and human
bone provided a corrected age of 1200 !
70 b.p. This calibrates to a 1-sigma cal-
endar range of a.d. 690 –958 (Ricklis
1994a, 225), well within the range as-
cribed to Scallorn points elsewhere in
Texas (Prewitt 1981, 1985).

The Final Late Prehistoric subperiod

at Mitchell Ridge is abundantly repre-
sented by a lithic assemblage of Perdiz
arrow points, prismatic blades, thin bi-
facial knives, and expanded-base drills
made on blades and blade-like ﬂakes (see
Fig. 6.12). This assemblage is well dated
at the site to between a.d. 1280 and
1450, in accord with the time range of
ca. a.d. 1250/1300 –1700 for similar
lithic assemblages in inland Texas (see,
e.g., Black 1989b; L. Johnson 1994; Pre-
witt 1985; Ricklis 1994b). End scrapers
and knives were scarce at Mitchell Ridge,
but that situation is not surprising con-
sidering that, although bison bone frag-
ments were present, most of the meat
weight represented in faunal samples
came from ﬁsh and deer. Presumably,
bison were hunted on the mainland, so
that only selected meaty elements were
brought to Mitchell Ridge. Beveled
knives and end scrapers are in fact found
at mainland sites (see, e.g., Wheat 1953),
where bison kill sites (e.g., the White Oak
Bayou site in Harris County [McReynolds
et al. 1988]) have been found. The Late
Prehistoric inﬂux of bison onto the Texas
coastal prairies by ca. a.d. 1300 (Huebner
1991; Ricklis 1992a) must have found a
response among coastal populations who,
as did inland groups, adopted a function-
ally associated lithic tool kit.

During the Late Prehistoric, ceramics
underwent some discernible technological
and stylistic modiﬁcations. Grog temper-
ing was introduced, presumably from the
east, a change which Aten (1983) places
at ca. a.d. 1000. (Given the actual ten-
dency for radiocarbon dates in his se-
quence to be older than site age estimates
based on ceramic seriation, this introduc-
tion may have occurred somewhat ear-
lier.) Also, bone tempering is introduced,
although it was always present in a mi-
nority of sherds. Vessels continue to be
simple bowls, jars, and constricted-neck
ollas (Fig. 6.13), but decorations become
more elaborate. The decorated bands on
rim exteriors tend to be wider than previ-

ously, with wider bands of horizontal in-
cised lines under rims as well as decora-
tive subrim zones of vertical, oblique, and

allels at this time between decorative mo-
tifs on the upper Texas coast and those of
various types of the Coles Creek–Plaque-
mine sequence in coastal Louisiana and
the Lower Mississippi Valley (Fig. 6.16).

In combination with the appearance of
grog tempering, this concurrence of mo-
tifs suggests an intensiﬁcation of inﬂuence
from, and/or interaction with, peoples to
the east.

Long-Term Cultural
Processes and Patterns

Settlement Patterns in the Coastal Zone
Aten (1983) has suggested for the up-

per coast of Texas a long-term and very
basic pattern of settlement involving ag-
gregation in large inland winter villages
and spring-summer dispersal into smaller
bands along the coast. The postulated
winter aggregation was based on historic
references to a number of large cool-season
inland camps, although this information
has never been presented in detail. The
spring-summer use of the coastal zone
estuaries was suggested on the basis of
seasonality analyses on rangia clam shells
(Aten 1981); however, some archeologists
have more recently questioned the relia-

bility of the method (Patterson and Gard-
ner 1993; Weinstein et al. 1989; Aten’s
rangia seasonality method is currently
undergoing rigorous reexamination to
determine if any modiﬁcations should be
made in the approach [Lawrence Aten
1997, personal communication]).

Other methods of seasonality analysis

can and should be routinely applied on
upper Texas coast archeological sites. Fish
otoliths, often found in abundance, as
well as oyster shells, when present, hold
considerable potential for seasonality
studies. At the Eagle’s Ridge site, both
otoliths (Stringer 1998) and oyster valves
(Ricklis 1998b) were employed and,
while the results showed a somewhat
broader seasonal spectrum than that indi-
cated by rangia seasonality at the site
(Zimmerman 1995), all three methods
indicated a general emphasis on warm
weather occupation (Ricklis 1998a).

At the Mitchell Ridge site on the la-
goonal side of Galveston Island (Ricklis
1994a), seasonality analysis on otoliths

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

and oysters suggested an emphasis on fall-
winter occupation, which agrees with
Cabeza de Vaca’s sixteenth-century obser-
vation that the native inhabitants of the
upper coast barrier islands spent the fall
and winter on the island and moved to
the mainland during the spring. If Aten’s
seasonality results on rangia prove to be
reliable, the spring-summer occupation of
the “coast” may actually refer to the more
inland areas around secondary bays and
river deltas; at least during the Late Pre-
historic, signiﬁcant fall-winter occupation
may have been focused on the landward
side of the barrier islands. Certainly, the
problem of seasonal locations of subsis-
tence activities and seasonal aggregation
and dispersal of populations merits fur-
ther investigation.

Population Growth and the Emergence
of Incipient Sociocultural Complexity
Aten (1983) has suggested that grow-
ing populations along the coast by Early
Ceramic times were a systemic catalyst for
successive ﬁssioning of social groups; as a
group’s numbers approached four hun-
dred or so, it split, thus conserving exist-
ing social mechanisms with an essentially
egalitarian social order. By Early Historic
times, the native Attakapan-speaking
Akokisa of the area comprised a number
of macrobands of several hundred people;
these groups were seen by Aten to have
been the end result of the long-term
ﬁssioning process. Aten further suggested
that these groups resided in large villages
away from the shoreline during the win-
ter and then dispersed along the coast
in smaller bands during the spring and
summer.

Patterson (1987, 1995) has also posited

a long-term trend toward higher coastal
population density during Late Archaic
times, although he suggests that by Late
Prehistoric times population growth had
slowed or stabilized. Patterson’s empirical
bases for these postulates are the number
of recorded sites for each major time
period in relation to the length of each
period. The idea of long-term net popu-
lation growth on the upper Texas coast
has intuitive appeal, considering the
high biotic productivity of the Late
Holocene estuarine environment and
the general ethnographic fact that coastal
hunter-gatherer populations tend toward
relatively high densities as well as some

OCCUPATION OF SOUTHEAST TEXAS / 197

dence of grave offerings than the other
three, suggesting a spatial segregation of
mortuary wealth. In the cemetery desig-
nated as Area 4, 91 percent of the grave
pits contained burial goods, as compared
with 20 to 25 percent in the other three
cemeteries (Fig. 6.18). Moreover, the
combined graves in Area 4 yielded twenty-
four distinct classes of grave goods whereas
the other three cemeteries produced only
between one and three classes of goods.
These ﬁndings strongly suggest a spatial
segregation of relatively high-status buri-
als, as would be expected in a social sys-
tem involving some degree of internal
ranking (see, e.g., J. Brown 1981; Fried
1967; Mainfort 1985; O’Shea 1984).

That a single cultural pattern is repre-
sented by all four cemeteries (as opposed
to different cultural groups with differing
mortuary behavior) is indicated by funda-
mental similarities among all four ceme-
teries in other aspects of mortuary behav-
ior, especially the virtually consistent
orientation of heads to the southeast
(Ricklis 1994a, 467– 68). Also, the dif-
ferential amounts of grave goods cannot
be ascribed to diachronic change in mor-
tuary behavior since (a) all four cemeter-
ies contained Late Prehistoric burials,
(b) two cemeteries (Areas 1 and 4) con-
tained burials that were radiocarbon dated
to the Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and
Early Historic periods, and (c) burials in
Area 4 contained abundant and varied
goods regardless of the time period.

Also possibly relevant to the question
of population growth is the fact that the
overwhelming majority of the archeologi-
cal evidence for settlement at Mitchell
Ridge and other barrier island sites per-
tains to the Late Prehistoric period. A to-
tal of thirty radiocarbon assays on burials
and features at Mitchell Ridge indicate
that, while there was some use of the site
by ca. 2000 b.p., intensive occupation
began only by ca. a.d. 700/800 (Ricklis
1994a). Similarly, other investigated sites
on upper coast barrier islands, namely the
Caplen site on Bolivar Peninsula (Aten
1983; T. N. Campbell 1957) and the Ja-
maica Beach site on Galveston Island
(Aten 1983), were occupied mainly dur-
ing the Late Prehistoric period and later.
Seasonality analyses on ﬁsh otoliths and
oyster shells from Mitchell Ridge suggest
a seasonal emphasis on fall-winter occu-
pation, which, judging from the extensive

Fig. 6.16. Diagram showing similarities between Late Prehistoric ceramic decorations from

degree of sociopolitical complexity (see,
e.g., Hassan 1981; Perlman 1980; Wid-
mer 1988). If, in fact, resident popu-
lations along the upper coast were ex-
periencing net growth during the Late
Archaic and Ceramic periods, this growth
likely would have led to the emergence of
some measure of societal complexity: As
pressure on resources and size of social
groups increased, a degree of internal
sociopolitical differentiation might be
required to maintain organizational co-
hesion and systemic viability in the face
of intra-group competition for access to
resources.

The recent ﬁndings in four cemetery

areas at the Mitchell Ridge site indeed
suggest that, by Late Prehistoric times, at
least incipient social ranking had emerged
on the upper Texas coast (Ricklis 1994a).
Many aspects of the Mitchell Ridge buri-
als match those previously documented in
the Galveston Bay area, namely: a major-
ity of ﬂexed or semiﬂexed single inter-
ments in small, discrete cemeteries; red
ochre in some graves; and offerings of
personal adornment and other nonmun-
dane objects (Aten 1976a; Fig. 6.17).
However, one of the four Mitchell Ridge
cemeteries had a dramatically higher inci-

and dense midden debris on the site and
the presence of cemeteries, must have re-
curred on a fairly regular basis. That re-
gional coastal populations were regularly
frequenting the barrier islands only rela-
tively late in the Ceramic period suggests
that growing population pressure on
mainland resources was a catalyst for ex-
pansion of activities into a previously
little-utilized resource zone.

Demographic and Cultural Change
during Protohistoric and
Early Historic Times

The best information recovered to date
on fundamental processes operating dur-
ing the Protohistoric and Early Historic
periods comes, once again, from Mitchell
Ridge. The Protohistoric period was rec-
ognizable at the site on the basis of radio-

carbon-dated burials and an occupation
area that falls into the earliest period of
the Euro-American presence on the upper
Texas Gulf coast (ca. a.d. 1500 –1700).
Little change from the Final Late
Prehistoric is evidenced in basic subsis-
tence practices during the Protohistoric;
faunal data from Feature 9, a series of
overlapping pits containing abundant
camp debris (dated to a 1-sigma range of
a.d. 1450 –1640), shows no major differ-
ence in proportional representation of
species from those recovered from a dis-
crete Final Late Prehistoric midden in
the area of a major block excavation
(with a combined 1-sigma date range of
a.d. 1280 –1450 on four hearth features).
Judging by the data from these areas,
both periods saw a major reliance on
ﬁshing, with additional signiﬁcant dietary

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

input from hunting (primarily white-
tailed deer, although bison elements were
also present) and trapping of the hispid
cotton rats that still abound today on
much of Galveston Island (Ricklis 1994a,
89 –97). There is no evidence for signiﬁ-
cant change in mortuary patterns during
the Protohistoric, since single primary in-
terments and some secondary burials are
still the rule, and the deceased were buried
in the same discrete cemeteries used dur-
ing Late Prehistoric times.

There is some suggestion of an in-
creased variety of arrow point types being
used in Protohistoric times. The over-
whelmingly predominant arrow point in
the Final Late Prehistoric was the Perdiz
type, whereas the excavations in Protohis-
toric Feature 9 yielded a mix of Perdiz,
Bulbar Stemmed, and unstemmed round-
based and lozenge-shaped arrow points
(Fig. 6.19).

Signiﬁcantly, a Protohistoric burial of
a child (Feature 82), with a 1-sigma range
of a.d. 1480 –1650, contained a complete
necklace of native-made tubular conch
shell beads and large blue-green glass
beads of the Itchuknee Plain type. The
latter are commonly found in late six-
teenth- and early seventeenth-century
contexts in the Southeast, and it is the
most common glass bead type on early
seventeenth-century Spanish mission sites
in Florida (Deagan 1987, 171; Marvin
Smith 1993, personal communication).
This ﬁnd indicates that native peoples on
the upper Texas coast had limited access
to European goods (or, at least, glass
beads) in the Protohistoric period, per-
haps obtained via down-the-line exchange
with coastal groups to the east.

By Early Historic times (ca. a.d. 1700 –

1800), major social and demographic
changes were taking place on the upper
Texas coast. Documentary evidence indi-
cates that French fur traders were operat-
ing along the northwest Gulf coast at
least as early as 1720 and that by mid-
century a trading post was established at
the mouth of the Trinity River for the
deerskin trade with the local Akokisa.
The activities of this period are reﬂected
in several of the Mitchell Ridge burials,
which contain early to middle eighteenth-
century glass beads, iron spikes and nails,
a brass hawk bell of typical French style,
and a glass mirror fragment.

The Mitchell Ridge ﬁndings appear
to support Aten’s (1983) suggestion of

signiﬁcant native population decline dur-
ing the eighteenth century due to the in-
troduction of Old World epidemic dis-
eases. The average number of individuals
in Early Historic graves is 3.5, as com-
pared to the Late Prehistoric average of
1.2, suggesting an increased mortality
rate. Also, the Early Historic burial popu-
lation at the site contains 50 percent sub-
adults, compared to 25 percent for the
Late Prehistoric period. This situation,
too, may indicate the presence of Old
World pathogens, since in general chil-
dren are the segment of the population
that is most vulnerable to the effects of
introduced diseases.

There is evidence as well for the inﬂux

of nonlocal native people at Mitchell
Ridge during the eighteenth century. Two
grave pits in Area 4 (Features 63 and 64)
pertaining to this period exhibited attri-
butes that distinguished them from other
graves at the site. Both pits were unusu-
ally large and were surrounded by large
post molds indicative of wooden enclo-
sures. Feature 64 contained the superim-
posed skeletons of four individuals (one
adolescent female, two children, and one
young adult male). All were interred on
the back in extended position, in contrast
to other primary burials at the site that
were all in semiﬂexed or ﬂexed position.
The extended positions are reminiscent
of burials of the general Mississippian pe-
riod tradition in the southeastern United
States, as is the fronto-occipital cranial
deformation of the adult male in Feature
64 (see Powell 1994). Additionally, the
absence of tooth wear in the adult male
and the adolescent female from Feature
64 is in marked contrast to the moderate
to heavy tooth wear seen in other crania
from the site (Powell 1994), also suggest-
ing a nonlocal origin for these individuals.
Taken together, these attributes suggest
that nonlocal people, possibly refugees
from the dissolution of native societies
to the east in Louisiana and the Lower
Mississippi Valley, were incorporated
into indigenous upper Texas coast society
and buried within traditional cemetery
space.

The Ceramic Period in
Inland Southeast Texas

Inland southeast Texas has been sub-

sumed by Dee Ann Story (1990) into

200 / COASTAL GROUPS

the same general Mossy Grove Tradition
manifest on the coast. Sites in the interior
have thus produced essentially the same
ceramics, especially Goose Creek Plain,
var. unspeciﬁed. Goose Creek Incised is
also present, although it is seemingly less
common inland than in the coastal zone.
The earliest pottery found along the

coast, the Tchefuncte and Mandeville
wares, is virtually absent in the interior.
In fact, as mentioned previously, pottery
did not appear in inland areas until per-
haps ca. a.d. 500 (Aten 1983, 298 –99).
According to Aten (1983, 298), subse-
quent ceramic developments parallel
those of the coast, with grog-tempered
pottery appearing ca. a.d. 1000, with
minor amounts of bone-tempered ware
showing up relatively late in time. Stylis-
tic inﬂuences from the Caddo area to
the north (see Perttula, chapter 13, this
volume) are evidenced in the Conroe-
Livingston and upper Neches–Angelina
River areas some sixty to one hundred
kilometers north and northeast of Galves-
ton Bay, in the forms of brushed and
punctated surfaces and sherds of vessels
that are probably of Caddoan origin (e.g.,
Aten 1983; Ensor and Carlson 1988;
Story 1990). Story (1990, 256) further
suggested that the movement of Caddoan
populations into the central part of east
Texas resulted in intensiﬁed contact and
exchange, probably mainly peaceful, be-
tween Caddoans and northern Mossy
Grove peoples.

On the basis of pottery samples from
numerous coastal and inland sites, Pat-
terson (1990) has suggested that grog-
tempered wares were never as abundant
in the interior as along the coast. He also
notes less common and less elaborate dec-
oration on inland southeast Texas pottery
and suggests that these differences demar-
cate the inland limits of coastal territories
that extend only thirty to forty kilometers
inland, as was also the case on the central
Texas coast during Late Prehistoric times
(Ricklis 1995b, 1996, and chapter 5, this
volume).

Lithics in inland areas vary according
to location. In the northern Mossy Grove
area, the earliest pottery is associated with
Gary dart points. By ca. a.d. 700/800,
these are largely if not entirely replaced
by arrow point types such as Alba, Cata-
houla, and later, the Perdiz (Story 1990,
256). To the west around the lower Bra-

zos River, Gary points are present at the
early end of the sequence, but other
Late/terminal Archaic types such as En-
sor and Godley are quite common (e.g.,
G. Hall 1981). In the latter area, the in-
troduction of the bow and arrow is
marked by a predominance of Scallorn
arrow points (e.g., G. Hall 1981), and
Perdiz points become dominant in the
latter part of the Late Prehistoric.

As was the case in Late Archaic times,
inland sites tend to be located on uplands
overlooking stream valleys or on elevated,
well-drained locations within or along
ﬂoodplains (Ensor and Carlson 1988,
1991; McClurkan 1968; R. Moore 1989,
1994, 1995; Shafer 1966; Story 1990).
Roger Moore (1995), in fact, suggests
that major stream drainages deﬁned the
geographic parameters for subsistence-
settlement systems with probable ethnic
correlates.

Moore (1994, 1995) has developed a
model of inland Mossy Grove settlement
and subsistence patterns based on a sample
of forty-eight Ceramic period sites on Cy-
press Creek in northwest Harris County.
He observes that sites are situated in
proximity to reliable fresh water sources
and that wooded ﬂoodplains were pre-
ferred over upland prairies for camp loca-
tions; basically, people were “tethered” to
the linear resource zones of riverine wood-
lands. Further, he suggests that ﬂood-
plains presented a more or less homoge-
neous distribution of resources conducive
to a logistical collecting adaptation (see
Binford 1980). The settlement pattern
was thus characterized by: (a) residential-
based camps that saw a wide range of
on-site activities, (b) smaller residential
camps with a more limited range of activ-
ity, and (c) task-speciﬁc extraction sites.
Moore’s model infers an oscillating aggre-
gation and dispersal of populations, with
large “maximal bands” (analogous to
those suggested by Aten [1983] for the
coastal Akokisa) occupying the large resi-
dential base camps and “minimal bands”
residing for part of the annual round in
smaller residential campsites.

Moore’s residential base camps and

smaller residential camps essentially
match the Group I and Group II sites
that H. Blaine Ensor postulated for the
area on the basis of intersite variations in
quantities and kinds of lithic artifacts
(Ensor and Carlson 1991). Moore adds

OCCUPATION OF SOUTHEAST TEXAS / 201

the third kind of site, the extraction lo-
cale, on the basis of numerous small, low-
density riverine sites that may have func-
tioned for procurement or processing of a
speciﬁc resource; the White Oak Bayou
bison kill site (41HR541; see McReynolds
et al. 1988) is an example of this kind of
location. In their observations of intersite
variability, Moore and Ensor both diverge
from Patterson’s conclusion that inland
Mossy Grove sites, while varying in size,
are of “a single type” (Patterson 1991b,
17), indicating recurrent use by residen-
tial groups within a scheduled forager
adaptation (see Binford 1980).

Summary of Key Points and
Some Thoughts for Ongoing
Regional Research

Southeast Texas straddles the major
ecotone between the eastern woodlands
and prairies to the west. This division is
reﬂected in the culture history of the area,
as it is characterized by both internal re-
gional developments and extraregional re-
lations and interaction between peoples
and cultures.

During Late Paleoindian times, the re-

gion was occupied by groups with cul-
tural roots in the eastern woodlands, as
indicated by widespread ﬁnds of San
Patrice dart points. On the other hand,
dart points and other diagnostic artifacts
of the Cody Complex are also present,
suggesting an interface between eastern
and western (Plains) cultural traditions
(L. Johnson 1989).

At a very general level, the long Ar-
chaic stage in southeast Texas was proba-
bly marked by growing populations and,
by Late Archaic times, reduced group
mobility and increasingly circumscribed
territoriality. Such trends are suggested
by the predominance of relatively poor-
quality lithic raw material of intraregional
origin in the Late Archaic, as well as by
the appearance of large cemeteries on the
coastal prairies.

Along the coast, shoreline occupation

and resource use appear to have ﬂuctu-
ated in intensity over the long term in re-
sponse to broad ﬂuctuations in estuarine
productivity linked with a pattern of dis-
continuous Holocene sea level rise. With
the attainment of stable modern sea level
by ca. 3000 b.p. and the emergence of
high-biomass, protected shallow-water es-

tuarine environments, human carrying
capacity probably increased during the
Late Archaic and into the Ceramic pe-
riod, resulting in long-term net popula-
tion growth. Growing populations may
have facilitated movements of people,
technologies, and ideas along the north-
western Gulf coastline. Signiﬁcant coast-
wise interactions are indicated by the ap-
pearance of Tchefuncte ceramics at the
beginning of Early Ceramic times, per-
haps by ca. 200 b.c. However, there fol-
lowed several centuries during which pot-
tery in southeast Texas had a distinctly
local ﬂavor, as ceramic assemblages came
to be dominated by Goose Creek types,
mostly plainwares. If ceramics are a reli-
able indicator, these centuries saw little
or no signiﬁcant inﬂuence from develop-
ing Middle Woodland (Marksville Hope-
wellian) culture to the east in Louisiana
and the Lower Mississippi Valley.

In Late Prehistoric times, elaboration

of ceramic decorations in imitation of
Coles Creek–Plaquemine motifs, most
notably along the coast, once again
suggests signiﬁcant interaction among
groups along the northern Gulf coast.
Also, relations between northern inland
Mossy Grove populations and Caddo
populations are indicated by the available
ceramic data. At the about the same time,
Final Late Prehistoric populations in the
Galveston Bay area and probably in the
western interior of southeast Texas partic-
ipated to some degree in a widespread
pattern of bison hunting, adopting the
apparently associated lithic technocom-
plex seemingly within the framework of
traditional Mossy Grove cultural patterns.
Along the coast, barrier islands were
intensively occupied beginning in Initial
Late Prehistoric times, perhaps in re-
sponse to growing regional population
and attendant pressure on resources avail-
able on or from the mainland. Judging
from the recently acquired mortuary data
from the Mitchell Ridge site on Galves-
ton Island, population growth may have
stimulated an emergent social complexity
with at least incipient social ranking indi-
cated by marked spatial variability in
mortuary goods between cemeteries. It is
currently unclear whether this advent of
social complexity was essentially an in-
digenous development or whether upper
Texas coast societies were drawing upon
existing sociopolitical models of the more

complex agricultural societies to the east
and north.

In the period of European contact, re-
gional groups participated in the deerskin
trade as French traders began to operate
along the northwest Gulf coast in the
early eighteenth century. Bioarcheological
data from Mitchell Ridge support earlier
postulations of population decline with
the spread of Old World diseases and also
suggest the inﬂux of native peoples from
the east, a pattern that may have followed
long-established, traditional lines of inter-
group relations along the northwest Gulf
Coast Plain.

Based on the current status of research,
a number of questions emerge that are of
particular interest for future investiga-
tions. While other issues doubtless will be
(and should be) explored, the following
are clearly in need of attention:

1. The poor chronological control for
inland southeast Texas and the limited un-
derstanding of synchronic intersite func-
tional variability are largely due to the low
level of vertical and horizontal resolution in
multicomponent sites with mixed deposits;
most excavated deposits are within more or
less heavily bioturbated, sandy matrices.
While the kind of work begun by Moore
(1994, 1995) and Ensor (Ensor and Carl-
son 1991) has helped deﬁne the nature of
inland hunter-gatherer adaptations in terms
of differences in site size and function, the
number of sites intensively investigated
along these lines is currently limited, and
additional work will be needed to further
develop and reﬁne models of settlement
and subsistence.

Integral to such work will be the discov-

ery and extensive excavation of sealed site
components that represent occupation epi-
sodes and/or recurrent occupations during
discrete time periods, along the lines sug-
gested for central Texas by Michael B. Col-
lins (1995, and chapter 3, this volume).
Work at such sites will also be indispensable
for reﬁning the currently very general chro-
nology for the area. As Collins and Bous-
man (1993) have pointed out for east Texas
in general, this research will require work at
sites in geomorphic settings that are con-
ducive to the development of clear strati-
graphic sequences (e.g., deep alluvial de-
posits in large stream valleys).

2. One of the more pressing needs on
the coast is a deﬁnitive understanding of

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

06-A2946  4/13/04  12:03 PM  Page 202

202 / COASTAL GROUPS

the most appropriate method for adjusting
or calibrating radiocarbon assays on samples
of estuarine shell. As noted above, there is
currently no clear consensus on this issue,
and the various approaches used to obtain
dates can result in adjusted radiocarbon
ages that diverge by hundreds of years (see
Ensor and Ricklis 1998; Kibler et al. 1996).
This lack of consensus renders a deﬁnitive,
detailed cultural chronology difﬁcult, with
obvious implications for a fuller under-
standing of the rates and timing of signiﬁ-
cant cultural changes and processes. Since
the various approaches used so far all hinge
on the divergence between ages in paired
samples of charcoal and shell, ongoing ﬁeld-
work should involve efforts to identify dis-
crete depositional units containing undis-
turbed associations of shell and charcoal; as
noted above, most so-called paired samples
reported to date match shell with charcoal
collected from arbitrary levels or gross

stratigraphic units in which contemporane-
ity of materials cannot be unquestionably
demonstrated.

3. The linkage between southeast Texas,

especially the coastal zone, and Louisiana
has been repeatedly mentioned here. If ce-
ramics are a reliable indicator of contact,
the intensity of interregional relations may
have varied through time; the initial Tche-
functe/Mandeville pottery of the Tchula
period was followed by simple sandy-paste
wares of the Goose Creek series, after which
the appearance of grog-tempered pottery
(with more frequent and elaborate decora-
tions with parallels in the Coles Creek–
Plaquemine tradition) suggests increased
inﬂuence from Louisiana and the Lower
Mississippi Valley. The area of extreme
southeast Texas around the lower Sabine
River, where the possible waxing and wan-
ing of inﬂuences from and interaction with
Louisiana aboriginal cultures should be

most readily discerned, remains poorly
known. Systematic investigations in this
area and in adjacent southwest Louisiana
might provide signiﬁcant insights into the
nature and timing of cultural interaction
along the northwest Gulf coast.

Prehistory of the Jornada Mogollon and Eastern
Trans-Pecos Regions of West Texas

Myles R. Miller and Nancy A. Kenmotsu

The Trans-Pecos region of Texas extends
from El Paso on the west to the Pecos
River on the east, with the Rio Grande
deﬁning its southern boundary and New
Mexico its northern. Included within this
region are El Paso, Hudspeth, Culberson,
Brewster, Presidio, Jeff Davis, Terrell,
Pecos, and Reeves Counties (Fig. 7.1).
Part of the greater Southwest, part of the
Southern Plains, yet mostly in and of it-
self, the Trans-Pecos region represents an
important transitional point between sev-
eral geographic and cultural regions.
Archeological sites ranging in age from
Paleoindian to Historic are well repre-
sented, and among these are site types
ranging from lithic scatters and isolated
hearths to rockshelters, pueblos, and
Spanish missions. In this chapter, we of-
fer an outline of prehistoric human adap-
tation to this vast and highly variable
region.

For much of the twentieth century
archeological research in the Trans-Pecos
lagged behind that of many other regions
of Texas and the Southwest. Due to the
region’s remoteness and the prevalence of
nonarchitectural hunter-gatherer sites, its
prehistory was viewed as peripheral to de-
velopments in better known and more
archeologically visible culture areas. De-
spite this past neglect, the Trans-Pecos is
proving to be an extremely fertile region
for archeological inquiry, and its archeo-
logical resources offer an important and
accessible data base for several topics of

current archeological relevance. These
topics include, to list but a few of the ma-
jor ones, (a) the nature of hunter-gatherer
mobility and organization in a semiarid
environment characterized by spatially
and temporally variable plant and animal
resources, (b) the ecological and social as-
pects underlying a high degree of settle-
ment mobility among horticultural and
agricultural groups in the region, and
(c) causal factors leading to the adoption
of agriculture in the Southwest. Archeol-
ogists working in the region have also
made several fundamental contributions
to studies of prehistoric landscape use
and landscape (or “nonsite”) archeology
(Burgett 1994; Camilli and Ebert 1992;
Camilli et al. 1988; Doleman et al. 1992;
Mauldin 1995; O’Leary 1987) and how
artifact and site distributions are condi-
tioned by geomorphological factors in ac-
tive eolian environments (Anschuetz et al.
1990; Doleman et al. 1991; Mauldin
et al. 1998; M. Miller 1988; Schutt 1992;
Seaman et al. 1988).

As the effects of scale on archeological
interpretation achieve wider recognition,
the prehistory of the Trans-Pecos has
great importance in explicating relation-
ships between long-term change in adap-
tive systems and panregional social and
economic systems. As archeologists gain a
broader appreciation of the synchrony of
developments across the southern South-
west and adjoining regions, it has become
increasingly evident that events in Casas

205

Grandes, the Mogollon, Chupadera Mesa,
or southeast New Mexico and the Texas
Panhandle cannot be completely under-
stood without reference to contemporary
developments in adjacent regions, includ-
ing the Trans-Pecos (see Boyd et al. 1997;
Creel 2000; Kenmotsu 1994; Mallouf
1990; M. Miller et al. 1997; Rautman
1993; Spielmann 1983, 1991a, 1991b;
Wiseman 1988). Moreover, such pro-
cesses may be examined over an extended
time frame in the Trans-Pecos because of
the presence of numerous Spanish Colo-
nial period Native American and Euro-
pean settlements, several of which were
continuously occupied from late prehis-
toric through historic times.

Archeological investigations have been

conducted throughout the Trans-Pecos
since the early part of the twentieth cen-
tury, and several syntheses and overviews
of regional prehistory have been pro-
duced since the middle of the twentieth
century. In 1948, Donald Lehmer re-
ported the results of several archeological
investigations in south-central New Mex-
ico and the western Trans-Pecos that ulti-
mately led to his seminal deﬁnition of the
Jornada Branch of the Mogollon. Mean-
while, J. Charles Kelley, in collaboration
with Lehmer and T. N. Campbell, under-
took the ﬁrst professional and systematic
investigations in the eastern Trans-Pecos,
the results of which established a cultural
historical sequence and descriptions of
material culture for this region ( J. C. Kel-

water delivery projects throughout the
Rio Grande Valley southeast of El Paso
have contributed an impressive amount
of information on Historic period sites
and material culture. In the eastern Trans-
Pecos, a revitalized program of archeolog-
ical investigations initiated by the Center
for Big Bend Studies in Alpine has con-
tributed additional survey and excavation
data for several poorly known areas.

The increasing pace of archeological
work during the 1990s has produced a
considerable amount of new information,
much of which remains unpublished or
has yet to be widely disseminated. Among
the most profound contributions are sev-
eral investigations of long- and short-term
regional adaptive patterns based on com-
pilations of data obtained during twenty
years of CRM investigations and earlier
professional or avocational work. Several
recently reported studies have provided
crucial insights into changing patterns in
subsistence economies, landscape use, fea-
ture and artifact variation, and regional ex-
change patterns. These include analyses of
macrobotanical samples (Hard et al. 1996;
M. Miller 1997), groundstone (Calamia
1991; Hard et al. 1996; Mauldin 1995;
Mauldin and Leach 1994), thermal fea-
tures (Leach 1993; Mauldin 1994, 1995,
1996a; Mauldin et al. 1998), ceramics
(M. Miller 1997), lithic raw materials and
obsidian geochemical data (Church et al.
1996; M. Miller and Shackley 1998), and
burials (M. Miller 1990; Mauldin 1995).
Published databases available for study in-
clude more than four thousand chrono-
metric dates (M. Miller 1996a) and de-
scriptive information for more than one
thousand habitation structures from the
northern and southern Jornada Mogollon
regions (Graves 1996).

We will present some of the insights
recently gained from these studies and of-
fer several new perspectives on the prehis-
tory of the Trans-Pecos region. Numer-
ous cultural historical summaries for the
Jornada Mogollon region have appeared
since the 1970s, although the majority
are in introductory sections available in
a multitude of CRM reports. Unfortu-
nately, many of these summaries tend to
be behind the curve in considering re-
cent developments or at worst are simply
“boilerplate” insertions. In either case,

After this brief period of activity, interest
in this part of the southern Southwest
faded as archeologists devoted their atten-
tion to the more visually appealing Mo-
gollon, Hohokam, and Casas Grandes
Culture areas. Lehmer reviewed the status
of Trans-Pecos archeology in a 1958 ar-
ticle in the Bulletin of the Texas Archeolog-
ical Society, as did Alexander J. Lindsay,
Jr., in a brief 1969 current research con-
tribution to American Antiquity. How-
ever, aside from Kelley’s work in the La
Junta de los Ríos area the Trans-Pecos re-
ceived little attention from professional
archeologists. In their place, the majority
of excavations were performed by devoted
and capable avocational groups such as
the El Paso Archaeological Society, and
much of the information on prehistoric
pueblos in the Jornada Mogollon region
is known through their efforts.

It was not until the 1970s and the ad-

vent of cultural resources management
(CRM) programs that the Trans-Pecos
again became the focus of professional in-
vestigations. The majority of archeologi-
cal work in the 1970s and early 1980s
consisted of small- and large-scale inven-
tory surveys, most of which were con-
ducted on the Fort Bliss Military Reserva-
tion (Beckes et al. 1977; Carmichael
1983; Skelton et al. 1981; Whalen 1977,
1978). This pattern continued through
the 1980s, and while numerous sites were
investigated to determine their research
potential, intensive excavation projects
were surprisingly few in number. The

lack of excavation data was one of the
major obstacles to acquiring a scholarly
understanding of regional developments
and changing adaptive trends, and even
fundamental issues of chronology, artifact
sequences, subsistence, architectural de-
velopments, and settlement patterns re-
mained the subject of uncertainty and
debate through the 1980s.

Fortunately, since the late 1980s this
situation has changed, and it would not
be unreasonable to state that during the
1990s the accumulation of archeological
data progressed at an exponential rate for
much of the Trans-Pecos. This change is
perhaps best exempliﬁed by the fact that
75 percent of the 827 radiocarbon dates
from the Jornada Mogollon region of El
Paso, Hudspeth, and Culberson Counties
have been reported since 1988, and more
than 50 percent of the dates are from just
1995 –2000. Similarly, two-thirds of the
dates from the eastern Trans-Pecos have
been reported since 1985. In the far west-
ern portion of the region, numerous
archeological testing and mitigation proj-
ects have been undertaken as part of
well-funded CRM programs at Fort Bliss
Military Reservation and because of the
constant encroachment of urban develop-
ments on archeological sites resulting
from the rapid growth of El Paso. As a re-
sult, our understanding of the timing and
nature of prehistoric adaptations has un-
dergone several important revisions and
reﬁnements. In addition, archeological in-
vestigations sponsored by the Texas Water
Development Board in advance of several

of inquiry tends to be regional in order to
illustrate important adaptive trends as
well as social relationships with adjacent
regions. We do discuss individual sites,
however, to provide examples of speciﬁc
settlement systems at various points in
time. Moreover, to present a truly re-
gional perspective, we refer to several
important sites across the state line in
New Mexico.

Also included in this chapter are an
update and a synthesis of recent archeo-
logical research on the Protohistoric and
Spanish Colonial periods. Often ignored
or downplayed in culture history over-
views, the archeology of these periods is
achieving increased interest and impor-
tance. We do not, however, offer a de-
tailed compendium of historical events
involving Spanish expeditions or the es-
tablishment of missions and presidios but
prefer to focus on archeological aspects of
these periods and the information they
provide in terms of the effects of Euro-
pean colonization on the settlement and
social organization of indigenous Native
American groups.

Environment and Climate

The western two-thirds of the Trans-
Pecos is part of a large physiogeographic
region known as basin and range (Hawley

1975) that is characterized by generally
north-south trending mountain ranges
separated by wide internal drainage basins
termed bolsons (see Fig. 7.1). Two of the
most prominent such drainage features
are the Hueco Bolson and Salt Flat Basin
in El Paso, Hudspeth, and Culberson
Counties (Fig. 7.2). The basin and range
physiography terminates with a northwest
to southeast chain of mountains, begin-
ning with the Guadalupes on the north,
followed by the Delawares, Davis, Rosillos
or Glass, and Chisos. East of these moun-
tains are the Delaware Basin, Toyah Basin,
and the dissected Stockton Plateau, all of
which terminate at the Pecos River. Ele-
vations range from 8,751 feet at Guada-
lupe Peak, the highest elevation in Texas,
to 1,600 feet at the conﬂuence of the
Pecos River and the Rio Grande, with
the majority of landforms ranging be-
tween 3,000 and 5,000 feet in elevation.
To visitors from well-watered, ﬂora-
rich lands to the east, the Trans-Pecos
may appear harsh and unforgiving. Such
a view is deceptive. The land supports a
wide range of ﬂora and fauna, and the
material recovered from excavations in
the region provides evidence that the re-
gion’s prehistoric inhabitants exploited
many of these resources. Plant resources
used for food, fuel, or construction wood,
medicine, or ﬁbers include honey and

dated by a decade or more. While it would
be safe to assume that, at any given time,
any geographic or culture region is ready
for an overhaul of current interpretations,
assumptions, and theoretical perspectives,
the Trans-Pecos region is particularly
suited for such an endeavor.

To accomplish such an overhaul in this
chapter required a synthesis and summary
of the accumulated archeological work of
ﬁfty years, an endeavor that presented
several challenges. Perhaps most trouble-
some was the highly variable quantity and
quality of data available across a region
measuring more than thirty-one thousand
square miles. This imbalance is particu-
larly evident in the tone of the respective
discussions for the eastern and western
segments of the Trans-Pecos. Several
counties and geographic zones in the east-
ern Trans-Pecos are archeologically among
the least known regions of the state, and
for these areas it is only possible to make
general statements regarding changing as-
pects of material culture over broad time
intervals.

We also take into account the in-
tended audience of this volume on the
prehistory of Texas: a group undoubtedly
including academic and CRM archeolo-
gists, avocational archeologists, students,
historians, and members of the public
having an interest in the prehistory of the
state. With these varied groups in mind,
we debated whether to produce a techni-
cal and theoretically oriented review of
long-term patterns and processes involv-
ing prehistoric adaptations in the Trans-
Pecos region or a more conventional pre-
sentation that simply proﬁled sequential
intervals in material culture, feature types,
and general subsistence trends (i.e., a tra-
ditional culture-historical overview). We
opted for a compromise approach. Ac-
cordingly, while the overview is largely
structured within a conventional culture-
historical framework involving sequential
periods and phases, we emphasize speciﬁc
trends within these periods. Trends exam-
ined within each time interval include
settlement mobility and landscape use,
changes in subsistence economies as re-
ﬂected in dependence upon domesticated
versus nondomesticated plants and ani-
mals, and how changes in technology,
settlement structure, and social organiza-
tion reﬂect the evolution of these settle-
ment and subsistence systems. Our scale

screwbean mesquite (Prosopis juliﬂora,
P. pubescens), sotol (Dasylirion wheeleri ),
agave (Agave lechuguilla, A. americana),
yucca (Yucca elata, Y. baccata), prickly
pear (Opuntia sp.), and various other cacti
(Echinocereus sp., Mammalaria sp.). Faunal
resources include rabbits (Sylvilagus audu-
boni, Lepus californicus), deer (Odocoileus
hemionus), pronghorn antelope (Antiloca-
pra americana), bison (Bison bison), and
various reptiles, rodents, and ﬁsh.

Besides the Rio Grande and, in some

years, the Pecos River, springs provide
the only source of permanent water
throughout much of the region. Certain
springs, such as those associated with site
41CU460 at the head of South McKit-
trick Canyon in the Guadalupe Moun-
tains, are small, and the limited archeo-
logical remains at such sites suggest that
they were infrequently utilized for brief
stays (Kenmotsu 1993). In contrast,
the archeological materials at Phantom
Springs (41JD63), a large permanent
spring in Jeff Davis County near Bal-
morhea, show repeated, intensive occupa-
tion from 4500 b.c. to a.d. 1500 (Charles
1994). Here, burned rock middens,
hearths, and activity areas (i.e., horizontal
zones within a site where the patterns of
artifacts and/or features indicate that one
or more speciﬁc activities occurred) docu-
ment the importance of this water source
as a camp site for intervals of at least sev-
eral days at a time. Playas distributed
throughout the central bolsons also
served as an important yet often unpre-
dictable water source and were a focus
of agriculturally based settlements after
ca. a.d. 1200 in the western Trans-Pecos.
James T. Abbott (1996), Raymond
Mauldin (1995), and Robert J. Mallouf
(1981) provide comprehensive summaries
and critiques of regional paleoclimatic
ﬁndings. Data from packrat middens
indicate that woodland and grassland sa-
vanna communities were present through-
out the region at the end of the Pleisto-
cene. H. Curtis Monger and Brenda J.
Buck (1995; see also Monger 1993) note
that the presence of lagged carbonate nod-
ules in deposits dating to ca. 7000 b.c.
indicates that a major erosional event oc-
curred at this time. Additional geomor-
phological, pollen, and stable isotope
analyses (Monger and Buck 1995) point
to the beginning of a drying trend at
7000 b.c. that persisted through the
Middle Holocene. By then, climate and

vegetation communities similar to mod-
ern conditions were becoming estab-
lished. In agreement with studies from
adjacent regions of the Southwest and
Southern High Plains (G. Hall 1985;
Holliday 1989b; E. Johnson and Holliday
1986; see E. Johnson and Holliday, chap-
ter 9, this volume), packrat midden data
and measures of stable isotope ratios in
soils throughout the El Paso area of west
Texas show that this period was essen-
tially warm and arid, although with sev-
eral relatively brief periods of increased
moisture and cooler temperatures.

Essentially modern conditions were

established during the Late Holocene
throughout the Chihuahuan Desert (Van
Devender 1990). Plant materials incorpo-
rated into packrat middens at several lo-
cations include high proportions of spe-
cies adapted to dry environments. More
detailed reconstructions of paleoclimatic
patterns during the Late Holocene have
been obtained through proxy indicators
of temperature and precipitation. Using
data on tree-ring sequences and historic
precipitation and temperature records,
Mauldin (1995) has summarized climatic
trends during the period between a.d. 450
and 1950. Mauldin identiﬁes at least three
intervals (a.d. 500 –700, 1000 –1300,
and 1550 –1950) that may correspond to
periods of higher rainfall and greater sta-
bility in climate. As an indicator of mois-
ture stress, and therefore an additional
proxy measure of rainfall and tempera-
ture, Myles R. Miller (1996a) illustrates
trends in measured delta 13C values from
more than seven hundred radiocarbon-
dated C3 wood charcoal samples from
the El Paso area. Although these analyses
are problematic in some regards, the two
sequences show several general correspon-
dences in periods interpreted as having
increased precipitation and perhaps a
more stable and predictable climatic re-
gime. Interestingly, several of these inter-
vals correlate with broad trends and tran-
sitions in adaptive systems and other
archeological patterns during the Forma-
tive period in west Texas and southern
New Mexico (see below).

The present-day topography of much of
the region consists of mesquite-stabilized
coppice dunes. The prevalence of desert
shrub plants such as mesquite and cre-
osote is thought to have resulted from the
introduction of cattle and resultant over-
grazing in the late 1800s, combined with

episodic periods of drought. The modern
climate of the region is characterized as
semiarid. Average annual rainfall through-
out most of the Trans-Pecos is less than
eight inches, with much of the rainfall
occurring during July, August, and Sep-
tember, and the spring usually being the
driest period of the year. As with most
desert environments, substantial variation
exists in precipitation rates over a period
of years or decades. Rainfall during the
summer monsoon occurs in localized,
high-intensity thunderstorms. In addi-
tion, evaporation rates are high due to
high temperatures. Taken together, these
climatic patterns created an uncertain,
unpredictable, and geographically vari-
able environment from year to year. Ac-
cordingly, subsistence, mobility, and
scheduling patterns of prehistoric popula-
tions were, to a large extent, inﬂuenced
by these parameters.

Status of Archeological
Investigations and Background
for Inquiry

Following Mallouf (1985), we divide
the Trans-Pecos region into eastern and
western segments. The western segment,
including El Paso, Hudspeth, and west-
ern Culberson Counties, has traditionally
been subsumed within the Jornada Mo-
gollon culture region of the greater South-
west (Lehmer 1948; Leslie 1979). The
eastern segment includes Brewster, Pre-
sidio, Jeff Davis, Terrell, Pecos, and Reeves
Counties.

The division is certainly arbitrary,
based as it is primarily on such trait mark-
ers as the presence of ceramics and archi-
tectural settlements. The use of such an
artiﬁcial construct undoubtedly obscures
some important aspects of prehistoric oc-
cupation and interaction in the region.
Nevertheless, it serves as a useful point
of departure for discussions to follow.
Equally important, the division also re-
ﬂects the disparity in data available from
the western and eastern segments. Be-
cause of several factors, including the pre-
dominance of private land, the remote-
ness of the region, and absence of major
urban centers, archeological surveys in
the eastern Trans-Pecos and indeed any-
where east of El Paso County have been
few and far between.

search Laboratory, at the University of
Texas, and Texas Site Atlas Project, under
the aegis of the Texas Historical Commis-
sion (Table 7.1 and Fig. 7.3), for each of
the counties in the region were compared
with the size of the county. El Paso
County has the highest number of re-
corded sites (in fact the highest quantity
of recorded sites of any county in the
state) because of environmental laws that
have required large-scale systematic arche-

ological surveys by the U.S. Army at Fort
Bliss (Burgett n.d.; Lukowski 1997; Lu-
kowski and Stuart 1996; Whalen 1977,
1978), the Texas General Land Ofﬁce
(Lynn et al. 1975), the Texas Water De-
velopment Board (Peterson and Brown
1992a), the City of El Paso (Kauffman
and Stuart 1994), and other project
sponsors prior to land development and
construction projects. East of El Paso,
however, many fewer construction and

development projects have been under-
taken, and the number of sites dramati-
cally decreases while county size increases.
For example, in Culberson County a se-
ries of surveys near Van Horn (Hedrick
1968, 1975, 1989, 1991) and inventories
of sites within the Guadalupe Mountains
National Park (Applegarth 1976; Boisvert
1980; Katz and Katz 1974; P. Katz 1978;
Kenmotsu 1993; Phelps 1974; Shafer
1970) are responsible for the bulk of the
recorded sites. Similarly, most sites in
Brewster and Presidio Counties have been
recorded during inventories in Big Bend
National Park and Big Bend Ranch State
Park (Campbell 1970; Ing et al. 1996;
Mallouf 1993; Mallouf and Wulfkuhle
1989). Hudspeth, Pecos, and Terrell
Counties have seen systematic surveys for
land impacts (Cloud 1989; Shafer 1971;
Warren 1977), but these have largely
been conﬁned to small areas and most of
these counties remain largely unknown.
Elsewhere, systematic archeological sur-
veys have been sporadic, often consisting
of linear surveys for pipelines (Ackerly
et al. 1987; Zier 1996), highways (Craw-
ford 1971), or road improvements as part
of the Joint Task Force 6 project (Lowry
1999; Sale and Gibbs 1998). Reeves
County, with only twenty-three recorded
sites, has received the least amount of
archeological attention.

Survey level data are often problem-
atic, and thus an even greater issue is the
paucity of excavation data from the east-
ern Trans-Pecos. The few excavations that
have been conducted in the Guadalupe
Mountains have largely focused on caves
and rockshelters (Ayers 1936; Mera 1938;
Roney 1985, 1995; Schroeder 1983) that
represent only a handful of the total sites
in the range. Only Susan M. Applegarth
(1976) and Susana R. Katz (1978) have
investigated open sites. A small number
of sites have been investigated in the
La Junta region (Cloud et al. 1994a;
J. C. Kelley 1949; Mallouf 1990, 1995a;
Shackelford 1951, 1955), but few other
excavations have taken place. Fortunately,
this situation is being altered with a re-
newed emphasis on archeological investi-
gations at the Center for Big Bend Stud-
ies in Alpine.

Obtaining a ﬁrm count of excavated
sites across the region proved impractical,
and as an alternative we have summed the
number of radiocarbon dates and radio-
carbon-dated sites within each county

tories and overviews of the eastern Trans-
Pecos (Cloud et al. 1994; J. C. Kelley
et al. 1940; J. C. Kelley 1985, 1986; Ken-
motsu 1994; Mallouf 1985, 1990; see
also Sebastian and Larralde 1989), our
discussion relies on a variety of published
and unpublished material from archeo-
logical investigations that have taken
place in the region over the last eight de-
cades. Also, because we use previously
published data, a few words about the na-
ture of that data are in order. First, the
data are of varying quality. Field methods
today emphasize thorough documentation
during site investigations and typically in-
clude the recovery of special samples for
radiocarbon dating, macrobotanical re-
mains, or other speciﬁc analyses. These
methods, and many of the analyses, were
either unknown or not used in the past.
Thus, the modern researcher who seeks

to study excavations from the 1950s
through 1970s can ﬁnd it difﬁcult to
correlate speciﬁc artifacts with one or
another level in the site or to understand
how one area of a site may relate to an-
other. That successful correlation is not
impossible is demonstrated by Christine
G. Ward (1992), who analyzed the collec-
tions recovered ﬁfty years earlier from the
Shelby Brooks Cave in eastern Culberson
County.

The following discussion is structured
within the traditional cultural-historical
sequence of Paleoindian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric/Formative, and Protohistoric/
Spanish Colonial periods. When neces-
sary, we refer to more speciﬁc phase des-
ignations or subdivisions. The taxonomic
sequences used in this chapter for the
western and eastern Trans-Pecos regions
are illustrated in Fig. 7.4. Problems with

Fig. 7.4. Late Archaic through Spanish Colonial, and Paleoindian through Late Archaic cul-
tural sequences of the eastern and western Trans-Pecos.

(see Table 7.1). We intend this informa-
tion to serve as a proxy measure indicat-
ing the relative numbers of sites at which
some excavations have taken place. As ex-
pected, El Paso County has had by far the
most intensive work (716 radiocarbon
dates from 185 sites). Several habitation
sites (Batcho et al. 1985; Bentley n.d.;
Bradley 1983; Browning et al. 1992;
Carmichael 1985; Fields and Girard
1983; Foster and Bradley 1984; Hard
1983a, n.d.; Kauffman 1984; Kegley
1982; M. Miller 1989, 1990; M. Miller
and Stuart 1991; O’Laughlin 1980; Scar-
borough 1986a, 1986b; Whalen 1994a)
and virtually hundreds of small sites
within Fort Bliss (Burgett n.d.; Lowry
and Bentley 1997; Mauldin et al. 1998;
O’Laughlin and Martin 1989, 1990;
Whalen 1980a) and elsewhere in the
vicinity of El Paso have been investigated
(Camilli et al. 1988; Doleman et al. 1991;
O’Leary 1987; Seaman et al. 1988). A re-
cent and particularly welcome develop-
ment is the increasing number of investi-
gations taking place in the Rio Grande
Valley (Lower Valley of El Paso) that have
broadened our understanding of Spanish
Colonial period settlement and adaptation
(D. O. Brown et al. 1994, 1995; D. Mar-
tin 1999; M. Miller and O’Leary 1992a;
Vierra et al. 1997, 1999).

Culberson and Hudspeth Counties
follow, with intensive dating studies con-
ducted at Wind Mountain (Hines et al.
1994), Granado Cave (Hamilton 1998),
and several sites investigated along the All
American Pipeline (M. Miller 1994; New
Mexico State University and Continuum
Corp. 1989) and Samalayuca Pipeline
(Mauldin and Leach 1997; Staley and
Turnbow 1995). Radiocarbon dates have
recently been obtained from important
settlements in the La Junta and Big Bend
regions (Cloud et al. 1994; Mallouf 1990)
and from Balmorhea State Park in Jeff
Davis County (Charles 1994). Elsewhere
throughout the Trans-Pecos, however,
few or no radiocarbon dates are available,
particularly in those counties centered on
the Stockton and Delaware Basins, and
therefore prehistoric patterns and devel-
opments based on absolute dates in these
areas are very poorly known.

With these factors in mind, the out-
line of the human occupation of this vast
region that we offer is tentative, and, at
times, we draw heavily on data from sur-
rounding regions. Like other culture his-

continued reference to, and reliance on,
phase sequences have been noted by sev-
eral archeologists in the region (Car-
michael 1982a, 1984, 1985; Mauldin
1995; M. Miller 1993a), and while ac-
knowledging the validity of these argu-
ments, the conventional use of periods
and phases provides a convenient frame-
work for discussions of long-term pro-
cesses in prehistory.

We also rely on inferences and pattern

identiﬁcations that are heavily based on
radiocarbon dates. These patterns are
usually contrasted with other lines of evi-
dence to arrive at a wider view of trends
and transitions in prehistoric settlement
and adaptation. The use of chronometric
dates to examine broad trends also reﬂects
the fact that for most of the region, and
particularly in central basin landforms
where most archeological work has been

conducted from about 1980 to the end of
the century, settlements spanning the en-
tire Archaic and Formative period se-
quences are compressed within shallow
(less than 1 m) geomorphic deposits.

Pre-Clovis and “Pre-Projectile
Point” Cultural Traditions
(ca. 35,000 to 10,000 B.C.)

The existence of pre-Clovis occupa-
tions— or a “Pre-Projectile Point Hori-
zon” as occasionally referred to in earlier
studies—in North America has been the
subject of considerable debate since Alex
D. Krieger ﬁrst suggested that pre-Clovis
lithic traditions existed in Texas and else-
where throughout the United States be-
tween 40,000 and 15,000 b.c. (Krieger
1953, 1962, 1964; see also Meltzer et al.
1997). Claims of pre-Clovis manifesta-

tions in the Jornada Mogollon region
have recently been resurrected, and un-
surprisingly they have also created a
substantial amount of controversy and
skepticism. While often disregarded in
prehistoric overviews of the Trans-Pecos,
the subject of pre-Clovis occupations de-
serves some mention in light of recent
ﬁndings throughout the Americas (e.g.,
Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer 1993a,
1993b; Meltzer et al. 1997), particularly
since one of the more controversial candi-
dates for having a pre-Clovis occupation,
Pendejo Cave, is situated north of and
just across the Texas-New Mexico state
line from El Paso.

Recently, the existence of a pre-Clovis
cultural tradition in the American South-
west has been proposed by Richard Mac-
Neish based on his excavations at Pendejo
Cave, a deeply stratiﬁed rockshelter lo-
cated on McGregor Guided Missile
Range east of Orogrande, New Mexico
(MacNeish 1993a; MacNeish et al.
1993; see also Chrisman et al. 1996).
Zones C1 through O, with a seemingly
well-stratiﬁed sequence of radiocarbon
dates ranging between twelve thousand
and more than ﬁfty thousand years in
age, contained large quantities of Pleisto-
cene faunal material, well-preserved plant
remains, and other ecofacts purportedly
in association with hearths, stone arti-
facts, modiﬁed animal bones, and human
skin impressions and hair.

Middle and Late Holocene occupa-
tions of the shelter by human groups are
not contested. Zones A through C con-
tained preserved corncobs, cordage, and a
sample of recognizable chipped stone and
ceramic artifacts. The ages of these items,
plus two radiocarbon age estimates ob-
tained directly from sandal fragments re-
covered from these strata, occupy a range
within the Early and Late Archaic peri-
ods. Arguments for a human presence in
the cave during the Late Pleistocene,
prior to 10,000 b.c. and up to thirty-ﬁve
thousand years in age, are based on less
conclusive ﬁndings. Claims of pre-Clovis
occupations rest primarily on a small
quantity of crudely manufactured stone
artifacts, a very small number of bones
with fractures or marks suggestive of hu-
man modiﬁcation, hearth features con-
structed of stones differing petrologically
and chemically from the limestone rock
formations comprising the natural setting
of the cave, and the presence of hair and

skin imprints claimed to be of human
origin.

Aside from the manuscripts cited above
and the American Antiquity article (Chris-
man et al. 1996) describing claims for
human friction skin impressions and that
also provides the ﬁrst coherent list of
chronometric dates from the shelter, the
only fully reported analysis and discus-
sion of materials from the cave involves
the sample of Pleistocene faunal remains
(A. Harris 1995). Most of the special
studies cited in support of arguments for
human occupation or manipulation of
certain materials and artifacts remain in
manuscript form at the Andover Founda-
tion for Archeological Research. Appar-
ently a sample of rock used in the hearth
features was submitted for neutron acti-
vation analysis (Pavlish 1994, cited in
Chrisman et al. 1996); however, no for-
mal description of the study has been
published, and therefore the sampling
criteria, element concentration data, and
statistical basis for claiming a nonlocal
origin for the hearth stones have not been
independently evaluated. Similarly, petro-
graphic analyses of a ﬂake artifact and
other lithic materials have been used to
support the claim that the artifacts were
also made of a material foreign to the cave
(Clemons 1992, partially reproduced in
MacNeish 1993a; also cited in Chrisman
et al. 1996). In addition, Richard S. Mac-
Neish (1993a) notes informally that ther-
moluminescence analysis of the hearth
stones demonstrated that interior stones
were subjected to higher temperatures
than those at the margins of the feature,
and he argues that this ﬁnding veriﬁes that
the features were used by humans and did
not represent natural clusters of rock.

The article by Chrisman et al. (1996)
describing human skin friction imprints
promptly became the subject of several
commentary articles. In support of criti-
cisms regarding the skin imprints, it
should be noted that Fort Bliss retains a
copy of the original study conducted by
the Ontario Provincial Police Forensics
Laboratory, which states that no evidence
of sweat pores could be detected among
the imprints, leading one investigator to
conclude that a nonhuman agent could
possibly have made the marks. The small
sample of bone and stone artifacts has
been examined by several researchers, in-
cluding the authors of this chapter during

a 1991 visit to the site. Most who have
viewed the material have informally com-
mented on the extremely crude nature of
the tools and the absence of attributes
typical of chipped stone artifacts and ac-
cordingly have expressed serious reserva-
tions over their human origin. A ﬁnal
point is that Arthur Harris’s detailed
study of more than thirty-six thousand
faunal specimens found no evidence of
human action or modiﬁcation in the as-
semblage, and he explicitly states in the
summary that “other than the widespread
occurrence of burned bone, the sample
appears no different than natural, non-
human-related cave accumulations that
have been examined elsewhere. At least
some of the burning seems consistent
with burning or smoldering of strata
post-depositionally, as also seen else-
where” (A. Harris 1995, 37).

An independent evaluation of the site
conducted in 1995 by Fort Bliss archeol-
ogists and Tom Stafford (INSTAAR, Uni-
versity of Colorado) resulted in a revised
interpretation of the stratigraphic se-
quence. In addition, ﬁfteen AMS radio-
carbon dates were obtained from rodent
pellets collected from well-documented
columns in two exposed proﬁles in the
shelter. The results of this study have not
been reported, but initial analyses suggest
that the stratigraphic sequence and as-
sumed integrity of the layered deposits
may require substantial reconsideration
(Galen Burgett 1998, personal communi-
cation; Thomas Stafford 1995, personal
communication). Extensive packrat mid-
dens are present throughout the shelter,
and preliminary results of the radiocar-
bon dating suggest that the degree of dis-
turbance in the deposits is greater than
previously assumed (Thomas Stafford
1995, personal communication). Another
potentially serious issue is that alternating
layers of uncharred and charred organic
material were often characterized as dis-
crete, sealed stratigraphic units, while
many such deposits may represent indi-
vidual, natural depositional units exposed
to different levels of heat during major
ﬁres inside the cave (i.e., a lower level of
unburned material; a middle level com-
prising incompletely combusted materials
and charcoal; and an upper level of mate-
rials reduced to ash). Based on examina-
tion of the remaining deposits, Burgett
suggests that the sediments at Pendejo

Cave represent a massive but complex de-
positional sequence in which bioturba-
tion and burning have played a major role
and that it will take much higher resolu-
tion methods than used during the origi-
nal excavation to accurately deﬁne and
characterize the stratigraphic sequence or
to support the argument for a Pleistocene
human presence.

Although Pendejo Cave has received
the greatest degree of attention— or no-
toriety—since ﬁrst publicized in the early
1990s, additional claims of pre-Clovis oc-
cupations have been made for the eastern
Trans-Pecos. A. A. Andretta (1976, 1977)
proposed the existence of a pre-projectile
point (pre-Clovis) horizon on the basis of
several anomalous collections of desert-
varnished lithic artifacts found through-
out the Davis Mountains. Subsequent
studies (Andretta 1982; Ezell 1982) linked
the Davis Mountains lithic complex to
geologic deposits with an estimated age
of approximately nineteen thousand years
ago, and several similarities between the
Davis Mountains materials and the San
Dieguito cultures of southern California
and the north Mexican state of Sonora
have been claimed (Hayden and Andretta
1984). No chronometric dates have been
obtained from the geologic formation,
and the criteria on which the deposits
were dated remain mostly unspeciﬁed.
Moreover, the association between arti-
facts and the deposit remains tentative,
and whether they represent occupation
surfaces on past erosional surfaces re-
mains unclear. The rate of desert varnish
formation has not been critically evalu-
ated to determine whether the artifacts
could be of great age, but as no further
investigations have been conducted since
the mid-1980s the purported antiquity of
the deposits and the cultural origin of the
artifacts remain unresolved.

Paleoindian Period
(10,000 – 6000 B.C.)

The earliest accepted evidence of pre-
historic human occupation in the Trans-
Pecos is from the Paleoindian period.
Paleoindian adaptations have typically
been viewed as a tradition of small, highly
mobile bands with a subsistence economy
centered around the hunting of large
mammals such as mammoth and bison
( Judge 1973). The period may be sub-

divided into three sequential traditions
marked by functional and stylistic differ-
ences in tool kits thought to reﬂect chang-
ing hunting and settlement adaptations:
the Clovis Complex, Folsom Complex,
and the Plano/Cody Complexes.

The Paleoindian period in the Trans-
Pecos is generally dated from 10,000 to
6000 b.c., although this time range is
subject to revision since no chronometric
dates have been obtained from contexts
unambiguously associated with Paleo-
indian materials. Recognition of Paleo-
indian sites and traditions in the Trans-
Pecos has been accomplished mostly
through cross-dating distinctive lanceo-
late projectile point forms with those
found at chronometrically dated occupa-
tion or kill sites in adjacent regions of the
Texas Panhandle, eastern New Mexico,
and across the Great Plains (see, e.g.,
Haynes 1992; Holliday 1997a; Johnson
and Holliday 1981; Wheat 1972).
At the present time, no absolute
chronometric dates have been obtained
from contexts or features in secure associ-
ation with Paleoindian materials in the
Trans-Pecos (Table 7.2). The only radio-

carbon dates falling within this period
were obtained from undescribed deposits
of charred material deeply buried in
ﬂoodplain alluvium of the Rio Grande
Valley north of Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The samples were collected during geo-
morphological studies of Quaternary sur-
faces in the valley (Gile et al. 1981; Met-
calf 1969). Unfortunately, the features or
deposits from which the samples were ob-
tained were not described, and whether
they represented hearths or noncultural
deposits of charred material is unknown.
Two dates from the deepest deposits in
Fresnal Shelter partially extend into the
latter part of the Paleoindian period, and
the earlier of the two dates (ISGS-812)
and the stratigraphic context from which
it was obtained suggested a Late Paleo-
indian occupation (Carmichael 1982b;
R. Jones 1990). Edgar B. Howard (1932,
1935) reported the recovery of a ﬂuted
point from a deposit containing bones of
extinct fauna at Burnet Cave in the Gua-
dalupe Mountains. A radiocarbon date of
7432 ! 300 b.p. has been reported dur-
ing a subsequent study conducted on ma-
terials from the cave (see discussion in

Roney 1995, 17), but the association be-
tween the radiocarbon age, projectile
point, and faunal material could not be
clearly established.

Finally, radiocarbon dates ranging
slightly earlier than the accepted age of
the Clovis Complex have been obtained
from two sites. MacNeish reports ﬁve
dates from Zones C1 and C2 at Pendejo
Cave (Chrisman et al. 1996), and two are
claimed to be in association with human
friction skin imprints. Both dates tend to
be earlier than accepted dates for Clovis,
but other dates from strata situated above
or below Zones C1 and C2 substantially
predate or postdate the Paleoindian pe-
riod. Similarly, Edwin N. Ferndon, Jr.
(1946), and C. Bertrand Schultz et al.
(1970) describe the excavations at Hermit
Cave in the Guadalupe Mountains where
basal deposits in the shelter contained
Pleistocene fauna in association with a
purported hearth feature. Although no
artifacts were found in the deposit, the
excavators claimed that the entrance had
been partially barricaded with logs. Cali-
brated radiocarbon dates obtained from
charcoal and wood in the hearth and
one of the logs range from 14,360 to
11,100 b.c.

Despite the absence of chronometric
dates in unquestionable association with
Paleoindian artifacts or features, a sub-
stantial number of Paleoindian manifesta-
tions have been recorded across the Trans-
Pecos. Fig. 7.5 presents a summary of
these ﬁndings based on ﬁgures provided
in Amick (1994a), Mallouf (1985),
Mauldin and O’Leary (1994), and Som-
mer (1974). However, Paleoindian com-
ponents are rare when compared to the
numbers of sites documented for later
time periods. Problems of archeological
recognition may have contributed to this
perception. Paleoindian sites probably ex-
ist in greater numbers but are buried by
later alluvial deposits and remain unde-
tected during surface survey. In a remark-
ably rapid case of alluvial deposition in
the La Junta region, Robert Mallouf
(1991, 5 – 6) describes a hearth feature
buried at a depth of 6 m in an arroyo
proﬁle at the Adobe Walls Draw site
(41BS751) that provided a radiocarbon
age estimate postdating a.d. 600. It is also
possible that Paleoindian components
consisting of scatters of lithic debitage but
otherwise lacking distinctive projectile

1990). These environmental changes
were also marked by the extinction of the
large game animals such as mammoth,
mastodon, and bison thought to have
been a primary food resource for Paleo-
indian groups (Mallouf 1981).

Early Paleoindian: Clovis Complex

Knowledge of Clovis occupation of the

Trans-Pecos and Jornada Mogollon re-
gions has been obtained almost entirely
through rare and isolated ﬁnds of the dis-
tinctive, ﬂuted lanceolate Clovis projectile
points (Campbell 1970; Harkey 1981;
Krone 1976; MacNeish 1993b; O’Laugh-
lin et al. 1988). Similar artifacts have
been observed in private collections, but
overall, few Clovis points and even fewer
Clovis sites have been documented (par-
ticularly when comparing the Trans-Pecos
and Jornada Mogollon regions to the
Southern Plains and south Texas; see
Meltzer and Bever 1995), despite several
extensive and intensive archeological sur-
veys in southern New Mexico (Beckes
et al. 1977; Carmichael 1983, 1986;
Camilli et al. 1988; Doleman et al. 1991;
Duran 1982; Lukowski and Stuart 1996;
Mauldin et al. 1997; Oakes 1981; Raves-
loot 1988; Seaman et al. 1988; Skelton
et al. 1981), the western Trans-Pecos
(Lynn and Baskin 1976; Lynn et al.
1975; Whalen 1977, 1978), or the east-
ern Trans-Pecos (Ing et al. 1996; Mallouf
1993). Clovis manifestations were seldom
mentioned among the collected ﬁndings
of several avocational groups presented at
the 1973 Southwest Federation of Ar-
chaeological Societies Early Man Confer-
ence (Sommer 1974, 134 –36).

Two habitation sites of this period
have been reported from the Jornada Mo-
gollon region. Patrick H. Beckett (1983)
notes Clovis tools mixed with later Paleo-
indian materials at a site in Rhodes Can-
yon in the southern Tularosa Basin of
New Mexico. A substantial Clovis occu-
pation is reported in Weber and Agogino
(1968) at Mockingbird Gap in the north-
ern Tularosa Basin. The site apparently
had several suspected living surfaces and
approximately one hundred whole and
partial Clovis points, but the site and arti-
fact assemblage have not been reported in
sufﬁcient detail to make any ﬁrm inter-
pretations regarding the site’s function.
No habitation sites or kill sites have been
identiﬁed in the eastern Trans-Pecos. Due

Fig. 7.5. Paleoindian components in Trans-Pecos Texas and south-central New Mexico.

points, bifaces, end scrapers, and other
diagnostic tool forms of the period may
have been unrecognized during surveys.
Paleoindian tools are also common
among private artifact collections, and the
degree to which removal of these artifacts
has contributed to this recognition prob-
lem is unknown.

Although several sites of this period
have been investigated, results of excava-
tions have been reported in detail only
in relatively recent years (Elyea 1988;
Mauldin and Leach 1997; Mauldin and
O’Leary 1994). Two of the more promis-
ing sites represent longer or more inten-
sive occupations with some degree of in-
tegrity— Chispa Creek and Mockingbird
Gap—but they were excavated during
the late 1960s and have never been fully
reported. To further complicate matters,
many known sites are severely eroded,
and Paleoindian materials are often mixed
with artifacts deposited during later occu-
pations. For instance, seventeen charcoal
and bulk soil samples from hearth fea-
tures distributed throughout the eastern

segment of the Fillmore Pass site on Fort
Bliss yielded radiocarbon dates ranging in
age from 1890 b.c. to the Historic period
(Carmichael and Meyer n.d.), despite the
fact that a sizable collection of Folsom
tools, preforms, and channel ﬂakes was
recovered during excavations in the west-
ern segment.

Environmental conditions during the
Paleoindian period in the Trans-Pecos are
characteristic of the Pleistocene-Holocene
transition: West Texas was characterized
by moist woodlands and continual stream
ﬂow in mountain zones, with standing
lakes and marshes throughout interior ba-
sins. Studies of packrat middens (Van
Devender 1990) suggest juniper-oak
woodland communities along with grass-
land savannas in interior basins during
the early half of the period. Increasingly
dry conditions prevailed from 10,000 to
6000 b.c., when most of the woodland
environments had been displaced by
plant communities characteristic of the
Chihuahuan Desert (Mallouf 1981;
Monger and Buck 1995; Van Devender

to the absence of excavation and distribu-
tional data, the nature of Clovis settle-
ment types, hunting and subsistence
adaptations, mobility patterns, and tech-
nological organization in the Trans-Pecos
is poorly known.

Early Paleoindian: Folsom Complex

Folsom manifestations in the Trans-
Pecos are much better known than are
their Clovis predecessors. Several excava-
tions at Folsom components have been
undertaken from the late 1980s to 1990s
(Ackerly et al. 1987; Carmichael and
Meyer n.d.; Mauldin and Leach 1997;
Mauldin and O’Leary 1994). In addition,
the nature of Folsom tool forms, subsis-
tence adaptations, and mobility patterns
has recently been the subject of inquiry
(Amick 1994a, 1995, 1996).

In contrast to the preceding Clovis pe-
riod, numerous Folsom period points and
occupation sites have been recorded dur-
ing archeological surveys (e.g., Beckes
1977; Beckett 1983; Carmichael 1986;
Hester 1977c; O’Hara 1988; M. Miller
et al. 1988; Whalen 1978). Stuart (1997)
has reported a cluster of Folsom compo-
nents distributed around the margins of a
drainage channel leading from a fault line
escarpment north of El Paso. Surface col-
lection activities recovered more than a
dozen fragmentary and whole Folsom
points, in addition to a substantial num-
ber of steep edge angle tools (Fig. 7.6).
Isolated Folsom and Midland points have
been described by Brook (1968a) and
Quimby and Brook (1967), while Ander-
son and Carter (1985; see also Kauffman
1984) report on a fragmentary Folsom
point at the Vista Hills site in east El
Paso. Several of the larger sites in the re-
gion have been reported by avocational
archeologists (e.g., J. Davis 1975), includ-
ing the Cruz Tarin site (Everitt and Davis
1974), Moody Tank (Russell 1968), and
Three Buttes (Krone 1975).

In the eastern Trans-Pecos, Folsom
ﬁnds have been reported from the Guada-
lupe Mountains (Boisvert 1980; P. Katz
1978), and Hedrick (1989) reports a frag-
mentary Folsom point at site 41CU373
several miles east of Van Horn in the Salt
Flat Basin. Sommer (1974) provides a
comprehensive list of sites documented
by professional and avocational groups,
noting concentrations of Paleoindian oc-
cupations along the Pecos River valley in

the Stockton Plateau, the Big Bend region,
the Marfa Plains south of Van Horn, and
in the Hueco/ Tularosa Bolsons.

Folsom occupation in the eastern
Trans-Pecos is known primarily through
the excavation of an extensive occupation
site on Chispa Creek south of Van Horn
in Culberson County. Chispa Creek is a
tributary to Wild Horse Draw, which, in
turn, is part of the southern watershed of
Salt Flat Basin and therefore is strategi-
cally situated along a major north-south
transit corridor. The excavations were
conducted by the University of Colorado
in 1967 under the direction of Joe Ben
Wheat. Although the results of the exca-
vations have not been formally reported,
Lindsay (1969) summarized the ﬁndings.
Three areas having high numbers of Fol-
som points were chosen for excavation.
The artifact assemblage includes more
than one hundred Folsom points and
many channel ﬂakes, ﬁve hundred scrap-
ers, numerous other tools such as gravers
and bifacial knives, and large quantities of
chipping debris. East of the Pecos River
in Loving County, a Folsom component
at 41LV3 was excavated in 1985. A Fol-
som base, a small collection of tools and
channel ﬂakes, and a large quantity of
debitage were recovered there (Ackerly
et al. 1987). Situated in eolian deposits at
times reaching depths of 2 m, the assem-
blage was apparently heavily mixed with
later Archaic materials.

The problem of assemblage mixing is
typical of many Paleoindian sites in the
Trans-Pecos. With the possible but un-
conﬁrmed exception of Chispa Creek,
most investigated Paleoindian sites also
contain substantial occupations of later
periods mixed throughout heavily dis-
turbed eolian soil deposits. In other cases,
Folsom and other Paleoindian materials
occur in lag contexts on paleodeﬂational
surfaces, such as the surface dating to
7000 b.p. identiﬁed by Monger (1993).
The general absence of discrete strati-
graphic zones or depositional units makes
it difﬁcult to separate nondiagnostic deb-
itage associated with Paleoindian occupa-
tions from that deposited during subse-
quent use of a locality. Accordingly,
analyses of Paleoindian lithic assemblages
have focused on diagnostic bifacial tools
and projectile points, transverse or “snub-
nose” scrapers and other tools with steep
edge angles, channel ﬂakes, and denticu-

late radial break tools. When coupled
with detailed studies of raw material
types, important insights into regional
mobility patterns of Paleoindian groups
and functional aspects of their settle-
ments are emerging. Such studies are
being pursued at substantial Folsom com-
ponents, such as Fillmore Pass on Fort
Bliss (Carmichael and Meyer n.d.), Boles
Well in the Tularosa Basin (Mauldin and
O’Leary 1994), and Padre Canyon sites
41HZ504 and 41HZ505 in the Hueco
Bolson southeast of El Paso (Mauldin and
Leach 1997). Lithic assemblages typically
contain very high proportions of high-
quality, ﬁne-grained materials. For ex-
ample, more than 95 to 99 percent of the
lithic assemblages from 41HZ505 and
41HZ504, respectively, consist of ﬁne-
grained cherts and chalcedonies (Mauldin
and Leach 1997). The lithic assemblage
from Fillmore Pass had a higher propor-
tion of obsidian than occurs naturally in
local gravel deposits (Carmichael 1994).
More detailed examination of recent

collections has identiﬁed several raw
material types obtained from primary
sources located a distance of up to 450 km
from the Hueco and Tularosa Bolsons
(Fig. 7.7). This situation is consistent
with patterns of raw material movement

detected among several North American
Paleoindian assemblages (Bamforth 1985;
Emery and Stanford 1982; Frison and
Stanford 1982; Hester et al. 1985; Melt-
zer 1985; Wilmsen and Roberts 1978).
Amick (1994a, 1994b) has identiﬁed
Chuska and Edwards Plateau chert from
northwestern New Mexico and the Texas
Panhandle, respectively, among the col-
lection of Folsom points and tools from
the Jornada region, and similar ﬁndings
have been reported from Boles Well and
Padre Canyon (Mauldin and Leach 1997;
Mauldin and O’Leary 1994). Carmichael
(1998, personal communication) also
notes that Edwards Plateau chert, along
with suspected Alibates material, was
present in around 1 percent of the Fol-
som assemblage from Fillmore Pass. X-ray
ﬂuorescence analysis of obsidian artifacts
from Fillmore Pass has identiﬁed several
specimens from the Cow Canyon source
in eastern Arizona (Shackley 1994), and
at least one artifact assigned to the Jemez
region of northern New Mexico retained
a remnant of non-waterworn cortex, in-
dicating procurement of this material at
the primary source rather than from sec-
ondary gravel deposits in the Rio Grande
Valley.

materials among various classes of tools
and debitage have been used to infer as-
pects of site function during Folsom
times. Carmichael (1998, personal com-
munication) observes that discarded Fol-
som point basal fragments at Fillmore
Pass are entirely of nonlocal materials.
Conversely, the Folsom preforms and
many channel ﬂakes are predominantly of
local materials (including the distinctive
Rancheria chert), suggesting that inhabi-
tants were retooling at the site. Addition-
ally, a distinctive brown chert thought to
be of nonlocal origin was observed only
among the collection of ﬁnished formal
tools at the Padre Canyon sites, suggest-
ing that these tools had been manufac-
tured elsewhere and transported to the
site in ﬁnal form (Mauldin and Leach
1997).

Considered within a larger perspective,
these ﬁndings lend support to interpreta-
tions regarding the distinctive nature of
Folsom subsistence and land use in the
Southwest (Amick 1994a, 1996). Daniel
Amick’s comprehensive review of Folsom
occupations in the Jornada Mogollon re-
gion, including several collections from
west Texas, considers a sample of more
than 500 point specimens and several
hundred preforms and channel ﬂakes.
Included in this study were 173 Folsom
points, 69 preforms, and 206 channel
ﬂakes from the Lone Butte and Three
Buttes Folsom localities of the Tularosa
Basin north of El Paso. Amick (1994a,
1996) argues convincingly on the basis
of assemblage content and raw material
sources that Folsom settlement in the Tu-
larosa/Hueco Bolsons involved a pattern
of residential settlements oriented toward
hunting game animals other than bison, a
pattern that differs signiﬁcantly from that
of the Southern Plains, where typical Fol-
som land use patterns involve logistical
sites occupied during the course of bison
hunts. In addition, Folsom occupations
in the Tularosa Basin can be linked to an
extensive regional land use system that
included the Southern Plains.

Late Paleoindian Plano
and Cody Complexes

A variety of tool traditions that have
been recognized for the Late Paleoindian
period are collectively referred to as the
Plano and Cody Complexes (Wheat
1972). Meserve, Golondrina, Angostura,

Eden, and Scottsbluff points characterize
the period, although based on the recorded
distribution of projectile point forms
through the Trans-Pecos (Sommer 1974),
it appears that the last two forms may oc-
cur mostly in the western Trans-Pecos.

As with the Early Paleoindian period,

Plano and Cody Complex occupations
have been documented through numer-
ous surface ﬁnds across the Trans-Pecos,
but again substantial or well-documented
occupation sites of this period are rare.
On the basis of survey data it appears that
Late Paleoindian materials are more com-
mon than Clovis and Folsom in the east-
ern Trans-Pecos, although this may be a
product of site visibility and recognition.
Projectile types attributed to the Plano
and Cody traditions have been found at
several small sites in the Davis Mountains
(Marmaduke and Whitsett 1975), Big
Bend National Park and State Ranch
(T. N. Campbell 1970; Cloud and Mal-
louf 1996; Mallouf and Wulfkuhle 1989),
and the Stockton Plateau (Sommer 1974).
In the western Trans-Pecos, these materi-
als are also well represented in the Guada-
lupe Mountains (Boisvert 1980; P. Katz
1978; Katz and Katz 1975; Marmaduke
1978a), the Diablo Plateau (Ackerly et al.
1987), and Salt Flat Basin (Hedrick 1968,
1975). Isolated ﬁnds of Plano and Cody
Complex tools are common throughout
the Tularosa, Mesilla, and Hueco Bolsons
(Beckes 1977; Brook 1968b; Carmichael
1986; Hester 1977c; O’Hara 1988). Un-
like the situation in the eastern Trans-
Pecos, the frequency of Late Paleoindian
components in the western Trans-Pecos
does not appear to be greater than that of
the earlier Folsom components.

Late Paleoindian components occur
across a wide range of topographic zones,
including mountains, alluvial fans, and
the Diablo Plateau. Most ﬁnds, however,
have been in basin landforms near major
playas or along the margins of the Rio
Grande Valley, a pattern observed by Car-
michael (1986) in the Tularosa Basin. Pre-
sumably, this widespread pattern reﬂects
the adaptation of hunting large game ani-
mals that remained close to these large
permanent water sources. As suggested by
Mallouf (1981, 1985), this pattern may
also reﬂect a continuation of hunting tra-
ditions in what were probably the last lo-
cations with suitable habitats for large
game animals, while populations in other

areas of the Trans-Pecos may have begun
the transition to Archaic hunting and
gathering economies as a response to
changing environmental conditions.
The ﬁnding of a signiﬁcant Plano
Complex occupation site at 41HZ347 in-
dicates major drainages or intermittent
streams in the Diablo Plateau may have
served as important settlement locations.
Located in northwestern Hudspeth
County just east of the Hueco Moun-
tains (see Ackerly et al. 1987), the site is
situated on a low, rocky knoll overlook-
ing a wide drainage channel. Three Plain-
view points and one Angostura point
were collected from the site surface, along
with more than six hundred chipped
stone artifacts.

The most intensively studied site of
this period is LA63880, located in the
southern Tularosa Basin north of El Paso
(see Fig. 7.5). One of the largest known
Paleoindian sites in the region, the
LA63880 site covers an area of approxi-
mately 78,000 m2 and is situated 2 km
from a playa. There are four primary arti-
fact concentrations along with several low
density scatters distributed among cop-
pice dunes. Based on the presence of two
biface fragments with parallel ﬂaking, the
site has been provisionally assigned to the
Cody Complex.

Janette M. Elyea (1988) describes the
assemblage of 132 formal tools recovered
from LA63880. The majority of the tools
(76.5 percent) consist of transverse end
scrapers, although other forms included
side scrapers, bifaces, projectile point
fragments, and a burin spall. All but three
of the artifacts were manufactured from
high-quality, ﬁne-grained cherts and chal-
cedonies, including a possible specimen
of Chinle chert from the middle Rio
Grande Valley (100 km to the north).
Comparing the low diversity of tool
forms and the setting of the site to Judge’s
(1973) typology for the middle Rio
Grande Valley, Elyea interprets the loca-
tion as a processing site or base camp
rather than a kill or armament site. In ad-
dition, the majority of tools were worn
and had been extensively resharpened,
suggesting extractive tasks were per-
formed at the location. Based on the ex-
tensive site size and the unusually high
number of artifacts for Paleoindian com-
ponents in the region— combined with
the low diversity of tool forms and spatial

distribution of artifacts among several
concentrations—Elyea (1988) also inter-
prets the site as representing a series of
occupations by several small bands.

Environmental changes during the
Early Holocene brought about several
changes in human adaptation at the close
of the Paleoindian period. The persistent
drying trend continued, with a resultant
demise of large game mammals, expan-
sion of plant communities adapted to
drier conditions, and constriction of pe-
rennial water sources. These changes un-
doubtedly contributed to large-scale
changes in subsistence strategies, requir-
ing a diversiﬁcation of the Paleoindian
subsistence base with a greater focus on
exploitation of plant foods. Such changes,
and accompanying shifts in settlement
and technology, mark the onset of the Ar-
chaic period at ca. 6000 b.c.

Archaic Period (6000 B.C. to A.D. 200)

The Archaic period in the Trans-Pecos

is known through excavations in rock-
shelters and open-air sites throughout
most environmental zones of the region.
The period encompasses more than six
thousand years, and several broad adap-
tive trends and important changes in sub-
sistence and technology took place during
this time. Notable developments include
the ﬁrst archeological evidence for agri-
culture, habitation of residential pithouse
or hut structures, and the widespread use
of rock or caliche in the construction and
use of thermal features. An increase in the
range of plant materials utilized as well as
technological changes reﬂecting the pro-
cessing of these foods indicate a greater
diversiﬁcation of subsistence practices
than during the Paleoindian period.
It is generally agreed that Archaic
adaptations involved a seasonally mobile,
broad spectrum hunter-gatherer subsis-
tence and settlement adaptation with a
technology that reﬂected speciﬁc strate-
gies to deal with semiarid conditions as
well as geographic and temporal varia-
bility in the Trans-Pecos environment.
While populations were seasonally mo-
bile, what is envisioned is an increasingly
restricted mobility range or territoriality.
In terms of general, long-term trends over
this period of more than six thousand
years, it appears that increasing popula-
tion levels coupled with more diverse sub-
sistence economies led to an intensiﬁca-
tion of land use patterns as well as the

exploitation of a continually increasing
range of environmental zones. Ultimately,
in the western Trans-Pecos these processes
(although the subject of debate) may have
contributed to the adoption of agriculture
between ca. 1500 and 1000 b.c.

The six-thousand-year Archaic period

has been conventionally divided into
Early, Middle, and Late subperiods. These
subdivisions have been deﬁned primarily
on the basis of projectile point typologies
and sequences developed in adjacent re-
gions (Carmichael 1986; MacNeish
1993b; MacNeish and Beckett 1987;
Mallouf 1985, 1990; Roney 1995). How-
ever, no reliable and independently dated
projectile point sequence has been devel-
oped for the region (S. Katz 1992; Mal-
louf 1985; M. Miller 1996a; Seaman
et al. 1988), and the use of extraregional
typologies carries a substantial amount of
classiﬁcation error and chronological im-
precision. Archaic period subdivisions
also broadly correspond to paleoenviron-
mental and paleoclimatic intervals (Mal-
louf 1981; Mauldin 1995). Accordingly,
the estimated beginning or ending dates
for Early, Middle, and Late Archaic sub-
periods vary considerably between the
eastern and western Trans-Pecos.

MacNeish and Beckett (1987) and
MacNeish (1993b) have proposed an Ar-
chaic period phase sequence for the Chi-
huahua Archaic tradition. Their work
mainly provides new phase names to ex-
isting Early Archaic (Gardner Springs
phase) and Middle Archaic (Keystone
phase) time intervals, while subdividing
the Late Archaic into two phases, the
Fresnal and Hueco. Aside from minor
temporal adjustments, the sequence
maintains the general structure estab-
lished during previous studies. Few stud-
ies have been undertaken to conﬁrm or
reﬁne the sequence in terms of changing
settlement or technological adaptations
(but see S. Anderson 1993).

Prior to the 1980s, much of the infor-

mation on Archaic period material cul-
ture and settlement systems was acquired
during early and mid-1900s excavations
in a series of rockshelters in the Hueco
Mountains (Alves 1930; Cosgrove 1947;
Ellis and Hammack 1968) and the east-
ern Trans-Pecos (Cofﬁn 1932; A. Jackson
1937; V. Smith 1938; R. Tanner 1949).
More recent investigations have been
conducted as part of the Organ Moun-
tain Archaeological Project and Chi-

huahua Archaic Project (M. Johnson and
Upham 1988; MacNeish 1993b) in sev-
eral small rockshelters north of El Paso
(Fig. 7.8).

The most abundant evidence of Ar-
chaic period occupations has been ob-
tained from Fresnal Shelter, and much of
the information on early cultigens, fauna,
and other aspects of subsistence and tech-
nology has been obtained through inves-
tigations at this site. Fresnal Shelter is
situated in the Sacramento Mountains
160 km north of El Paso, at an elevation
of 6,270 feet in a southern exposure of a
cliff overlooking Fresnal Canyon, one of
several narrow drainages leading from the
mountains to the Tularosa Basin. Excava-
tions were conducted between 1969 and
1972 by Human Systems Research of
Tularosa in collaboration with Cynthia
Irwin-Williams of Eastern New Mexico
University (Human Systems Research
1972). Approximately 50 percent of the
shelter was excavated, documenting strati-
ﬁed deposits up to 2 m in depth with nu-
merous unlined and rock-lined conical
pits (Fig. 7.9). Radiocarbon dates sug-
gest occupations primarily between
ca. 4000 b.c. and a.d. 600, spanning the
Middle and Late Archaic and the ﬁrst few
centuries of the Formative period. While
calibrated age ranges for about 75 percent
of the twenty-seven radiocarbon dates
tend to fall within the Late Archaic (be-
tween 2000 b.c. and a.d. 200), sampling
bias may have affected the distribution to
an unknown extent; a signiﬁcant number
of Middle Archaic projectile points were
also recovered (R. Jones 1990). No ce-
ramics were found in the shelter and only
a small number of arrow points. The ma-
jority of deposits, features, and cultural
materials from Fresnal Shelter can conﬁ-
dently be assigned to the Middle and Late
Archaic periods.

The material culture recovered during

the excavations is immense and consti-
tutes one of the largest well-documented
collections from a stratiﬁed rockshelter in
the American Southwest. As described by
Robert C. Jones (1990, 24 –25; see also
Tagg 1996), the catalog of materials at
Eastern New Mexico University lists ap-
proximately 6.5 million specimens of
lithic material, although the majority con-
sist of roof spalls and ﬁre-cracked rock.
Perishable materials include 25,269 fau-
nal specimens, 700 pounds of vegetal ma-
terial, rabbit and deer hides, more than

400 complete and fragmentary sandals,
30 basket fragments, more than 200 feath-
ers, several thousand cordage specimens,
and hundreds of preserved wood artifacts
such as atlatl foreshafts and digging sticks.
Plant remains were abundant throughout
the deposits, and several hundred corn-
cobs, kernels, beans, and cucurbit
samples were recovered.

Excavations at open-air sites in the
central basins, alluvial fans, and river
margin terraces of the Hueco, Tularosa,
Mesilla, and Salt Flat Basins have also
contributed important information on
Archaic period archeology in the Trans-
Pecos. While the rich material culture
preserved in rockshelters is typically ab-
sent at open-air sites, these studies have
provided much of the information for in-
terpreting settlement patterns and land
use. Investigations at Keystone Dam led
to the identiﬁcation of Archaic house
structures, several among the earliest in
the southern Southwest. Extensive studies
of small sites throughout the Hueco and
Tularosa Bolsons at Fort Bliss and White
Sands Missile Range (Burgett n.d.; Dole-
man et al. 1991; Mauldin et al. 1998;
O’Laughlin and Martin 1989; Seaman
et al. 1988; Whalen 1980a), in addition
to several projects in the Mesilla Bolson
west of El Paso (Camilli et al. 1988;
O’Leary 1987; Ravesloot 1988), have
identiﬁed an extensive Late Archaic use of
the central basins, marked by small, shal-
low pithouses or “huts” and thermal fea-
tures. Excavations at several sites with
large burned rock features situated on
alluvial fans and terraces (Carmichael
1985; Fields and Girard 1983; Hard
1983a; O’Laughlin 1979) have also pro-
vided important information and insights
into Archaic adaptations.

For the eastern Trans-Pecos, Mallouf ’s
(1985) summary offers a much more de-
tailed overview than can be provided
here, and several observations in Sebas-
tian and Larralde’s (1989) overview of
southeastern New Mexico are also rele-
vant for our understanding of Native
American life in the Archaic. A small
number of studies have been completed
since the publication of Mallouf ’s exten-
sive overview, including investigations
at Phantom Lake Spring in Jeff Davis
County (Charles 1994), Ward’s (1992)
study of materials from sinkholes and

Early Archaic Period
(6000 to 4000/3000 B.C.)

The Early Archaic period is one of
the more poorly known intervals in the
Trans-Pecos. In the western part of the
region, occupation is known from surface
ﬁnds of projectile points, a few thin de-
posits in rockshelters, and a small number
of radiocarbon dates from hearths or
rockshelter deposits. Intensive surveys
conducted throughout Fort Bliss and
adjacent areas of El Paso County and
New Mexico have recorded several surface
ﬁnds of Early Archaic projectile points,
but only rarely have features or substan-
tial settlements been identiﬁed. While
numerous projectile point ﬁnds have been
documented, the number of Early Ar-
chaic projectile points collected during
surface surveys is only slightly greater
than the number of Paleoindian speci-
mens (Beckes 1977; Camilli et al. 1988;
Carmichael 1986; Lukowski and Stuart
1996; O’Hara 1988). A similar situation
exists in the eastern Trans-Pecos, where,
as noted by Mallouf, the region is “distin-
guished by a perplexing lack of substan-
tive data concerning even the barest out-
lines of Early Archaic Cultures” (Mallouf
1985, 101). Material culture from the
few Early Archaic features or rockshelter
deposits in the eastern Trans-Pecos is
sparse, and no ﬁrmly dated substantial
Early Archaic occupation has been identi-
ﬁed or investigated. Mallouf (1990) fur-
ther notes that only twelve out of several
hundred projectile points examined in
private collections from northeastern
Chihuahua have Early Archaic afﬁliations.
The Early Archaic period in the west-
ern Trans-Pecos is conventionally dated
from the close of the Paleoindian period
at 6000 b.c. to 4000 b.c., although nei-
ther temporal estimate is ﬁrm. In the
eastern Trans-Pecos, Mallouf (1985,
1990) dates the period from 6500 to
3500/3000 b.c. The recognition and
temporal placement of the Early Archaic
are based almost entirely on cross-dating
projectile point forms (i.e., Jay, Bajada,

and Uvalde) characteristic of the Oshara
(Irwin-Williams 1973, 1979) and central
Texas (Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976). The
current radiocarbon data base from the
western Trans-Pecos (M. Miller 1996a)
has only eleven dates with 2-sigma cali-
brated age ranges falling securely between
6000 and 4000 b.c. and an additional
nine dates that partially overlap between
4000 and 3500 b.c. To our knowledge,
only one radiocarbon date has been ob-
tained in association with Early Archaic
materials in the eastern Trans-Pecos
(Charles 1994).

The context and distribution of dates

from the western Trans-Pecos demon-
strate the problems of archeological rec-
ognition that hinder identiﬁcation of
Paleoindian, Early Archaic, and Middle
Archaic components. Signiﬁcantly, 50 per-
cent of the Early Archaic dates have been
obtained from thermal features buried at
depths of 1 m or more in alluvial deposits
ﬂanking local mountain chains. Several
were obtained from features at the Gard-
ner Springs radiocarbon site, investigated
during the Desert Project in initial at-
tempts to establish age limits for the Or-
gan (Holocene) alluvial sequence (Gile
and Hawley 1968). Throughout the
Gardner Springs area, deep erosional
channels cutting through Middle-to-Late
Holocene alluvium have exposed numer-
ous hearth features distributed at varying
depths in the alluvial deposits. In many
cases artifacts have been found in associa-
tion with these features, including an in-
tact metate adjacent to a hearth (Beckett
1973) with a calibrated age range of 5570
to 5070 b.c. (I-4281). Monitoring of
road construction in Gardner Springs Ar-
royo resulted in the discovery of an addi-
tional site (Almarez 1990) and excavation
of a moderate-sized Early Archaic ﬁre-
cracked rock feature. Other cases of deeply
buried Early Archaic features include ﬁre-
cracked rock hearths at Vado, New Mex-
ico, just north of El Paso (Henry and
Batcho 1984), the North Mesa site (Mac-
Neish 1993b) east of Las Cruces, and
an isolated location in the San Andres
Mountains (Human Systems Research
1991).

Seven Early Archaic dates have been

obtained from Fresnal, Pendejo, and
Todsen rockshelters (Carmichael 1982b;
R. Jones 1990; MacNeish 1993b; Tagg
1996) located north of El Paso, although

there is some question as to whether the
two Fresnal dates represent a Late Paleo-
indian occupation. In addition, a human
femur recovered from Bishop Cap Cave
between El Paso and Las Cruces yielded
an Early Archaic date (L. Davis 1969;
King 1984), but both the context of the
specimen and the reliability of the date
are questionable.

In only four cases have features in
basin landforms yielded Early Archaic
dates. Among these are sites 41EP1143,
FB7483, and FB7520 in the Hueco
Bolson on Fort Bliss (Mauldin et al.
1998; O’Laughlin and Martin 1989)
and 41HZ403 in Hudspeth County
(O’Laughlin and Martin 1992). The date
from 41HZ403 was from Feature 17, an
eroded hearth associated with a small
quantity of lithic debitage and ground-
stone fragments. The remaining localities
had hearths and limited numbers of
chipped stone and groundstone artifacts
and were often part of larger, multicom-
ponent sites. Despite the rarity of fea-
tures, Early Archaic projectile points are
relatively common in the central basins
(Carmichael 1986), and thus it remains
unclear whether the lack of chronometri-
cally dated features indicates the sparse
use of this landform or the possibility that
features have been eroded.

These ﬁndings do suggest that a large
portion of the Early Archaic landscape is
buried in alluvial deposits or that occupa-
tions are present within lower strata of
rockshelters; therefore, many components
have remained invisible during archeolog-
ical surveys. Accordingly, the most pro-
ductive archeological investigations will
be buried contexts in alluvial fans and
rockshelters. However, even rockshelters
in both the eastern and western Trans-
Pecos contain signiﬁcant components of
this period. For example, Zone K1 at
Todsen Shelter was assigned by MacNeish
(1993b) to the Gardner Springs phase,
dating to the Early Archaic period. This
zone consisted of a small, mixed deposit
with burned rock, charcoal, and a small
sample of chipped stone. A more substan-
tial occupation may have been present
in Pendejo Cave, where Chrisman et al.
(1996) report an Early Archaic radiocar-
bon date obtained from a sandal fragment
in Zone C, but further information on
this deposit has not been reported in de-
tail. Two dates from Fresnal Shelter indi-

cate some limited occupation during the
Early Archaic or Late Paleoindian period,
but the problems with age estimates de-
rived from charcoal samples and the po-
tential mixing of deposits observed by
R. Jones (1990) and Tagg (1996) have
not permitted detailed study of materials
from contexts associated with the dates.
To add to the problems of deﬁnition
and temporal placement of Early Archaic
settlement, few secure chronometric dates
have been obtained from contexts in asso-
ciation with technologically or stylistically
characteristic artifact types. A Bajada
point may have been recovered from a
level in Fresnal Shelter in association with
the two earliest radiocarbon dates (ISGS-
812 and ISGS-845), but the context is
uncertain. In his study of bifacial tools
from the shelter, R. Jones (1990) does
not assign an associated date to this speci-
men. A sandal fragment from Pendejo
Cave provided a direct radiocarbon age of
5480 ! 60 b.p. (UCR-2643), indicating
the presence of an Early Archaic occupa-
tion in the shelter, but again the context
is unknown. Investigations at buried sites
in alluvial settings have involved limited
exposures, and open sites in central basin
landforms are eroded. However, Charles
(1994) reports Early Archaic point forms
in association with deeply buried hearth
features and depositional units at Locality
21 of the Phantom Springs site (41JD63)
in the eastern Trans-Pecos. In one of the
few cases from the Trans-Pecos involving
direct associations between a feature, a di-
agnostic tool form, and a radiocarbon age
estimate, a Uvalde point (Fig. 7.10) was
recovered from a hearth feature with an
uncorrected soil humate date of 6050 !
100 b.p. (calibrated age is 5300 – 4700
b.c., with variance added to the radiocar-
bon error estimate to compensate for the
imprecision of soil humate age estimates).
Aside from locational information for
projectile points and a limited number of
settlements, we currently have very little
information on Early Archaic material
culture, subsistence, or technology. Nev-
ertheless, several aspects of technology
during this period provide some insights
into changing adaptations. Based on the
small sample of dated features, it is evi-
dent that the use of rock or caliche as
cooking stones and heating elements in
thermal features appears during this time.
While the apparent absence of burned

rock thermal features during the preced-
ing Paleoindian period may be due to
preservation and visibility biases, there are
no documented cases of burned rock in
secure association with a Paleoindian oc-
cupation. In contrast, several medium to
large thermal features of Early Archaic
age found buried in alluvial fans contain
moderate quantities of burned rock, and
smaller stains in the central basins often
contain limited quantities of burned rock
or caliche. Mallouf (1985) also notes
that burned rock features and middens
throughout the eastern Trans-Pecos oc-
casionally have Early Archaic materials,
although these associations are tentative.
The nature and function of Early Archaic
thermal features is unclear, as the small
sample of such features has yielded few
or no macrobotanical remains. Yet their
presence does suggest an important
change in subsistence practices involving
an increased emphasis on plant process-
ing. Variability among features, including
small hearths in the central basin and
larger, more substantial burned rock
hearths in alluvial fans, may indicate dif-
ferences in the season or intensity of
settlement and plant processing among
differing environmental zones. Coinci-
dent with the use of burned rock thermal
features is the appearance of groundstone
artifacts (Beckett 1973; O’Laughlin and
Martin 1992), also implying a greater
emphasis on plant processing.

Projectile point technology emphasizes

a change from lanceolate forms of the
preceding Paleoindian period to stemmed
forms such as the Jay, Bajada, and Uvalde
types, as well as perhaps a Nolan-like form
(Fig. 7.11). An increasing regionalization
among the distribution of these projectile
forms is apparent, with types having tech-
nological afﬁnities with the central Texas
sequence (i.e., Uvalde and Nolan-like; see
Prewitt 1995) somewhat more prevalent
in the eastern segment (Mallouf 1985).
While Uvalde forms are occasionally
found in the western Trans-Pecos, the Jay
and Bajada types of the Oshara Tradition
are much more common.

With the adoption of stemmed forms
in the western Trans-Pecos comes a no-
ticeable change in the use of coarser-
grained raw materials for the manufacture
of projectile points. In contrast to the
common use of high-quality, ﬁne-grained
materials for the manufacture of Paleo-

Fig. 7.10. Uvalde projectile recovered in situ

indian tools, the majority of Bajada and
Jay specimens are coarser-grained igneous,
metamorphic, and sedimentary rock types
(including medium- or coarse-grained
cherts). Fig. 7.12 illustrates the distribu-
tion of general material texture groups
among a sample of sixty Early and Late
Paleoindian and thirteen Early Archaic
projectile point specimens in the Fort
Bliss collection. Of the Early Archaic
points, 69 percent were manufactured
from medium- or coarse-grained materi-
als compared to only 10 percent among
the sample of Paleoindian points. Al-
though the sample of Early Archaic Jay
and Bajada points is small and the Fort
Bliss sample may not be representative of
the Trans-Pecos, or for that matter even
the Jornada Mogollon, Wirt H. Wills
(1988, 79) notes the prevalence of coarser-
grained materials among Early Archaic
projectiles, with 83 percent of a sample
from central New Mexico having been
manufactured of basalt. Examination of
private artifact collections from west
Texas, south-central New Mexico, and
northern Chihuahua by the senior author
has also shown the common occurrence
of coarse-grained materials among Early
Archaic projectile points.

Factors underlying this apparent shift
in material utilization may reﬂect a change
in prey selection and hunting practices
during the Early Archaic (given the cur-
rent lack of knowledge regarding settle-

A total of ﬁfty-one dates with cali-
brated age ranges falling securely within
this interval is known from the western
Trans-Pecos, along with a dozen or so
that partially overlap this temporal inter-
val. The distribution of the dates differs
from the Early Archaic, with buried
burned rock features and rockshelter de-
posits providing a smaller proportion of
the available dates. A surprisingly small
number (n"5) of dates overlapping the
Middle Archaic time interval have been
obtained from rockshelter deposits, al-
though whether this is due to sampling
bias or a reduced focus on occupation of
rockshelters is unknown. A small number
of deeply buried burned rock features of
Middle Archaic age have been docu-
mented, including examples buried at
depths of 2 m in the Delaware Moun-
tains south of Guadalupe Peak (M. Mil-
ler 1994) and in the vicinity of Gardner
Springs Arroyo (Almarez 1990; Gile
and Hawley 1968; M. Miller and Stuart
1991).

In contrast, the majority of Middle
Archaic radiocarbon dates have been ob-
tained from sites in the more exposed in-
terior basin landforms, including several
small sites in the Hueco and Tularosa
Bolsons (Doleman et al. 1991; Mauldin
et al. 1998; O’Laughlin et al. 1988;
O’Laughlin and Martin 1989; Seaman
et al. 1988). Middle Archaic settlements
are also known from the lower and upper
terraces of the Rio Grande Valley, such as
Vista del Sol (41EP2970), Keystone Dam
(41EP492 and 41EP493), and 41EP2611
(Earls and Newton 1988; O’Laughlin
1980; M. Miller et al. 1993).

Mallouf (1985) observes similar pat-
terns among Middle Archaic sites in the
eastern Trans-Pecos. Based on data from
surface archeological surveys, sites appear
to be more numerous and tend to be
larger or contain greater numbers of fea-
tures. In contrast to the Paleoindian and
Early Archaic period sites, there is an in-
creased focus of Middle Archaic settle-
ments along drainages. Mallouf (1985)
also notes that Middle Archaic compo-
nents in the eastern Trans-Pecos are
found among a variety of settings, sug-
gesting an expansion into and exploita-
tion of new environmental niches.
A common pattern among these
Middle Archaic sites is the presence of
two or more thermal features with over-

Fig. 7.12. Bar graph showing shift in raw material utilization for projectile points between the
Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods. Fine-grained materials include chert, chalcedony, and
obsidian; medium-grained materials include coarser cherts (Rancheria and others); and
coarse-grained materials include limestone and other igneous and metamorphic types.

of small hearth and artifact scatters dis-
tributed among a variety of environmen-
tal zones. However, the presence of larger
burned rock features along alluvial fan
zones establishes a land use pattern in-
volving burned rock thermal features that
persists throughout the remainder of the
Archaic and much of the Formative pe-
riod. Technological changes over the pre-
ceding Paleoindian period are apparent
in different hafting methods and patterns
of raw material utilization for projectile
points, the utilization of rock for heating
elements in thermal features, and the use
of groundstone tools. These changes sug-
gest a seasonally mobile settlement system
of small bands, although possibly more
restricted than during preceding periods.
What these changes actually mean in
terms of subsistence and adaptation await
additional data on macrobotanical and
faunal collections as well as analyses of
tool and lithic debitage assemblages. As
noted by Mallouf (1985, 108) for the
eastern Trans-Pecos, much more work is
needed to determine whether the patterns
perceived for Early Archaic occupations
are the result of survey bias—an observa-
tion that applies equally to the Jornada
Mogollon region.

Middle Archaic Period
(4000/3000 to 1200 B.C.)

Fundamental subsistence, settlement,
and technological adaptations established
in the Early Archaic tend to be main-
tained through the Middle Archaic, al-
though they may have become intensiﬁed
throughout the latter part of this two-
thousand-year-long interval. Based on
the locations and increasing numbers of
Middle Archaic occupations, some degree
of population growth probably took place
in the Trans-Pecos (Carmichael 1986;
Mallouf 1985; O’Laughlin 1980). Exami-
nation of the radiocarbon record from the
western Trans-Pecos supports this view,
as there appears to be an increase in the
number of radiocarbon-dated features
and contexts throughout the region, par-
ticularly during the latter half of the pe-
riod. Paleoclimatic reconstructions indi-
cate a continued drying trend during this
period, suggesting that the timing and
distribution of food resources may have
been more restricted and variable, and
therefore a more seasonally intensive land
use pattern that focused on speciﬁc re-
sources may also account for perceived
patterns of Middle Archaic site numbers
and distributions.

lapping radiocarbon age estimates. In ad-
dition, artifact assemblages tend to be
slightly more substantial in number than
Early Archaic components. Preservation
factors may account for this variance.
However, because the resolution of avail-
able chronometric methods is not sufﬁ-
cient to conﬁdently determine whether
features are contemporaneous, the com-
mon ﬁnding of clusters of thermal fea-
tures may indicate greater levels of settle-
ment intensity and perhaps the presence
of larger social groups. Moreover, the ex-
istence of discrete Middle Archaic resi-
dential settlements has been demonstrated
through Thomas C. O’Laughlin’s discov-
ery in the late 1970s of pithouses at Key-
stone Dam site 33, situated along the
lowermost terrace of the Rio Grande Val-
ley in northwest El Paso.

Considered one of the most signiﬁcant
sites in the southern Southwest, Keystone
33 contains several of the earliest house
structures documented in the region.
On the basis of a testing program con-
ducted in advance of dam construction,
O’Laughlin (1980) recorded the presence
of twenty-three known or suspected
houses. A series of radiocarbon dates
suggest occupations of these structures
occurred between 2500 and 1800 b.c.
Similar structures excavated during the
Navajo-Hopi Land Exchange Project
west of El Paso (Camilli et al. 1988) and
at the Vista del Sol site in east El Paso
(M. Miller et al. 1993) have provided ad-
ditional dates that are contemporaneous
with the structures at the Keystone Dam
sites (Fig. 7.13). The construction and
use of such structures was probably more
widespread during the Middle Archaic
than indicated by the current sample, but
because of their ephemeral nature it is
likely that many such structures have
been eroded or naturally destroyed. Fur-
thermore, several features described as
large stains or “roasting pits” but lacking
associated rock or burned caliche have
been excavated in the Hueco Bolson
(Burgett n.d.; O’Laughlin and Martin
1989), and these features may in fact rep-
resent additional examples of Middle Ar-
chaic house structures.

The Middle Archaic house structures,

or “huts” as they are more commonly
known, are round, shallow constructions
measuring an average of less than 2.0 m
in diameter and 15 to 20 cm in depth

(Fig. 7.14). Floor and subﬂoor features
are rare, although burned and ashy areas
possibly represent interior hearths.
O’Laughlin notes the presence of daub
with stick and pole impressions, indicat-
ing that some form of brush or jacal su-
perstructure was present over the struc-
tures at Keystone Dam 33. Overall, the
labor investment involved in constructing
and maintaining these features is low, and
they have generally been interpreted as
short-term residences. Based on the re-
sults of soil cores, O’Laughlin suggests
that as many as two dozen such structures
are present at Keystone Dam 33 and that
several appear to be arranged in groups,
suggesting a level of social organization
involving multifamily or extended family
groups.

The hut structures identiﬁed at Key-
stone Dam and elsewhere in the western
Trans-Pecos are among the earliest evi-
dence for semisedentary settlements in
the Southwest. Interestingly, residential
structures of the Middle Archaic period,
and by extension evidence for semiseden-
tary settlement systems, predate the ﬁrst
conclusive evidence of agriculture in the
Jornada Mogollon region, as well as the
southern Southwest, by several hundred
to more than one thousand years.

Unfortunately, it is difﬁcult to arrive at

concise impressions of subsistence prac-
tices during the Middle Archaic. The
presence of groundstone tools and ther-

mal features indicates the continued ex-
ploitation of plant foods, and the com-
mon association of Middle Archaic pro-
jectile points with burned rock middens
and extensive hearth ﬁelds in the eastern
Trans-Pecos suggests to Mallouf (1985)
that processed cacti and desert succulents
became a staple of the subsistence base
during this time. However, more direct
evidence of subsistence practices is largely
unavailable, as preservation of botanical
and faunal remains is extremely poor at
exposed sites in central basin and river
terrace landforms and the few available
studies of materials from rockshelters
have not explicitly differentiated among
Early, Middle, and Late Archaic materi-
als. Only twenty-ﬁve faunal specimens
were recovered from features in the
Middle Archaic (Zone 2) deposits at Key-
stone Dam. Along with ﬁve eggshell frag-
ments, the specimens included mostly the
remains of rabbits or small and medium-
sized mammals. Analysis of ﬂotation
samples from Zone 2 features at Keystone
Dam noted four-wing saltbush, cheno-
ams, purslane, mesquite, rushes and
grasses, and cacti such as Turk’s Cap and
prickly pear. Similar botanical assem-
blages have been recovered from the small
number of Middle Archaic thermal fea-
tures in the Tularosa and Hueco Bolsons
(e.g., Swift et al. 1991).

Few distinct technological changes or

trends have been observed in the Early,

are attributable to breakage and rework-
ing has not been established.

It is evident from published projectile
point collections from the region that two
hafting conﬁgurations represent the most
common Middle Archaic forms: contract-
ing stems with ﬂat, rounded, or pointed
bases and expanding stems with concave
bases. Again, there appear to be regional
differences in the distribution of these
forms, with expanding stem/concave base
forms having general afﬁnities with the
Oshara Tradition and Cochise sequences
more prevalent in the western Trans-
Pecos, while contracting stem forms are
more prevalent among the central Texas
and Coahuila traditions present in the
eastern Trans-Pecos. Another trait of
Middle Archaic projectile points in the
western Trans-Pecos is the variety in
blade modiﬁcations, including beveling,
serration, and extensive retouching.
While simple retouching and reworking
is common among Early and Late Ar-
chaic points from the western Trans-
Pecos, beveled and serrated blades occur
predominantly among Middle Archaic
forms. Such patterns may indicate an in-
creased emphasis on the conservation of
raw materials, blade modiﬁcation related
to multiple uses of the tools, or an aspect
of increased efﬁciency in felling prey.
These possibilities suggest that the design
and use of projectile points among Middle
Archaic groups reﬂects different patterns
of technological and settlement organiza-
tion than was the case among earlier and
later intervals of the Archaic period.

In summary, our present knowledge of

Middle Archaic settlement and adapta-
tion is only slightly more substantial than
for the Early Archaic. Radiocarbon-dated
features increase during the latter half of
the period, and occupations increase in
number across a wider range of environ-
mental and topographic zones. The ma-
jority of sites consist of isolated hearths,
burned rock accumulations, or clusters
of several thermal features, although the
presence of residential structures clearly
implies the existence of settlements of
longer, seasonal duration within some
environmental zones.

Late Archaic Period

In terms of settlement, subsistence,
and technological adaptations, the Late

Middle, and Late Archaic period archeo-
logical record in terms of lithic and
groundstone tool assemblages or thermal
features; this is certainly due in part to
the paucity of sites and well-documented
assemblages. Technological changes be-
tween the Early and Middle Archaic have
been inferred primarily through observed
differences in projectile point form. One
commonly noted aspect of Middle Ar-
chaic tool technology is the diversiﬁcation
of projectile point types. Mallouf (1985)
notes an increasing regional spatial pat-
tern of projectile point forms, with west-
ern Trans-Pecos sites having a combina-

tion of Trans-Pecos, Coahuilan, and
Cochise forms while forms of the eastern
Trans-Pecos have closer afﬁnities with the
central Texas, Coahuilan, and Lower
Pecos traditions.

In reviewing the most prevalent
Middle Archaic projectile forms, how-
ever, it is evident that many forms have
several broad morphological similarities.
This condition is particularly true in the
design of the haft element, and the degree
to which small variations in shoulder,
blade form, and haft elements represent
technological design choices or cultural
norms (see Tomka and Prewitt 1993) or

Archaic—particularly the latter half of
the period—represents a true break in
the long Archaic sequence of the previous
four thousand years. Several technological
innovations and changes in settlement
adaptations characteristic of this period
presage developments during the subse-
quent Formative period. In fact, aside
from the initial use of plain brownware
ceramics, it has become increasingly difﬁ-
cult to identify distinct changes in adap-
tation, subsistence, settlement patterns, or
technology between the latter portion of
the Late Archaic and the early portion of
the Formative period Mesilla phase.

Recognition of the Late Archaic arche-
ological record in the western Trans-Pecos
increased dramatically in the 1990s. In
contrast to the minimal numbers of
chronometric dates available for the Paleo-
indian, Early Archaic, and Middle Archaic
periods, more than 550 radiocarbon dates,
representing more than 300 features,
rockshelter strata, or other cultural con-
texts, fall within this period in the Jor-
nada Mogollon region of the Trans-Pecos
and south-central New Mexico.

MacNeish (1993b; see also MacNeish

and Beckett 1987) subdivide the Late
Archaic into two phases: Fresnal (2500 –
1000 b.c.) and Hueco (1000 b.c.– a.d.
200). While the speciﬁc criteria for differ-
entiating these phases and their temporal
divisions are not clearly presented, these
temporal divisions do tend to reﬂect
broad developments across the Trans-
Pecos and southern New Mexico that oc-
curred between 1500 and 1000 b.c. Be-
cause the total number of Late Archaic
dates is still small and at least half were
from mixed contexts (such as crescent
and ring middens) or did not have arti-
facts in association, the recognition and
temporal divisions of the Late Archaic are
still based mainly on the presence of side-
and corner-notched dart points (one of
the hallmarks of the period) that have
been associated with radiocarbon dates in
the Lower Pecos and central Texas. The
available evidence for the Late Archaic in
the eastern portion of the Trans-Pecos in-
dicates a beginning date roughly contem-
poraneous with the Fresnal /Hueco phase
boundary and an ending date around
a.d. 900 or 1000, several centuries after
its termination in the Jornada region.
Radiocarbon dates from the Big Bend
(Baskin 1978; Mallouf 1985), Stockton

Plateau (Bandy 1980; Prewitt 1981), Del-
aware and Pecos Basins (Charles 1994;
Skinner et al. 1980; Valastro et al. 1979;
Young 1981, 1982), and the Guadalupe
Mountains (Bradford 1980; Roney 1995)
support the temporal span of the Late Ar-
chaic in the eastern Trans-Pecos.

In terms of settlement patterns and
land use intensity, an important aspect of
Late Archaic settlement is the dramatic
increase in sites, features, and associated
material culture. Indeed, whether mea-
sured by site densities, numbers of projec-
tile points, or counts of radiocarbon dates
and dated features, the Late Archaic pe-
riod represents the peak of occupational
intensity in several major environmental
zones in the region. In the western Trans-
Pecos, projectile point frequencies and
the distributions of features with radio-
carbon dates led Carmichael (1986), Sea-
man et al. (1988), and Whalen (1980a,
1985a) to conclude that a substantial oc-
cupation of interior basin landforms oc-
curred during the Late Archaic. These
impressions have been conﬁrmed by re-
cent studies emphasizing more intensive
chronometric dating. Radiocarbon dates
from several large-scale testing and miti-
gation projects (Burgett n.d.; Camilli et al.
1988; Mauldin et al. 1998; O’Laughlin
and Martin 1990) have consistently iden-
tiﬁed Late Archaic components in the
central basin landforms, and Mauldin’s
(1994, 1995, 1996a) summary of these
data clearly demonstrates that a substan-
tial proportion of more than ﬁve hundred
dated features in the Hueco Bolson repre-
sent Late Archaic occupations. Late Ar-
chaic components are equally common
and widespread in the Mesilla, Tularosa,
and Salt Flat Basins.

In addition to the central basins, ra-

diocarbon-dated features and compo-
nents are widely distributed among nearly
all environmental and topographic zones
in the western Trans-Pecos. Late Archaic
components are present on alluvial fans,
including both surface sites and buried
components. Most rockshelters have con-
siderable Late Archaic deposits, and this
period is often the primary time interval
represented in rockshelters. Rockshelters
in the Guadalupe Mountains also have
predominantly Late Archaic deposits
(Roney 1985, 1995).

Research on the Late Archaic in the

eastern Trans-Pecos (Mallouf 1985,

1990) and adjacent regions (Sebastian
and Larralde 1989) documents similar
trends. Foremost, there was a remarkable
increase in the number of Late Archaic
sites over previous periods. They have
been identiﬁed in all environmental set-
tings, including river terraces that are not
prone to ﬂooding (Cloud et al. 1994),
high mountain environments (Cloud
1989; Ferndon 1946; Kenmotsu 1993),
intermountain bolsons (Hedrick 1989),
adjacent to springs (Charles 1994; Mal-
louf 1985), and in every other ecological
zone in the region. The increase in Late
Archaic sites, and their expansion into all
ecological zones, has been interpreted to
be the result of wetter environmental
conditions (Mallouf 1990) that ended
around 500 b.c. but that had promoted
interregional interactions among hunting-
gathering groups (Mallouf 1985). The
numeric increase in Late Archaic sites is
so dramatic that it is believed to have rep-
resented some level of concomitant ex-
pansion “in population, changes in socio-
economic practices, or a combination of
these factors” (Mallouf 1985, 125).

Subsistence and Agricultural
Developments during the
Late Archaic Period

Among the most important develop-
ments during the Late Archaic in the west-
ern Trans-Pecos is the ﬁrst conclusive evi-
dence for the use of cultigens. Steadman
Upham and Richard MacNeish (1993)
identify the presence of cultigens—and
hence the adoption of horticultural or
agricultural subsistence practices—as one
of the signature traits marking the initia-
tion of the Fresnal phase at ca. 2500 b.c.
The inception date of this phase is based
on the presence of tentatively identiﬁed
Zea mays pollen from Zone 4 at Keystone
Dam (O’Laughlin 1980). Pollen Type A
was provisionally identiﬁed as Zea, but
not conclusively so due to the poor con-
dition of the pollen grains. Moreover, cal-
ibration of the uncorrected radiocarbon
age estimates from wood charcoal samples
retrieved from pithouse structures within
Zone 4 range from 3400 to 1200 b.c.,
and error estimates of the individual dates
range between 120 and 200 years. There-
fore, the inception of the Fresnal phase,
based as it is on these data, carries a sub-
stantial degree of imprecision. Recent
chronometric studies involving direct age

that the earliest maize specimens have not
yet been found and that it would be rea-
sonable to assume an introduction period
between 1550 and 1050 b.c. (see also
Minnis 1992), an estimate that is in
agreement with the evidence from Fresnal
Shelter.

Causal factors underlying the adoption
of corn, beans, and other cultigens during
the Late Archaic period are not well
known, and the origins of agriculture in
the Jornada Mogollon region are best
viewed within the larger perspective of
developments across the Southwest.
Many argue that the use of cultigens is
part of an increasing diversiﬁcation and
range of plant foods exploited during
Late Archaic times, a practice that also
provided additional stability, buffering,
and/or predictability to the subsistence
base (e.g., Matson 1991; Minnis 1992;
Wills 1988). It is not well understood,
however, whether this diversiﬁcation may
have been a cause or effect of increasing
population levels and, as a result, re-
duced territories available for population
movements.

Crucial for understanding the integra-

tion of agriculture into the subsistence
economies of Late Archaic groups in the
Trans-Pecos is deﬁning the extent and de-
gree of agricultural production. Several
rather contradictory data sets are avail-

able. Referring to an outstanding case of
plant preservation, Vorsila L. Bohrer
(1981, 45) provides several ubiquity cal-
culations from Fresnal Shelter. Based on
her analysis, corn was identiﬁed in 50 per-
cent of ten 120 ml samples collected from
natural strata, 57 percent of samples
(n"7) of equivalent volume collected
from pits in Unit D27, and 52 percent of
the screened excavation levels (n"44).
The high degree of preservation of de-
posits in the shelter undoubtedly contrib-
uted to these counts, as other seeds and
plant parts have even greater ubiquity val-
ues. Yet the consistent distribution of
corn throughout deposits and features is
surprising when compared to the gener-
ally low ubiquity values for corn at other
Late Archaic components, and it is even
more striking when compared to the low
ubiquity values at Early Formative period
sites occupied by groups presumably hav-
ing a greater agricultural subsistence base
(see below). The pattern observed at Fres-
nal is also evident at Todsen Shelter and
the Organ Mountain rockshelters where
Upham and MacNeish (1993) document
more than one hundred corncobs—a to-
tal that does not include individual ker-
nels and cupules—recovered from several
generally shallow deposits. While counts
or ubiquity measures cannot be deter-
mined for individual stratigraphic zones

Fig. 7.15. Direct radiocarbon age determinations from corn samples at Tornillo and Fresnal
Shelters, New Mexico (data from R. Jones 1990; Tagg 1996, 316–17; Upham et al. 1987). Samples
with laboratory designations A and AA have assumed 13C correction of #10.0 percent.

estimates obtained from corn samples in-
dicate that MacNeish’s inception date for
the Hueco rather than Fresnal phase may
more accurately reﬂect the introduction
and adoption of cultigens in the Jornada
Mogollon region.

More conclusive evidence for the ap-
pearance of cultigens has been obtained
through direct conventional and accelera-
tor mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocar-
bon dating of corn specimens recovered
from Fresnal and Tornillo rockshelters.
The earliest direct date was obtained from
a composite sample of eight corncobs
from Tornillo Shelter, situated a few miles
north of El Paso. Upham et al. (1987) re-
port a corrected age estimate of 3175 !
240 b.p. (GX-12720), which calibrates to
2030 –830 b.c. (at 1-sigma). Because the
sample was a composite, it may have in-
corporated younger and earlier cob speci-
mens. Therefore, the age estimate cannot
be considered entirely accurate, and the
imprecision of the calibrated age estimate
(a span of twelve hundred years) must
also be taken into account.

A more concise and intensive dating

study was undertaken using cultigens
from Fresnal Shelter (Tagg 1996). Seven
corn samples and three beans from several
pits and excavation levels in Units D27
and C29 were directly dated using AMS
to help establish the ages of these materi-
als as well as to reconcile earlier debates
regarding the context and association of
radiocarbon age estimates obtained from
wood charcoal and cultigens. The earliest
of the series of dates obtained from a corn
sample is 2945 ! 55 b.p. (AA-6402, cali-
brated age range is 1370 –940 b.c.), while
the remainder of the dates range between
1200 b.c. and a.d. 600 (Fig. 7.15). Di-
rect dates were also obtained for three
samples of common bean, and Tagg
(1996) notes that the distribution of these
dates suggests a somewhat later occur-
rence at ca. 350 b.c.

The Fresnal cultigen dates accord well
with other evidence for the introduction
of cultigens in the southern Southwest.
By most recent accounts, maize and other
cultigens ﬁrst appear sometime between
1050 and 850 b.c. in southern New
Mexico and southern Arizona (Fish et al.
1986; Matson 1991; Minnis 1992; Tagg
1996; Wills 1988), as well as in northern
Chihuahua (Wills 1988; see also Hard
and Roney 1998). Wills (1988) suggests

at these sites, a substantial proportion of
the samples was obtained from Late Ar-
chaic contexts.

Open-air sites present quite a different

matter. Despite the possible presence of
corn pollen in Zone 4, no macrobotanical
specimens of corn were identiﬁed during
the examination of more than one hun-
dred ﬂotation samples from houses, pits,
and thermal features at the Middle and
Late Archaic components of Keystone
Dam sites 33 and 34 (O’Laughlin 1980).
Keystone 33 is located in sandy alluvial
and eolian deposits of the lower Rio
Grande terrace, and the generally limited
recovery rate for macrobotanical remains
throughout the site suggests that the ab-
sence of corn may be partially attributable
to poor preservation. Despite preserva-
tion biases, however, it is noteworthy
that corn is virtually absent in ﬂotation
samples collected from Late Archaic resi-
dential structures, pits, and virtually hun-
dreds of thermal features throughout the
Jornada Mogollon region (Ford 1977;
Gasser 1983; Holloway 1994, 1998;
Minnis and Toll 1991; O’Laughlin 1988;
Wetterstrom 1978), including numerous
intact examples with well-preserved
deposits.

Additional evidence contrary to any
view of moderate or high levels of agri-
cultural dependence during the Late Ar-
chaic is provided by stable isotope analy-
sis of human skeletal remains. Trends in
15N/14N and 13C /12C ratios among hu-
man remains of Archaic age does not in-
dicate a high level of maize in the diet
(MacNeish and Marino 1993).

While evidence of agricultural depen-

dence during the Late Archaic involves
contradictory evidence, the problem may
be due, in part, to the seasonal nature of
rockshelter occupations as opposed to
settlements situated at lower elevations in
the central basin, alluvial fan, and river
terrace landforms. Identifying the speciﬁc
season of occupation for low-elevation
settlements is difﬁcult because of the fre-
quent absence of plant and faunal re-
mains, yet it may be surmised that these
locales were used at different periods of
the year than were the upland rockshel-
ters. Based on several aspects of the plant
and faunal collections, convincing argu-
ments for the presence of seasonal occu-
pations at Fresnal Shelter and Keystone
Dam have been presented by Bohrer

(1981), O’Laughlin (1980), and Wim-
berly and Eidenbach (1981). Seasonal
settlements may also be indicated by the
highly variable quantities of materials re-
covered from rockshelters as opposed to
lowland open sites, as seasonal occupa-
tions of different intensity or duration
(along with varying deposition rates) may
partially account for the generally mini-
mal subsistence remains and artifact in-
ventories recovered from lowland sites.
Accordingly, reconstructions of subsis-
tence and settlement strategies that ne-
glect to incorporate data from settlements
across several environmental zones may
present a biased picture of Late Archaic
adaptations.

Placing the issues of agricultural de-
pendence aside for the moment, it is evi-
dent that agricultural production was
only one facet of what was clearly a
broad-spectrum subsistence economy.
Bohrer identiﬁed eleven subsistence items
in high abundance throughout deposits at
Fresnal Shelter, noting that most repre-
sent “a well-buffered system of collecting
that provides a minimum of risks” and
“have a maximum emphasis on predicta-
bility in terms of location and availability”
(Bohrer 1981, 45). These plant foods in-
clude four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canes-
cens), buffalo gourd (Cucurbita foetisdis-
sima), turk’s head cactus (Echinocactus
horizonthalonius), juniper berries ( Junipe-
rus sp.), four o’clock (Mirabilis multi-
ﬂora), prickly pear cactus (Opuntia sp.),
New Mexico feathergrass (Stipa neomexi-
cana), and mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa).
Less economically reliable species in-
cluded pigweed (Amaranthus sp.), drop-
seed (Sporobolus sp.), and Paniceae grasses.
Sotol (Dasylirion wheeleri ) is equally com-
mon throughout the deposits but is not
mentioned in Bohrer’s discussion. Flota-
tion analysis of several hundred thermal
features and hut structures in the Hueco,
Tularosa, and Mesilla Bolsons has identi-
ﬁed similar inventories of plants, along
with various annual seeds (cheno-ams,
purslane, grasses), mesquite, and cacti.

Hunting continued to play an impor-
tant role in the Late Archaic. A study of
nearly 26,000 faunal remains from pre-
dominantly Late Archaic deposits in Fres-
nal Shelter led Wimberly and Eidenbach
(1981) to conclude that large or medium-
sized mammal bones represented slightly
more than 90 percent of the remains. Of

869 identiﬁable fragments, 99 percent
were mule deer, with trace amounts of
antelope, bighorn sheep, and bison.
Wimberly and Eidenbach (1981) also
note that the proportional representation
of these taxa is the same throughout de-
posits in the shelter, and they suggest that
this indicates a continuity in upland hunt-
ing and subsistence practices. Inventories
of faunal remains from Todsen Shelter
(Dawson 1993) found few differences be-
tween Middle (Keystone phase) and Late
Archaic (Fresnal and Hueco phases) de-
posits, with rabbit comprising the major-
ity of faunal remains in both periods.
However, aquatic species, most likely ob-
tained from the Rio Grande, were also re-
covered from Late and Middle Archaic
deposits.

Faunal remains from open-air sites
consist predominantly of various leporid
(rabbit) species. In lowland settings, it ap-
pears that large and medium-sized mam-
mal remains decrease steadily through the
Middle and Late Archaic, with a corre-
spondingly greater emphasis on rabbits, a
pattern that is maintained through the
subsequent Formative period. This view
is impressionistic, however, as no quanti-
tative studies have been attempted and
such studies would have to rely primarily
on small, poorly preserved samples from
hearth features. An exception to this low-
land hunting pattern is La Cueva, a small
shelter at the base of the Organ Moun-
tains north of El Paso, where substantial
quantities of deer, antelope, and moun-
tain goat remains were found (Beckett
1979). In contrast to the typically low
numbers of projectile points from low-
land sites, Beckett notes that an average
of ten points per cubic meter of ﬁll were
found, indicating that hunting of large
game continued in proximity to larger
mountain ranges during the Late Archaic.
Both hunting and gathering played
prominent roles in the Late Archaic econ-
omies of eastern Trans-Pecos groups, but
differing emphases given to these two sub-
sistence economies can be noted between
north to south. In the north, analyses of
coprolites from site 41CU1 (Holloway
1985), which is a sinkhole/cave, and of
artifacts from nearby Shelby Brooks Cave,
(site 41CU8 [Ward 1992] in the Rustler
Hills of the Delaware Basin) indicate an
emphasis on vegetal and small game food
sources. Only one dart point and a few

fragments of atlatls and/or foreshafts
were recovered from Shelby Brooks Cave.
These hunting implements were over-
shadowed by forty-one rabbit sticks and a
small hunting net (Ward 1992). Copro-
lites from 41CU1 support the notion that
Late Archaic populations in the northern
portion of the Trans-Pecos consumed
more vegetal foods (Holloway 1985).
All coprolites contained a relatively large
quantity of grass seeds prepared by parch-
ing. Most had smaller quantities of cheno-
ams, Artemisia (sage), prickly pear, Lilia-
caeae (cacti or wild onion), and mesquite
seeds. Several had no evidence of mam-
malian consumption while others con-
tained bones and/or hair from rabbits,
packrats, and other rodents, and one con-
tained an insect exoskeleton. Creosote
and Ephedra were present in several cop-
rolites, and these likely represented treat-
ments for diarrhea since water available
near Caldwell Cave is especially high in
magnesium, a known laxative (Holloway
1985, 326).

Approximately 150 miles southeast
of Rustler Hills, data from Roark Cave
(41BS3; see Kelly 1963) in southeastern
Brewster County provide an interesting
counterpoint. Roark Cave is one of sev-
eral occupied rockshelters in Reagan Can-
yon, situated a few miles north of the Rio
Grande in the western portions of the
Stockton Plateau (Kelly and Smith 1963).
At Roark Cave, Thomas C. Kelly’s small
block excavation yielded a substantial
quantity (238) of projectile points, many
of which (45 Paisano, 15 Ensor, 8 Frio,
and 6 Palmillas), along with a foreshaft,
date to the Late Archaic. Scrapers, bone
tools, spokeshaves (burins?), and gravers
were also present in the rockshelter in rel-
atively high quantities. These artifacts
suggest that Late Archaic occupants in
the southern sector of the Trans-Pecos
placed greater emphasis on hunting than
did their northern counterparts.

Trends among several technologies
track the changes in Late Archaic subsis-
tence and demographic patterns. While
thermal features with burned rock ﬁrst
appear during the Early Archaic and con-
tinue to be used during the Middle Ar-
chaic, they become more numerous in
the Late Archaic. There is an increase in
numbers and weights of large rock accu-
mulations, indicating increasing intensi-
ﬁcation of plant processing. Mounds of

discarded rock associated with Late Ar-
chaic thermal features, such as those ex-
cavated at the Keystone Dam sites (Car-
michael 1985; Fields and Girard 1985;
O’Laughlin 1980) and other locations
often contain rock weights in excess of
several hundred kilograms.

A distinguishing feature of the Late
Archaic outside of the Hueco Bolson is
the prominence of ring middens: circular
to oval heaps of burned rock, sometimes
accompanied by large quantities of ash,
charcoal, and lithic artifacts, with a cen-
tral depression. The sheer number of
these features across the landscape “sug-
gests widespread exploitation of desert
succulents” (Mallouf 1985, 125). While
mounded middens of burned rock (lack-
ing the central depression) were built dur-
ing earlier periods, they are less numerous
and present in fewer ecological niches.
Late Archaic ring middens have been
found in high rockshelters (Ferndon
1946; Mera 1938; Roney 1995), near oc-
cupied sinkholes (A. Jackson 1937; Ward
1992), near tinajas (box canyons with
waterholes; Cofﬁn 1932), in high moun-
tain basins (Cloud 1989), and in most
ecological niches of the Trans-Pecos.

Occupants of the Trans-Pecos east of

the Hueco Bolson continued to form
these ring middens into the Historic pe-
riod. These features were constructed by
Apaches and other Native Americans to
cook sotol and lechuguilla bulbs (Bell
and Castetter 1941; Castetter 1935), and
remnants of these same desert succulents
have been recovered from excavations of
prehistoric ring middens (Bohrer 1994;
P. Katz 1978). Thus, it has long been
held that similar functions can be as-
cribed to prehistoric ring middens (Black
et al. 1997; Hines et al. 1994; J. C. Kelley
et al. 1940; Roney 1995). Ethnographic
data from the Apache (Bell and Castetter
1941) and elsewhere (Black et al. 1997)
show that the bulbs cooked en masse in
these features could be stored for long pe-
riods of time. The discovery of “about a
bushel of pieces of leaves which had been
stripped from the outside of roasted
crowns of sotol” at Bee Canyon (41BS8)
(Cofﬁn 1932, 15) suggests that prehistor-
ically the bulbs were also cooked en
masse and stored for later consumption.
Several other cultural trends make
their appearance in the Late Archaic.
First, dry rockshelters with their greater

preservation contain a rich Late Archaic
material assemblage of not only lithic
tools and grinding stones but also ﬁber
netting and cords, basketry (mats, parch-
ing trays, baskets), animal skin pouches,
gourd vessels, throwing sticks, foreshafts,
wooden and shell pendants, wooden
tongs, sandals, and various other perish-
able and nonperishable artifacts ( J. C.
Kelley et al. 1940; Mallouf 1985; R. Tan-
ner 1949; Ward 1992). One of these, a
wooden mortar recovered from a crevice
in Terrell County (41TE170), dated be-
tween a.d. 875 and 1055 (Prewitt 1981),
while a wooden slab from Pratt Cave
(41CU196) dated to a.d. 530 ! 60
(Valastro et al. 1979, 262 – 63). Ward
(1992) has noted that these assemblages
represent fragments of containers, hunt-
ing and gathering implements, clothing
(sandals, pendants, skins), and leisure
time activities (rhythm sticks), while the
preparation of the dead with animal skin
and woven wrappings and occasional
grave goods indicates that the people
cared deeply about each other. Grass-
lined pits (Ferndon 1946; Kelly 1963)
and grass-lined ﬂoors, perhaps for sleep-
ing (Cofﬁn 1932), have also been attrib-
uted to the Late Archaic.

Projectile point technologies undergo

several modiﬁcations, including the
characteristic shift to corner- and side-
notched forms. In addition, points made
in the second half of the Late Archaic and
the Early Formative periods are signiﬁ-
cantly smaller in size. How do these fac-
tors relate to combined changes in hunt-
ing practices and settlement mobility? A
corresponding increased use of local raw
materials for the manufacture of projec-
tiles, combined with increasing land use
intensity as indicated by the dramatic in-
crease in features and radiocarbon dates
during this period, may reﬂect a reduc-
tion in territorial ranges available for ex-
ploitation by Late Archaic groups.

In summary, the Late Archaic period is

marked by several distinct changes from
the preceding Early and Middle Archaic
periods, particularly in demographics,
land use intensity, feature variability, and
technology. Patterns accentuated or in-
tensiﬁed during the Late Archaic persist
through much of the subsequent Forma-
tive period. Most Late Archaic compo-
nents are small in size, consisting of one
or more thermal features and occasional

structures. While not exceedingly greater
in size or in artifact density than those of
preceding periods, the Late Archaic sites’
sheer numbers indicate a much more in-
tensive land use pattern.

General Trends of the
Archaic Period

In this section we examine three broad
trends of the Archaic period archeological
record. First, the radiocarbon record can
be employed as a proxy indicator of land
use intensity, population growth, and the
introduction of various technologies. Sec-
ond, quantitative and qualitative data
have been collected on a large sample of
projectile points from Fort Bliss, permit-
ting us to draw tentative inferences re-
garding trends in projectile technologies,
hunting strategies, and settlement mo-
bility. Finally, issues of regional hunter-
gatherer mobility or territorial ranges can
be considered through visual or geochem-
ical sourcing studies of lithic raw materi-
als and a consideration of projectile point
distributions.

Settlement and Demographic Trends as
Revealed by the Radiocarbon Record
and Projectile Point Frequencies

As mentioned above, it has been noted

that through time there are increasing
numbers of occupations from the Early
and Middle to Late Archaic periods. Site
counts and densities have been presented
in support of these observations (Car-
michael 1986; Mallouf 1985; Whalen
1980a), and while interpretations derived
from such data (e.g., S. Anderson 1993)
are certainly useful and sufﬁcient to ob-
tain a general impression of population
trends or increasing levels of settlement
intensity through time, the multicompo-
nent nature of most archeological sites in
the region may tend to inﬂate or reduce
“site” counts within various temporal pe-
riods and ultimately provide an inaccu-
rate conception of population or settle-
ment trends.

As another measure of these trends—

albeit imperfect in its own right—we
refer to the radiocarbon record using re-
cent compilations of chronometric dates
from the region (Mallouf 1985; M. Mil-
ler 1996a). Fig. 7.16 illustrates a por-
tion of the Jornada Mogollon/western

Trans-Pecos radiocarbon record between
6000 b.c. and a.d. 500, encompassing
the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic peri-
ods and early centuries of the Formative
period. Four major archeological feature
classes or contexts are depicted: residen-
tial structures, rockshelter deposits, and
thermal features with and without rock
heating elements. A ﬁfth graph displays
the distribution of early cultigen dates
from Fresnal and Tornillo Shelters (see
Fig. 7.16).

Radiocarbon-dated contexts are rare
during the Early Archaic and ﬁrst half of

the Middle Archaic periods. A slight in-
crease in the number of radiocarbon-

during the Middle Archaic, along with
the ﬁrst evidence for the construction of

ing thermal features or other subsistence
and economic activities resulting in the
deposition of datable materials were un-
common. During the Late Archaic, a pro-

nounced increase in the numbers of ra-
diocarbon-dated features and contexts be-
gins between 1200 and 1000 b.c., a time
period corresponding to the appearance
of cultigens. Another more pronounced
rise in date frequencies across all feature
types and contexts occurs near the close
of the Late Archaic (between 200 b.c. and
a.d. 1), particularly for the numbers of
dated house structures and cultigen dates
(see Fig. 7.16). The majority of these
contexts show similar trends, with the ex-
ception that the trajectory for house
structures lags behind thermal features.

There does appear to be a general cor-
relation between the appearance of culti-
gens and an increase in the number of
radiocarbon-dated contexts that, based
upon an initial and uncritical appraisal,
could suggest a linkage between changing
demographic patterns and the adoption
of cultigens. Does the appearance of
cultigens represent a cause or effect of in-
creasing population levels and/or land use
intensity as represented by much higher
numbers of dated features and compo-
nents? We also wonder whether increas-
ing levels of feature construction, site
counts, or occupational intensity (via in-
creasing numbers of radiocarbon-dated
contexts) represent population growth
within the Jornada and Trans-Pecos re-

gions or reﬂect extraregional population
factors that resulted in reduced territorial
ranges available for exploitation. That is,
population growth per se may not have
occurred, but what took place instead was
an increasing intensiﬁcation of land use
within the region, resulting from increas-
ingly restricted territorial ranges, while
population levels may have remained rela-
tively stable. As will be shown below, pro-
nounced changes in regional territories
and dynamics may have occurred dur-
ing—and particularly at the end of—the
Archaic period.

Additional questions remain, however,

regarding how accurately or reliably the
radiocarbon record reﬂects prehistoric
demographics or patterns of feature and
land use. Another independent measure
of these patterns is provided through data
collected in the region during surveys
on the relative proportions of projectile
points representative of each Archaic pe-
riod time interval (Fig. 7.17). These sur-
veys produced projectile point data from
ﬁve studies within the limits of Fort Bliss
and White Sands Missile Range in the
Hueco and Tularosa Bolsons, including
the BorderStar 85 and McGregor Range
surveys in the southern Tularosa Basin
(Beckes 1977; O’Hara 1988), two recent
site revisitation projects in the Hueco

Bolson (Lukowski 1997; Lukowski and
Stuart 1996), and Katz’s (1992) overview
of projectile points collected from the
Fort Bliss maneuver areas of the Hueco
and Tularosa Bolsons.

Some degree of variation among these

studies should be expected because of
variable survey intensities and coverage of
different topographic zones, as well as
idiosyncrasies and differing classiﬁcation
approaches. Despite this variation, the
ﬁve series show similar trends. Paleo-
indian and Early Archaic projectile points,
respectively, do not exceed 10 percent of
the respective samples. The proportion of
Middle Archaic forms averages 25 per-
cent. The largest increase occurs during
the Late Archaic and Early Formative,
with most studies recording proportions
of more than 50 percent for projectile
forms of these periods. Proportions of
later Formative period (ca. a.d. 600 –
1450) forms decrease sharply and are
present in only slightly higher propor-
tions than Paleoindian and Early Archaic
forms (see Fig. 7.17). Projectile points of
unambiguous Historic period age (e.g.,
metal points) have been formally recorded
during only two surveys at Fort Bliss and
Holloman Air Force Base (Hawthorne
1994; Lukowski 1997) and overall are ex-
ceptionally rare (see Thompson 1980,

however, for examples from uncontrolled
collections in the northern Tularosa Ba-
sin). However, it should be noted that
specimens of small, triangular points
identical to Late Formative period arrow
points have been recovered from Spanish
Colonial period components in the El
Paso lower valley (Graves 1995; Melton
and Harrison 1996; O’Leary and Miller
1992); therefore, it is possible that similar
specimens from various sites in the region
represent Historic period occupations.
An initial impression suggests that
trends in projectile point frequencies ap-
pear to support the inference of increas-
ing population levels and/or land use in-
tensity through the Archaic period. Yet
what do these trends really represent? The
ﬁnal bar in Fig. 7.17 indicates the pro-
portion of the summed radiocarbon dis-
tribution for the Jornada region falling
within each time interval. This trend in
radiocarbon proportions is quite different
from that suggested by projectile point
frequencies. Although we acknowledge
that smaller points may have been missed
more often during surface surveys and
that this situation may have biased the
sample, it is still clear that the dispropor-
tionate representation of radiocarbon
dates and projectile points during the
Late Formative period indicates a distinct
change in subsistence and land use, in-
cluding a reduced emphasis on hunting
and, as suggested by Mauldin (1995,
1996a), an increase in the logistical use of
the basin topographic zone that did not
require the construction and use of ther-
mal features or habitation structures.

As differences among the two data sets
illustrate changing settlement adaptations
during the Late Formative period, a fur-
ther possibility is that the lack of concor-
dance between the respective proportions
of projectile points and radiocarbon dates
for the Middle Archaic may also indicate
shifts in subsistence and mobility strate-
gies in contrast to the Early and Late Ar-
chaic periods. Of course, the rarity of
Middle Archaic radiocarbon dates may be
due to preservation and visibility biases,
with Middle Archaic components having
been more commonly buried in alluvial
deposits or eroded within basin land-
forms. Indeed, evidence for a major ero-
sional event between 7000 and 6000 b.c.
is evident in lagged carbonate nodules

(Monger 1993) and thus may account for
the absence of Paleoindian dates and the
frequently lagged context of artifacts at
sites of this period.

Yet, as observed for the Late Formative,

the lack of concordance between projec-
tile points and dates may be evidence that
different patterns of settlement and land
use occurred during the Middle Archaic
as opposed to the Early and Late Archaic.
There are one or more alternative expla-
nations to those based solely on preserva-
tion and visibility factors. First, Middle
Archaic adaptations may have involved a
greater emphasis on hunting and did not
require thermal features. Second, Middle
Archaic occupations may have involved
low-intensity logistical use of basin land-
forms, with a greater settlement focus in
alluvial fans and river margins. In provi-
sional support of this argument is the fact
that the currently known distribution of
Middle Archaic house structures at Key-
stone Dam, Vista del Sol, and the NAHO
project area are all in proximity to the Rio
Grande Valley. Based as it is on a sample
of three sites, this observation is tenuous,
however. Third, Middle Archaic adapta-
tions may represent different patterns of
mobility and territorial exploitation, with
concomitant changes in technology.

Trends in Projectile Point
Form and Technology

An examination of projectile technolo-

gies provides some insights into these is-
sues. While projectile points were only
one aspect of compound weapon systems
that through time included atlatls, bows,
foreshafts, and spear or arrow shafts,
changes in subsistence and settlement
adaptations would alter the technological
requirements underlying the use and de-
sign of the various compound weapons,
and this in turn should be reﬂected by
changes in their individual components,
including projectile points.

The most obvious trend involves dis-
tinctive changes in the hafting element of
Archaic points: a change from strong-
stemmed or split-stem Early Archaic
forms, to contracting stem and concave
base forms as well as expanding stem
forms of the Middle Archaic, to side-
notched, convex, or ﬂat-based Late Ar-
chaic varieties. The signiﬁcance of chang-
ing hafting designs has been considered

in numerous studies (see Christenson
1987; Keeley 1982; Odell 1994; Tomka
and Prewitt 1993). Possible explanations
for different haft conﬁgurations, as well as
the corresponding presence of barbs or
shoulders, include efforts to modify the
security of the point’s attachment to the
shaft, to increase the damage or depth of
penetration of a point, or to either allow a
projectile to remain inside or make it easy
to extract from prey. Different haft con-
ﬁgurations also affect the overall durability
of a tool in that barbs and basal protru-
sions may be more easily broken during
use and require more time to manufac-
ture. Little experimental work has been
conducted to assess these patterns, and
thus the speciﬁc functional aspects of dif-
fering haft elements remain conjectural.
However, it is probable that choices in
the design and manufacture of projectile
point haft elements (and other elements)
should reﬂect differing subsistence and
settlement adaptations (Odell 1994;
Tomka and Prewitt 1993).

Haft conﬁgurations may convey or
reﬂect stylistic information (see Tomka
and Prewitt 1993). While slight varia-
tions in hafting or blade form evident in
general trends of point form throughout
the Trans-Pecos may have stylistic origins
or otherwise be due to culturally con-
strained norms of manufacture, we be-
lieve that the larger technological trend
of Early, Middle, and Late Archaic haft
and shoulder conﬁgurations does indeed
represent speciﬁc technological require-
ments of tool use as related to broad pat-
terns of changing subsistence and mobil-
ity adaptations.

In addition to these general morpho-

logical attributes, aspects of projectile
size, raw material composition, and blade
modiﬁcations offer more speciﬁc infor-
mation. Fig. 7.18 illustrates several trends
among a sample of 1,233 projectile points
recovered during surface collections and
testing projects at Fort Bliss. The ﬁrst two
graphs (Fig. 7.18a, b) concern several
metric variables involving blade and haft
elements. It is clear that while the major-
ity of these variables are highly correlated,
they do document a consistent trend of
decreasing projectile point size through
time. The most distinctive change occurs
between the Late Archaic and Early For-
mative periods, which in part reﬂects the

vation and highly maintainable, multi-
functional bifacial tools.

Patterns of raw material utilization pro-

vide additional evidence of Archaic pro-
jectile point technology (see Fig. 7.18).
As noted previously, Early Archaic projec-
tiles have a greater incidence of medium-
and coarse-grained materials. Utilization
of ﬁne-grained cherts remains relatively
stable throughout the Paleoindian-

Archaic-Formative sequence, while
medium-grained varieties decline steadily
through time. Aside from these gradual
changes, the most pronounced difference
in raw material use occurs during the Late
Archaic/Early Formative, when obsidian
and Rancheria chert use increases dramat-
ically. Obsidian, obtained primarily from
secondary gravel deposits along the an-
cestral and present course of the Rio

shift to arrow points and the adoption of
the bow and arrow. However, Early Ar-
chaic projectiles are among the largest of
the sequence, particularly among several
dimensions of the haft element (stem).
Examination of the 1,233 projectile
point specimens revealed that 39 percent
had evidence of retouch, primarily along
blade margins, shoulders, and haft ele-
ments (M. Miller 1996a). While simple
retouching and reworking of projectiles is
commonly seen among Early and Late Ar-
chaic points from the western part of the
Trans-Pecos, more extensive modiﬁcations
in the form of beveled and serrated blades
occur predominantly among Middle Ar-
chaic forms; this provides additional evi-
dence for a distinctive Middle Archaic
technological pattern (see Fig. 7.18). Two
major forms of blade modiﬁcations were
investigated: beveling and serration. More
than 35 percent of the Middle Archaic
points have these blade modiﬁcations,
compared to less than 5 percent of the
Late Archaic or Late Archaic/Early For-
mative projectile points. While the pres-
ence of edge serration and beveling on
points is not uncommon in the southern
Southwest (e.g., Wills 1988), it appears
that the Jornada region has an unusually
high incidence compared to several other
regions.

The speciﬁc tool performance charac-
teristics of beveled and serrated blades are
uncertain. Experimental work conducted
by Stanley A. Ahler (1971) indicates that
serrated edges are more suitable for hide
cutting and skinning and may increase
the piercing power of the projectile. An-
drew L. Christenson (1987) and others
view serration as reﬂecting raw material
conservation. Resharpening a projectile
blade by adding serrations increases the
overall cutting edge surface or length
while conserving the material of the edge.
Blade beveling—the resharpening of al-
ternate edges along the blade—is also
seen as a means of conserving raw mate-
rial (Sollberger 1971). There is also some
question as to whether blade beveling in-
dicates the use of the projectiles as multi-
functional bifacial tools (Ahler 1971). In
either case, these patterns indicate that
Middle Archaic projectile points are part
of a distinctive technology in the Archaic
tradition, one that may have had a spe-
ciﬁc emphasis on raw material conser-

and mobility through the Archaic. Recent
studies of hunter-gatherers emphasize the
relationship between technology, subsis-
tence resources, and settlement mobility.
As suggested by Bleed (1986) and Kuhn
(1994), mobile groups should employ
maintainable, portable, and durable tools,
while Schott (1986) proposed that mo-
bile groups would also require a greater
degree of versatility among their tools.

In this sense, Early Archaic forms may
be considered “overdesigned” (see Bleed
1986; Nelson 1991) in that they are
among the largest and thickest projectile
points in the Trans-Pecos, were com-
monly manufactured of durable materials
more resistant to breakage (although of-
ten less amenable to resharpening), and
had simple, reliable haft elements (or
strong stems) that lacked notches, barbs,
basal protrusions, and other easily break-
able items. Reliability and durability ap-
pear to be the preferred design character-
istics among Early Archaic projectile
points. Subsistence and settlement
changes during the Early Archaic may be
reﬂected by a change in prey selection
and hunting practices, as suggested by the
adoption of stemmed projectile point
forms, in addition to a reduced emphasis
on tool maintenance and a greater em-
phasis on reliability.

The most distinctive trait of Middle
Archaic projectile points lies in the fre-
quency of blade modiﬁcations, including
beveling, serration, and extensive re-
touching. It has not been determined
whether such patterns indicate an in-
creased emphasis on the conservation of
raw materials, multiple uses of the tools,
and/or an increased efﬁciency in felling
prey. Nevertheless, they suggest that the
design and use of projectile points among
Middle Archaic groups reﬂect patterns of
technological and settlement organization
different from those in earlier and later
intervals of the Archaic. By contrast with
the Early Archaic, the design of Middle
Archaic projectile points indicates a
greater emphasis on renewability and
maintainability, and in the sense that pro-
jectiles may have served more than one
function, they also constitute a highly
portable and versatile tool kit.

The early portion of the Late Archaic

does not differ appreciably in these re-
spects from the Middle Archaic. However,
projectile technologies undergo several

Grande, may be considered primarily a
local material in that 95 percent of the
geochemically sourced obsidian artifacts
have been assigned to source groups from
northern New Mexico present in the
Pliocene- and Pleistocene-aged gravels of
the valley (Church 1998a; M. Miller and
Shackley 1998). Rancheria chert is an-
other distinctive, easily recognized raw
material (O’Laughlin 1980; Carmichael
1985) that outcrops in several locations
in mountain chains bordering the Hueco
and Mesilla Bolsons (Loudon and Bow-
sher 1949). Both of these materials are of
inferior quality to many other regional

sources; Rancheria chert often contains
solution joints and has a blocky fracture,
while the small size of obsidian nodules
limits the range and size of tool forms
that can be manufactured from them.
However, both sources are abundant
throughout a large part of the Jornada re-
gion, and the drastic increase in their use
indicates a greater utilization of easily ob-
tained materials.

Considered in tandem, these patterns

of projectile point design, raw material
composition, and use indicate distinctive
changes in technological organization
that, in turn, reﬂect changes in subsistence

major modiﬁcations during the second
half of the Late Archaic and the early part
of the Formative periods. These modiﬁ-
cations include the shift to corner- and
side-notched forms, a signiﬁcant decrease
in size, and a much reduced emphasis on
blade modiﬁcations. An increase in the
use of locally abundant raw materials also
occurs during this time. The design and
raw material characteristics of these pro-
jectile points reﬂect less intensive mainte-
nance and a reduced durability or versa-
tility. When considered in terms of the
considerable increase in the numbers of
radiocarbon-dated thermal features and
structures present across several environ-
mental zones in the western Trans-Pecos,
these changes in Late Archaic/Early For-
mative projectile technology indicate:
(a) a more intensive land use pattern and
(b) a concomitant decrease in group mo-
bility, in terms of either the number and
duration of group moves across the land-
scape or a reduction in territorial ranges
available for exploitation by populations,
which resulted in a more intensive use of
smaller areas.

Additional Aspects of Mobility,
Territoriality, and Regional Dynamics

The study of projectile point form also
offers a more traditional means of consid-
ering regional dynamics. Unfortunately,
this research has taken place primarily
under the rubric of “regional interaction”
and accordingly has been reported almost
entirely by means of comparing projectile
point forms of one region with those of
adjacent regions. For example, based on
similarities of projectile forms of the
Cochise (Sayles 1983) and Oshara Tradi-
tions (Irwin-Williams 1973, 1979), Katz
(1992) makes a deﬁnitive statement that
the cultural afﬁnities of the western Trans-
Pecos are primarily toward the west and
north. This perspective belies the fact that
many projectile forms have analogs in sev-
eral regional sequences and may instead
represent broad technological patterns
rather than speciﬁc cultural traditions.
Speciﬁc geographic distributions of
projectile point forms do exist through-
out the Trans-Pecos. Late Archaic dart
points common to the southern portions
of the region (Brewster, Terrell, and Pre-
sidio Counties) include Shumla, Palmi-
llas, Paisano, Ensor, San Pedro, Figueroa,
Frio, Marcos, Paisano, Conejo, and Char-

cos (Mallouf 1990). In the northern sec-
tor of the eastern Trans-Pecos, Shumla
and Paisano forms are rare and Charcos
and Conejo are absent (Roney 1985). It
is possible that some projectile point forms
may indeed represent distinct cultural tra-
ditions or speciﬁc instances of population
movements. We also believe that it is un-
likely that populations inhabiting differ-
ent regions existed without any form of
contact with each other. However, we
currently lack the chronological resolution
necessary to determine whether many of
the highly variable projectile forms char-
acteristic of each Archaic subperiod were
manufactured contemporaneously.

More consistent information on Ar-
chaic period mobility and territoriality
can be obtained from studies of chipped
stone raw material distributions, and re-
cent geochemical analyses suggest that it
is quite likely that territorial ranges of Ar-
chaic groups have been underestimated.
Geochemical sourcing studies are in a de-
velopmental stage, and problems with
differentiating among a multitude of local
and nonlocal chipped stone materials us-
ing visual or geochemical methods pose
several interpretative problems (Church
et al. 1996). Most problematic is deter-
mining the range of within-source varia-
tion versus between-source variation for
the myriad of raw material types available
and used by prehistoric groups that are
widely distributed among primary and
secondary sources of igneous, metamor-
phic, and sedimentary materials across
the Trans-Pecos. Yet, as seen with recent
studies of Paleoindian technology and
toolstone, such evidence is present.

Obsidian geochemical sourcing studies

provide the most reliable and extensive
data for considerations of mobility and
territoriality. R. Jones (1990) notes that
obsidian accounts for 1.2 percent of the
lithic sample from Unit C29 in Fresnal
Shelter. Four samples were chemically
characterized, three of which were sourced
to the Jemez region of north-central New
Mexico, although it is likely that the ob-
sidian was actually procured from sec-
ondary gravel deposits in the Rio Grande
Valley. The fourth sample was identiﬁed
as Cerro del Medio. It may indicate pro-
curement at the source in the Jemez re-
gion because recent studies suggest that
this material does not enter the Rio
Grande gravels (Church et al. 1996; Le-

Tourneau and Shackley 1998). Obsidian
does not naturally occur in the vicinity of
Fresnal Shelter, so the samples found in
the region indicate that there were popu-
lation movements of at least one hundred
kilometers between Fresnal Shelter and
natural obsidian procurement areas in the
Rio Grande Valley. The presence of Cerro
del Medio obsidian may indicate either
contact with groups in northern New
Mexico or that this region was part of the
territorial range of Archaic period inhabi-
tants of Fresnal Shelter.

Movements of equivalent or greater

distances are evident through the re-
cent identiﬁcation in Jornada Mogollon
assemblages of obsidian from several
sources in Chihuahua, Mexico (M. Miller
and Shackley 1998). One of the Chi-
huahuan sources, Sierra Fresnal, is situ-
ated approximately one hundred kilome-
ters southeast of the Hueco and Mesilla
Bolsons. While the sources of obsidian
represented in Archaic period assemblages
are not nearly as distant as those noted
for nonlocal materials in Paleoindian as-
semblages, they nevertheless suggest a
considerable geographic area of mobility,
extending from northern Chihuahua to
northern New Mexico.

The temporal distribution of datable
specimens from Chihuahuan sources is
bimodal (Fig. 7.19a), occurring almost
exclusively during the Archaic period,
although several specimens have been
identiﬁed at a single early Historic period
site. No occurrences of these Chihuahuan
groups have yet been identiﬁed in Forma-
tive period contexts. More speciﬁc attri-
bution to Archaic subperiods is seldom
possible, but the majority appear to be
associated with Middle and Late Archaic
occupations. Although the sample is very
small, Middle Archaic contracting-stem
projectile forms (Pelona or Augustin
types) tend to be particularly pronounced
among these Chihuahuan compositional
groups. A comparison of the proportional
distributions of obsidian sources among
projectile points or bifaces versus other
artifact types (see Fig. 7.19b) indicates
that the occurrence of obsidian from Chi-
huahua is disproportionately higher than
for all other sources, including those com-
mon in the Rio Grande gravels (M. Mil-
ler and Shackley 1998). This situation
indicates that such tools were transported
in ﬁnished form.

artiﬁcial border” (Beckes and Adovasio
1982, 207). In stark contrast to this
broad Archaic tradition, textiles from
Formative or Late Prehistoric period con-
texts have predominantly Mogollon
(western New Mexico) characteristics.
Together, data from obsidian distribu-
tions and textiles indicate that a pro-
nounced shift in regional dynamics oc-
curred at the close of the Archaic period.

Summary of the Archaic Period

Important changes in subsistence,
settlement mobility and land use, territo-
rial ranges, and technological organiza-
tion apparently took place during the Ar-
chaic period. However, several of the
observed trends, and particularly infer-
ences derived from these observations, are
tentative. Clearly, additional information
in the form of corroborative data sets is
required, particularly through analyses of
faunal, macroﬂoral, and other subsistence
data, settlement patterns, chipped stone
assemblages, and raw material distribu-
tions. It is hoped that our discussion will
provoke a broader consideration of settle-
ment and adaptation over the long Ar-
chaic sequence.

The rarity of radiocarbon-dated fea-
tures during the Middle Archaic period
may be due to large-scale changes in sub-
sistence practices and landscape use that
are distinct from the Early and Late Ar-
chaic. Such a perspective offers an alterna-
tive means of investigating this temporal
interval that reaches beyond explanations
based solely on site preservation and
archeological visibility. The Late Archaic
period is also marked by several distinct
changes in demographics, land use inten-
sity, feature variability, and technology.
These cultural patterns that became ac-
centuated or intensiﬁed during the Late
Archaic persist through much of the sub-
sequent Formative period.

Formative Period/Late
Prehistoric Period
(A.D. 200 –1450)

The Formative period encompasses
several important transitions in prehis-
toric settlement adaptations. In the west-
ern Trans-Pecos, a relatively rapid succes-
sion of changes in architectural form,
settlement structure, subsistence, and
technology occurred, including a decreas-

along a north-south axis, while sources
present in Formative period contexts have
an east-west geographic distribution.
Overall, a surprisingly minor amount of
Archaic period obsidian is from sources
in western New Mexico and southeastern
Arizona, indicating that territorial ranges
were primarily restricted within the Chi-
huahuan Desert basin and range ecozone
of the Trans-Pecos, south-central New
Mexico, and northern Chihuahua.

Interestingly, a similar interpretation
has been proposed by Michael R. Beckes

and James M. Adovasio (1982; see also
Adovasio 1974). Detailed studies of Ar-
chaic period textiles from rockshelters
throughout the Trans-Pecos, the Mogo-
llon region of western New Mexico, and
Coahuila identiﬁed several similarities in
diagnostic basketry and weaving methods
between the Trans-Pecos and northern
Mexico. Beckes and Adovasio propose the
existence of a related tradition and similar
developmental continuum and also that
the “TransPecos Archaic north of the Rio
Grande is but a single expression or a se-
ries of regional expressions of the Archaic
culture(s) directly to the south of that

ing mobility coupled with increasing agri-
cultural dependence and specialization,
culminating in the a.d. 1250/1300 –1450
Puebloan occupations. A similar pattern
took place in the La Junta district of the
eastern Trans-Pecos. While the agricultur-
ally based Puebloan occupations of the
Jornada and La Junta regions have re-
ceived the most attention, the results of
sporadic work conducted throughout
other areas of the Trans-Pecos suggest
that Native Americans in those locations
were also affected to some degree by these
signiﬁcant cultural changes.

Chronological sequences for the Late
Prehistoric period are generally undeﬁned
throughout much of the eastern Trans-
Pecos. Developments in these areas have
often simply been assigned to a generic
Late Prehistoric temporal interval, al-
though cultural-historical sequences from
adjoining regions have occasionally been
adopted. Three generally contemporane-
ous phases have been deﬁned for the Jor-
nada and La Junta regions. In the La
Junta district ( J. C. Kelley et al. 1940),
these include the poorly deﬁned Chisos
phase (a.d. 1–900/1000), the Livermore
phase (a.d. 900/1000 –1200), and the La
Junta phase (a.d. 1200 –1400).

The Formative period in the western
Trans-Pecos also has been traditionally di-
vided into three phases (Lehmer 1948):
Mesilla (a.d. 900 –1100), Doña Ana (a.d.
1100 –1200), and El Paso (a.d. 1200 –
1400). Lehmer’s original beginning date
of a.d. 900 for the Mesilla phase has been
extended to a.d. 200/400, depending on
the source and consideration of when
El Paso brownware ceramics ﬁrst appear
(see Miller’s discussion in Perttula et al.
1995a). Whalen (1978, 1985b) subse-
quently integrated these phases into larger
taxonomic units, placing the Mesilla
phase within the Early Formative, or Pit-
house period, and the Doña Ana and El
Paso phases within the Late Formative, or
Pueblo period.

The tripartite sequence of Mesilla,
Doña Ana, and El Paso is used in most
cultural-historical overviews, and regional
developments and/or evolutionary trends
are described accordingly within this
structure. Commonly cited characteristics
of the Mesilla phase include insubstantial
pithouse architecture, plain El Paso
brown ceramics (Fig. 7.20), and nonlocal
wares such as Mimbres whiteware. Do-

mesticated plant species were utilized, al-
though cultigens appeared to have played
a minor role in what continued to be a
mobile hunter-gatherer adaptive system.
The Doña Ana phase, the existence of
which has long been a subject of con-
tention, has been considered part of the

pithouse-to-pueblo transition. Architec-
tural forms included pithouses as well
as surface rooms. El Paso plain brown,
bichrome, and polychrome ceramics were
produced, and the presence of a wider va-
riety of nonlocal ceramic wares suggests
greater levels of interaction with adjoin-

ing regions. The El Paso phase, consid-
ered to be the apex of Native American
cultural development in the region, in-
cludes habitation in pueblos by agricul-
turally dependent populations, reduced
settlement mobility, a more restricted
settlement distribution focusing on well-
watered landforms across the landscape,
and greater levels of social complexity and
religious expression.

Recent temporal and taxonomic revi-
sions to this Formative period sequence
in the western Trans-Pecos suggest that
the Mesilla phase (Pithouse period) prob-
ably dates from a.d. 200/400 to 1000,
the Doña Ana or Transitional phase from
a.d. 1000 to 1250/1300, and the El Paso
phase (Pueblo period) between a.d. 1250/
1300 and 1450. It would be equally plau-
sible to characterize the a.d. 1000 –1150
period as a terminal extension of the
Mesilla phase, with recognition of a
transitional pithouse-to-pueblo interval
between a.d. 1150 and 1250/1300.
However, the terms “Pithouse period,”
“Pueblo period,” and “pithouse-to-pueblo
transition” are somewhat misleading in
that pithouses were used throughout the
Formative period, as well as during the
earlier Middle and Late Archaic periods.
Clearly, there exists a substantial de-

gree of confusion and debate over the
present sequence of phases, their nomen-
clature and material culture manifesta-
tions, and other aspects of regional phase-
based systematics. As argued by M. Miller
(1993a, 1996b), resolution depends on
which criteria—adaptive changes or nor-
mative lists of material traits (such as ce-
ramics and architecture)—are used to
partition the archeological sequence.
Considerable overlap exists among mate-
rial culture traits conventionally used to
partition cultural-historical phases and
periods, and as such the chronological pe-
riods may be best viewed in a heuristic
sense. The use of phases and periods
serves not only to obscure important pat-
terns in the prehistory of the region but
also may often accentuate the importance
or apparent abruptness of certain cultural
patterns that realistically can be viewed as
part of a continuum. For example, the
a.d. 1000 beginning date for the Transi-
tional or Doña Ana phase implies that
subsequent developments occurred inde-
pendently of, or at least signify a major
departure from, those of the preceding

Mesilla phase. However, several aspects of
the Mesilla phase may also be considered
part of this long trajectory. The trend to-
ward sedentary— or at least semiseden-
tary—and agriculturally based adapta-
tions that are characteristic of the El Paso
and La Junta phases had their initial ori-
gins in developments beginning during
the latter part of the Mesilla phase (a.d.
600 –1000), if not in the earlier Late
Archaic.

Developments between a.d. 200/400
and 1450 are considered part of a contin-
uum of increasing agricultural depen-
dence and social integration, and this
continuum is reﬂected in a corresponding
decrease in settlement mobility. The re-
ﬁned chronometric resolution and exten-
sive database compilations available for
study can be employed to document
synchronous trends among a number of
regional patterns. Changes in architec-
tural form and site structure are reﬂected
by changes in regional settlement pat-
terns and land use. These changes, in
turn, closely correspond with periods of
change or stability in technologies such
as groundstone, ceramics, chipped stone,
and thermal features. Several of these
trends cut across one or more of the time
intervals traditionally assigned to the
Mesilla–Doña Ana–El Paso phase se-
quence, and important transitional peri-
ods in the archeological record do not
match the speciﬁc points in time conven-
tionally used to delimit phase boundaries,
inasmuch as such phase boundaries are
intended to denote major periods of
change.

Formative period cultural develop-
ments as reﬂected by changes in architec-
ture, settlement pattern, and technology
have almost universally been perceived in
terms of increasing agricultural depen-
dence; current evidence does not appre-
ciably alter this. However, archeological
information from the Jornada region also
suggests that prehistoric populations may
have become more agriculturally special-
ized between a.d. 1250/1300 and 1450.
While similar architecture and material
culture patterns exist in the La Junta
district of the eastern Trans-Pecos, the
degree of agricultural dependence or spe-
cialization may not have been as pro-
nounced. Elsewhere throughout the east-
ern Trans-Pecos, corresponding changes
suggest that agricultural developments in

the Jornada and La Junta regions had a
broad reach or that at least some level of
interaction occurred between these vari-
ous Native American groups.

Architectural Forms and
Settlement Structure

The most conspicuous aspect of the
Formative period involves the increas-
ingly formal organization of residential
settlements and accompanying changes in
architectural form that occurred between
a.d. 200 and 1250/1300. Several impor-
tant trends occurred during this thou-
sand-year period, beginning with habita-
tion primarily in informally constructed
huts and pithouses, moving on to more
formally constructed rooms, and ulti-
mately the joining of rooms to form con-
tiguous room blocks, or pueblos.

Much of the early avocational and pro-
fessional archeological work in the region
prior to the 1980s emphasized the deﬁni-
tion and description of Formative period
architectural forms, often to the exclusion
of detailed studies of material culture and
subsistence remains. Despite this short-
coming, the sequence of architectural de-
velopments in the western and eastern
Trans-Pecos serves as a fundamental point
of reference for interpretations of chang-
ing patterns of settlement mobility and
sedentism, agricultural dependence, and
changes in social and technological orga-
nization. Discussions of residential struc-
tures in the Southwest and other regions
have acknowledged the energy investment
of differing house forms as an indication
of the mobility of the inhabitants (e.g.,
Binford 1990; Gilman 1983, 1987). The
ephemeral and shallow pithouse struc-
tures characteristic of many Mesilla phase
occupations involved little energy expen-
diture, implying occupations of shorter
duration or lesser intensity than the for-
mal house structures and pueblos of later
periods. With these issues in mind, we
preface the following discussion with an
updated review of the architectural se-
quence of the Trans-Pecos. Newly ac-
quired chronometric dates from several
habitation sites allow the sequence to be
placed in a reliable temporal framework.

There has been considerable discussion
of various forms of prehistoric residential
structures in the Trans-Pecos (e.g., Brook
1975; Carmichael 1985; Hard 1983a,
n.d.; J. C. Kelley 1985, 1986; Lehmer

Pithouse structures include circular

and subrectangular or square shapes.
Later pithouses tend toward subrectangu-
lar and square shapes, but there is consid-
erable variation across the region, and
two or more shapes may occur within in-
dividual sites. Circular pithouses of the
Late Formative period tend to be more
substantial than their predecessors of the
Mesilla phase, often having greater depths
and ﬂoor space, although a clear lack
of formality in construction continues.
These differences may also reﬂect shifting
settlement locations, as pithouses situated
in riverine zones and alluvial fans tend to
be more substantial than those docu-
mented in the central basin landforms.
Prepared or plastered ﬂoors and walls are
rare in pithouses, but subﬂoor features in-
clude small, unlined hearths, few and ir-
regularly positioned postholes, and occa-
sional storage pits. Many structures,
however, lack subﬂoor features.

More formally constructed structures,
namely formal, noncontiguous rooms, or
simply isolated rooms, appear during later
time intervals; the term “pit room” has
also been used, along with the somewhat
inappropriate term “pithouse.” These
structures have a substantially greater for-
mality and uniformity in construction
than pithouses. Typically, they are square
in shape, shallow in depth, and have pre-
pared caliche or adobe-plastered ﬂoors;
walls are also occasionally plastered. Inte-
rior subﬂoor features include centrally lo-
cated ﬁre pits surrounded by raised, plas-
tered collars, occasional storage or burial
pits, and sometimes stepped entryways.
Exterior and interior posthole arrange-
ments vary, but two main support posts
are usually present along a central axis
(see Fig. 7.21).

This architectural form may be a pre-
cursor to pueblo rooms, and similarities
between the two room forms have been
noted (Batcho et al. 1985; O’Laughlin
and Martin 1990). The primary distinc-
tion between the two forms is that pueblo
rooms are joined together to form con-
tiguous room blocks, although isolated
rooms tend to have smaller ﬂoor areas
than pueblo rooms. Characteristics
shared between the two forms include
square or rectangular shapes and caliche-
plastered ﬂoors and walls. Pueblo ﬂoor
and subﬂoor features include collared
hearths, storage or cache pits, and burial

1990, 1994; O’Laughlin 1980; O’Laugh-
lin and Martin 1990; Whalen 1977,
1980b, 1994a). Architectural forms of
the Formative period may be subsumed
under four categories: huts, pithouses,
formally constructed noncontiguous (iso-
lated) rooms, and contiguous room blocks
or pueblos (Fig. 7.21). These categories
are intended primarily to facilitate com-
parisons and should not be understood as
representing the entire range of architec-
tural diversity in the region.

A common form of residential struc-
ture found at many habitation sites of ap-
parently short duration is what Whalen
(1981a) and Hard (1983a, 44) termed
“huts.” These structures have small diam-
eters (averaging 2.5 m) and shallow (15 –

30 cm) dish-shaped basins with sloping,
insubstantial walls. They lack prepared
ﬂoors or walls and have roughly circular
occupation ﬂoors (average ﬂoor area
of 6.5 m2). Common at Mesilla phase
sites (Camilli et al. 1988; Hard 1983a;
O’Laughlin 1981; Whalen 1978, 1980b,
1994a), similar structures dating to the
Archaic period have also been documented
at Keystone Dam site 33 (O’Laughlin
1980) as well as at the Late Formative
period component of Keystone Dam site
37 (Carmichael 1985). In each case, the
structures have been interpreted as a form
of ephemeral brush hut or wickiup, and a
high degree of mobility has been inferred
for the Native American occupants (Car-
michael 1985; Hard 1983a; O’Laughlin
1980; Whalen 1994a).

pits (see Fig. 7.21). Entry steps are often
present in pueblo rooms, as are occasional
small, raised platforms (sometimes re-
ferred to as “altars”). Primary posthole
patterns in pueblo rooms follow a three-
or four-post pattern.

Dating the Trans-Pecos
Architectural Sequences

Chronological placement of these ar-

chitectural forms and accompanying
settlements has long been a matter of
uncertainty and debate. Until recently
the chronological placement of pithouse
and pueblo settlements was based on ce-
ramic cross-dating and a small sample
of chronometric dates (see Brook 1970;
Whalen 1983, 1985a). Indeed, as of 1992
only twenty-eight radiocarbon and four-
teen archeomagnetic age estimates had
been obtained for El Paso phase residen-
tial sites, and the majority of radiocarbon
dates were from isolated pit room sites
(Batcho 1987; Browning 1991; Browning
et al. 1992; Duran and Batcho 1983;
O’Laughlin and Martin 1990). Radio-
carbon dates were often from vague or
ambiguous contexts and were seldom cor-
rected for isotopic fractionation. More-
over, the few archeomagnetic dates were
based on early experimentation with the
method and derived from secular varia-
tion curves (DuBois 1989) that have yet
to be fully reported; they also differed sub-
stantially from those proposed by other
archeomagnetic laboratories.

Recent compilations of chronometric

dates, combined with intensive dating
studies undertaken during the Fort Bliss
Chronometric and National Register
Pueblo projects (Bentley n.d.; M. Miller
1996a), have provided a data base of more
than 400 radiocarbon dates for Formative
period pithouse, pueblo, and isolated
room components. Archeomagnetic
sample cubes were reanalyzed using im-
proved instrumentation, and the age esti-
mates were revised using the most recent
secular variation curves. Hot Well Pueblo,
with 41 radiocarbon and 10 revised ar-
cheomagnetic dates, is now the most in-
tensively dated site in the Trans-Pecos re-
gion. Fig. 7.22 presents series of summed
probability distributions for the sample of
more than 350 radiocarbon age estimates
obtained from contexts directly associated
with the major architectural forms.

Note that archeomagnetic dating provides multiple age ranges due to inversions in the secu-
lar geomagnetic polar curves and that curves developed by differing laboratories provide
varying age estimates.

Rather than attempt to isolate speciﬁc
differences between huts and pithouses,
for this study we have assigned round or
square/subrectangular forms to structures.
Several architectural trends and transi-

tions are apparent. First, there is a shift
from circular huts/pithouses to square
pithouses between a.d. 700 and 1000,
with several more abrupt architectural
changes at approximately a.d. 1000,
1150, and 1250/1300 (see Fig. 7.22).
At ca. a.d. 1000, circular pithouses are
almost entirely replaced by rectangular
structures; the ﬁrst isolated rooms appear
at this time. A less pronounced change
occurs at a.d. 1150, when the number of
chronometrically dated isolated rooms in-
creases by more than 100 percent while

the proportion of informal pithouses de-
creases. A fourth change occurs between
a.d. 1250 and 1300. The precise dating
of this fourth event involves a greater de-
gree of imprecision because a major inver-
sion point, or “wiggle,” occurs in both the
bidecadal and decadal dendrochronologi-
cal calibration curves at this time, with
the result that radiocarbon age estimates
tend to either begin or end at around
a.d. 1280. The construction and occupa-
tion of pithouse structures essentially ends
between a.d. 1250 and 1300, and the use
of formal isolated rooms declines to that
of the preceding a.d. 1000 –1150 inter-
val. Coincident with the decline in the
use of pithouses and isolated rooms, the
majority of contiguous pueblo rooms and

JORNADA MOGOLLON AND EASTERN TR ANS-PECOS REGIONS / 241

though at the regional scale the frequency
of these structural forms covary through
time until a.d. 1000, when circular struc-
tures were apparently no longer built.
Both subrectangular pithouses and iso-
lated rooms were inhabited between a.d.
1000 and 1250/1300. Again, the relative
frequencies of these two forms covary
until sometime between a.d. 1250 and
1300, when, for the most part, pithouses
were no longer constructed. Pueblos were
occupied during the a.d. 1250/1300 –
1450 interval, but habitation of isolated
rooms persists through this period (see
Fig. 7.23).

The dated architectural sequence also
provides important insights into changing
patterns of mobility. Cross-cultural stud-
ies of architectural form have noted a re-
current pattern linking round, insubstan-
tial structures with mobile settlement
systems, while angular structures tend to
be afﬁliated with more sedentary groups
(Binford 1990; Hunter-Anderson 1977).
Lewis R. Binford (1990) also noted that
groups with variable or seasonal mobility
patterns tend to construct two or more
house forms. Seen in this perspective, the
shift from circular to square or rectangu-
lar structures, as well as the increasingly
formal nature of the angular structures,
can be interpreted as evidence for de-
creasing mobility during the Formative
period and that variable mobility and
adaptive strategies may have existed dur-
ing any given temporal interval.

Variation in Settlement Layout

The architectural picture becomes
more complex when variations in settle-
ment layout (site structure) and site for-
mation processes are considered. Site
settlement layout in earlier components
of the Formative period is known from a
small sample of sites; therefore our im-
pression may not represent the range of
spatial variability. In particular, informa-
tion on the layout of riverine settlements
of this period is lacking. Yet a range of in-
trasite arrangements of residential struc-
tures, extramural features, and activity
areas is apparent.

Several sites belonging to the Mesilla
phase and early part of the Transitional
period, including Turquoise Ridge,
North Hills, Gobernadora, and Ojasen
(M. Miller 1989, 1990; Shafer et al.

Fig. 7.23. Planview of the La Junta phase pueblo at the Millington site, Presidio
County, Texas (after J. C. Kelley 1985, 153) and radiocarbon dates from La Junta
phase architectural features at the Polvo site (41PS21), Presidio County, Texas (data
from Cloud et al. 1994, 35; Mallouf 1990, table 1). Summed probability distribution of
these age estimates is A.D. 1280 –1400 (1-sigma) and A.D. 1240 –1420 (2-sigma).

room blocks date to between a.d. 1300
and 1400.

In the eastern Trans-Pecos, Mallouf
(1990; see also J. C. Kelley and E. A. Kel-
ley 1990) obtained two radiocarbon dates
from a La Junta phase structure. Further
test excavations (Cloud et al. 1994) ob-
tained an additional sequence of dates.
The six age estimates provide the ﬁrst
chronometric data for architectural forms
in the region (Fig. 7.23). The six dates
consistently range between a.d. 1240 and
1420, contemporaneous with the period
of pueblo construction in the Jornada re-
gion. Two shallow, circular pithouses
were also excavated at the margin of Salt
Lake in Salt Flat Basin, east of the Gua-
dalupe Mountains (M. Miller 1994). Five
radiocarbon dates from ﬂoor and ﬁll con-
texts range between a.d. 600 and 1280.
Another small hut structure in the Dela-
ware Mountains is associated with several
thermal features that yielded radiocarbon
dates ranging from a.d. 1000 to 1400.
While few structures and even fewer dates
are available from this region, preliminary

evidence suggests that the general se-
quence of architectural forms in the
La Junta District follows the trend of
increasing formality apparent in the west-
ern Trans-Pecos. Elsewhere in the Trans-
Pecos, architectural forms are more con-
servative, with small huts and pithouses
predominant throughout the sequence.
The clariﬁcation of the chronological
sequence of architectural trends and tran-
sitions establishes an important frame-
work for understanding the nature of
changing demographic, mobility, and
subsistence patterns during the Formative
period. First, it is important to under-
stand that during any given temporal in-
terval at least two architectural forms
were in use, each representing different
levels of formality and labor investment
in construction. Second, each temporal
interval represents a progressively greater
level of architectural formality. Shallow,
circular pithouses (huts) were common
throughout the Mesilla phase (and Ar-
chaic period), as were more substantial
square or subrectangular pithouses, al-

1999; Whalen 1994a), have central clus-
ters of pithouses surrounded by discrete
activity areas with groups of ﬁre-cracked
rock features (Fig. 7.24). The most com-
mon type of activity area is one or more
rock-lined pits adjacent to scatters or
mounds of discarded, fractured rock.
Dense trash middens are also present.
Extramural hearths and pits are rare.

Despite the apparently coherent settle-

ment layout of these sites, unequivocal
evidence for temporal differences among
different site areas and feature types has
now been recognized (M. Miller 1990,
1995b; Whalen 1994a), most notably
with stratigraphic and horizontal differ-
ences in midden formation and pithouses
at North Hills. Fig. 7.25 illustrates one of
the more intriguing aspects of site use.
While chronometric dates for pithouses
and midden deposits range between a.d.
900 and 1150, the majority of age esti-
mates from rock-lined pit features date
between a.d. 1150 and 1250/1300, co-
eval with subsequent architectural and
settlement changes involving isolated
rooms. While not discounting the fact
that these are terminal use dates for these
features and that the features may have
been used during earlier occupations, it is
nevertheless clear that a specialized use of
these sites involving rock-lined thermal
features continued after the abandonment
of residences.

Occupations representing the later
portion of the Transitional period, such
as Meyer Range, present quite a different
arrangement of pithouses, isolated rooms,
and extramural features. Here, central
clusters of pithouses are surrounded by
a large number of features: hearths, trash
pits, and other forms of pits. Again, how-
ever, evidence for multiple occupations is
indicated by dense trash deposits in struc-
ture ﬁlls, superpositioned features, and

that Meyer Range dates between the
North Hills and Hueco Tanks Transi-

Tanks dating the latest (M. Miller 1996b).
The latest Transitional period sites have
distinctive house structures that mark a
departure from earlier pithouses. Recent
investigations during the Loop 375
Archeological Project (O’Laughlin and
Martin 1990) have documented two sites
similar to Hueco Tanks in terms of layout
and architectural form (see Fig. 7.24). As

forty-ﬁve have been excavated. These
rooms are distributed among three areas
that are more than one hundred meters
apart. A fourth equally distant area is

for another possible example). Because
several additional cases of El Paso phase
isolated rooms have been encountered
(Browning et al. 1992; O’Laughlin 1995,
personal communication; O’Laughlin
and Martin 1990; Sechrist et al. 1998), it
can no longer can be conﬁdently stated
that contiguous pueblo room blocks were
the primary focus of habitation during
the Pueblo period.

Of importance in considerations of re-
gional demographic and adaptive patterns
is that changes in the architectural se-
quence and in site structure reﬂect shifts
in settlement location and mirror tempo-
ral patterns expressed in features and arti-
facts across the region. Comparing these
patterns to those identiﬁed in other re-
cent overviews of radiocarbon dates
(Mauldin 1995; Mauldin et al. 1998;
M. Miller 1996a, 1997) reveals that shifts
in the use of various architectural forms
closely correspond with changes in fre-
quency trends in the distribution of other
feature types across different topographic
zones. For example, the gradual temporal
transition from circular to rectangular
pithouses closely corresponds to the shift
from settlements centered in the central
basins to the alluvial fan piedmonts
throughout the region.

Settlement Pattern and Land Use

Several shifts in regional settlement
patterns occurred during the Formative
period, each reﬂecting a change in demo-
graphic patterns and subsistence econo-
mies. In part, these shifts are a function
of a change from generalized to more spe-
cialized agricultural adaptation, but more
subtle patterns are also evident.

Knowledge of regional settlement pat-
terns has been obtained primarily through
large-scale surface surveys conducted at
Fort Bliss in the 1970s and early 1980s
(Beckes et al. 1977; Carmichael 1983,
1986; Mauldin 1993; Skelton et al. 1981;
Way 1979a, 1979b; Whalen 1977, 1978,
1980a). Settlement pattern studies con-
ducted by Whalen (1977, 1978) in the
Hueco Bolson ﬁrst identiﬁed a shift from
a pattern of Mesilla phase settlements
widely distributed across the interior ba-
sin to one of concentrations or “core ar-
eas” of El Paso phase settlements located
along distal alluvial fans of the Franklin
and Hueco Mountains, often adjacent to
the margins of playas. Similar site distribu-

present, but it is known from only a single
excavation unit in a room completed by
Vernon L. Scarborough (1986a). Each of
the areas consists of two or more room
blocks. To date, the largest block exca-
vated is Room Block 1 in Area 1, which
consists of twelve rooms (Fig. 7.26). This
room count is typical of linear room
block arrangements, and the majority of
pueblos in the region have fewer than ten
rooms (see, e.g., Bradley 1983; Gerald
1988; G. Moore 1947; Scarborough
1985). A notable pattern among linear
pueblo room blocks is the presence of a
single large room. These rooms have gen-
erally been characterized as ceremonial or
communal, and their consistent presence
within individual room blocks does sug-
gest some common function, possibly as-
sociated with lineage or corporate groups
inhabiting a room block.

As pointedly observed by O’Laughlin
(1996), extramural excavations have rarely
been undertaken at pueblos. An excep-
tion is Firecracker Pueblo, where several
hundred square meters of excavations
outside the room block resulted in the
discovery of dozens of features: trash and
storage pits, hearths, and several types of
unknown function. Substantial numbers
of rectangular pithouses and isolated
rooms were also found. Less extensive ex-
cavations at Hot Well Pueblo between
two major room blocks in Area 1 also
documented several refuse deposits and

pits. In contrast to Transitional period
sites, dense midden deposits appear to be
rare at pueblos, although the only thor-
ough investigation of such features took
place at La Cabrana.

Despite the apparent “village” orienta-
tion for many Formative period sites, iso-
lated Formative period pithouse struc-
tures have been excavated at a substantial
number of locations in the western Trans-
Pecos (Batcho et al. 1985; Gerow and
Hogan 1993; Kauffman and Batcho
1987, 1988; Lowry and Bentley 1997;
Mauldin et al. 1998; M. Miller et al.
1993). The functional and economic role
of these small sites, consisting of one or
two isolated structures, in relation to
larger settlements constitutes one of the
more intriguing research issues in the
Jornada.

The El Paso phase was long considered
primarily a Puebloan occupation. Pueblos
have been thought to be the predominant
architectural form because, being among
the more highly visible of site types, they
naturally received the greatest amount of
attention and excavation. Artifact scatters
of lesser extent and density have only re-
cently received notice. The existence of
isolated rooms during the Pueblo period
was not conﬁrmed until 1983 with the
discovery of such a structure at the Dona
Ana County Airport project 16 km west
of El Paso (Batcho et al. 1985; Duran and
Batcho 1983; although see Brook 1966b

investigations in one such core area at the
northeastern edge of El Paso (Kauffman
and Stuart 1994) involved revisits to sev-
eral pueblo sites and “small camps”
recorded in the 1970s and early 1980s.
Numerous sites had been vandalized with
small bulldozer trenches. Examination of
these pits identiﬁed an extensive settle-
ment zone containing isolated rooms and
small pueblos.

Formative period settlements have also
been recorded near the margins of playas
in the central basins, along the upper ter-
race edges of the Rio Grande, within
mountain canyons, or along major drain-
ages in mountain bajada landforms. Iso-
lated house structures of the Mesilla phase

are distributed across most environmental
zones. In contrast, isolated houses dating
to the second half of the Transitional pe-
riod and the El Paso phase tend to be sit-
uated near playas or the Rio Grande Val-
ley terraces. However, the distribution of
these late structures is tentative.

The riverine component of the Forma-

tive period settlement pattern is largely
unknown. Several Mesilla phase pithouse
sites such as Los Tules, Tortugas, and Roth
are situated along the margins of the val-
ley. Surprisingly few Transitional /Doña
Ana residential sites or structures have
been documented in this topographic
zone. Several large and small pueblos were
on the lower terrace of the Rio Grande

the northeastern margin of the survey area.

tions were observed during Carmichael’s
(1983, 1986) surveys of the Tularosa Ba-
sin, as well as in surveys in New Mexico
near the Jarilla Mountains (Mauldin
1993; Way 1979a), the Sacramento
Mountains (Sale and Ennes 1997; Skel-
ton et al. 1981) and the San Andres
Mountains (Duran 1982).

Both Whalen and Carmichael noted
that El Paso phase components tended to
be concentrated along alluvial fans, pre-
sumably to take advantage of rainfall
runoff for irrigation. Carmichael (1983,
1986), however, observed a subtle differ-
ence and suggested that Doña Ana com-
ponents tended to be situated at slightly
higher elevations along medial and distal
fans, in contrast to El Paso phase compo-
nents that are generally situated at lower
elevations on distal fan surfaces or the ba-
sin ﬂoor in proximity to large playas
(Fig. 7.27). Early Formative (Mesilla
phase) components are widely distributed
throughout the basin, while Late Forma-
tive (Transitional and El Paso) settle-
ments tend to cluster along the alluvial
fans of the Organ Mountains or the
fan/basin interface in the vicinity of Coe
Lake playa. In addition, Transitional
components tend to be distributed on
higher surfaces of alluvial fans while El
Paso phase settlements are closer to playas
(see Fig. 7.27).

Recent archeological surveys within

alluvial fan piedmonts of the eastern
Franklin Mountains near El Paso (Kauff-
man and Stuart 1994; Sale and Gibbs
1995) and in the Sacramento Mountains
(Sale and Ennes 1997), as well as excava-
tions at several habitation sites on the me-
dial Franklin Mountain fans (Aten 1972;
M. Miller 1989, 1990; O’Laughlin 1979;
Shafer et al. 1999), tend to support Car-
michael’s interpretation. El Paso phase
components, particularly ones with resi-
dential structures, are exceptionally rare
within the alluvial fan topographic zone.
Accordingly, the concept of El Paso
phase “core areas” is still valid, but with
modiﬁcations. More detailed archeologi-
cal information, coupled with a reﬁned
understanding of chronology and ceramic
sequences, suggests that several of these
areas may more appropriately be viewed
as foci of settlement during much of the
Late Formative period, especially between
a.d. 1150 and 1275, rather than exclu-
sively during the El Paso phase. Recent

Valley between El Paso and Las Cruces
(Brook 1975; O’Laughlin 1980). Unfor-
tunately, several decades of urban and
agricultural development have destroyed
the majority of these sites and obliterated
most of the prehistoric landscape.

An often overlooked aspect in the tra-
ditional focus on Formative period archi-
tectural sites concerns nonresidential sites
or short-term sites with special processing
facilities. Michael E. Whalen (1978) pro-
posed the existence during the puebloan
El Paso phase of special purpose sites with
burned rock features along the alluvial
fans of mountain chains. The majority of
these features have been dated to before
the pueblo interval of a.d. 1250/1300,
although radiocarbon ages from some
burned rock features range from a.d.
1250 to 1450, indicating that these fea-
tures were used for subsistence activities
even during presumably agricultural peri-
ods. Nevertheless, use of the features, and
by extension the processing of cacti, suc-
culents, or other items associated with
their use, appears to have been substan-
tially reduced during the El Paso phase in
comparison to earlier periods (M. Miller
1997).

Reviewing radiocarbon dates from the
Hueco Bolson, Mauldin (1994, 1995; see
also Mauldin et al. 1998) demonstrates
that site formation and use of thermal
features signiﬁcantly declined in the cen-
tral basins after a.d. 1000. In order to
amplify this study, we examine trends
among major feature classes and topo-
graphic landforms in the Hueco, Tu-
larosa, and Mesilla Bolsons (Fig. 7.28).
We consider thermal features and habita-
tion structures within three major envi-
ronmental zones: the central basin ﬂoor,
alluvial fans, and the fan/basin interface
in proximity to major playas. For com-
parative purposes, Fig. 7.29 includes the
previously reviewed chronometric trends
for the four major architectural forms.
All feature types and topographic
zones show a gradual rise in use through
the early part of the Formative period
(between a.d. 200 and 650). Between
a.d. 650 and 1000, both residential occu-
pations (as indicated by the presence of
the structures) and thermal features are
common throughout the central basins.
However, this period is marked by a
gradual increase in the use of alluvial fans.
This subtle shift in settlement location

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

Fig. 7.28. Summed radiocarbon probability histograms illustrating changing land use patterns
in the western Trans-Pecos/Jornada Mogollon region.

corresponds with the beginning of a grad-
ual decrease in the use of circular struc-
tures as opposed to an increase in the
construction of rectangular structures.

A major change in regional settlement
takes place at a.d. 1000, one that signiﬁes
the relatively abrupt culmination of the
landscape and architectural trends ob-
served for the preceding 350 years. The
construction and use of thermal features
and structures in the central basins de-
clines markedly, while occupation of
alluvial fans continues to increase (see
Fig. 7.28). Notably, this period of change

corresponds with the rapid shift from
construction and use of circular pithouses
to that of rectangular pithouses. This fea-
ture use pattern continues until a.d. 1150,
when another subtle shift in feature dis-
tributions is apparent across the land-
scape. At this time, utilization of the
alluvial fans reaches an apex, while settle-
ments in proximity to playas (at the fan/
basin interface) also become common.
Again, this settlement shift corresponds
to another transition in the architectural
sequence as indicated by a notable in-
crease in the use of formally constructed

07-A2946  4/13/04  12:06 PM  Page 247

JORNADA MOGOLLON AND EASTERN TR ANS-PECOS REGIONS / 247

isolated rooms. A major change in intra-
site structure or settlement layout also
takes place then.

Finally, feature distributions between
a.d. 1275 and 1450 indicate that there is
little evidence for settlements within the
central basin, at least in terms of occupa-
tions requiring the use of structures and
thermal features. Moreover, there is a
marked decrease in the occupation of al-
luvial fans. In contrast, occupation of
landforms in proximity to playas reaches
the peak of intensity.

These results indicate that within any
given time interval, variations in architec-
tural form and site structure are greater,
and patterns of land use more complex,
than previously was recognized in the
archeological record. These ﬁndings, in
turn, mean that Formative period settle-
ment mobility and subsistence adapta-
tions may also have been more variable
than was once thought to have been
the case.

In summary, the early part of the For-

mative period is characterized by a dis-
persed settlement system, the exploitation
of several environmental zones, and the
use of ephemeral, circular house struc-
tures. However, the gradual trend of in-
creasing use of the alluvial fans and con-
struction of more substantial, rectangular
pithouses foreshadows a major transition
period at a.d. 1000. From then until
a.d. 1150 there is a decrease in the occu-
pation of the central basin landform and
a rapidly increasing use of the alluvial
fans. Construction of circular pithouses is
discontinued in favor of rectangular pit-
houses and occasional isolated rooms.
The period between a.d. 1150 and
1275 is intriguing because it appears to
be a time of dual settlement systems for
residential occupations in the western
Trans-Pecos. While two or more environ-
mental zones were utilized during preced-
ing periods, usually one zone predomi-
nated. However, between a.d. 1150 and
1275, the utilization of both alluvial fans
and playa zones was roughly equivalent,
although pronounced differences existed
in the nature of the occupations within
these two zones. The construction and
use of house structures in both alluvial
fans and playa settings suggests the exis-
tence of at least two distinctive patterns
of mobility and resource exploitation.
Additional evidence presented below

tends to support this, and indeed this pe-
riod marks an intensiﬁcation in several as-
pects of the subsistence economy. There
is not only evidence for increasing agri-
cultural production but also an intensiﬁ-
cation of traditional subsistence practices
based on the exploitation of cacti and
other nondomesticated plants. Residen-
tial occupations were situated primarily in
proximity to playas, while along the allu-
vial fans occupation evidence consisted
primarily of thermal features, occasionally
associated with isolated pithouse struc-
tures. It is during this period that increas-
ingly formal architectural forms become
common, and these house forms are asso-
ciated with an increasingly coherent and
organized use of site space, including a
more patterned refuse disposal.

After a.d. 1000, there is a continual
reduction in the use of the central basin
landform. Overall, both thermal features
and structures were rarely used in the
central basin during the Late Formative
after a.d. 1000, and this was particularly
the case after a.d. 1275. Mauldin (1995,
1996a) argues that these changes reﬂect a
major shift in subsistence and settlement
organization, in effect marking a change
from a predominantly residential use of
the central basin to a more logistically or-
ganized pattern of exploitation with the
advent of increasing sedentism and agri-
cultural dependence. While the obsidian
hydration data on which he partially
bases his argument may be questioned on
several grounds, other lines of evidence
nevertheless fully support his interpreta-
tion. Studies of ceramics and projectile
points collected during large-scale survey
and testing projects in central basin land-
forms show that later varieties of El Paso
brownware and small, triangular point
forms are present in disproportionately
high numbers compared to the low num-
bers of radiocarbon-dated features. These
data do suggest that short-term logistical
use of the central basins occurred during
the Pueblo period.

In the absence of other forms of cor-
roborative data, these inferences regarding
the nature of mobility and subsistence
based on observed patterns among archi-
tectural forms, site structure, and land use
patterns remain unevaluated. Direct in-
formation on subsistence practices, in the
form of macroﬂoral and faunal data sets,
is required. Major trends in subsistence

economies should also be reﬂected in
speciﬁc changes in groundstone, ceramic,
and chipped stone technologies, as well as
other aspects of technological organiza-
tion such as thermal and storage facilities.

Formative Period Subsistence Patterns
In understanding the changing nature

of architectural forms, settlement struc-
ture, and landscape use in the western
Trans-Pecos, it is critical to assess the de-
gree of reliance on cultivated as opposed
to wild or nondomesticated plants. Ob-
served changes in architectural complex-
ity and formality, combined with the
location of settlements in relation to hy-
drologically favorable topographic zones,
have been taken as evidence of increasing
agricultural dependence and reduced
settlement mobility during the Formative
period (Carmichael 1983, 1986; Lehmer
1948; Whalen 1977, 1978, 1981a). Qual-
itative statements regarding the frequency
of cultigens observed during a limited
number of excavations often were used in
support of such arguments (e.g., Brook
1966a, 1980; Carmichael 1986; J. Green
1980; Lehmer 1948; Whalen 1977,
1978, 1981b). Prior to the mid-1980s,
however, few quantitative analyses of
macroﬂoral remains from habitation sites
had been published (although see Ford
1977 and Wetterstrom 1978), and ac-
cordingly, there was little in the way of
direct and substantial evidence of subsis-
tence practices that could be used to in-
terpret developments during the Forma-
tive period.

While it can be logically surmised that

agriculture played a greater role in re-
gional subsistence economies during the
Late Formative period than in preceding
periods, the extent or proportion of agri-
cultural production in the diet remained
unestablished. Aside from a generalized
perception that populations of puebloan
settlements were more dependent upon
agriculture than preceding pithouse pop-
ulations were, it was difﬁcult to isolate
more speciﬁc trends in subsistence econo-
mies during the Formative period. Since
the 1980s, however, an increasing num-
ber of macrobotanical studies have been
completed, and comprehensive ﬂotation
analyses from a representative sample of
time intervals and site types are available.

west, corn (Zea mays) represents the most

common and important cultigen in the
western Trans-Pecos. Other important
cultigens include beans (Phaseolus sp.),
squash (Cucurbita sp.), and to a lesser ex-
tent a variety of bottle gourd (Lagenaria
siceraria). Two bean varieties common to
lowland environments of the Southwest
have been reported from the Jornada Mo-
gollon region: the common bean (Phaseo-
lus vulgaris) and tepary bean (Phaseolus
acutifolius). Lima beans (Phaseolus luna-
tus) have been reported from the Late
Formative La Cabrana and Embree pueb-
los (Bradley 1983; Foster et al. 1981;
Thomas C. O’Laughlin 1995, personal
communication) but are present in small
numbers and have not been identiﬁed
elsewhere. Cucurbits have occasionally
been recovered at pueblo components
(Bradley 1983; Ford 1977; Southward
1979) but have not been identiﬁed at ear-
lier Formative period sites. Cotton is
known to have been utilized in west
Texas, as indicated by cordage and frag-
mentary textiles recovered from dry caves
and rockshelters, but its presence in west
Texas has not been securely dated. Aside
from a quantity of seeds included as bur-
ial furniture with two interments at Gra-
nado Cave in Culberson County (Hamil-
ton 1998), no evidence of cotton has been
recovered in macrobotanical samples, and
whether this crop was cultivated in the
Jornada remains open to question.

As with the preceding Archaic period,
a variety of noncultivated plants were also
exploited during the Formative period.
More than forty wild plant taxa, includ-
ing several species of cacti and succulents,
mesquite, cheno-ams and portulaca, sun-
ﬂower, and various grasses, forbs, and an-
nuals have been identiﬁed in macrobotan-
ical samples from thermal features, pits,
and structures. The habitats of the plant
species represent several environmental
zones, and their presence indicates that
mountain, riverine, alluvial fan, and cen-
tral basin zones were exploited.

Settlements dating to the earlier part
of the Formative period present a com-
plex picture of subsistence practices. Early
Formative Mesilla phase settlements have
variable recovery rates of plant remains,
although they are often disappointingly
low. For example, only 23 percent of 345
ﬂotation samples from the Turquoise
Ridge site in the eastern Hueco Bolson
yielded charred plant remains (Whalen

1994a, 117). Virtually no charred seeds
or plant remains were identiﬁed in several
samples from the Roth site (M. Miller
1997), a cluster of four pithouses and
eight burials situated on the Rio Grande
Valley terraces west of Las Cruces
(O’Laughlin 1981; Stuart n.d.). In con-
trast, a substantial collection of plant re-
mains was recovered from a burned pit-
house at the Tortugas site located across
the valley (Stuart 1991). High amounts
of plant remains have also been reported
from the BK4, BK5, and Conejo sites sit-
uated in alluvial deposits on the Organ
Mountain fan piedmont (Goldborer
1985; M. Miller and Stuart 1991). In one
of the only instances of high recovery rates
reported for a Mesilla component in the
central basin, Jeff D. Leach, Richard
Holloway, and Federico Almarez (1996b)
describe the recovery of 50 charred che-
nopodium seeds from a single ﬂotation
sample at FB12719, a cluster of two
pithouses in the Hueco Bolson east of
El Paso.

Charred corn remains have been re-
covered at several of these Mesilla phase
habitation sites, but again in small quan-
tities. A very small number of domesti-
cated beans have been found at the Conejo
and Turquoise Ridge sites (Goldborer
1985; Whalen 1994a). Overall, maize
and beans appear to be less common at
Mesilla phase occupations predating
a.d. 600 –700 (see discussion in Whalen
1994a), with the exception of a few sites
in the Rio Grande Valley. Other cultigens
are virtually absent in Mesilla phase con-
texts, although one sample of bottle
gourd rind has been reported from a pit-
house context dating to a.d. 500 –700 at
the BK4 site east of Las Cruces (M. Mil-
ler and Stuart 1991).

Domesticates also appear to be rare at
Transitional components dating prior to
a.d. 1150. Extensive ﬂotation analyses at
Gobernadora, Ojasen, and North Hills I
documented very high recovery rates for
charred plant remains (Dering 1999a;
Hutira 1990; Scott-Cummings 1989).
More than seven thousand charred plant
remains have been identiﬁed in ﬂotation
samples from these three sites, including
substantial numbers of mesquite, cacti,
cheno-ams, and other noncultivated seeds
and plant parts. Of these plant remains,
cultigens are represented by only nineteen
specimens of corn. However, botanical

assemblages from later Transitional sites
such as Meyer Range and Hueco Tanks
include moderate quantities of corn,
beans, and cucurbits (M. Miller 1997;
O’Laughlin 1996), although several vari-
eties of wild plant species are also present.
In contrast to Mesilla and Transitional

components, charred corncobs, cupules,
and kernels are ubiquitous at El Paso
phase pueblos. Brook (1966b, citing an
unpublished 1939 paper by Vermillion)
reports the recovery of two hundred
bushels of corn remains from a single
pueblo room in the southern Tularosa
Basin, and J. Green (1980) and V. R.
Brook (1966b, 1980) comment on the
frequency of corn remains encountered
during excavations at the Hot Well and
Sabina Mountain sites. Several kilograms
of charred corn and beans were also re-
covered from the ﬂoor and subﬂoor pits
of a single room at Embree pueblo north
of Las Cruces, New Mexico, and corn-
cobs were recovered from most excavation
units throughout the site (Magers 1973;
O’Laughlin 1985a). Similar botanical as-
semblages have been recovered from El
Paso phase isolated rooms. Wetterstrom
(1983) reports high recovery rates for
corn, common beans, and mesquite seeds
and pods from several extramural refuse
and storage pits at the Dona County Air-
port sites west of El Paso. Linda Scott-
Cummings (1992) recovered maize pollen
from a groundstone fragment, a core, and
several ﬂoor soil samples from the isolated
room at the MOTR site on Fort Bliss.
Although the recovery of plant remains
from the severely eroded house ﬂoor was
poor, an estimated total exceeding six
thousand corn cupules, kernels, and cob
fragments was recovered from samples re-
trieved from an adjacent trash midden.
To date, no such quantity of cultigens has
been recovered from Mesilla or Transi-
tional components.

Quantitative summaries of these and
other macrobotanical studies have been
presented by Hard et al. (1996) and
M. Miller (1990, 1997). The latter study,
a portion of which is reproduced here
(Fig. 7.29), utilized data from more than
600 ﬂotation samples, 303 of which were
productive, obtained from seven hut/
pithouse components dating between
a.d. 400 and 1000, three pithouse com-
ponents dating to a.d. 1000 –1150, two
pithouse and isolated room components

fall to less than 10 percent for late Forma-
tive components (see Fig. 7.29). This pat-
tern suggests that exploitation of these
food resources may have intensiﬁed dur-
ing the latter part of the Transitional pe-
riod but decreased as agricultural depen-
dence— or perhaps more appropriately,
agricultural specialization—increased.
Signiﬁcantly, this plant use pattern is
also reﬂected in the regional decline after
a.d. 1250/1300 of the use of rock-lined
pits or other thermal facilities presumably
used to process these plant foods (see
below).

Additional evidence for increased
maize dependence among prehistoric
populations is available from analyses of
stable isotope ratios in human skeletal
material. Although inferences regarding
prehistoric subsistence based on such
analyses often tend to be problematic (see
Hard et al. 1996; Mauldin 1996b), they
can provide useful corroborative informa-
tion when combined with ﬂotation data
and other lines of archeological evidence
(Hard et al. 1996).

MacNeish and Marino (1993) report
the results of a preliminary study of stable
carbon and nitrogen isotopes measured in
a range of samples from the Jornada Mo-
gollon region. Although isotope values
have been obtained for several burials,
sample numbers for several time periods
are limited and some important intervals
are not represented. For example, mini-
mal data are available for the Early For-
mative period (a.d. 200 –1000) because
only a single Mesilla phase burial pro-
vided sufﬁcient collagen for analysis. The
Late Formative period sample includes
only remains recovered from El Paso
phase pueblos, and critical information for
settlements dating between a.d. 1000 –
1250/1300 is lacking. Nevertheless, the
preliminary results demonstrate a pro-
nounced trend in increasing 13C /12C and
15N/14N ratios among samples from Ar-
chaic period populations through Late
Formative El Paso phase populations
(Fig. 7.30). The subsequent decline in
stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios
observed among the population of His-
toric burials from Socorro Mission pre-
sents some interpretive problems but may
be attributed to changes in diet involving
the introduction of and increased reliance
on domesticated animals (MacNeish and
Marino 1993).

dating primarily between a.d. 1150 and
1250/1300, and four pueblo and three
isolated room sites dating to a.d. 1250/
1300 –1450. Abundance measures for
four major subsistence items are pre-
sented (see Fig. 7.29), including the two
most common cultigens (corn and beans)
and two of the more important nonculti-
vated plants or groups of plants (mes-
quite and a combined cacti/succulent
group). It should be noted that the ubiq-
uity values are subject to a number of
preservation biases, particularly in light of
the low recovery rates at many pre-a.d.
1000 components, and they should not
be considered absolute measures of plant
dependence or consumption during a
given time interval. Furthermore, the low
productivity of ﬂotation samples and
small numbers of plant remains from
Mesilla phase components may also be a
function of settlement intensity, whereas
less intensive occupations at these sites re-
sulted in the deposition of lesser quanti-
ties of charred materials.

Trends in ubiquity values among the
four plant groups point to several signiﬁ-
cant aspects of Formative period subsis-
tence. Overall, a trend of increasing agri-
cultural dependence is evident between

a.d. 1000 and 1250/1300, an observa-
tion that generally supports the hypothe-
sized relationship between the increasing
formality of architectural forms and
settlement structure and a greater depen-
dence on agricultural production. Ubiq-
uity values for maize remain relatively
constant at approximately 10 percent be-
tween a.d. 400 and 1150 but show a par-
ticularly pronounced increase after a.d.
1150 and reach a peak of 60 percent for
post–a.d. 1250/1300 pueblo and isolated
room components. Ubiquity values for
domesticated beans also show an increase
only after a.d. 1150 (see Fig. 7.29).

Nondomesticated plants contribute to
the subsistence base through all time in-
tervals. Mesquite pods and seeds were a
particularly important food resource, al-
though it is noteworthy that ubiquity val-
ues show a decline corresponding with
the rise in ubiquity values for corn.

Ubiquity values for cacti and succu-

lents such as lechuguilla (Agave lechu-
guilla), banana and soap-tree yucca
(Y. baccata, Y. elata), sotol (Dasilyrion
wheeleri ), and Echinocereus or Mamma-
laria (ﬁshhook, pitaya, and hedgehog
cacti) increase steadily between a.d. 400
and 1250/1300 to around 40 percent but

occurrence of rabbit bone in El Paso
phase middens. The most compelling
analysis of faunal material from a pueblo
component is from La Cabrana, located
on the ﬁrst Rio Grande terrace immedi-
ately northwest of El Paso (Bradley 1983;
Foster et al. 1981). The recovery of more
than ﬁve thousand ﬁsh bones and scales
indicates a distinct riverine component to
the subsistence base.

Formative Period
Technological Patterns

Sequential changes in architectural
form and site structure, settlement pat-
tern, and subsistence economies are also
reﬂected in the material culture of the
western Trans-Pecos. Several recent stud-
ies have used various classes of artifact
data to successfully monitor or infer
broad-scale changes in subsistence econo-
mies during this period (Calamia 1991;
Hard et al. 1994, 1996; Mauldin 1995;
M. Miller 1997). Changes in ground-
stone and ceramic technologies have re-
ceived particular attention because they
indicate coincident patterns of increasing
agricultural dependence and changes in
mobility patterns. Analyses of storage
and thermal or burned rock facilities
(Leach 1993; M. Miller 1997; Whalen
1994b) also provide important insights
into changing aspects of technological
organization.

Thermal and Storage Features

Several changes in the form, size, and
frequency of burned rock and other ther-
mal features occur throughout the For-
mative period. Presumably these reﬂect
changing land use and subsistence prac-
tices, inasmuch as such features are di-
rectly associated with the processing of
plant and animal foods. Burned rock fea-
tures are particularly suited for nondo-
mesticated plant foods, and therefore ob-
served patterns among this type of feature
can provide insights into varying degrees
of reliance on wild plant foods versus
cultigens.

Distribution patterns for one thousand

radiocarbon age estimates of artifacts
from various thermal features correspond
closely with architectural and subsistence
trends previously discussed (Fig. 7.31).
The use of most categories of thermal fea-
tures appears to peak prior to a.d. 650

Fig. 7.30. Stable isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N) for human burials from the Jornada Mogo-
llon region (data from MacNeish and Marino 1993, 118–21).

Dependence on fauna throughout the
Formative period has proven difﬁcult to
assess. Few detailed studies are available,
and no synthetic overview of faunal data
from the region has been attempted. De-
tailed analyses of faunal collections are
available for three Mesilla sites— Conejo,
Turquoise Ridge, and BK4 (Russel and
Hard 1985; M. Miller and Stuart 1991;
Whalen 1994a)—and three Transitional
period sites (Bartlema 1996; Hanson
1990; Shafer et al. 1999), but only one
pueblo assemblage has been described in

detail (Bradley 1983; Foster et al. 1981).
Common among all these components is
the predominance of lagomorph (rabbit)
remains (Lepus californicus and Sylvilagus
audubonii ), a pattern common among
prehistoric sites in lowland settings across
the Southwest. Larger game animals such
as deer, antelope, and occasionally bison
are present but occur in relatively small
numbers compared to lagomorphs. This
faunal use pattern continues through the
Pueblo period, as Carmichael (1983,
1986) has commented on the common

and either decline gradually or remain
relatively stable between a.d. 650 and
1000. Considering general size classes,
the trend for small thermal features co-
varies with large and medium features, in-
dicating that the numbers of thermal fea-
tures with larger pit sizes and greater
accumulations of burned rock increased
through the earlier half of the Formative
period.

Another signiﬁcant pattern involves
formally constructed rock-lined pit fea-
tures. While examples of such features
have been dated to as early as 2000 b.c.
(MacNeish 1993b; M. Miller 1994),
they become increasingly common after
a.d. 1000 and reach a peak in use be-
tween a.d. 1150 and 1250/1300 (see
Fig. 7.31). Numerous examples have
been excavated at Transitional compo-
nents, although they often tend to post-
date most of the pithouses at these sites.

Whether their increasing frequency and
formal mode of construction indicates an
intensiﬁcation of plant processing (i.e.,
bulk processing), continual and repeated
use or maintenance, or a combination of
both factors, remains unclear. In terms of
use intensity, it is noteworthy that several
of the largest macrobotanical inventories
in the region have been recovered from
these features. An estimated 10,000 or
more amaranth seeds were recovered
from a single rock-lined pit at the Ojasen
site, and the discarded ﬁll contents of a
similar feature at Gobernadora yielded
2,483 prickly pear, echinocactus, and
mesquite seeds (Scott-Cummings 1989).
Additional evidence of changing sub-
sistence and mobility strategies is appar-
ent in the temporal distribution of stor-
age pits and trash pits. (The two feature
types are considered together because it is
often difﬁcult to determine the original

Fig. 7.31. Trends among summed radiocarbon probability distributions for major categories of
thermal features and trash/storage facilities in the western Trans-Pecos during the Formative
period.

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

or primary function[s] of these features.
Pits containing quantities of charred
plant remains often contain discarded
faunal bone and lithic debitage as well as
broken ceramic and groundstone imple-
ments.) As indicated in Fig. 7.31, the
construction and use of formal trash dis-
posal pits and storage facilities increases
substantially after a.d. 1150, and this fea-
ture use continues through the El Paso
phase, indicating an increasing emphasis
on the storage of foods. Moreover, the
presence of discrete trash pits, common
at isolated room and pueblo compo-
nents, suggests more structured patterns
of trash disposal as opposed to the more
generalized dispersal of sheet trash and
large midden accumulations common at
earlier Transitional and Mesilla phase
components.

The correspondence between formal
thermal features (rock-lined pits), storage
facilities, and the increase in formal archi-
tectural forms (isolated rooms) is interest-
ing when the presumed relationship
between agricultural production and ar-
chitectural formality is considered. The
current archeological data indicate that
reliance on cacti intensiﬁed during the
Transitional period, particularly between
a.d. 1150 and 1275, coeval with the ap-
pearance of formally constructed house
forms and an increasing emphasis on
storage. Notably, the regional decline in
nearly all types and size groups of thermal
features occurred after a.d. 1250/1300,
and this is when the ubiquity measures
of cacti in ﬂotation samples also show a
drastic reduction. Intensiﬁcation of cacti
processing and agriculture occurred
roughly simultaneously. We suggest that
these trends support the argument that
subsistence practices between a.d. 1275
and 1450 became not only more agricul-
turally dependent but also more agricul-
turally specialized. Moreover, the appar-
ent intensiﬁcation of both traditional
plant processing and agricultural produc-
tion occurred in tandem and across dif-
ferent environmental zones and marks an
important transition in subsistence and
settlement. The factors underlying this
intensiﬁcation of plant processing, agri-
cultural production, and architectural for-
mality between a.d. 1150 and 1275 re-
main more speculative, however, along
with the reasons for the decline in cacti

exploitation in favor of agricultural pro-
duction during the pueblo period.

Groundstone

Trends in groundstone form and use

in the western Trans-Pecos are known
primarily through studies by Calamia
(1991), Hard et al. (1996), and Mauldin
(1995). Using multiple lines of evidence,
including macroﬂoral analyses and trends
in stable carbon isotopes measured in hu-
man bone, Hard et al. (1996) demon-
strate that increasing mano size and grind-
ing area correlate with an increase in corn
processing. Although part of a larger syn-
thesis of archeological data across the
Southwest and the Southern Plains, their
study demonstrates that a similar trend of
increasing groundstone size, representing
a pattern of increasing agricultural depen-
dence, occurred in the Jornada Mogollon
between a.d. 200 and 1450. Based on an
extensive analysis of manos from both ex-
cavated and surface contexts, they further
show that greater proportions of two-
handed manos, as well as the signiﬁcant
increase in mano size and grinding area,
occurred in assemblages dating after
a.d. 1000 (Fig. 7.32).

In addition to mano size, the increased

prevalence of trough metates over slab
and basin forms has been noted at Pueblo
components (Lehmer 1948), a factor ob-
served in other regions to be associated
with increased agricultural dependence
(Morris 1990; Schlanger 1991). Pestles,
presumably used to process mesquite,
may also show changes in frequency and
form through this period. Based on sur-
vey data from the Tularosa Basin, Car-
michael (1981, 1986) notes that the fre-
quency of pestles observed at post– a.d.
1000 components in the Tularosa Basin
decreases from the earlier Mesilla phase,
indicating a possible reduction in the im-
portance of mesquite beans as a food re-
source in the central basin.

Ceramics

One of the conventional hallmarks
or traits commonly used to demarcate
the Formative period is the appearance
of ceramics between a.d. 200 and 400.
The underlying reasons for the adoption
of ceramics during the Early Formative
period are not well understood, nor are
the technological and functional aspects

of ceramic use by populations continu-
ing a subsistence economy predomi-
nantly based on hunting and gathering
(M. Miller in Perttula et al. 1995b, 219).
It is known, however, that the El Paso
brownware tradition (see Fig. 7.20) re-
mained remarkably stable during the en-
tire Early Formative Mesilla phase. Stud-
ies of rim and vessel form have identiﬁed
very few differences between assemblages
from different times during this period
(M. Miller 1996a; Whalen 1993, 1994a),
although some technological attributes
such as temper size and abundance may
show changes reﬂecting the need for
increased thermal resistance (Whalen
1994a), possibly due to an increase in
corn processing.

After a.d. 1000, ceramic assemblages
change signiﬁcantly, probably reﬂecting
demographic shifts and changing settle-
ment and subsistence patterns. After six
hundred to seven hundred years of tech-
nological and stylistic continuity, the lo-
cal El Paso brownware ceramic tradition
underwent several developments between
a.d. 1000 and 1300 (M. Miller 1989;
O’Laughlin 1985; Perttula et al. 1995;
Whalen 1980b, 1981b). Undecorated
El Paso brownware of the earlier Mesilla
phase becomes part of assemblages
with El Paso bichrome and polychrome
(Fig. 7.33a, b). Proportions of decorated
vessels increase gradually between a.d.
1000 and 1275, until bichrome and early
polychrome varieties are completely re-

By a.d. 1250/1300, neckless and short-
necked jar forms are replaced by necked
jars with everted rims at pueblo and iso-
lated room components. This shift may
relate to the greater containment secu-
rity afforded by necked forms for pro-
cessing corn (Hard et al. 1994; Seaman
and Mills 1988a, 1988b; see also Braun
1983).

Miller’s (1997) comparative analysis
of vessel form utilizing a sample of more
than ﬁve thousand El Paso brownware
rim sherds from twenty assemblages dat-
ing between a.d. 200 and 1450 docu-
mented that vessel form assemblages from
components dating to the Mesilla phase
and the earlier part of the Transitional pe-
riod vary widely among the seven vessel
classes used in the analysis, while assem-
blages from Pueblo settlements are re-
markably consistent in terms of the pro-
portional representation of vessel form
classes. This situation at ﬁrst appears
counterintuitive, in that one would ex-
pect residential occupations of longer du-
ration at pueblos to have a greater variety
of vessel forms. However, this ﬁnding
does not necessarily reﬂect the variety of
vessels (i.e., the number of speciﬁc vessel
classes, or “richness”) observed in the as-
semblages, but rather the variation, or
“evenness,” among the proportional rep-
resentation of vessel classes. That is,
Mesilla and early Transitional sites have
uneven representations of vessel forms;
one may have a high proportion of neck-
less jars, a moderate proportion of necked
jars, and a small proportion of bowls,
while another site has a moderate propor-
tion of neckless jars, moderate proportions
of necked forms, and a high proportion
of bowls. In contrast, the proportional
representation of the vessel classes at all
seven pueblo sites is comparatively uni-
form. Clearly then, Mesilla and early
Transitional sites have variable collections
of vessels. This variety may, in turn, re-
ﬂect a greater range of functional and
seasonal occupations by more mobile
populations with generalized subsistence
economies. Conversely, this variety may
be evidence of a more uniform function
in ceramic use at pueblos.

An important exception to the El Paso
phase use of ceramics concerns the cluster
of four outliers representing vessel assem-
blages from isolated room components.

bichrome/early polychrome and late
polychrome include increasing elabora-
tion and the addition of secondary design
elements and complex multiple band lay-
outs (Fig. 7.35).

Additional studies have emphasized

technological aspects of vessel form and
manufacture in an attempt to identify
changing patterns of subsistence and mo-
bility (e.g., Scarborough 1992). In con-
trast to Mesilla phase assemblages consist-
ing predominantly of neckless (tecomate)
jar forms, necked jar forms become in-
creasingly common after a.d. 1000, par-
ticularly at isolated room components.

Chipped Stone

While our understanding of ceramic
and groundstone technologies is relatively
well founded for the Formative period,
studies of chipped stone assemblages have
lagged. Formative period lithic technolo-
gies are poorly known, and there is little
information on whether any substantial
changes in reduction technology, tool
form, or raw material procurement oc-
curred during this period. Information
on lithic assemblages of puebloan oc-
cupations is especially limited. Aside
from a small number of descriptive ac-
counts listing general artifact classes
and raw material types at Hot Well, La
Cabrana, and Pickup Pueblos (Bentley
n.d.; Bradley 1983; Garcia 1988), tech-
nological and functional studies of lithic
assemblages from pueblo occupations
are virtually nonexistent, and the as-
semblage from only one isolated room
component of this period has been re-
ported in much detail (Browning et al.
1992).

Based upon the available information,
it appears that no major shift in techno-
logical organization occurred from pre-
ceding periods in terms of raw material
procurement and reduction, nor was
there a signiﬁcant change in the range
and types of tools produced. Informal
core technologies and the production of
informal ﬂake tools remained dominant,
as did the exploitation of local valley ter-
race and alluvial gravel sources for the
majority of raw materials.

Several studies have noted the com-
mon trend of decreasing proportions
of ﬁne-grained materials over the pre-
ceding Archaic period (Carmichael
1986; Whalen 1980a). Obsidian tends
to be more common among Late For-
mative assemblages. While this may re-
ﬂect an increased preference for this ma-
terial, it is more likely that this is due to
a shift in settlement location to alluvial
fans and the margins of the Rio Grande
Valley, areas where obsidian nodules are
present in the local gravels (M. Miller
1996a).

Likewise, attributes of lithic assem-
blages that can suggest changes in mobil-
ity remain very poorly known. As Maul-
din (1984, 1986) noted, there has been
little effort to develop models with expec-
tations regarding the relationships among

Fig. 7.34. Proportions of El Paso Brown ceramic varieties observed among rim collections from

ranges of radiocarbon age distributions.

Arts and Culture, Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Vessel assemblages at these sites have
much higher proportions of necked jar
forms with highly everted rims. In addi-
tion, vessel walls are signiﬁcantly thinner.
This combination suggests that while

necked jar forms may reﬂect technologi-
cal requirements for processing corn, an
ancillary technical factor of facilitating
ease of vessel transport may also be likely
(M. Miller 1997).

expedient core reduction to settlement
duration proposed by M. Miller (1990),
and considerably critiqued, reﬁned, and
improved by Dockall (1999a, 1999b),
has been used to investigate assemblages
at a limited number of sites in the Hueco
Bolson. These studies have been designed
primarily to test the utility of the model,
which has not been applied to a larger
comparative data base.

One of the more noteworthy aspects
of Formative period lithic assemblages is
the rarity of projectile points at major
habitation sites. Archeological investiga-
tions at the Turquoise Ridge, Gober-
nadora, Ojasen, North Hills, and Meyer
Range sites (more than 3,000 m2 of hand
excavations, including at least 35 pit-
houses and hundreds of burned rock
features, pits, and middens) recovered
more than 130,000 lithic, ceramic, and
groundstone artifacts, but projectile
points are represented by only 27 speci-
mens (Fig. 7.36). An exception to this
pattern is Hueco Tanks, where more than
70 points were found in house ﬁll and ex-
tramural contexts (Kegley 1982). While
it remains uncertain whether these ﬁnd-
ings reﬂect off-site manufacture and dis-
card or loss of projectile points, debitage
analyses have noted that evidence for bi-
face production (such as preforms, thin-
ning ﬂakes, or ﬂake debitage with faceted
platforms) is exceedingly rare. Assem-
blages with a similar character have been
noted at pueblo settlements, with a total
of only 36 points recovered from Hot
Well Pueblo. The rarity of projectile
points at Formative period habitation
sites is an indirect estimate of the reliance
of groups on small and medium-sized
game animals, and it generally conﬁrms
the observation that large game animals
are rare among faunal assemblages of this
period. When compared to mountain
settlements such as the Robinson Pueblo
in the Sacramento Mountains of New
Mexico, where more than 3,000 points
were recovered ( J. H. Kelley 1991, 171),
the rarity of projectile points at low-
land Jornada Mogollon pueblo sites is
striking.

Water Control Features and Other
Miscellaneous Technologies

A ﬁnal technological innovation asso-
ciated with puebloan occupations in the
western Trans-Pecos involves the con-
struction and maintenance of water con-
trol features. Foremost among these is a
reservoir documented at Hot Well Pueblo
(Scarborough 1988). James Neely and
Chris Caran (1998, personal communica-
tion) have recently identiﬁed a possible
reservoir at Hueco Tanks State Park, and
further investigations of this feature are
planned. The presence of additional
reservoirs or other forms of water control
features such as canals and terraces (Hub-
bard 1987; Leach et al. 1996a) are un-
conﬁrmed, but lack of evidence does not
necessarily preclude their existence, par-
ticularly since many areas have been ex-
tensively modiﬁed by natural and human
developments.

Late Prehistoric Period Developments
in the Eastern Trans-Pecos

The changes taking place in the Hueco

Bolson and north of the Trans-Pecos
( Jelinek 1967) in the manufacture of
pottery, the development of agriculture,
the establishment of villages, and the use
of the bow and arrow do not appear in
the archeological record in the remaining
portion of the Trans-Pecos until about
a.d. 1000. In addition to their late ar-
rival, the changes were variously adopted.

Throughout most of the eastern Trans-
Pecos, the bow and arrow were univer-
sally adopted; few other changes were.
Instead, the archeological record there
indicates that settlement patterns, subsis-
tence economies, and group mobility
strategies established during the Late Ar-
chaic persisted despite an awareness of
changes taking place to the west and
north.

Prominent site types are ring middens

(Greer 1968a, 1968b), hearth ﬁelds,
lithic scatters, wickiup or tipi rings, and
the use of rockshelters and sinkholes.
Rock art is commonly etched or painted
on boulders and walls of caves and shel-
ters. Frequently, these types of sites co-
occur, and they are present in all eco-
logical zones. This situation mirrors the
distribution of Late Archaic sites and
their presence in all ecological zones. In
fact, Late Prehistoric sites often overlie
Late Archaic components.

In the foothills of the Cienega Moun-
tains, the Cat Spring site (41PS660) has
four ring middens associated with a lithic
scatter (Mallouf 1993). The Squawteat
Peak site (41PC14), with Perdiz points,
prismatic blades (common in the Late
Prehistoric in central and south Texas; see
Collins, chapter 3, and Hester, chapter 4,
this volume), and radiometric assays aver-
aging around a.d. 1300, is deﬁned by a
burned rock midden, at least fourteen tipi
rings, multiple hearths, mortar holes, and

lithic scatters (Young 1981). Similarly,
A. T. Jackson (1937) noted that sinkhole/
cave sites in the Rustler Hills with For-
mative period arrow points and ceramic
sherds were surrounded by ring middens,
hearths, lithic scatters, and, at times, rock
art panels. This pattern obtains through-
out much of the eastern Trans-Pecos, in-
cluding the Stockton Plateau (Kelly and
Smith 1963), the terraces of the Rio
Grande (C. Johnson 1977), and in the
Guadalupe Mountains (Katz and Katz
1974).

Thus, it is not surprising that only a
handful of Late Prehistoric sites in the
eastern Trans-Pecos have yielded evidence
of cultigens. Carved Rock Shelter near
Alpine (V. Smith 1938), site 41BS8 in
Brewster County, Pratt Cave (Schroeder
1983, 65), and Williams Cave and an un-
named cave in the Guadalupe Mountains
(Roney 1995) produced corn, and cotton
cordage was recovered from the Shelby
Brooks site (A. T. Jackson 1937) and
Granado Cave (Hamilton 1998). Instead,
the evidence for Late Prehistoric subsis-
tence practices continued to indicate a
generalized diet focused on desert succu-
lents and hunting ( J. C. Kelley et al. 1940;
Mallouf 1990). It appears that, having es-
tablished an effective mode of making a
living, occupants of the region chose to
maintain old patterns, selectively learning
new technologies to enhance, rather than
change, their lives. Lehmer (1958), Mar-
maduke (1978a, 1978b), Mallouf (1985),
and Sebastian and Larralde (1989) have
long noted this reluctance for change in
the eastern Trans-Pecos.

Despite this trend to conservatism,
subtle differences exist throughout the re-
gion. Ward (1992) noted the popularity
in the Rustler Hills of sandals woven with
a ﬁsh-tail pattern. While the style is not
unknown to the south, other styles are
more prominent. Similarly, in the north,
pottery is found in low quantities on Late
Prehistoric sites outside of the Salt Flat
Basin (Charles 1994; Hedrick 1989; Katz
and Katz 1974; Perttula et al. 1995; Ward
1992), but as one moves south, “ceramics
become [even] more rare” (Mallouf 1985,
130). While Late Prehistoric site locations
mimic Late Archaic site locations in the
Rustler Hills (A. T. Jackson 1937; R. Tan-
ner 1949; Ward 1992), the Guadalupes
(Katz and Katz 1974), and most other

sectors of the eastern Trans-Pecos (Mal-
louf 1985, 127), Marmaduke’s (1978b)
work at the Bear Creek sites in the Stock-
ton Plateau noted a reduction in the
number of Late Prehistoric sites on ridges.
At the same time, occupational debris at
these Late Prehistoric sites was substan-
tially greater than the debris from earlier
occupations, and he concluded that there
was an overall increase in the population
utilizing the area and a trend to coexist in
larger groups. These differences lead to
our hypothesis that groups knew and in-
teracted with one another but maintained
traditions unique to their own area.
Data from the Wind Canyon site
(41HZ118) in the Eagle Mountains ﬁt
this hypothesis. The site has a ring mid-
den that spans the period from a.d. 340
to 1480 (Hines et al. 1994). Although a
sizable number of dart points came from
the site, only four arrow points were re-
covered, and faunal remains show that
limited taxa were hunted (deer, rabbit,
squirrels, and a bird). In contrast, macro-
botanical evidence indicates a “continuity
in the ﬂotation record . . . spanning hun-
dreds of visitations to the site over a long
period of time” (Bohrer 1994, 180). To-
gether, these data reinforce our notion of
the retention of Late Archaic food prefer-
ences, cooking techniques, and settlement
patterns. The latter, a settlement pattern
of small groups—aware of and selectively
adopting the technologies of the Late Pre-
historic—whose mobility was conﬁned
to a particular area, is supported by the
lithic and ceramic record. Using data
from Hedrick (1989), Hines et al. (1994)
tentatively conclude that the three Toyah
arrow points and one Livermore point
from Wind Canyon were manufactured
with raw material from southwestern
Culberson County, 50 to 65 km east of
the site. Lithic materials (trachyte and
syenite) locally available in the Eagle
Mountains made up 48 percent of the
4,944 pieces of unmodiﬁed lithic deb-
itage (Hines et al. 1994, 62, and table 4).
The 63 sherds recovered during excava-
tions similarly suggest local manufacture.
Most were El Paso polychrome and El
Paso or Jornada brownwares. However,
petrographic analyses suggest that they
were made locally using igneous material
of the Eagle Mountains. Nonlocal mate-
rial, in relatively limited quantities, in-

cludes mussel shell and lithics from the
Rio Grande and a few sherds of northern
Chihuahuan polychrome from the re-
gions southwest of the Rio Grande and
others from the Tularosa Basin of New
Mexico.

In sum, excavations at the Wind Can-

yon site support the hypothesis of small
groups continuing traditional subsistence
practices, returning to locales that had
been used for centuries, and moving
within a local region. Nonetheless, the
archeological data also indicate that the
Late Prehistoric occupants were not only
aware of new technologies (e.g., the man-
ufacture of arrow points and pottery and
the growing of domesticated crops) but
also became sufﬁciently knowledgeable
about these techniques that they manu-
factured both arrow points (see Fig. 7.36)
and pottery from locally available materi-
als. The people of Wind Canyon did not,
however, restrict themselves to just their
local area. Shell and ceramic material
from regions to the south and southwest
indicate contacts with those regions, and,
given the fact that the bulk of the sherds
stylistically mirror the pottery of the
Hueco Bolson, either the residents spent
extended stretches of time in that region
or the residents of the Hueco Bolson vis-
ited the general Wind Canyon area with
some frequency.

There are two areas of the eastern
Trans-Pecos where the patterns of the
Late Archaic were not continued: the Pre-
sidio Bolson, an intermountain basin tra-
versed by the Rio Grande where modern
Presidio, Texas, is situated, and in the Salt
Flat Basin on the west side of the Guada-
lupe and Delaware Mountains. Here, the
archeological evidence indicates that local
Native American residents constructed
and lived in small villages for all or part of
the year, manufactured pottery, and culti-
vated crops, and, at least in the southern
portion of the region, the Late Prehistoric
period changes persisted into the Historic
period.

In the La Junta district, situated in the

Presidio Bolson, small pithouse villages
whose residents manufactured pottery
and grew some cultigens developed
around a.d. 1200 ( J. C. Kelley et al
1940; J. C. Kelley 1985, 1986). Known
as the La Junta phase ( J. C. Kelley et al.
1940), the pithouses that mark this pe-

riod are relatively small, measuring ap-
proximately 3.4 by 4.2 m ( J. C. Kelley
1949, 1986; Shackelford 1951), and have
been investigated at the Millington
(41PS14), Loma Alta (41PS15), Polvo
(Cloud et al. 1994; J. C. Kelley and
E. A. Kelley 1990; Shackelford 1951),
and Shiner ( J. C. Kelley et al. 1940)
sites. Shiner, on the northern edge of the
Cienega Mountains, is the only one of
the group not located on the alluvial and
Pleistocene terraces of the Rio Grande in
the Presidio Bolson.

The pithouses at these sites have jacal
walls over a relatively deep pit, often ac-
companied by well-made adobe ﬂoors
and altars ( J. C. Kelley and E. A. Kelley
1990). One had “two, possibly three, su-
perimposed ﬂoors . . . one well-deﬁned
post mold, and one sub-ﬂoor pit or addi-
tional large post mold” (Cloud et al. 1994,
58). Two wood samples from Polvo re-
covered by J. Charles Kelley in 1948 from
charred beams taken from a La Junta
phase pithouse had calibrated dates of
a.d. 1265 –1405 and a.d. 1240 –1350
(Mallouf 1990). More recent investiga-
tion and dating of the La Junta phase pit
structure (Cloud et al. 1994) with super-
imposed ﬂoors indicates that initial con-
struction occurred around a.d. 1200 –
1250, that the structure was renewed
with a second ﬂoor of sandy base material
with pea gravels after a.d. 1250, and that
the structure was capped with a third ﬂoor
of clean, silty sand between a.d. 1300
and 1350. After its abandonment around
a.d. 1350, the structure burned. While it
is not known if the ﬁre was accidental or
purposeful, the other three pithouses in-
vestigated at Polvo (Shackelford 1951;
J. C. Kelley 1949) also contained associ-
ated burned roof debris.

The reason why pithouse villages were

established along this stretch of the Rio
Grande, at some distance from their near-
est counterpart, is not clear, but they are
generally believed to derive from the
Hueco Bolson ( J. C. Kelley 1952; J. C.
Kelley and E. A. Kelley 1990; Lehmer
1958). Several aspects of the architecture
and material culture lend support to this
belief. First, a ﬁve-room surface pueblo
was constructed at the Millington site, the
type site for the La Junta phase. J. Charles
Kelley and Ellen Abbott Kelley believe
that this small pueblo preceded construc-

tion of the La Junta phase pithouses at
the site, leading to the conclusion that “a
small El Paso phase colony at the Milling-
ton Site . . . was responsible for the ensu-
ing sedentary development in the La
Junta area” ( J. C. Kelley and E. A. Kelley
1990, 11). The pueblo differed from La
Junta phase pithouses in its surface rather
than pit construction and in the use of at-
tached, adobe walls. This construction is
identical to the construction of contem-
poraneous pueblos of the El Paso phase
(see Fig. 7.26). While La Junta phase pit-
houses are similar to El Paso phase pueb-
los, differences are apparent: the La Junta
phase structures were built of jacal rather
than adobe, placed in shallow or deep pits
rather than on the surface, and had sepa-
rate walls ( J. C. Kelley and E. A. Kelley
1990). Similarities include the construc-
tion of La Junta phase pithouses in rows
and the fact that they frequently had al-
tars in their south wall. Another similar-
ity is the presence of El Paso style pottery.
At Millington, two large ollas of El Paso
polychrome pottery were associated with
the surface pueblo. Moreover, El Paso
polychrome is the dominant ware in La
Junta phase occupations ( J. C. Kelley
et al. 1940; Shackelford 1951, 71–72,
and tables 3 and 4). El Paso polychrome
was also used as offerings for La Junta
phase burials, and some El Paso ware
sherds are believed to have been locally
made (see Cloud et al. 1994). Together,
these data lend credence to the idea that
these small villages derive from the Hueco
Bolson.

Circular pit structures, such as those
excavated at both Millington and Loma
Alta, are among other traits of the La
Junta phase. Two were excavated at the
Polvo site, averaging just over 1 m in
diameter and approximately 1 m deep
(Shackelford 1951). These structures may
have served as either granaries or sweat
houses ( J. C. Kelley and E. A. Kelley
1990), but almost no associated artifacts
have been recovered in them and no mac-
robotanical samples were taken.

Burials from the La Junta phase are
usually found beneath the clay ﬂoors of
the pithouses in small burial pits and in
ﬂexed positions. Five burials were recov-
ered from the Polvo site, including one
adult and four infants, leading Shack-
elford (1951) to suggest a fairly high in-

fant mortality rate. Although El Paso
polychrome is the dominant pottery type
in the La Junta phase, Chihuahua poly-
chromes, Playas Red, Chupadero Black-
on-white, and several unnamed brown
and red wares have also been recovered at
these sites (Cloud et al. 1994; J. C. Kelley
et al. 1940). Lithic artifacts include shal-
low basin metates, manos, pestles, stone
bowls, notched pebbles or sinkers, and
scrapers (Shackelford 1951).

Arrow points recovered from La Junta

phase sites are problematic, largely be-
cause most were recovered during early
excavations where stratigraphic controls
were minimal (see Fig. 7.36). They in-
clude Toyah, Perdiz, Fresno, and basally
notched and basally indented variants
(Shackelford 1951) now referred to as
Garza (Runkles 1964) or Soto arrow
points. Mallouf (1990) and Eileen John-
son et al. (1977) assign the Garza points
to the seventeenth century, well after the
La Junta phase, and Abby C. Treece et al.
(1993e) note that radiocarbon dates from
sites with Garza points in western central
Texas range from a.d. 1410 to 1630.
Garza points from excavations at Justice-
burg Reservoir (Boyd et al. 1993, 1997b)
in the Southern Plains support these
dates. Similarly, Soto points of northern
Chihuahua and the Trans-Pecos are gen-
erally considered fairly late in age (G. L.
Fritz 1989; Mallouf 1990). Perdiz and
Fresno arrow points have a fairly wide
distribution in Texas (Prewitt 1995;
E. Turner and Hester 1993; Treece et al.
1993e). Both have been found in Late
Prehistoric and Historic period contexts
throughout much of Texas (Mallouf
1985; Prewitt 1981; Treece et al. 1993e).
Forty-four arrow points recovered
during excavations at Polvo (Cloud et al.
1994) may help to resolve this issue. De-
spite the apparent mixing of deposits in
some units, a deep refuse pit in one unit
dated to a.d. 1190 –1280 contained only
two Toyah specimens. This date, plus the
“juxtaposition of the arrowpoints in the
stratigraphic column” suggest that Toyah
arrow points predate the Perdiz, Garza,
triangular (Fresno?), and other types re-
covered at Polvo (Cloud et al 1994, 73).
In summary, around a.d. 1250 small
pithouse villages began to be constructed
in the Presidio Bolson. The similarity
of the villages to the small pueblos of

small sample of such structures. Burned
rooms with in situ ﬂoor assemblages have
been observed at Hot Well, Escondida,
and Embree Pueblos (Bentley n.d.;
Hedrick 1967; Magers 1973; O’Laughlin
1985a), and there is some disputable evi-
dence for large-scale burning of structures
at Embree pueblo. These cases appear to
be relatively isolated, and the majority of
several hundred excavated pueblo rooms
were not burned.

The demise of El Paso phase pueblo
settlements after a.d. 1450 presents an-
other instance, along with Casas Grandes,
of regional abandonment by agricultural
populations throughout the southern
Southwest during the ﬁfteenth century.
Although several explanatory scenarios
have been proposed for the decline of
Puebloan occupations in west Texas (e.g.,
Upham 1984), two have some merit.
Foremost is the view that terminal events
in the El Paso phase were a result of envi-
ronmental change—such as an extended
period of drought— or more appropri-
ately that such change was coupled with
subsistence failure resulting from an
overspecialized agricultural economy
(O’Laughlin 1980; Upham 1984). A sec-
ond position is that the fall—as well as
the rise— of the Jornada pueblo system
was a direct result of the inﬂuence of the
Casas Grandes regional system (Schaafsma
1979; Wimberly 1979). J. C. Kelley
(1990; see also J. C. Kelley and E. A. Kel-
ley 1990, 1991) proposes a similar expla-
nation for developments during the La
Junta phase in the eastern Trans-Pecos.
A third position offered by Carmichael
(1986) for the Jornada region, and echoed
by Mallouf (1990) for the termination of

the La Junta phase in the Big Bend re-
gion, takes issue with the concept of
abandonment. Carmichael suggests that
populations reverted to a less intensive
hunting-gathering subsistence organiza-
tion similar to that practiced by indige-
nous groups and documented by Spanish
explorers during the sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries. Such adaptations
often left few visible archeological traces,
although, based on recently obtained
chronometric data, the Cielo Complex
appears to represent an archeologically
distinct entity of this period in the Big
Bend region (Mallouf 1985, 1990).

As established above, there is sufﬁcient
evidence to indicate that populations had
become increasingly specialized during
the El Paso phase. Therefore, it is likely
that even small-scale climatic deviations
may have resulted in a serious disruption
of the Puebloan subsistence economy. It
is also plausible that this climatic factor,
when combined with the disorder appar-
ent among social and economic systems
across the southern Southwest, may have
systemically contributed to problems in
the western Trans-Pecos.

Regardless of the nature of the under-

lying causes, the demise of the pueblo
settlement system represents a profound
change in social, economic, and subsis-
tence systems. A drastic reduction in ra-
diocarbon age estimates occurs between
a.d. 1400 and 1500 (Fig. 7.37). Using
this record as a proxy measure of feature
construction and site formation, it may
be estimated that rates of feature con-
struction after a.d. 1450 declined to lev-
els equivalent to those of the Middle Ar-
chaic or earlier, clearly suggesting a major

Mexico.

the Hueco Bolson, together with the
dominance of ceramic styles from that
region, albeit possibly locally made, cer-
tainly indicates strong inﬂuences, if not
actual movement of peoples, from the
El Paso area.

At the same time, Sebastian and Lar-

ralde (1989) and M. Miller (1994),
working in the northern region of the
Trans-Pecos, recommend an alternative
hypothesis. Speciﬁcally, they suggest that
at least some sites in the region represent
seasonally mobile groups that moved into
the eastern Trans-Pecos to gain access to
selected resources. Evidence from the
Snakepit site (41CU310), a small El Paso
phase camp on the Brushy Mesa escarp-
ment of the Delaware Mountains in east-
ern Culberson County, supports this
view. Excavated during the All American
Pipeline Project (New Mexico State Uni-
versity and Continuum Corp. 1989;
M. Miller 1994), the Late Prehistoric
component consists of several hearth fea-
tures surrounding a small, ephemeral hut
structure. Radiocarbon dates conﬁrm an
El Paso phase occupation, along with
characteristic El Paso polychrome vessel
forms and styles; however, the circular
form of the structure is not characteristic
of the formal isolated rooms and pueblos
typical of this time period in the Jornada
region but rather is much more similar to
the ephemeral hut structures of the Me-
silla phase. The artifact assemblage and
architectural form indicate a high level of
mobility with little evidence of agricul-
tural dependence. Pithouse settlements
have also been identiﬁed in the Salt Flat
Basin. Whether these settlements were
agriculturally based is open to question
because analyses of macrobotanical and
pollen samples identiﬁed few plant
remains.

Post-Pueblo through the Early
Spanish Colonial Period
(A.D. 1450 –1750)

Between a.d. 1450 and 1500, pueblo
settlements across the Jornada Mogollon
region of the western Trans-Pecos and
southern New Mexico were abandoned.
Whether isolated rooms or pithouses con-
tinued to be occupied is open to ques-
tion, although no post–a.d. 1450 radio-
carbon dates have been obtained from the

decline in regional population. Another
indication that profound social and dem-
ographic changes took place is that the El
Paso brownware ceramic tradition, repre-
senting nearly twelve hundred years of
relative technological continuity in manu-
facturing methods and raw material uti-
lization, disappears from the archeological
record after a.d. 1450.

Subsequent to the abandonment of
the El Paso phase puebloan system and
preceding the Spanish entradas in the
mid- to late 1500s, events in the western
Trans-Pecos remain almost entirely un-
known. Noting the presence of several
post–a.d. 1450 radiocarbon dates
throughout the western Trans-Pecos,
Patrick H. Beckett and Terry L. Corbett
(1992; see also Beckett 1985) suggest that
these dates provide evidence of post-
pueblo habitation. They further propose
that the inhabitants of El Paso phase
pueblos were ancestral to indigenous
Manso groups described by early Spanish
chroniclers. M. Miller (n.d.) offers a criti-
cal appraisal of these dates, noting that
very few post– a.d. 1450 radiocarbon age
estimates are free from serious contextual
and interpretive problems. However,
several radiocarbon age estimates do fall
within this interval, most notably a series
of dates obtained from Firecracker Pueblo
in northeast El Paso (M. Miller 1996a).
While we believe the region was occupied
during this period, unambiguous archeo-
logical evidence to substantiate such be-
liefs is lacking. Unfortunately, aside from
the issue of late chronometric dates, cur-
rent arguments regarding the existence of
post-pueblo occupations are phrased pri-
marily in terms of negative evidence, and
accordingly the nature of prehistoric oc-
cupation between a.d. 1450 and the late
1500s remains entirely open to question.
Commencing in 1581, several entradas
by Spanish explorers passed through por-
tions of the Trans-Pecos. Among the more
important and well-documented early en-
tradas are the Rodriguez-Chamuscado,
Espejo, and Oñate expeditions. Spanish
accounts of these travels note the presence
of several indigenous groups occupying
the La Junta and western Trans-Pecos re-
gions. Although varied and contradictory
names are often provided in the docu-
mentary sources (Gerald 1973; Naylor
1969), the most common terms include

the Manso and Suma in the vicinity of El
Paso and southern New Mexico, and the
Jumano and Patarabueye in the La Junta
region ( J. C. Kelley 1986). Ethnohistori-
cally, little is known of these groups be-
yond rather brief and vague accounts
provided by Spanish chroniclers of the
expeditions (Beckett and Corbett 1992;
Benavides 1965; Hammond and Rey
1929; A. Hughes 1914; J. C. Kelley 1952,
1953, 1986; Kenmotsu 1994; Scholes and
Mera 1940; Walz 1951).

Fray Alonso de Benavides (1965
[1916]) and Diego Pérez de Luxán
(Hammond and Rey 1929) provide the
most thorough accounts of the encoun-
ters between Spanish and indigenous
groups in the Trans-Pecos. In the western
Trans-Pecos, both accounts describe
Manso groups living along the Rio
Grande in communities, or rancherias,
composed of straw houses ( jacales) and
subsisting primarily on hunted and gath-
ered foods. Descriptions of food items
include mesquite, ﬁsh, and mice, in addi-
tion to corn, which may have been culti-
vated to a limited extent. Luxán’s account
of settlements in the La Junta district
provide several insights into house form
and subsistence, describing the presence
of ﬂat-roofed semisubterranean habita-
tions similar to the jacal structures exca-
vated at the Millington, Loma Alta, and
Polvo sites ( J. C. Kelley 1939, 1949,
1986; Shackelford 1951, 1955). The in-
habitants of these sites, collectively re-
ferred to as Patarabueyes, are described as
having an agricultural subsistence base,
with corn, beans, and gourds mentioned
as primary food items. In addition to the
sedentary groups along the Rio Grande,
the Jumanos are also ﬁrst mentioned the
Espejo expedition and are described as
having a similar appearance and dress to
the Patarabueyes but constructing differ-
ent house forms and subsisting on hunted
and gathered foods such as roasted cal-
abashes, prickly pear cactus, buffalo, and
ﬁsh. Benjamin L. Everitt (1977) makes
an important observation that such
groups were frequently encountered by
Spanish explorers traveling through the
Rio Grande Valley during the winter
months, but they found the region de-
void of inhabitants during the summer
months, a pattern suggestive of a mobile,
seasonal settlement round.

Archeological evidence of occupations
by protohistoric Manso or Suma groups
in the western Trans-Pecos has been elu-
sive (Gerald 1974). No settlement of this
period has been conclusively identiﬁed
despite extensive surveys in El Paso
County and south-central New Mexico.
Since Spanish documents often note that
portions of the valley were occupied, the
apparent absence of such sites probably is
due to problems of archeological recogni-
tion and geomorphic factors, the latter
being a particularly salient issue if such
settlements were situated in the ﬂood-
plain of the Rio Grande Valley.

One site that may be provisionally at-
tributed to Manso or Suma settlement is
LA26780, at the Dona Ana County Air-
port 8 km west of El Paso (Batcho 1987;
Batcho et al. 1985; M. Miller 2001). Sur-
face collections and limited excavations
documented a multicomponent occupa-
tion with several clusters of hearths and
artifacts distributed along an upper ter-
race of the Rio Grande Valley.

Aspects of the artifact collections from

some clusters at LA26780 are unusual
when contrasted with other prehistoric
and historic assemblages in the vicinity.
Nearly 64 percent of the lithic assemblage
was obsidian, an unusually high propor-
tion in a region where, even at sites situ-
ated near obsidian-bearing gravels, this
material rarely exceeds 10 percent of pre-
historic lithic assemblages. Of forty ob-
sidian samples submitted for source iden-
tiﬁcation, one is from the Antelope Wells
source in southwestern New Mexico;
thirty-nine samples are assigned to three
obsidian geochemical compositional
groups that derive from the Lago Barreal,
Sierra Fresnal, and one as yet unidentiﬁed
source in northern Chihuahua (M. Miller
and Shackley 1998). None of the forty
samples is from a source in the Rio
Grande gravels, despite the site’s location
at the edge of the Rio Grande Valley ter-
race. The artifact assemblage also includes
coarsely manufactured and poorly ﬁred
sand-tempered brownware sherds and
small, triangular Harrell-style projectile
points. Duran and Batcho (1983) also
note that a partial rowel from a Spanish
spur was recovered from the surface near
a hearth that yielded a calibrated radio-
carbon age range of a.d. 1420 (1516,
1588, 1622) 1950. These data are not

particularly convincing if considered indi-
vidually, and the multicomponent nature
of the site (i.e., prehistoric materials at
several hearth/artifact clusters) creates
further interpretive problems. At the
present time, however, LA26780 is the
most promising candidate for a Manso
settlement. If this can be conﬁrmed, ob-
sidian sourcing studies and other aspects
of material culture from this settlement
may provide insights into the mobility
ranges or nature of extraregional contacts
of protohistoric Manso groups in the area.
Archeological and historical evidence

indicates that quite a different series of
events took place during this period in
the eastern Trans-Pecos. Unlike the west-
ern region, the villages of the La Junta
district were not abandoned around
a.d. 1400 but continued to be occupied
until 1683, when Spanish missions were
established in the Presidio Bolson. This
period of time has been named the Con-
cepcion phase ( J. C. Kelley et al. 1940;
J. C. Kelley and E. A. Kelley 1990), but
the dates are tentative, and the phase
needs further archeological research.
The distinguishing features of the
phase are its house and pottery styles.
Houses of the Concepcion phase are dis-
tinct from the earlier houses in their much
larger size (measuring ca. 7.3 by 8.8 m)
and “by [their] lack of adobe ﬂoors, curbs,
altars, and ﬁre pits” ( J. C. Kelley 1986,
82). They did continue to be constructed
in a pit and were frequently constructed
in rows (Fig. 7.38). Excavated examples
of these structures resemble those de-
scribed by Spanish explorers. Kelley and
Kelley conclude that their large size, and
the presence of multiple hearths, indicates
they were used by “several families, prob-
ably an extended family group” ( J. C.
Kelley and E. A. Kelley 1990, 11). Circu-
lar pit structures, believed to be granaries
or storage facilities in the preceding
phase, were also constructed in the Con-
cepcion phase. However, like the rectan-
gular pithouses of this phase, these struc-
tures are much larger than those of the La
Junta phase. If Kelley and Kelley (1990)
are correct in their interpretation of mul-
tifamily settlement, then it would make
sense that the size of storage facilities
would have increased to accommodate
greater needs.

While nearly all artifact types present

in components of the La Junta phase are
present in Concepcion phase deposits
( J. C. Kelley 1986), the ceramic wares in
the latter are quite distinct. In contrast
to the prominence of El Paso styles dur-
ing the La Junta phase, locally produced
plainwares dominate the assemblage. Ten-
tative type names assigned to Concepcion
phase ceramics are Chinati Plain, Capote
Red-on-brown, and Paloma Red-on-gray
( J. C. Kelley et al. 1940). Another dis-
tinction of the Concepcion ceramic as-
semblage is that intrusive wares from
New Mexico or northern Chihuahua are
not present ( J. C. Kelley 1986). One ex-
ception to this is two sherds of Patton
Engraved, a pottery type manufactured
by the historic Hasinai Caddo of east
Texas (see Story 1995), recovered from
the Millington site. As noted above, an-
other possible distinction between the
two phases is the replacement of Toyah
arrow points with Perdiz, Garza/Soto,
and Fresno styles.

More recently, Mallouf (1985, 1990,
1993) has documented a unique archeo-
logical manifestation designated the Cielo
Complex. One of the more distinctive as-
pects of Cielo Complex settlements is an
architectural style of oval or round house
enclosures (2.7 to 3.4 m in diameter)
bounded by stacked stones (Fig. 7.39).
Cielo Complex settlements are present
throughout the Big Bend region, north-
eastern Chihuahua, and northwestern
Coahuila. In the La Junta district they
tend to be situated on higher alluvial ter-
races and landforms than La Junta and

Concepcion phase villages. Bone tools,
formal stone tools, groundstone, and
Perdiz arrow points are commonly found
at Cielo Complex sites, and turquoise and
shell ornaments have also been recovered.
The material culture of the complex is
similar to that of the La Junta and Con-
cepcion phase settlements. However, an
important distinction between Cielo
Complex occupations and La Junta and
Concepcion phase settlements is that ce-
ramics are entirely lacking at the former.
Recently obtained radiocarbon dates indi-
cate occupations between ca. a.d. 1330
and 1680 (Mallouf 1990).

The particular settlement and adaptive
system represented by the Cielo Complex
cuts across the La Junta and Concepcion
phases and offers intriguing support for
the idea of a continuum of hunter-gatherer
adaptations coexistent with agricultural-
ists in the Presidio Bolson, a continuum
transcending the demise of agriculturally
based settlement systems in the adjacent
Jornada Mogollon region. In addition,
Mallouf (1985, 1990) notes the presence
of turquoise and shell in Cielo Complex
sites, evidence for symbiotic relationships
between hunter-gatherer groups and
sedentary agriculturalists in the eastern
Trans-Pecos.

Establishment of Missions
and the Pueblo Revolt

Beginning in the late 1600s the pace
of Spanish colonization increased with
the establishment of missions and settle-
ments in the La Junta district and the

but none has yet been identiﬁed archeo-
logically (A. Hughes 1914; Gerald 1990a).
The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 in New
Mexico and the Manso Revolt of 1684 in
the El Paso area provided the impetus for
the next series of mission and presidio es-
tablishments. After the Pueblo Revolt
among puebloan groups in northern New
Mexico, an estimated two thousand
Spanish refugees and Native Americans
loyal to the Spaniards were resettled
around missions in the El Paso Lower
Valley. Tiwa (Tigua), Piro, and Tompiro
groups from the Rio Abajo pueblos of the
central and northern Rio Grande Valley
of New Mexico were resettled at the mis-
sions of Ysleta and Socorro. The original
Ysleta mission and at least two locations
of the mission at Socorro were destroyed
by ﬂoods. In the 1980s, Rex Gerald,
working at site 41EP1532, identiﬁed the
location of what is suspected to be the So-
corro mission occupied until 1760 (Ger-
ald 1990b; D. Martin 1999). Missions
were also ﬁrst established in the La Junta
district in 1683. J. C. Kelley (1953) and
Madrid (1993) have tentatively identiﬁed
the Polvo site (412PS21) as the location
of the San Antonio de los Puliques mis-
sion and pueblo known as Tapacolmes.
Unfortunately, Spanish Colonial period
sites in the La Junta district have received
little archeological attention aside from
limited work completed at the Polvo site
(Cloud et al. 1994).

Archeological aspects of the Pueblo
Revolt period in the western Trans-Pecos
have recently come to light in excavation
and survey projects in the El Paso Lower
Valley in the vicinity of the present-day
towns of Ysleta, Socorro, and San Elizario
(D. O. Brown et al. 1994, 1995; M. Mil-
ler and O’Leary 1992a; Peterson 1993;
Peterson and Brown 1992a, 1992b; Sale
et al. 1987; Vierra et al. 1997, 1999).
These investigations have provided infor-
mation on site locations, feature types,
chronology, and material culture of this
period. However, in many ways, the
Spanish Colonial period archeology in
the western Trans-Pecos remains in a de-
velopmental stage, and inferences regard-
ing changing subsistence adaptations and
social organization remain conjectural.
There are also fundamental problems in
differentiating among archeological re-
mains attributable to Native American and

lower valley of El Paso. The ﬁrst mission
in the western sector was Nuestra Señora
de Guadalupe de los Mansos, established
in 1659 on the southern side of the Rio
Grande in what is today Ciudad Juárez,
Chihuahua (Gerald 1990a). The mission
was refurbished in 1662, and a restored
version stands today adjacent to the Juárez

cathedral. Records indicate that four hun-
dred Mansos were present at the dedica-
tion ceremony (Forbes 1960). Little else
is known of this settlement, and much of
the original site remains buried under ur-
ban developments in downtown Juárez.
Additional missions and settlements were
established along the Rio Grande Valley,

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

Hispanic groups. However, a chronologi-
cal and material culture framework has
now been established to guide the design
of future research.

During this period, the focus of re-
gional settlement shifted to the ﬂoodplain
and terrace margins of the Rio Grande
Valley, with residential settlements cen-
tered in proximity to missions or pre-
sidios established at Ysleta, Socorro, and
San Elizario. Such sites have rarely been
encountered far from these core settle-
ment zones, although some important
components may be difﬁcult to identify
because they may be buried at depths of
greater than 1 m below recent ﬂoodplain
alluvium and agricultural ﬁelds. Recent
surveys of the terrace margins have re-
corded small camp sites with historic
brownware ceramics, suggesting intermit-
tent and short-term occupation of this
topographic zone (Graves et al. 1997).
Oral traditions note that the Hueco Bol-
son was used for hunting forays, and
macroﬂoral and faunal assemblages from
Spanish Colonial deposits commonly in-
clude game animals and plants indige-
nous to habitats outside the riverine envi-
ronment of the Rio Grande Valley. Direct
archeological evidence of land use or
settlement in the Hueco or Mesilla Bol-
sons is rare, however. Isolated ﬁnds of
historic brownware sherds have occasion-
ally been reported there, and a few sherds
have been found associated with small ar-
tifact scatters or hearths (see M. Miller
et al. 1998). There appear to be no sub-
stantial residential sites of this period
within the central basin, alluvial fan pied-
mont of local mountain chains, or river
margin terraces.

Community structure of post–Pueblo

Revolt settlements remains poorly
known. Evidence for pueblos is absent,
and instead settlement involved isolated
jacal structures near agricultural ﬁelds or
clusters of such houses loosely arranged
around central plazas. The majority of
test excavations in these contexts through-
out the valley have encountered generally
undifferentiated deposits of cultural de-
bris and refuse mixed within ﬂoodplain
deposits, although trash pits and occa-
sional jacal structures or suspected rem-
nants of such structures have been en-
countered. Excavations have usually been
restricted to small areas, such that it is sel-

dom possible to determine the overall lay-
out of settlements or whether adjacent
structures are present. Based on current
information, it does appear that most
house structures are relatively isolated,
and it may be surmised that community
layouts were similar to those observed by
J. Walter Fewkes at the Tigua pueblo at
Ysleta: “The cacique remembers that for-
merly Indian houses were arranged in
that site in rectangular form about the
plaza, each building being a small one-
story habitation made of upright logs
chinked and plastered with adobe, form-
ing a type of building called by the Mexi-
cans jacal” (Fewkes 1902, 60).

Early work focused on remains of mis-

sions and presidios, including Rex Ger-
ald’s pioneering work at Socorro Mission
(Gerald 1990a, 1990b; see also D. Martin
1999), or Hispanic homesteads (Morrow
1978), and consequently Native Ameri-
can settlements received less emphasis.
An exception is Consuelo T. Evans’s
(1988) study of burials from Socorro
Mission that provided an important
source of bioarcheological information
for this period. The burial population of
thirty-two individuals recovered from be-
low the ﬂoor and in the nave of the mis-
sion consisted mostly of Native Ameri-
cans, although some were of mixed
Native American/Spanish descent. Car-
bon isotope studies on a sample of the
burials (MacNeish and Marino 1993) in-
dicate a reliance on domesticated culti-
gens and animals.

The best known Native American
settlement of the Pueblo Revolt period is
41EP2840, also known as the Ysleta WIC
Clinic site (Miller and O’Leary 1992a).
The Ysleta WIC Clinic site has been se-
curely dated on ceramic and stratigraphic
grounds to a.d. 1680 –1725, and there-
fore it was inhabited within the ﬁrst two
generations after the Pueblo Revolt. Exca-
vations at a depth of 1 m below the plow
zone and ﬂoodplain deposits unearthed
a collapsed, burned jacal structure sur-
rounded by numerous trash pits, bor-
row pits, and a possible hearth feature
(Fig. 7.40). Large quantities of animal
bone and ceramics were recovered from
these features. Aside from the ceramics
and subsistence remains, the artifact
assemblage from the Ysleta WIC Clinic
site appears distinctly Native American.

Chipped stone tools, spindle whorls fash-
ioned from reworked brownware and ma-
jolica sherds, and a fragmentary ceramic
ﬁgurine were recovered at the site. Items
of metal or glass were extremely rare, as
were nonlocal ceramic wares.

The artifacts and features at the Ysleta

WIC Clinic site are among the earliest
well-documented Spanish Colonial pe-
riod assemblages in the valley, and aspects
of material culture from this settlement
provide an important data set to compare
with materials recovered from later eigh-
teenth- and nineteenth-century deposits
in the vicinity. Beginning in the 1700s,
the El Paso area missions became part of
a commercial network along the Camino
Real between Santa Fe and Chihuahua,
Mexico. Comparative studies of artifact
assemblages offer an opportunity to ex-
amine the impacts of this increasing
tempo of economic activity and Spanish
inﬂuence on Native American groups.
Subsistence practices are becoming
known through recent work, and the pic-
ture is one of mixed subsistence of tradi-
tional wild and domesticated foods and
the addition of European cultigens and
livestock. The inﬂuence of Spanish colo-
nization is readily apparent by the com-
mon presence of introduced, domesticated
animals in faunal collections from this pe-
riod (Bartlema 1994, 1995; M. Brown
1997, 1999; Hanson et al. 1992; Stratton
1996). The most common faunal remains
include cow (Bos taurus), domesticated
sheep (Ovis aries), and goat (Capra hir-
cus). Other domesticated species such as
pig (Sus scrofa), chicken (Gallus gallus),
and horse (Equus caballus) are present in
smaller numbers, as occasionally are
canids (dogs, coyote), probably nonfood
items. Despite the predominance of do-
mesticated species and the hunting of
deer, animals such as cottontail, jackrab-
bit, antelope, and various bird species
continued to be important. Riverine spe-
cies include turtle, ﬁsh, and shellﬁsh, but
such remains are surprisingly rare given
the locations of the settlements in the Rio
Grande ﬂoodplain, and their rarity sug-
gests that they served as supplemental
food resources. Quantitative summaries
indicate that the meat diet comprised
domesticated cow and caprines (goat or
sheep). Intersite comparative analyses are
hindered to an extent by sampling and

taphonomic problems, yet it does appear
that the early occupation at the Ysleta
WIC Clinic site has proportionally greater
amounts of rabbit, deer, and antelope re-
mains when compared to faunal collec-
tions from post–a.d. 1750 occupations
(Fig. 7.41).

Several intriguing patterns are also
emerging from recent macrobotanical
studies (Holloway 1996; Holloway and
Toll 1992; McBride 1997, 1999). Not
surprisingly, corn is the most common
domesticate. Morphometric studies of
preserved corncobs from the Ysleta WIC

Clinic site have shown that distinctive
Spanish hybrids were absent (Holloway
and Toll 1992, 179). Instead, the struc-
ture and dimensions of the Zea samples
are similar to early post-contact south-
western types, demonstrating that local
groups during early post–Pueblo Revolt
times maintained an emphasis on tradi-
tional crops. The pits of peaches, a food
item introduced by the Spanish, are fre-
quently recovered from trash pits and
house contexts, and other introduced
plants such as wheat and grapes have been
found in contexts postdating a.d. 1750.

Despite the rather thorough sampling of
deposits at several sites in the valley, evi-
dence of domesticated beans has rarely
been found in early Spanish Colonial de-
posits, and the only mention of cucurbits
is from the Garcia site (Peterson 1993,
505). Wild plant foods continue to be an
important supplement to the diet. Mes-
quite and prickly pear cactus seeds have
been recovered from numerous contexts
both predating and postdating a.d. 1750,
indicating that these resources continued
to play an important role in subsistence.
Other wild plant remains include sun-

northern Mexico during Spanish Colo-
nial times. The earlier expression of the
tradition is represented at the Ysleta WIC
Clinic site (Miller and O’Leary 1992b)
and has a distinctive continuity with
northern New Mexican Native American
ceramic traditions because of the presence
of carinated bowl forms. Carinated bowls
(vessels with polished red slips or washes)
and an absence of red-on-brown designs
mark production and stylistic attributes
distinguishing the early period from
post–a.d. 1700/1750 assemblages from
sites in Socorro and San Elizario (Brown
and Driver 1994; Marshall 1997). The
Valle Bajo tradition shares several generic
similarities with Spanish Colonial brown-
ware collections of the Conchos phase in
the La Junta district. While certain differ-
ences in temper and paste can be ex-
pected given the distance between El Paso
and La Junta de los Ríos, sufﬁcient simi-
larities exist in design and form to indi-
cate that the historic brownware of the
Conchos phase represents another local
expression of the corriente ware tradition
of the greater Southwest.

Summary of the Post-Pueblo and
Early Spanish Colonial Periods

Only a cursory account of the variety
of recent archeological investigations of
the Spanish Colonial period has been pre-
sented in this chapter, but the relevance
of this period for examining larger an-
thropological issues of regional reorgani-
zation, economic and social interaction,
and processes of assimilation and accul-
turation is evident. Peterson and Brown
(1992b) deﬁne two overarching themes
for Spanish Colonial period archeological
research in the El Paso Lower Valley: cul-
ture group interaction and community
evolution. Central to these themes are the
study of the dynamic and complex rela-
tionships between indigenous popula-
tions (Manso, Suma, and Apache), reset-
tled puebloan groups from New Mexico
(Piro and Tiwa), and European colonists
and how rapidly changing economic and
social arrangements among these groups
are reﬂected in aspects of material culture
and the structure of communities. While
the picture is far from clear, the archeo-
logical record of settlements in the El Paso
Lower Valley shows a dilution of tradi-
tional subsistence practices and material
culture, indicating that Native Americans

groups through time.

ﬂower, atriplex, cheno-ams, milkweed,
cocklebur, and purslane, although it has
not been determined whether these repre-
sent food or medicinal items as opposed
to background seed rain from agricultural
ﬁelds and plazas.

Interestingly, stone tool technologies
show little fundamental change from pre-
historic sites in the western Trans-Pecos
(Graves 1995; O’Leary and Miller 1992;
Vierra 1997a, 1999). One recently inves-
tigated aspect of chipped stone assem-
blages indicates that gunﬂints were manu-
factured in the vicinity of the presidio at
San Elizario (Vierra 1997a), but produc-
tion of such implements was probably as-
sociated with Spanish military occupation
of the presidio. Otherwise, lithic technol-

ogy among Native American groups con-
tinues the tradition of informal core tech-
nologies and ﬂake tools using raw materi-
als procured from local gravel deposits.
Small, triangular projectile points (Har-
rell style) are common in some Spanish
Colonial contexts, particularly those pre-
dating a.d. 1750. Groundstone manos
and metates are also present.

The most striking technological change
involves ceramics. A new tradition known
as Valle Bajo brownware makes its ap-
pearance, marking a distinct departure
from prehistoric El Paso brownware. As
noted by Marshall (1997), Valle Bajo
brownware represents a local expression
of the regional corriente ware produced
throughout New Mexico, west Texas, and

assimilated to some degree into Spanish
Colonial culture. As noted by Vierra
(1997b), such events in the El Paso area
proceeded much more abruptly than in
the northern New Mexico pueblos. Ex-
amining the degree of community evolu-
tion and cultural assimilation—as well as
the continued resistance to assimilation—
is one of the more promising aspects of
Spanish Colonial period archeology in
west Texas.

Equally interesting are contrasting de-

velopments in the eastern and western
Trans-Pecos that present an important
opportunity to further our understanding
of processes of regional reorganization
and cultural collapse. What factors led to
the abandonment of puebloan settle-
ments toward the west while similar sub-
sistence and settlement systems to the
east were largely unaffected, or at least
were maintained with only minor changes
in architecture and material culture? An
important component of this issue in-
volves mutualistic relationships between
hunter-gatherer groups and agricultural-
ists (Kenmotsu 1994; Mallouf 1990),
and the eastern Trans-Pecos holds great
promise for further investigations of such
relationships.

Summary

The La Junta district, Salt Flat Basin,
the Guadalupe Mountains, and other ar-
eas of the Trans-Pecos are often accorded
only passing reference, if they are men-
tioned at all, in culture history overviews
of the Jornada Mogollon region. Like-

wise, the Jornada Mogollon region is of-
ten given limited attention in culture his-
tories of the eastern Trans-Pecos. Cultural
events and processes in the La Junta dis-
trict and Jornada Mogollon region are
distinct and rightfully should be viewed
within their speciﬁc environmental, eco-
logical, and cultural contexts. However,
of equal signiﬁcance is the interplay be-
tween Prehistoric and early Historic
groups throughout these and more dis-
tant regions of the Southwest. Again,
these issues reﬂect our scale of inquiry.
By focusing on single regions, adaptive
patterns and processes that transcend re-
gional boundaries are often overlooked.
A combined focus on the regional and
the transcendent can provide a more real-
istic vision of prehistory, not only for
the Trans-Pecos but also for the greater
Southwest, north-central Mexico, the
Southern Plains, and central Texas.

The Lower Pecos River Region of Texas
and Northern Mexico

Solveig A. Turpin

The Lower Pecos region, the smallest of
the deﬁned cultural areas in Texas, en-
compasses an elliptical area that centers
on the mouth of the Pecos River and ex-
tends perhaps 150 km north and south
of the Rio Grande, from the vicinity of
modern-day Shefﬁeld to the Arroyo de la
Babia in Coahuila, Mexico (Fig. 8.1).
The southern limits remain vague pend-
ing more systematic research in Mexico,
but at present the most southerly of the
known sites are on the north face of the
Sierra Santa Rosa, northwest of Múzquiz,
the former Spanish colony Santa Rosa
Sacramento, and southeast of Boquillas
del Carmen, the crossing of the Rio
Grande. The east-west axis roughly fol-
lows the Rio Grande from Del Rio–
Ciudad Acuña to beyond the historically
famous hamlet of Langtry, and extend-
ing onto the Stockton Plateau north of
Dryden.

Traditionally, the geographical bound-

aries of the region have been deﬁned by
the extent of the most distinctive of four
prehistoric rock art styles (the Pecos River
style) and by a commonality in material
culture recovered from dry rockshelters,
the latter partly a product of exceptional
preservation of wood and plant artifacts.
The concept of a Lower Pecos cultural
area is in fact a construct based on the
ﬂorescence of regionally speciﬁc charac-
teristics, such as the distinctive Pecos
River style pictographs and projectile
points that bear local names—Langtry,

Val Verde, and Pandale—that date be-
tween ﬁve thousand and three thousand
years ago, during the Middle Archaic pe-
riod. Before and after the Middle Ar-
chaic, the Lower Pecos shares many of its
traits with adjacent regions, apparently
being affected by cultural inﬂuences radi-
ating from Texas and northern Mexico.
Thus, the Lower Pecos cultural trajectory
can be visualized as elliptical with its
apogee reached during the Middle Ar-
chaic period.

Typically, hunter-gatherer adaptations
are strongly correlated to environmental
factors, and the Lower Pecos is no excep-
tion. The climatic sequence has been
reconstructed from fauna (Dibble and
Lorrain 1968; Lundelius 1984), pollen
(Bryant 1966, 1969; Bryant and Shafer
1977; Story and Bryant 1966), macro-
ﬂora (Dering 1979, 1999b), coprolites
(Sobolik 1988, 1994, 1996; Stock 1983;
Williams Dean 1978), ﬂood sequences
(Patton and Dibble 1982), sediments
(Robinson 1997a), and ethnohistory
(Turpin 1987b). The cool mesic Late
Pleistocene savanna, capable of support-
ing herds of now-extinct megafauna, suc-
cumbed to increasing aridity some nine
thousand years ago. Semidesert condi-
tions prevailed, reaching their peak about
ﬁve thousand years ago and relaxing
around 3000 b.p. during a short but in-
ﬂuential mesic interlude that permitted
the expansion of the Great Plains grass-
lands and their characteristic fauna at

266

least as far south as the Rio Grande. Then,
the trend toward aridity resumed and per-
haps even accelerated until late in the Pre-
historic or early Historic periods, when
early accounts again describe extensive
grasslands capable of supporting large
herd animals (Turpin 1987b). Sometime
late in the 1800s, the resurgence of the
drying trend coincided with the introduc-
tion of domestic livestock, tipping the
fragile balance of nature in favor of the
thorny unpalatable scrub that persists de-
spite moisture deﬁcits, the thin rocky
soils, and the insatiable appetite of sheep
and goats. Thus, although the desert suc-
culents that were the staple of prehistoric
diet over the millennia still grow in the
region today, much of their relative abun-
dance has been lost to invader species.

The northern half of the Lower Pecos

region is ﬂat to rolling rangeland dis-
sected by entrenching tributaries to the
three major rivers—the Devils, the Pecos,
and the Rio Grande—their conﬂuences
now inundated by Amistad Reservoir.
Although all were (and are) important
sources of water, and by extension harbor
important faunal and ﬂoral resources, the
three differ in potability. The saline Pecos
(originally called the Salado), the muddy
Rio Grande, and the clear, spring-fed
Devils were undoubtedly the nucleus of
prehistoric occupation, but springs, seeps,
and tinajas (potholes) permitted exploita-
tion of upland and tributary resources
that apparently waxed and waned in in-

Archaic period even if differences in to-
pography, hydrology, and natural re-
sources encouraged variability in aborigi-
nal technology and economy.

Other geologic factors that inﬂuenced

prehistoric occupation include the nu-
merous rock shelters hollowed from the
sheer limestone cliffs (Fig. 8.2), the copi-
ous quantities of lithic raw material avail-
able as gravels or eroding chert beds, and
the strictures imposed on accessibility be-
tween upland and riverine resources. The
prehistoric settlement patterns reﬂect
the high incidence of rockshelters on the
Pecos River and the Rio Grande and their
lesser presence on the Devils River, where
instead huge open camps are found at the
mouths of every tributary. By far the ma-
jority of the sites recorded south of the
Rio Grande are also rockshelters, but the
emphasis on rock art recording has un-
doubtedly introduced this bias.

Early settlers describe an environment
quite different from that of today, before
erosion, exacerbated by overgrazing and
modern droughts, reduced the soil cover
in historic times. The disastrous result is
evident in the siltation of Amistad Reser-
voir, the deﬂation of stone features once
perched on deeper soils but now sitting
on exposed bedrock (Turpin 1982; Tur-
pin and Bement 1989), the burial of the
Lewis Canyon petroglyphs under rede-
posited sediments (Turpin and Bass
1997), and the higher incidence of ﬂood
damage to rockshelters and rock art (Pat-
ton and Dibble 1982). The modern ﬂora
and fauna are similarly a product of live-
stock husbandry, but the vegetational
communities retain the basic components
utilized during much of prehistory.

Archeological research in the Lower
Pecos region can be divided into three
eras: the antiquarian search for museum
specimens that prevailed in the 1930s,
the salvage program in anticipation of the
construction of Amistad Reservoir (then
Diablo Reservoir) between 1958 and
1969, and the current resurgence of indi-
vidual and privately funded research. The
last ﬁfteen years of the twentieth century
saw rockshelter excavations and broad
area surveys, but the most recent trend is
a phenomenal interest in the diverse body
of Native American rock art preserved in
the dry shelters and overhangs. The pub-
lished and unpublished information gen-
erated by sixty years of research is so

tensity depending upon climatic condi-
tions. The impermanence of upland water
sources is reﬂected in the settlement pat-
terns, where scheduling depended upon a
thorough understanding of weather, to-
pography, and local water retention ca-
pacity (Turpin 1996).

The poorly known southern half of
the Lower Pecos region, between the Rio
Grande and the Sierra del Carmen, is
deﬁcient in permanent water sources,
forcing its inhabitants to develop a differ-
ent adaptive strategy. The Rio Grande
plain is ﬂat and featureless except where
dissected by entrenching tributary can-
yons that have been inundated to some
degree by the impoundment of Amistad
Reservoir. The Serranías del Burro rise
abruptly, presenting a barrier to south-

ward movement, and access, now as in
the past, is limited to the broad valleys
east and west of the mountains. Springs
rising high in the mountain deﬁles are
the only permanent source of water, and
many of those have gone dry in the mod-
ern era. Survey has generally been limited
to the speciﬁc search for cave paintings,
so little is known about the domestic side
of prehistoric lifeways, especially in the
mountainous zone. Recent pictograph
recordings, and shelter excavations in the
Encantada Mountains, west of the Arroyo
de la Babia, illustrate both similarities and
differences between the material culture
(Turpin 1997a) and the rock art of south
and north (Turpin and Eling 2002), but
it is clear that the entire area was united by
a shared belief system during the Middle

the intrusive powers, whether Native
American or European, was the most evi-
dent ethnohistorically (Turpin 1989).

The culture history of the Lower Pecos
is a microcosm of hunting and gathering
societies throughout the world, alternat-
ing between an emphasis on a hunting
economy to one dominated by gathering.
The stamp of arid lands adaptation is
seen in the aspects of prehistoric lifeways
that are most inﬂuenced by environment
and economics, such as material culture,
technology, and settlement patterns. The
excellent preservation of normally perish-
able items, and the diverse and elaborate
body of art, both mural and mobiliary,
transcends the mundane, opening vistas
into the political, social, and religious
spheres of hunter and gatherer lifeways.
Two competing models of prehistoric
adaptation have been generated from two
different perspectives on the material
record. One school postulates a static Ar-
chaic continuum that endured for nine
thousand years (Kirkland and Newcomb
1967; Shafer 1976, 1981a, 1986; Shafer
and Bryant 1977; and to some degree,
also Dering 1999b and Taylor 1967); my
perceptions are of both abrupt and grad-
ual changes within the parameters im-
posed by small-scale social organization
(Turpin 1990b). These diametrically op-
posed viewpoints are in part a function of
research focus. The ﬁrst perspective is de-
rived from the natural environment, as
well as from such material classes as food,
ﬁber, coprolites, and stone tools, and it
can be theoretically described as an eco-
logical, functional, or adaptive model.
The second perspective is conditioned by
an emphasis on less tangible items and
processes, including rock art, mortuary
customs, and settlement patterns.

Paleoindian Period

Aurora Subperiod (pre-12,000 B.P.)

The ﬁrst inhabitants of the Lower
Pecos region apparently arrived on the
banks of the Rio Grande sometime be-
tween twelve thousand and fourteen
thousand years ago, bearing a fully devel-
oped cultural system that centered on the
procurement of big game. Scattered and
burned horse, camel, bison, and bear
bones in the small site of Cueva Que-
brada are the ﬁrst radiocarbon-dated evi-
dence of Paleoindian occupation of the

abundant that the reader is often directed
to summary articles rather than primary
sources, a lamentable practice that may
lead to bibliographic drift, but one man-
dated by the number of citable resources.
More than three hundred radiocarbon

dates contribute to one of the most
precise regional chronologies in Texas
(Table 8.1), although several nomencla-
tures have been suggested (see Turpin
1991b). The one used to guide this

overview was ﬁrst proposed by Dibble (in
Prewitt 1983) and later reﬁned as more
radiocarbon assays were generated. The
traditional quadripartite division into
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric,
and Historic periods is expanded into
eleven prehistoric subperiods (including
one phase and one probable horizon),
leaving the Historic period intact. The
Historic period can be further subdivided
into four parts, depending upon which of

in deposits of this age (Hester 1983), and
the ﬁber industry was apparently well un-
der way (Andrews and Adovasio 1980), at
least in northern Mexico. These techno-
logical and economic shifts are appropri-
ate responses to the onset of the long dry-
ing trend that Bryant (1966) called the
Stockton stage.

Archaic Period

Viejo Subperiod (8900 to 5500 B.P.)

The Early Archaic period, or Viejo
subperiod, as currently deﬁned, is far too
long and amorphous to be considered a
meaningful cultural unit. Spanning some
thirty-four hundred years, during this pe-
riod one sees the entrenchment of many
of the traits that are attributed to the Ar-
chaic tradition that deﬁnes the Lower
Pecos region. The Viejo subperiod occu-
pies the latter half of Bryant’s (1966)
Stockton stage, the ﬁve-thousand-year-
long trend to aridity that presumably
conditioned the adaptive strategies of
Lower Pecos people. In Black Cave, the
cultural deposits were completely scoured,
exposing Pleistocene eboulis (Turpin
1982, 76); at Seminole Sink, the shaft
leading to the subterranean chamber was
opened for the ﬁrst time (Turpin 1988,
68). These localized phenomena suggest
intermittent periods of erosional intensity
sometime prior to 6800 b.p., perhaps con-
nected to the onset of the drying trend
(Turpin 1991b, 28).

During the Viejo subperiod, the pref-
erence for rockshelter habitation emerged,
with sites such as Hinds Cave yielding
evidence of segmented space; that is, the
rockshelter has activity areas deﬁned by
interior burned rock middens, prickly
pear ﬂoors, latrines, and perishable items
(Lord 1984). Small shelters, such as the
Wroe Ranch site in Terrell County, were
occupied on an intermittent basis, proba-
bly by small foraging or collecting groups
who sought expedient housing (Turpin
1997b). Dietary information gained from
coprolite analysis implies an extremely
successful adaptation to an increasingly
arid environment (Williams Dean 1978),
presumably through a reliance on desert
succulents. Kenneth M. Brown (1991,
118) has summarized the evidence for the
introduction of sotol and agave (most
likely lechuguilla) into rockshelter de-
posits during the Early Archaic period.

region (Lundelius 1984). Bone beds of
equivalent age at Bonﬁre Shelter (Fig. 8.3)
undoubtedly represent the intermittent
slaughter and butchering of elephant,
camel, horse, and bison, but the absence
of stone tools weakens the case (Bement
1986; Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Al-
though the perspective afforded by these
two sites is perforce limited, and perhaps
biased, both are compatible with the
widely held concept of Paleoindian
peoples as big game hunters exploiting
the specialized environment of the termi-
nal Pleistocene.

Bonﬁre Subperiod (10,700 to 9800 B.P.)

More deﬁnitive is the massive accumu-

lation of now-extinct bison associated
with Folsom and Plainview dart points in
Bone Bed 2 at Bonﬁre Shelter (Dibble
and Lorrain 1968). On at least three oc-
casions, herds totaling an estimated 120
animals were driven over the cliff above
the shelter, tumbling into the interior,
where they were butchered and processed.
Radiocarbon dates conﬁrm an age range
centering on 10,000 b.p., concurrent
with a mesic period that Vaughn M.
Bryant, Jr. (1966), called the Medina
stage. The faunal and ﬂoral evidence is
corroborated by the ﬂood sequence at

Arenosa Shelter, near the mouth of the
Pecos River, where a series of ﬁne-grained
sedimentary layers also suggest that a hu-
mid interlude predated 9500 b.p. (Patton
and Dibble 1982).

Bone Bed 2 at Bonﬁre Shelter is the
oldest known example of the jump tech-
nique of killing herd animals, and this
presumably implies organizational skills
consistent with coordinated group hunt-
ing strategies. More importantly, the big
game hunting strategies and the charac-
teristic projectile point styles incorporate
the Lower Pecos into the Paleoindian
sphere as it was expressed across North
America just prior to the extinction of
many of these species.

Oriente Subperiod (9400 to 8800 B.P.)

Although commonly called the Late
Paleoindian period because of continuities
in lithic technology, the Oriente subpe-
riod sees the ﬁrst tentative beginnings of
the Archaic adaptation that was to be-
come the hallmark of the Lower Pecos re-
gion. LeRoy Johnson (1964) ﬁrst noticed
the mixture of Archaic and Paleoindian
cultural traits at Devils Mouth, where the
economy was not noticeably oriented to-
ward big game hunting. Broad resource
procurement was evidenced at Baker Cave

These same plants are the basis of the
Lower Pecos ﬁber industry and the source
of raw materials for clothing, matting,
basketry, sandals, and twine (Andrews
and Adovasio 1980; McGregor 1992;
Schuetz 1956, 1963). Commonalities
with the northern Mexican ﬁber assem-
blages, and continuity over time, led
James Adovasio (Andrews and Adovasio
1980) to postulate a Coahuilan origin or
afﬁliation for the Lower Pecos industry.
The most durable ﬁber artifacts, the san-
dals, illustrate the broad appeal of the
common plaited form throughout north-
ern Coahuila and the Lower Pecos, but
the techniques are mature enough to have
encouraged local and regional variations
by the middle of the Early Archaic period
(W. Taylor 1988; Turpin 1997b).

The projectile points considered char-
acteristic of this subperiod, although they
bear localized names such as Baker and
Bandy, are widespread throughout central
Texas, where they are known as Uvalde
and Martindale (E. Turner and Hester
1993). A number of other generic projec-
tile point types, called by descriptive terms
such as early barbed, early stemmed, and
early corner-notched, remain ambigu-
ously deﬁned. A regionally speciﬁc varia-
tion on the ubiquitous unstemmed tri-
angular tools of southern Texas and
northeastern Mexico, the Devils Trian-
gular dart point dates to about 6000 b.p.
during the transition between the Viejo
and Eagle Nest periods, reafﬁrming the
multiplicity of possible external relation-
ships during the Early Archaic (Turpin
and Bement 1992).

The one mortuary site of this age that

has been excavated (Turpin 1988) has
cultural analogs in Coahuila (Aveleyra
et al. 1964) and the karst regions of Texas
(Bement 1994). A skeletal population of
twenty-one individuals recovered from a
vertical shaft cave, Seminole Sink, indi-
cates that the people experienced only
temporary, perhaps seasonal, dietary stress
and little trauma (Marks et al. 1988).
However, dental pathologies were com-
mon and were accompanied by early
tooth loss that probably resulted from a
high intake of sugar and carbohydrates
(see also Hartnady 1988; Turpin et al.
1986).

The mixture of young and old, male

and female, in this one site hints at an
egalitarian society where all ages and both

genders were accorded the same treat-
ment after death. Apparently, the dead
were dropped or lowered through the
narrow vertical shaft at Seminole Sink,
a process that outwardly seems casual
but that in fact has great psychological
ramiﬁcations. The broad distribution of
this mortuary practice can be attributed
to both the physical convenience afforded
by a natural tomb and the emotional sat-
isfaction of returning the dead to the
earth in a symbolic reversal of parturition
(Turpin 1988).

Little else is known about the social
structure and world view of these Early
Archaic people. Two forms of portable art
that characterize the Archaic period as a
whole may have their beginnings at this
time: painted pebbles and unbaked or
poorly ﬁred clay ﬁgurines. Neither art
form is well dated, but pebbles painted
with simple geometric designs have been
recovered from Early Archaic deposits
(Turpin and Middleton 1998). A larger
inventory of painted pebbles has been
stylistically sequenced and placed within
an Archaic context that spans all the
Lower Pecos temporal subdivisions (Par-
sons 1986; see also Mock 1987). These
ﬂat, smooth river rocks are systematically
decorated with a limited number of mo-
tifs that often portray human attributes
(Mock 1987; Parsons 1986). In fact, the
pebble often reﬂects the organization of
the human body, with eyes in the upper,
narrower end and identiﬁable genitalia,
usually female, in the lower, wider end. It
has been suggested that the pebble served
as a substitute for real people in curing
and fertility rites or as personal, as op-
posed to public, ritual paraphernalia.

Clay ﬁgurines are less common, but
they too are miniature humans, with pro-
nounced female sexual characteristics, but
headless (Chandler et al. 1994; Shafer
1975b). They are even more poorly dated
than the painted pebbles, in part due to
their rarity and in part due to poor prove-
nience. They are only included here be-
cause they, like the painted pebbles, are
Archaic phenomena of ambiguous age.

Eagle Nest Subperiod (5500 to 4100 B.P.)
About 5500 b.p., the beginnings of an
insularity that reaches its peak in the sub-
sequent San Felipe subperiod are signaled
by the appearance of Pandale projectile
points, a distinctly beveled style with a

limited regional distribution. This shift in
lithic technology coincided with the cul-
mination of Bryant’s (1966) Stockton
stage in an extremely hot, dry interlude
he called the Ozona Erosional after dis-
conformities in strata at Arenosa Shelter
(Dibble 1967) and the Devils Mouth site
(L. Johnson 1964). At about the same
time, Black Cave suffered another massive
erosional event that ﬂushed the deposits,
leaving only a few remnants of former liv-
ing surfaces cemented to the walls (Turpin
1982, 76).

At Baker Cave, Kenneth Brown (1991,

123) observed a shift to the labor-inten-
sive processing of lechuguilla, sotol, and
yucca around 5000 b.p., resulting in what
he called an “economy of scale.” Brown
(1991, 123) suggested that considerable
energy was invested in food production as
a least-risk response to environmental de-
terioration. Implied in this characteriza-
tion are increased diet breadth, group
mobility, and community size. Phil Der-
ing (1999b) attributed small group size
and residential mobility in part to the
depletion of local food sources, which
forced relocation in search of untapped
resources.

San Felipe Subperiod (4100 to 3200 B.P.)

Signs of increasing regionalization dur-

ing the San Felipe subperiod include the
further reﬁnement of local projectile
point styles, such as Langtry, Val Verde,
and Arenosa dart points, and the emer-
gence of the ﬁrst and most complex of
four prehistoric pictograph styles, the
Pecos River style (Fig. 8.4). These monu-
mental polychrome pictographs rank
among the oldest yet most elaborate reli-
gious art forms in the New World (Kirk-
land and Newcomb 1967; Turpin 1994a,
1994c). W. W. Newcomb, Jr. (Kirkland
and Newcomb 1967) recognized that
the central characters were portrayals of
shamans, the religious practitioners of
hunting and gathering societies through-
out the world. Anthropomorphic ﬁgures
with animal characteristics such as feath-
ers, wings, claws, fur, and horns are
equipped with atlatls, darts, fending
sticks, and enigmatic pouches that hang
from their elbows. The mountain lion,
colloquially called panther, ﬁgures promi-
nently in the Pecos River style bestiary,
which also includes deer, birds, ﬁsh, and
fantastic insects.

people, whether on nomadic rounds or
following migratory routes. This impres-
sion is bolstered by the relative percent-
ages of the characteristic point styles in
shelter deposits. Jora (Taylor 1967) or
Arenosa (Bement 1991) dart points are
the dominant style in Coahuila at this
time, but they form only a minor compo-
nent of the Middle Archaic lithic assem-
blage at many sites in the Lower Pecos,
where they have often been considered a
variant of the Langtry type. Conversely,
the percentage of Langtry and Val Verde
specimens declines with distance from

the Rio Grande, although they are still
found in low frequency in the same
stratigraphic contexts as Jora points as far
south as the Encantada Valley (Zubieta
1999). Thus, regional preferences are ex-
pressed while adhering to the same tech-
nological template.

Regionalization and intensiﬁed ritual

activity are an unlikely correlate to in-
creased ﬂooding of the Pecos River (Pat-
ton and Dibble 1982), an environmental
phenomenon probably related to the de-
nudation of the landscape during this
hot, dry, climatic interval (Fig. 8.5). The

Fig. 8.5. Intermittent ﬂooding of the Pecos River left a detailed stratigraphic record at Arenosa
Shelter (41VV99), excavated prior to the ﬁlling of Amistad Reservoir.

At least three primary tenets of sha-
manism are expressed in the art: the power
of magical ﬂight (Turpin 1994a); the
ability to assume the form of an animal
familiar (Turpin 1994c); and the con-
cept of parallel supernatural and natural
worlds accessible through a central axis
(Turpin 1994a) or holes in the earth
(Turpin 1992a, 1992c). The size, com-
plexity, and accessibility of the paintings
indicate they were produced through
group effort for public consumption;
their consistency in theme and style dem-
onstrates that a uniﬁed belief system pre-
vailed over the entire Lower Pecos area as
currently deﬁned; and their redundancy
is evidence of their ritualistic mode of
production. Thomas N. Campbell (1988)
was the ﬁrst to suggest that the paintings
were the product of visionary experiences
induced by ingesting mescal beans (So-
phora secundiﬂora). This hypothesis has
recently been revived and expanded to in-
clude a number of hallucinogenic sub-
stances (Boyd 1998b). More importantly,
Newcomb was quick to recognize the
similarities to ethnohistorically docu-
mented medicine societies and their im-
plications for ranked social organization
within the overall hunting-gathering
framework.

Stylistic variations between the classic
paintings in the Rio Grande core area and
those on the southern periphery seem to
favor the diffusion of a religious ideal
rather than the actual movement of

272 / DESERT ARCHEOLOGY OF WESTERN TEXAS

number of archeological components at
sites (Marmaduke 1978b) and the relative
frequencies of projectile point styles in se-
lected rockshelters (Turpin 1990c, 1997b)
indicate two shifts in the settlement pat-
tern: increases in population density
along the rivers and in the number of up-
land sites presumably devoted to exploita-
tion of food resources.

Such a conjunction of events can be

simply explained as a result of people
adapting their economic and social strate-
gies to the desertiﬁcation of the natural
environment. As upland water sources
dwindled, the general population concen-
trated along the three major rivers, occu-
pying rockshelters and open camps where
their domestic debris accumulated rap-
idly. Desert succulents, the mainstay of
the diet, may well have increased at the
expense of grasses and trees, but the man-
ner in which they were obtained changed
from band foraging to task-oriented col-
lecting. Small groups spread out across
the landscape, gathering foodstuffs and
returning them to the home base, thus
increasing the number of upland work
stations and temporary camps. The de-
mand for more rigorous scheduling, the
division of labor, and the dispensation of
the proceeds placed a premium on orga-
nizational skills and processes, mandating
the institution of social controls that had
been previously unnecessary (Turpin
1990c).

Two useful models of the emergence
of social complexity may be applicable to
the Lower Pecos Middle Archaic. Robert
L. Carneiro (1967) recognized that cir-
cumscription, usually by hostile neigh-
bors or impassable natural barriers, was a
factor in the rise of complex societies. Ap-
plied to simpler societies, some forms of
circumscription would inhibit the normal
hunter-gatherer tendency to resolve fric-
tion by ﬁssion. During the Lower Pecos
Middle Archaic, the evaporation of up-
land water sources in effect acted as a cir-
cumscriptive force, creating a densely
populated linear enclave along the major
rivers and providing the impetus for so-
cial change. The forced concentration of
people was in many ways equivalent to
population growth in that it generated
conﬂict while mandating a different ap-
proach to dispute resolution.

Gregory A. Johnson (1982) suggested
that population density creates informa-

tion overload, or what he called scalar
stress, which can be managed by institut-
ing rudimentary, perhaps sequential, hier-
archies, such as the medicine societies of
the Great Plains that Newcomb (Kirk-
land and Newcomb 1967) invoked as a
possible analog for the social units that
produced the Pecos River style picto-
graphs. Such structural changes are often
reiﬁed by ritual performances, in this case
one that produced an art style character-
ized by repetition, redundancy, and eso-
teric knowledge. Thus, the increase in
population density, but not numbers of
people, presented social challenges that
were met by the institution of ritual com-
munication that was manifested in the
rock art.

An alternative to this model has been
presented by Dering (1999b), who, based
on his analysis of burned rock features,
proposed that the energy imbalance cre-
ated by processing labor-intensive, low-
yield plant foods affected group size and
mobility throughout most of the Archaic
period. Depletion of food and fuel sources
was cited as the factor that mandated mo-
bility, thus limiting the size of population
units. Although much useful information
is generated by the ecological approach to
Lower Pecos culture history, more sophis-
ticated models are needed to account for
the elaboration of ritual and the diversity
that is apparent in those aspects of culture
not determined by the environment
(Turpin 1990b).

Cibola Subperiod (3150 to 2300 B.P.)

The beginning of the Late Archaic pe-
riod, aptly named the Cibola subperiod,
is signaled by abrupt economic, techno-
logical, and site distribution changes that
in turn coincide with an apparent break
in the climatic trend toward aridity that
transpired some three thousand years ago.
The rapid spread of cultural traits that
demonstrate spatial continuities meets
Gordon R. Willey and Philip Phillips’s
(1958) deﬁnition of a horizon. In Bryant’s
(1966) original climatic reconstruction,
this interlude was called the Frio Interval
to recognize the resurgence of pollen
types typical of cooler, more mesic condi-
tions. The faunal evidence from Bonﬁre
Shelter is incontrovertible. The upper-
most bone bed produced the remains of
approximately eight hundred modern bi-
son, accompanied by broad-bladed dart

points usually considered to be central
Texas types and securely radiocarbon
dated to around twenty-six hundred years
ago (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Bison
bones have also been recovered in lesser
amounts at Eagle Cave, Castle Canyon,
Arenosa Shelter, and Skyline Shelter in
deposits of approximately the same age.
A tentative shift in settlement patterning
is suggested by the distribution of charac-
teristic projectile point styles such as
Marshall, Castroville, and Montell. Rela-
tive percentages of these styles decrease
in stratiﬁed rockshelters (Turpin 1989,
1997b) but increase at the Devils Mouth
site, an open terrace camp, a trend that is
consistent with expectations for an eco-
nomic strategy that centered on mobile
food sources.

David S. Dibble (Dibble and Lorrain
1968) provided both environmental and
cultural explanations for the archeological
and faunal evidence from Bonﬁre Shelter.
In his model, cooler, wetter climatic con-
ditions permitted the grasslands of the
Great Plains to recolonize the Lower
Pecos, bringing large herds of migratory
game animals and their attendant hunters
bearing their characteristic arms. Ethno-
graphic sources of much later date de-
scribe coordinated winter bison hunts
near the mouth of the Pecos and along
the Devils River (Turpin 1987b), so per-
haps the in-migrations of the Late Archaic
were seasonally scheduled events as well.
Based on the depiction of bison hunts

and atlatls in the miniature Red Linear
pictographs, I have tentatively correlated
the paintings to the Late Archaic intru-
sion of the bison hunters (Turpin 1984,
1990a). Using a much smaller sample of
pictographs, Newcomb (Kirkland and
Newcomb 1967) also attributed them to
the Archaic period, although David Geb-
hard (1965) thought they were more re-
cent (ca. a.d. 900 –1400) and perhaps
related to Kokopelli, the hump-backed
ﬂute player of the American Southwest.
The one experimental radiocarbon assay,
run on pigment samples from one of the
presumed bison painted at Cueva Que-
brada, produced a date of 1280 b.p. or
a.d. 670 (Ilger et al. 1994), placing it
within the closing centuries of the Late
Archaic period but well beyond the end
of the Cibola subperiod.

Other favored themes in this style
are processions of head-dressed warriors

1,850 years ago, reaching its peak popu-
larity about 2300 b.p. (Turpin 1991b).
The many rockshelter excavations north
of the Rio Grande have failed to ﬁx the
Shumla’s style in time, but radiocarbon
dates recently obtained from an open site
on the eastern periphery of the Lower
Pecos also are consistent with the postu-
lated age of ca. 2300 b.p. (Mehalchick
et al. 1999, 158). Bryant (1966) recog-
nized a return to aridity that he called the
Juno Interval, so presumably the Flanders
subperiod peoples were practitioners of
the ancient exploitation strategies that
characterized the Early and Middle Ar-
chaic periods. There can be little doubt
that people using Shumla dart points left
a substantial material record in many sites
stratigraphically above the Cibola de-
posits. North of the Rio Grande, how-
ever, the most proliﬁc sites have been the
most poorly excavated.

There has been a tendency to attribute

the earliest glyphs at the large open
bedrock petroglyph site, Lewis Canyon,
to the makers of Shumla points because
one of the designs resembles this dart
point style. Named the Serpentine style
for its sinuosity of line (Turpin and Bass
1997), the design repertoire is dominated
by atlatl motifs, conﬁrming their Archaic
attribution, but it is not clear that the
projectile point is in fact a replica of the
Shumla type. The most interesting com-
position at Lewis Canyon is a pair of bear
prints that ﬂank a tabbed line and are en-
circled by atlatls of differing conﬁguration
(Fig. 8.7). A disproportionate emphasis
on bannerstones or atlatl weights indi-
cates that the weapons, and by extension,
their portraiture, were of more than prac-
tical importance. This depiction is one of
the few of bears in any Lower Pecos art
style, although bears are still common in
the Serranías del Burro on the southern
fringes of the region. Tabbed lines appear
in both pictographs and petroglyphs in
far southern Coahuila. Only one other
petroglyph in the Serpentine style has
been recorded anywhere near the Lower
Pecos, and that is far to the west near
Rankin, Texas (Turpin 1993; Turpin and
Bass 1997), but so little survey has been
done on the southern margins of the Rio
Grande that conclusions based on the
presumption of absence are premature.
Although the lines of evidence are ex-
tremely weak, a reasonable hypothesis is

Canyon State Historical Park. Processions of headdressed warriors are a key characteristic of

sometimes apparently involved in conﬂict
with other males (Fig. 8.6), and deer
hunting scenes that incorporate geometric
designs that may imply traps or nets. Sev-
eral secluded sites are devoted to scenes of
sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and birth,
perhaps hinting that the paintings were
part of puberty rites that prepared the ini-
tiates for adult life. The Red Linear artists
were capable of endowing these tiny
crude stick ﬁgures with animation and
vivacity not found in any of the other
Lower Pecos pictograph styles. This artis-
tic skill and the consistency in theme,
style, and minor details, displayed from
the Devils River to the Rio Grande west
of the Pecos, suggest that the conventions
were developed in another more mobile
medium and brought into the Lower
Pecos in fully developed form. Whether
that introduction coincided with the
demonstrated movement of people off the
Plains in Cibola times remains hypotheti-

cal. To date, however, all of the recorded
Red Linear sites are in the heartland of
the Lower Pecos and none have been re-
ported south of the Rio Grande.

Although little research attention has
been devoted to the issue, the changes in
resource distribution and the inﬂux of
new people must have had a fragmenting
effect on the resident population whether
they coexisted, migrated, or were ab-
sorbed. When the grasslands retreated,
the vacuum was ﬁlled by desert-adapted
people, apparently with afﬁliations to
northern Mexican groups.

Flanders Subperiod (ca. 2300 B.P.)

The Flanders subperiod of the Late
Archaic is the most elusive time period in
the regional chronology for the Lower
Pecos. The hallmark of the period, the
Shumla dart point style, has antecedents
in Nuevo León and Coahuila, where it is
found in deposits dating from 3,100 to

has led to the speculation that there was
an escalating reliance on desert plants.
Based on the several preserved ﬁber fea-
tures at the Wroe Ranch site, small shelter
occupancy appears to have intensiﬁed and
emphasized the procurement and process-
ing of vegetal material. A higher recovery
of ﬁsh bones and scales in some shelter
deposits also suggests the exploitation of
previously less important food sources,
but at other sites, such as Skyline Shelter,
riverine resources were always a signiﬁcant
component of the diet. The composite
picture mirrors that suggested by Ken-
neth Brown (1991) for the Middle Ar-
chaic period: a broad resource procure-
ment strategy characterized by increased
mobility, diversiﬁed diet, and the ex-
ploitation of a wide range of environmen-
tal niches, probably on a seasonal basis.

Late Prehistoric Period

Flecha Subperiod (1320 to 450 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric period is marked

by changes in artifact types, site types,
settlement patterns, exploitation strate-
gies, rock art styles, and mortuary cus-
toms. The temptation to credit these in-
novations to an inﬂux of a singular people
is dampened by the lack of stratiﬁed or
well-dated single component sites that
might coordinate or sequence these events.
Sometime between a.d. 600 and 900,

the bow and arrow were adopted in the
Lower Pecos region, signaling the advent
of the Flecha subperiod (Turpin 1991b,
table 1.12). Unfortunately, the upper lev-
els of most rockshelters are highly dis-
turbed, so it is difﬁcult to distinguish
components based solely on arrow point
styles (none of which is unique to the
Lower Pecos region) and/or to relate radio-
carbon dates to speciﬁc artifact types.

Although the Late Prehistoric people
continued to take advantage of the natu-
ral shelter offered by caves and overhangs,
they apparently began processing desert
succulents in a manner that left a distinc-
tive feature on open sites. Ring middens
— crescentic accumulations of burned
rock— consistently date to the Late Pre-
historic period, although some caution is
introduced by the mixture of projectile
point styles on these open sites and the
common sense recognition that charcoal
is less likely to survive in older features.
Kenneth Brown (1991, 127) suggests that
pit-baking ovens were relocated, being

Fig. 8.7. The bear tracks petroglyph at Lewis Canyon showing the serpentine lines for which
the style was named. The bear walks erect on two feet, human-like. The tabbed line is a motif
found in southern Coahuila, and its meaning is uncertain. The swirl of atlatls illustrates some
of the variations on the ways that bannerstones are depicted.

that northern Mexican people were able
to expand into the Lower Pecos region
once environmental conditions stabilized
to their liking. Little more can be said
until excavations concentrate on deposits
of this age.

Blue Hills Subperiod (2300 to 1300 B.P.)

Compared to the regional insularity of

the Middle Archaic period and the dis-
tinctive spread of the Cibola horizon, the
Blue Hills subperiod is diffuse. The char-
acteristic projectile points, primarily En-
sor and Frio, are shared across broad ex-
panses of Texas (see Prewitt 1995). The
ﬁber industry becomes somewhat more
elaborate by the appearance of more or-
nate painted mats as part of a mortuary
complex that is dominated by bundled
burials. Although some evidence suggests
that bundled burials are a generalized Ar-
chaic trait, most of the datable examples
are of Blue Hills age (Turpin et al. 1986).
Flexed corpses, sometimes lashed into a
fetal position, were wrapped in mats and
tied into a compact package that was then
interred in dry rockshelter deposits. Oc-
casionally, cremated remains are buried in
pouches or bags, but no gender or age cri-
teria seem to dictate any special method
of mortuary treatment. Ornaments and
items of clothing are sometimes preserved
in the dry rockshelter graves, and, on rare

occasions, tissue, skin, hair, and ﬂesh are
naturally mummiﬁed (Huebner 1995;
Turpin et al. 1986). Contrary to expecta-
tions voiced by a number of anthropolo-
gists, infants were apparently accorded
special treatment, their tiny bodies
wrapped in rabbitskin robes, deerskins,
and mats and placed on grass beds, often
with their broken cradle boards. Other-
wise, grave goods are relatively rare and
usually consist of items used by the de-
ceased in everyday life, such as clothing
or personal jewelry. On occasion, an indi-
vidual may be buried with an abundance
of mortuary offerings, but overall the im-
pression is one of an egalitarian approach
to death without gender or age discrimi-
nation beyond that accorded to infants.
Based on a single experimental radio-
carbon date (Ilger et al. 1994), it is pos-
sible that the Red Linear pictographs,
described in a preceding section, are at-
tributable to Blue Hills artists. A response
to the cyclical return to aridity may be
mirrored in yet another peak in the num-
ber of components at archeological sites
(Marmaduke 1978a) and in the projectile
point frequencies (Turpin 1990b) attrib-
utable to this period. The number of up-
land sites bearing Late Archaic points
coupled with an increase in the propor-
tionate number of unifaces, usually con-
sidered vegetal material processing tools,

LOWER PECOS RIVER REGION / 275

moved from rockshelters to open sites sit-
uated near stands of plants and ﬁrewood,
where a temporary surplus of foods could
be produced.

The technological and economic
changes are accompanied by the intro-
duction of foreign burial customs and
fully developed art styles. Although inter-
ments in rockshelter deposits continue,
the practice of bundling may have fallen
into disuse over time (Turpin 1991b, 35).
Two mummies exhumed from small shel-
ters by relic hunters date to this period;
the earlier, an adult male buried about
1,150 years ago, was accorded the typi-
cal Archaic mortuary treatment: ﬂexed,
wrapped in mats, and tied into a package
with a long human hair rope (Turpin
et al. 1986). Analysis of the preserved in-
testinal contents showed that this individ-
ual had consumed a most eclectic diet
during his last days, including such items
as ﬂedgling birds, minnows, mice, go-
phers, and snakes, but the bulk was pre-
dominantly grasshopper parts. Despite
the fact that the deceased had suffered
from severe dental abscesses that would
have prohibited his chewing his food, the
components of the desiccated bolus were
well macerated, indicating that someone
processed his last meals for him. Care is
also expressed in the more recent burial,
a prepubescent child who was laid, ﬂexed,
in a rockshelter grave outlined by sotol
stalks, cushioned by a grass and prickly
pear bed, and covered with an antelope
skin robe some 600 years ago. Through
analysis of the mummiﬁed tissue, Hueb-
ner (1995) was able to demonstrate that
the child suffered from severe malnutri-
tion, verging on starvation, which could
also account for some developmental

anomalies apparent in the skeletal mate-
rial. The death of this child is a reminder
that successful adaptation is a long-term
process that tends to mask the impact of
short-term stress and individual mortality.
A more drastic change in mortuary
customs is evidenced by the appearance
of cairn burials, oblong piles of rocks usu-
ally built on high promontories or points
overlooking the canyons. Similar features
are much more common north and west
of the Lower Pecos, where their function
has been conﬁrmed by excavation. In the
Lower Pecos, only one cairn has been ex-
cavated (Turpin 1982); it produced two
dart points and two arrow points, mirror-
ing the overlap of the two artifact forms
so often seen in rockshelter deposits. No
skeletal material was recovered, but the
purposeful construction methods, the ar-
tifacts, and high phosphate levels in the
interior matrix are consistent with the
prevailing interpretation of these features
as grave markers. The presumed recent
age of these features is substantiated by
their codistribution with tipi rings, a
house style clearly attributable to the
Inﬁerno phase (see below).

The latest mortuary practice docu-
mented by radiocarbon dates is cremation
and disposal in a vertical shaft cave. The
incinerated remains of an adult male were
gathered into a pouch and dropped down
the shaft at Seminole Sink, where they lay
atop the talus cone for some four hundred
years (Turpin 1988). Technically, this
event falls within the Inﬁerno phase time
frame, but there is no evidence to link the
two beyond age.

The case for the migration of new
people into the Lower Pecos is furthered
by the appearance of two fully developed

pictograph styles—both shared with
western and southern desert areas—and a
different set of petroglyph motifs related
to a series of sites that extend northwest
across the Eldorado Divide (Turpin 1993;
Turpin and Bass 1997). All are dated to
the Late Prehistoric period by stylistic cri-
teria; one experimental radiocarbon date
narrows the time frame of one style, the
Red Monochrome, to about a.d. 800.

The Red Monochrome style (Fig. 8.8)
consists of frontally posed, static, life-size
human ﬁgures and realistic animals—
such as dogs, turkeys, catﬁsh, deer, moun-
tain lions, rabbits, and turtles—painted,
as the name suggests, in red pigment
(Turpin 1986a). A variation on the hu-
man ﬁgure is nicknamed “lizard man” for
the bent knees and elbows. A most curi-
ous attribute is the common depiction of
protuberances or “buns” on the side of
the head. Single feather headdresses are
common. Presumably female ﬁgures wear
long skirts, but the males are often naked
with pronounced genitalia. Some are
armed with bows; others are impaled by
arrows—an emphasis on conﬂict that
carries over into Historic period picto-
graphs that show clear antecedents in the
Red Monochrome style (41VV205, Mis-
sionary Shelter [Turpin 1987c, 1989,
ﬁg. 18-5]).

The two largest panels in this style
line the walls of low-lying shelters, above
standing pools of water, leading Kirkland
(Kirkland and Newcomb 1967) to name
it the Flooded Shelter style. The larger in-
ventory of smaller sites known to date
shows a clear preference for isolated, of-
ten high shallow overhangs with little or
no cultural debris, as though the artists
were avoiding the long-occupied shelters

with their ornate Pecos River style paint-
ings. Most of the Red Monochrome sites
are near the mouth of the Pecos River,
but some examples are found on the Dev-
ils River, as far north as the mouth of the
Dry Devils. The only example yet re-
corded in Mexico was in Parida Canyon,
across from the mouth of the Pecos, and
it is now inundated by Amistad Reservoir.
Several Red Monochrome sites, in-
cluding at least one painted in black pig-
ment, have been reported in the Big Bend
area. Miriam Lowrance (1982) attributed
them to Jumano artists, citing ethnohis-
toric descriptions of clothing and hair-
styles that could be artistically rendered
as “buns.” The Jumanos, and their allies,
the Cibolos, were placed along the Rio
Grande, from La Junta to south of mod-
ern-day Del Rio, by seventeenth-century
Spanish chroniclers, so Lowrance’s (1982)
hypothesis is not without merit.

Another intrusive art style, Bold Line
Geometrics, is less securely dated to the
Late Prehistoric period because its ab-
stract iconography provides few temporal
clues (Turpin 1986b). Design motifs are
variations on straight lines and blank
spaces that are combined into nested zig-
zags, herringbones, cross-hatches, and
blanket patterns (Fig. 8.9a, b). In the last,
diamond-shaped cells are linked, forming
a spider web design that uses blank space
as a design element. Many of the geomet-
ric pictographs are associated in some way
with water, painted surrounding seeps in
the shelter walls or, in the case of Parida
Cave, above interior springs. Again, most
of the sites are found near the mouth of
the Pecos River, with a few aberrant ex-
amples recorded on the Devils River and
Red Bluff Creek. The Bold Line Geomet-
rics are most clearly afﬁliated with the ge-
neric Desert Abstract styles of northern
Mexico (Turpin et al. 1998) and the
American Southwest (Schaafsma 1992),
perhaps identifying one source of the in-
trusive traits of the Lower Pecos Late Pre-
historic period. However, abstract rock
art is ubiquitous worldwide and is more
indicative of commonality in thought and
response to speciﬁc stimuli than contact
or diffusion.

Although petroglyphs are rare in the
Lower Pecos, the largest and most famous
site, Lewis Canyon, also shows an icono-
graphic shift from curvilinear designs as-
sociated with free-ﬂoating atlatls to ab-

stract geometrics (Turpin and Bass 1997),
dominated by what Newcomb (Kirkland
and Newcomb 1967) called the line-and-
circle motif. Although difﬁcult to date,
one of the later petroglyphs appears to be
an arrow point, suggesting a Flecha pe-
riod age. A series of similar but smaller
petroglyph sites are found north of Lewis
Canyon, on the Eldorado Divide, but
geometric petroglyphs are also one of the
most common artistic expressions in
northern Mexico, as well as the rest of
the world.

Inﬁerno Phase (Estimated 450 to 250 B.P.)
The Inﬁerno phase inventory consists
of less than a score of sites characterized
by circles of paired stones that were pre-
sumably pole supports for brush- or hide-
covered structures (Fig. 8.10) and by a
tool kit that is dominated by four artifact
types: small triangular stemmed arrow
points, steeply beveled end scrapers (Be-
ment and Turpin 1987), four-beveled
knives, and plain ceramics (Turpin and
Robinson 1998). The type site, Inﬁerno
Camp, contains more than one hundred

that meets Willey and Phillips’s (1958)
criteria for phases. It is spatially and tem-
porally limited, and its tool kit and site
features clearly distinguish it from generic
Late Prehistoric assemblages, although
some overlap with the better known Toyah
Complex seen in central and south Texas
has been suggested (Mehalchick et al.
1999; see M. Collins, chapter 3; Hester,
chapter 4; and Ricklis, chapter 5, all in
this volume).

Historic Period
(350 B.P. to Present)

Technically, the Historic period began
in the Lower Pecos region in 1590 when
Gaspar Castaño de Sosa, then lieutenant
governor in Nuevo León, and a contin-
gent of some 160 to 170 souls crossed the
Rio Grande, somewhere near Ciudad
Acuña, en route from Villa Almadén
(Monclova) to the Pecos Pueblo (Ham-
mond and Rey 1966; Schroeder and Mat-
son 1965). Undoubtedly, however, the
native people had already experienced the
repercussions of the Spanish movement
north, if only through the ripple effect as
indigenous northern Mexican groups mi-
grated to avoid slavery and disease (Hack-
ett 1926, 1931; Steck 1932). Castaño,
like the many Spaniards that followed,
found little but hardship in the Lower
Pecos region. Expeditions sent to explore
the Rio Grande as a prelude to settlement
and the establishment of viable trade
routes brought back such discouraging
reports (Bolton 1908; Castañeda 1938,
1946; Daniel 1955; Weddle 1968) that
colonizing missions were abandoned, and
forays across the river often became largely
military maneuvers in retaliation for raids
on communities in Coahuila and Nueva
Vizcaya (Bolton 1915; Weddle 1968).

The closest the Spanish ever came to

establishing a physical presence in the
Lower Pecos region was an abortive at-
tempt to found a presidio, Sacramento,
on the San Diego River south of Ciudad
Acuña in 1737. Prior to its completion,
the presidio was removed to the Santa
Rosa valley, near modern-day Múzquiz.
Returned to the San Diego in 1773, the
presidio, renamed Agua Verde, lasted
only eight years before the troops were re-
moved to San Fernando de Austria (Zara-
goza) in 1781 (Moorhead 1975, 226). An
abortive attempt to recolonize Agua Verde

rings; the lesser sites have as few as one
and as many as eight stone rings. In one
locale, a single ring sits beside eight ob-
long cairns, presumably burial mounds,
indicating their contemporaneity. The
Inﬁerno people exhibited a distinct pref-
erence for high promontories, usually
overlooking springs or semipermanent
water holes. These locations are usually
reduced to bedrock, so the chances of re-
covering stratiﬁed or datable materials are
greatly reduced.

Only one tipi ring has been excavated
(Turpin and Bement 1989), and it pro-
duced no materials suitable for radiocar-
bon dating. The site was selected because
it overlooked an early Plains Indian rock
art site that presumably dated to about
1700. Among the surface artifacts whose
ages spanned the entire spectrum of
Lower Pecos prehistory were a plainware
sherd and a Guerrero arrow point, both
indicative of Protohistoric or early His-
toric occupation. It is important to note
that not one of the Inﬁerno phase single
component sites has yielded a single
European-derived historic artifact.

The rare ceramic sherds collected from
Inﬁerno phase sites are poorly ﬁred bone-
and calcite-tempered plainwares of uncer-
tain origin (Turpin and Robinson 1998).
A Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric age was
predicated on the resemblance to sherds

of native pottery recorded at the Apache
mission of San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz,
abandoned in 1771 (Tunnell and New-
comb 1969). One sherd of dubious afﬁli-
ation was recovered from the Sotol site in
Crockett County from a stratum that
dated to the range between 460 and 340
years ago (Lorrain 1968), the only radio-
carbon date even remotely attributable to
Inﬁerno phase materials. Afﬁnities with
bone-tempered ceramics from the eastern
periphery of the Lower Pecos region sug-
gest that the Inﬁerno phase is somehow
related to the earlier Toyah complex of
central and south Texas (Mehalchick
et al. 1999).

The Inﬁerno people clearly came into
the Lower Pecos region late in the prehis-
toric era. Seventeenth-century Spanish
documents describe native northern Mex-
ican people traveling en masse to the
mouth of the Pecos River for annual bi-
son hunts, perhaps recording a cyclical
round that predates European contact.
Ethnohistoric references to bison hunting
in and around the region suggest that the
Lower Pecos was again part of the great
sea of grass that characterized the Ameri-
can frontier (Turpin 1987b), reverting to
semidesert only after the introduction of
livestock in the late 1880s.

The Inﬁerno phase is the only archeo-

logical unit in the Lower Pecos region

can presence along the Rio Grande. Co-
manches and Kiowas annually rode south
to raid the settled communities of north-
ern Mexico, causing the Mexican govern-
ment to complain bitterly to Washington.
Kickapoos carried on their undeclared
war against Texans from their secure base
in the mountains near Santa Rosa (Múz-
quiz) until 1874, when U.S. troops ille-
gally raided their villages in a clear case of
boundary transgression. Driven from the
American side, renegade Apaches took
refuge in the vast arid reaches of the Bol-
són de Mapimí, south of the Big Bend,
where they were pursued by Mexican
troops as late as 1881.

The completion of the southern trans-

continental railroad in 1882 opened the
Lower Pecos to markets in the East and
West. Small towns sprang up around de-
pots at sites that later gave their names
to projectile point styles: Langtry and
Shumla. Pioneer ranchers with their
herds of sheep and cattle colonized the
marginal rangeland and forever changed
the face of the countryside. The very fact
that substantial herds of cattle found
sufﬁcient graze agrees with the ethno-
historic record of bison hunting in, and
south of, the Lower Pecos region, suggest-
ing that the great sea of grass that charac-

terized the American frontier once again
extended to and below the Rio Grande
(Turpin 1987b). The modern environ-
ment is a product of historic land use ex-
acerbated by natural phenomena, such as
the famous droughts of the 1950s and the
ﬂoods of 1954 and 1974.

Historic Period Archeology

The historic Native American period is

represented archeologically by one rock-
shelter, reported in the 1940s (Kirkland
1942), a few scattered metal arrow points,
and seventeen rock art sites that incorpo-
rate Euro-American elements (Fig. 8.11)
or bear strong afﬁnities to deﬁned Plains
Indian styles (Labadie 1997; Turpin
1989; Turpin and Davis 1993). Tipi
rings found adjacent to some of the his-
toric pictographs may represent the living
sites of the artists, but proof awaits the re-
covery of more temporally diagnostic ar-
tifacts and radiocarbon assays (Turpin
and Bement 1989). An internal chronol-
ogy signaled by theme, style, and icono-
graphic details sequences the paintings
and elucidates a trend from initial curios-
ity to bitter enmity between Native
Americans and Euro-Americans (Turpin
1989). A change in site distributional pat-

the presidio relapsed into ruins.

After their ﬁrst experiences with the
arid mountainous reaches of northern
Mexico, including the Lower Pecos re-
gion, the Spanish movement north bifur-
cated, heading east through the gateway
mission of San Juan Bautista and west
through La Junta, the conﬂuence of the
Mexican Conchos River and the Rio
Grande. The vast intervening area be-
came known as the despoblado, or unpop-
ulated zone (Daniel 1955), despite the
fact that it sheltered refugee and renegade
native populations for three centuries.
Spanish government and military reports
provide an inventory of native people
(Bolton 1908; Griffen 1969; Hackett
1926) and chronicle the immense changes
that took place as population movements
quickened and warfare intensiﬁed. In the
late seventeenth century, the Jumanos
and Cibolos are often mentioned as allies
of the Spanish in the general area of the
Lower Pecos. By 1729, indigenous people
and intrusive northern Mexico groups
alike were overrun by the Apaches, who
were reportedly in complete control of
the Rio Grande (Weddle 1968, 200).
Their supremacy was short lived, for the
Comanches and their allies, the Kiowas,
came down out of the north, forcing the
Apaches into political and military limbo
in the mountains of northern Mexico. By
the turn of the century, beset by revolu-
tion and engaged in wars on both conti-
nents, the Spanish empire was forced to
abandon its frontier, leaving its colonial
population undefended.

With the coming of Anglo-American

sovereignty in the middle of the nine-
teenth century, linking east and west be-
came a priority that depended upon the
extermination of the Plains Indians that
controlled much of the desert west. Map-
ping expeditions were followed by stage
and mail routes, trade caravans, freighters,
cattle drovers, and mineral exploration
(Turpin 1989). Fort Clark was established
in 1852, squarely athwart one of the
well-traveled Comanche traces. In 1857,
Camp Hudson was built to protect a ford
of the Devils River that later came to be
called Bakers Crossing for one of the
early settlers. After a hiatus imposed by
the Civil War, the U.S. military resumed
its attempt to eradicate the Native Ameri-

terns, shifting from deeply entrenched
canyons to open areas near accessible wa-
ter sources, can be attributed to the de-
mands of horse husbandry. The overall
scarcity of sites is the legacy of a period
of social unrest wherein mobility often
meant survival.

The historic Euro-American period
has attracted little scholarly attention.
The city of Del Rio has fared somewhat
better than the countryside, given the
pace of development (Dering 1998; Me-
halchick et al. 1999), although rumors
that a Spanish mission had been estab-
lished at San Felipe persist despite all evi-
dence to the contrary. The construction
of the Southern Paciﬁc Railroad left an
archeological trail that includes aban-
doned tracks and tunnels, depots, graves,
and work camps with domestic, commer-
cial, and industrial features (Briggs 1974;
Turpin 1995). The ranching era is poorly
represented by site survey data that record
rockshelter habitations (Turpin 1987a)
and a few early ranch headquarters (Tur-
pin 1990d).

Summary

The cultural trajectory of Lower Pecos
prehistory originates in stereotypic Paleo-
indian big game hunters who apparently
entered the region some twelve thousand
to fourteen thousand years ago. Based on
the two known sites of this age, the econ-
omy was oriented toward the procure-
ment of megafauna such as elephants,
camels, horses, and bison, although the
earliest kills were probably individuals or
pairs of animals that were trapped and
slain (Bement 1986). The later Folsom
and Plainview hunters had apparently
perfected the jump technique of bison
hunting, suggesting organizational skills
consistent with group procurement
strategies that centered upon migratory
herd animals (Dibble 1970).

The extinction of the large game herds

and the onset of a trend toward aridity
triggered a transition to Archaic lifeways
about ninety-four hundred years ago. The
people apparently exploited a broader re-
source base, developing a reliance on
plant products, both as food and as raw
material for the burgeoning ﬁber indus-
try, while retaining established lithic tra-
ditions. The transition culminated in a

robust adaptation that gives the outward
but perhaps misleading impression of
great stability for a period of some four
thousand years. Rockshelters became the
nucleus of the settlement pattern, show-
ing differentiated activity areas of a do-
mestic nature where ﬁber, wood, bone,
and hide were worked, as was the ever-
present stone. Mortuary customs included
disposal of the dead in convenient vertical
shaft caves regardless of age or gender.
Then, about ﬁfty-ﬁve hundred years
ago, the cultural system began a series of
internal adjustments, presumably in re-
sponse to an increasingly arid environ-
ment. The end result was the consolida-
tion of traits into the full-blown Archaic
expression that deﬁnes the Lower Pecos as
a distinct cultural entity. A model that
parsimoniously explains this development
was formulated by analogy to emerging
complex societies documented ethnohis-
torically and archeologically in arid lands
around the world.

In this model, changes in the distribu-

tion of essential resources, most promi-
nently potable water, triggered responses
in the settlement pattern and procurement
strategies leading to a disproportionate
concentration of people along the major
rivers. Aridity does not imply a shortage
of food, especially if desert succulents in-
crease at the expense of grasslands, but
gathering and processing of thorny plant
foods and small mammals requires spe-
cialized techniques and knowledge. The
responsibility for food procurement, es-
pecially hunting and gathering in the up-
lands, would have been delegated to mo-
bile task groups who operated from their
bases on the rivers. Diversiﬁcation broad-
ened the diet to include labor-intensive
processing of a wider range of foodstuffs,
activities that took place in open camps
and rockshelters as well.

New methods of social control were
mandated by the redistribution of human
populations, who were in effect circum-
scribed by the availability of water. The
inevitable tensions introduced by proxim-
ity elicited a restructuring of society that
was accompanied by the intensiﬁcation of
ritual that was, in turn, manifested by the
ﬂorescence of publicly produced mural
art. A common belief system, rooted in
the principles of shamanism and expressed
in cave paintings, held sway over the area

that is now deﬁned as the Lower Pecos
cultural region. This period of time is the
apogee of the Lower Pecos cultural trajec-
tory: the consolidation of an ethnic iden-
tity that trembled on the verge of societal
complexity that was never achieved, pos-
sibly for lack of the ability to generate an
adequate surplus— the necessary and
sufﬁcient condition for sedentism.

Sometime around three thousand
years ago, the insular Lower Pecos cul-
tural persona relaxed, perhaps disrupted
by the advent of new people with a differ-
ent economic strategy and social struc-
ture. A mesic interlude permitted the
grasslands of the Great Plains to expand
to the Rio Grande, drawing herds of bi-
son and their attendant hunters. Even
episodic, perhaps seasonal, inﬂuxes of
people bearing a fully developed cultural
system of their own must have had a per-
ceptible effect on the resident population;
at present it can only be discerned in
settlement patterns, tool types, and pos-
sibly art styles.

The return to aridity and the retreat of
the grasslands created a vacuum ﬁlled by
desert-adapted people who came north
across the Rio Grande from northern
Mexico. Soon, the archeology of the
Lower Pecos found afﬁnities with that of
central Texas, sharing in the generalized
Late Archaic lithic assemblage while per-
fecting its ﬁber industry, retaining its
characteristic burial customs, and keeping
a balance between rockshelters and open
camp site occupations. Measures of popu-
lation density again rise, reaching and ex-
ceeding the heights achieved during the
Middle Archaic peak, but the processes
behind the increase are less clear.

The Late Prehistoric period experi-

enced a cultural upheaval, including
changes in settlement patterns, site types,
mortuary customs, art styles, and artifact
types. Pictograph styles show afﬁnities
with northern Mexico and the Big Bend
region of Texas, lithic tool types are shared
with the rest of Texas, and mortuary cus-
toms appear to be introduced from the
north and northwest. Clearly, people,
rather than ideas, were on the move.

Late in prehistory, one intrusive group

is identiﬁed by a distinctive artifact as-
semblage, including small arrow points
and ceramics, a preference for promonto-
ries with sweeping views, and residences

that used paired stones as pole supports
for a thatch or hide cover. The people of
the Inﬁerno phase may be precursors to
ethnohistorically described bison hunters
who again seasonally congregated at the
mouth of the Pecos River during yet an-
other mesic interlude.

The Spanish found little of value in

the Lower Pecos, isolating it as part of the
great uninhabitable desert of their north-
ern frontier, but native peoples found
refuge in the rugged terrain. Indigenous
groups were soon replaced by Apaches
who, in turn, were driven south by the
Comanches where they sometimes joined
the Kickapoos, staunch allies of the Mexi-

cans, in resisting their common enemy.
Under American hegemony, a concerted
effort to clear the way west resulted in the
extirpation of native people by the time
the second transcontinental railroad was
completed in 1882.

Archeology and Late Quaternary Environments
of the Southern High Plains

Eileen Johnson and Vance T. Holliday

The Southern High Plains of northwest-
ern Texas and eastern New Mexico
(Fig. 9.1) contains a rich record of human
occupation and sedimentation spanning
the past 11,500 years. The sediments,
along with soils and paleontological and
paleobotanical remains contained within
them, provide evidence of the environ-
mental history of the region. Numerous
prehistoric sites are situated throughout
the Southern High Plains, including
some of the best-known Paleoindian sites
in North America. Most archeological
sites are single-occupation localities or
surface occurrences. Several multiple-
occupation sites with good stratigraphic
context have been investigated to varying
degrees. Early investigators (e.g., Cotter
1937; E. Howard 1935; Sellards 1952;
Wendorf 1961; Wendorf and Hester 1975)
focused on the stratigraphy, depositional
environments, and paleoenvironments
of deposits older than about 8000 b.p.
(Paleoindian age), although these sites
generally also contained younger strata
and archeological remains. These sites in-
clude: Lubbock Lake (E. Johnson 1987c),
Clovis (Blackwater Draw Locality #1)
( J. Hester 1972), San Jon (Roberts 1942),
Plainview (Sellards et al. 1947), Marks
Beach (Honea 1980), and Lake Theo
(Harrison and Killen 1978) (see Fig. 9.1).
Among these sites that have long been
of interest to archeologists, Lubbock Lake
has undergone the most scrutiny. With
excavations covering its lengthy Late

Quaternary record, Lubbock Lake has
produced the most complete site-speciﬁc
Late Quaternary archeological and envi-
ronmental data base in the region. Geo-
archeological work over the past 25 years
(Holliday l985a; 1993, 1995a; Holliday
and Allen 1987; Stafford 1981) has pro-
duced a well-dated stratigraphic record
covering the last 11,500 years. This strati-
graphic record is complemented by de-
tailed cultural and zooarcheological rec-
ords for the same time period (E. Johnson
1987c, 1993a, 1995a, 1995b; E. Johnson
and Holliday 1989). The Lubbock Lake
records, in conjunction with data from
the other sites, form the data base for
modeling the regional culture history and
its relationship to paleoenvironmental
change.

This chapter reviews the results of in-
vestigations into the stratigraphy and cul-
tural history of the Southern High Plains,
with supplementary data from other
Southern Plains sites immediately adja-
cent to the region. The time period cov-
ered is the Late Quaternary, from the lat-
est Pleistocene through the Holocene, and
this interval encompasses ﬁve major cul-
tural periods. Paleontological and geosci-
entiﬁc research that began at Lubbock
Lake has expanded to encompass the
entire region (Holliday 1985b, 1985c,
1989b, 1995c, 1995d, 1997a, 1997b;
Holliday et al. 1996; E. Johnson 1986a,
1986b, 1989a, 1991, 1994a; E. Johnson
and Shipman 1986, 1993; E. Johnson

et al. 1982, 1986, 1987). The Late Qua-
ternary paleoenvironments, therefore, are
reconstructed from a regional data base
with details from site-speciﬁc records.

Regional Setting

The Southern High Plains (or Llano
Estacado) is an extensive plateau covering
about 120,000 km2 and bounded by es-
carpments on the east, north, and west.
The southern portion of the High Plains
surface grades into the Edwards Plateau
(see Fig. 9.1). The region has a virtually
featureless, constructional surface formed
by deposition of thick, widespread eolian
sediments (Blackwater Draw Formation)
during the Pleistocene (Holliday 1989c,
1990; Reeves 1976). These sediments rest
on eolian and alluvial deposits of the
Ogallala Formation (Miocene-Pliocene)
and locally on Pliocene and Pleistocene
lacustrine sediments (Caran 1991; Haw-
ley et al. 1976; Reeves 1972).

Slight topographic relief on the High

Plains surface is provided by small lake
basins, dunes, and dry valleys (Hawley
et al. 1976; Holliday 1985b, 1995c,
1995d, 1997b; Holliday et al. 1996;
Reeves 1972; Sabin and Holliday 1995;
Wendorf and Hester 1975). About
twenty-ﬁve thousand small (less than
5 km2) depressions dot the landscape and
contain seasonal lakes or playas. About
forty larger (tens of km2) basins, known
as salinas, are interspersed throughout the

Haragan 1983; Lotspeich and Everhart
1962).

The historic vegetation of the South-
ern High Plains is a mixed-prairie grass-
land, and the dominant native plant
community is shortgrass (Blair 1950;
Lotspeich and Everhart 1962). Trees are
absent except along the escarpments and
reentrant canyons. Native plant com-
munities of the region occur in very
few areas today, however, because most
of the Southern High Plains is under
cultivation.

The Southern High Plains has low,
even environmental gradients, ﬂat topog-
raphy, and uniform regional geology.
These topographic and geologic condi-
tions prevailed throughout the Late Qua-
ternary, suggesting that past environ-
ments were relatively uniform throughout
the region and that geomorphic responses
to climate were similar and synchronous.
This situation, in turn, suggests that long-
distance geological and paleoenvironmen-
tal correlations can be made with some
degree of conﬁdence.

Cultural and Environmental
Chronology

Five general cultural periods are rec-
ognized for the Southern High Plains:
Paleoindian (11,500 to 8500 b.p.); Ar-
chaic (8500 to 2000 b.p.); Ceramic
(2000 b.p. to ca. a.d. 1450); Protohistoric
(ca. a.d. 1450 to 1650); and Historic
(ca. a.d. 1650 to 1950s). The Paleoindian
period includes the latest Pleistocene to
the earliest Holocene, when now-extinct
mammals were hunted by people. The
Archaic, from the latter part of the Early
Holocene into the Late Holocene, is
characterized by evidence for adaptation
to drought and the systematic incorpora-
tion of plant use into the subsistence
base. The Ceramic period, in the Late
Holocene, is marked by the presence of
both ceramic artifacts and arrow points.
The Protohistoric period covers the time
when Europeans were in the region, but
their inﬂuence was manifested in neither
the aboriginal material culture nor in the
archeological record. The Historic period
is denoted by European material culture in
the archeological record, and it includes
both aboriginal and Anglo-European
occupations.

region. Today, the playa and salina basins
contain the only available surface water
on the Southern High Plains, although
the water is seasonal and often brackish
or saline. Lunettes (fringing dunes) often
are found adjacent to the playas, and sev-
eral large sand dune ﬁelds are present
along the western Llano Estacado. The
dry valleys or draws are northwest-south-
east trending tributaries of rivers on the
Rolling Plains to the east (see Fig. 9.1).
The Late Quaternary (post–Blackwater
Draw Formation) stratigraphic record of
the Southern High Plains, containing an
in situ archeological record, is found in
draws, playas, salinas, and dunes (Harbour

1975; Holliday 1985a, 1995c, 1995d,
1997a; Reeves 1972).

The climate of the Southern High
Plains is continental and semiarid (classi-
ﬁed as BScDw), a steppe with dry win-
ters, mainly mesothermal years (mean
temperature of the coldest month is 32
to 64° F) with occasional microthermal
years (mean temperature of the coldest
month is below 32° F) (R. Russell 1945).
Relatively uniform gradients in precip-
itation and temperature occur across
the region; precipitation generally in-
creases from west to east, and tempera-
ture usually increases from northwest
to southeast (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967;

LATE QUATERNARY ENVIRONMENTS OF SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS / 285

The environmental history of the past

twelve thousand years on the Southern
High Plains is divided into three periods
based on stratigraphic evidence (Holliday
1985a, 1985b, 1989a, 1995c, 1995d,
1997a). The latest Pleistocene and Early
Holocene are presented as a combined
period covering the time from 12,000 to
7500 b.p., while the Middle Holocene
dates from 7500 to 4500 b.p., and the
Late Holocene dates from post– 4500
b.p. The boundary between the Early and
Middle Holocene previously was set at
6500 b.p. (e.g., E. Johnson and Holliday
1993), based on the Lubbock Lake rec-
ord. Regional stratigraphic and paleo-
environmental studies have revised the age
of the boundary to 7500 b.p. (Holliday
1995d). Environmental reconstructions
for these periods are based on paleonto-
logical, sedimentological, pedological,
and geomorphic data sets.

The chronology presented in this chap-

ter is based on uncalibrated radiocarbon
ages. The chronology is not tree-ring cali-
brated because: (1) calibrations would
confuse comparisons with other dated se-
quences from the region and surrounding
areas, none of which is calibrated; and
(2) many of the radiocarbon ages from
the draws are in the range of only tenta-
tive calibrations (older than 10,000 b.p.)
(Becker 1993; Stuiver 1993). Calibration
of only part of the sequence is not a use-
ful exercise.

Paleoindian Period

The Paleoindian period is subdivided
on the basis of distinctive projectile point
types (Frison 1991, 1993; Holliday
1997a; Wheat 1972; Wormington 1957)
representing cultures that consistently
have tightly clustered radiocarbon ages.
On the Southern Plains, the Paleoindian
period is subdivided into the Clovis
(11,500 to 11,000 b.p.), Folsom (10,800
to 10,300 b.p.), and Late Paleoindian
(10,000 to 8500 b.p.). The Late Paleo-
indian includes Plainview (ca. 10,000 b.p.)
and Firstview (ca. 8600 b.p.) cultures.

The Late Pleistocene and Early Holo-

cene sediments of most archeological
signiﬁcance are found in the draws that
cross the region (see Fig. 9.1). The draws
developed during the Pleistocene, proba-
bly the result of repeated cutting and
ﬁlling, but their origin and chronology

are poorly known (Holliday 1995c,
1995d). The oldest dated alluvial sedi-
ments are twelve thousand to eleven
thousand years old. During this time,
bedded sand and gravel was deposited
in most draws, indicative of competent
streams ﬂowing in the drainages (Hol-
liday 1995c, 1995d). Water ceased to
ﬂow, and lacustrine deposition, in the
form of diatomite and sapropelic mud,
began abruptly about 11,000 b.p. in
some reaches in a number of draws.
Otherwise, the streams continued to
ﬂow until about 9500 b.p. (Holliday
1995c, 1995d).

Paleoindian materials are common on
the uplands of the Southern High Plains,
but in situ ﬁnds are relatively rare (Holli-
day 1997a). The best in situ materials on
the uplands are buried in playa ﬁll. The
lake basins underwent more or less con-
tinuous sedimentation during the Pleis-
tocene period. Due to lack of exposure,
however, only a few such sites are known.
Many sites are reported from the dune
ﬁelds, but most of the material is not in
context. Reconstruction of the general
stratigraphic setting, however, usually
is possible. Dune construction began
ca. 11,000 to 10,000 b.p., coincident
with the Folsom occupation of the re-
gion. Episodic eolian deposition contin-
ued into the Holocene, generally increas-
ing in magnitude and frequency.

The paleoenvironmental record of the
Late Pleistocene prior to the Clovis occu-
pation (ca. 25,000 to 11,500 b.p.) only
recently has begun to emerge. Data from
vertebrate paleontology suggest that very
generally, an equitable, humid, maritime-
like climate occurred over the Southern
High Plains, with cool summers, mild
winters, and abundant precipitation
(E. Johnson 1993a; Lundelius et al. 1983).
Signiﬁcant areas of open grassland envi-
ronments existed on the Southern Plains,
including parklands and savannas (Bryant
1977; Lundelius et al. 1983). The stratig-
raphy and stable carbon isotopes of
lunettes and playas, and limited pollen
evidence, indicate that the environment
between 25,000 b.p. and 15,000 b.p. al-
ternated between cool /dry and cool /wet
conditions, within an overall trend to-
ward cooler and more humid conditions
(Holliday 1997b; S. Hall and Valastro
1995). From 15,000 to 11,000 b.p., more

frequent ﬂuctuations of temperature and
moisture occurred.

The Clovis environment was the ﬁnal

phase of the cooler, more moist condi-
tions of the Late Pleistocene. Vertebrate
remains, primarily from Lubbock Lake,
indicate an equitable, humid, maritime
paleoclimate with a lower mean annual
temperature than today: cooler summers
and warmer winters that lacked extended
freezing conditions (E. Johnson 1986a,
1987b). Open grassland environments
(mixed-grass prairie) existed on the up-
lands with parklands along the draws.
Low gradient streams, with emergent veg-
etation and sedge beds along the banks,
meandered through the draws. Mean an-
nual temperature was about 10 to 13° C
(E. Johnson 1986a, 1987b) compared
to 15° C today (Bomar 1983; Haragan
1983). Summer temperature was lower
by at least 5.6° C compared to today,
with a winter temperature at or above
0° C (E. Johnson 1986a, 1987b). A
winter rainfall pattern may have existed,
coupled with cool, dry summers. These
climatic conditions produced more effec-
tive moisture, lower evaporation rate, and
greater humidity than today.

A Clovis age drought was proposed
(C. V. Haynes 1991) for the region based
on stratigraphic data from the Clovis and
Miami sites, with the argument that
megafaunal extinctions at the end of the
Pleistocene were linked to that drought.
This hypothesis is not supported by paleo-
botanical, paleontological, or other strati-
graphic data from the regional draws,
dunes, or playas (Holliday 1995c, 1995d,
1997a, 1997b; Holliday et al. 1996). The
earliest evidence of warming and drying in
the Late Quaternary is from the Folsom
period (Holliday 1995d, 1997a, 2000).
Thirteen sites with evidence of Clovis
age occupation are known on the South-
ern High Plains, beyond isolated ﬁnds,
but only three (see Fig. 9.1) have yielded
in situ evidence. Blackwater Draw Local-
ity #l ( J. Hester 1972), the Clovis type
site, yielded the most abundant evidence
of Clovis occupation in North America.
Located in a basin that fed Blackwater
Draw, the most extensive area excavated
revealed at least ﬁve mammoths that rep-
resented individual kill or scavenging
events ( J. J. Saunders 1980). Remains
from horse, camel, and bison along with

the mammoth exhibited various lines of
evidence of cultural modiﬁcation and tool
use (E. Hughes 1984; E. Johnson 1989a;
J. J. Saunders et al. 1990, 1991). Radio-
carbon dating of carbonized plants from
the bone bed yielded an average age of ca.
11,170 b.p. ( J. Hester 1972). Excavations
elsewhere at the site yielded evidence of
mammoth and bison that were scavenged
by Clovis peoples (E. Johnson and Holli-
day 1997; J. J. Saunders and Daeschler
1994). One of these features was dated to
ca. 10,780 b.p. (E. Johnson and Holliday
1997). Several Clovis points from this site
were resharpened and reused as butcher-
ing tools (E. Johnson 1991).

At Miami (Sellards 1938), the remains

of ﬁve mammoths (three adults and two
juveniles) were found in sediments ﬁlling
a playa-lake basin. Several interpretations
were offered for the site, including a single
event kill ( J. J. Saunders 1980, 94) and
scavenging (Holliday et al. 1994). Cul-
tural modiﬁcation of the bones was mini-
mal (E. Johnson 1989a), but weather-
ing was extensive (Holliday et al. 1994;
E. Johnson and Shipman 1986). Appar-
ent butchery hack marks could not be
conﬁrmed by scanning electron micros-
copy (SEM) analysis (E. Johnson and
Shipman 1986). However, their presence
would support a scavenge-activity inter-
pretation (see J. J. Saunders and Daesch-
ler 1994). Radiocarbon dates bracketed
the Miami bone bed between ca. 11,400
and ca. 10,800 b.p. (Holliday et al. 1994).
Clovis points from Miami were re-
sharpened and used as butchering tools
(E. Johnson 1991).

The Clovis age occupation level at
Lubbock Lake (Fig. 9.2) dates to 11,100
b.p. (Holliday et al. 1983). At least six
species of megafauna were processed,
with their remains exhibiting cut lines,
helical fracture surfaces, dynamic loading
points, and evidence of tool use (E. John-
son 1985, 1987a, 1995b; E. Johnson and
Holliday 1985; E. Johnson and Shipman
1986). Recovered mammoth limb ele-
ments were associated with two large
caliche boulders. Mid-diaphyseal impact
was used to fracture the humerus and
produce radial diaphyseal segments (E.
Johnson 1985). Although modiﬁed lithic
tools were absent, a Clovis point was re-
covered from a dredge pile (the result of
dredging operations that uncovered the
site) that overlooked the area where the

bone bed was located. The point was re-
sharpened and used as a butchering tool
(E. Johnson 1991; E. Johnson and Holli-
day 1987). The bone bed was subjected
to some postdepositional disturbance,
but the feature remained essentially in
primary context (E. Johnson 1995a;
E. Johnson et al. 1987; Kreutzer 1986,
1988).

The Clovis-Folsom transition (ca.
11,000 b.p.) on the Southern High Plains
was a time of signiﬁcant climatic and en-
vironmental change that continued into
Late Paleoindian times (Holliday 1995c,
1995d, 1997a; E. Johnson 1986a, 1987b;
Lundelius et al. 1983). Widespread ex-
tinctions denote this transition. Seasonal-
ity continued to increase, resulting in
continued warming. Vertebrate faunas
from Lubbock Lake and Blackwater
Draw Locality #1 (E. Johnson 1986a,
1987a) indicate that higher mean annual
temperatures and warmer summers pre-
vailed during Folsom times. Winter tem-
peratures were lower than in Clovis times,
with sustained below-freezing periods.
Minimum and maximum temperatures
ﬂuctuated near 21° C from highs greater
than 32° C to lows below 0° C (E. John-
son 1986a, 1987b). Perennial streams
persisted in the lower reaches of most
draws, but marshes and some clear fresh-
water ponds with weedy growth appeared
in the upper reaches (e.g., Blackwater
Draw Locality #1) and in a few lower
reaches (e.g., Lubbock Lake). Water levels
in these ponds ﬂuctuated; the water was
centimeters to meters deep or it was at or
below the surface, exposing the ﬂoor of
the draw. The mixed grasslands habitat
became dominant, with scattered decidu-
ous trees on the draw slopes and around
the ponds. Wet meadow grasses and sedge
beds around the ponds graded into bet-
ter-drained mixed grasslands along the
valley ﬂoor. By 10,000 b.p., many of the
streams ceased to ﬂow and the ponds
evolved into muddy marshes. On the up-
lands, playas and salinas continued to have
seasonal, if not perennial, fresh water.
Sand sheets formed, mainly on the west-
ern half of the Southern High Plains, in-
dicating a regional reduction in vegetative
cover (Holliday 1997a). This reduction
was the result of warming and drying,
marking the waning stages of pluvial
conditions.

Folsom sites are numerous in the re-

gion (Holliday 1997a). Two sites on the
Southern High Plains (Blackwater Draw
#1 and Lubbock Lake) and two just off
the High Plains (Lipscomb and Lake
Theo) are in good stratigraphic context
(see Fig. 9.1). At Blackwater Draw Local-
ity #1 ( J. Hester 1972), a series of small
herds of bison were killed and butchered
around the ponded spring waters. Radio-
carbon ages date these kills between
ca. 10,490 and 10,170 b.p. ( J. Hester
1972). At Lake Theo (Harrison and
Killen 1978; Buchanan 1998), at least
eight to twelve bison were killed and
butchered during the fall. An extended-
stay camp was associated with the bison
kill, with transported tools in both ac-
tivity areas. Expedient lithic ﬂake tools
were common, with extensive use of local
toolstone.

Lipscomb (Hofman 1991b; Hofman

and Todd 1990; Hofman et al. 1989a,
1991b; Todd et al. 1990) appears to be a
single-event, large-scale kill of at least
ﬁfty-ﬁve bison that took place in the late
summer or fall. The topographic setting
was on a terrace adjacent to a 2-m deep
arroyo that existed at the time (Holliday
1997a). Butchering of the carcasses ap-
pears limited, with many still fully articu-
lated. Some of the Folsom points have
been reworked to extend their usefulness

(Hofman 1992). Lipscomb now repre-
sents the largest single-event Folsom kill
known for the Southern Plains.

At Lubbock Lake, Folsom occupations

are represented by a series of bison kills
around the marshy edges of ponds. Each
kill was of a small cow-calf herd, and the
animals were butchered on the spot using
both expedient lithic and bone butcher-
ing tools (E. Johnson 1987a; E. Johnson
and Holliday 1987). Bones were stacked
in small piles representing butchering
units. Lithic tools were either retouched
or utilized amorphous ﬂakes. Production
of the bone butchering tools took place in
the kill area, and the debris and tools
were discarded there (E. Johnson 1985).
Folsom points were refashioned and also
resharpened for use as butchering tools
(E. Johnson and Holliday 1987). Based
on one kill analyzed for seasonality data,
kills took place in the late fall and early
winter (E. Johnson 1987b). The Lubbock
Lake Folsom occupation is radiocarbon
dated between 10,800 and 10,300 b.p.
(Holliday et al. 1983, 1985).

The Late Paleoindian occupation of
the Southern High Plains is represented
by a variety of unﬂuted, lanceolate, post-
Folsom projectile point styles. The best
known are Plainview (Knudson 1983; Sel-
lards et al. 1947) and Firstview (E. John-
son and Holliday 1987; Wheat 1972),
but also represented in this group are
constricted-stem styles such as Milnesand
(E. Johnson et al. 1986; Sellards 1955)
and Lubbock (Fig. 9.3; see Knudson et al.
1998).

Late Paleoindian environments are
characterized by an intensiﬁcation of the
warming and drying trend that began
during Folsom times (Holliday 1997a,
1997b). Effective precipitation decreased
and maximum summer temperatures
rose. Periodic droughts and disappearing
surface water resources denoted the be-
ginning of the trend toward modern cli-
matic conditions. Seasonality was more
strongly expressed with greater seasonal
temperature ﬂuctuations, decreased effec-
tive rainfall, and lowered humidity. Verte-
brate faunas at Lubbock Lake indicated
that valley-axis wet meadows/freshwater
marshlands with emergent vegetation and
sedge beds were available, grading into
better-drained valley ﬂoors and margins
with mixed-grass prairie (E. Johnson
1986a, 1987b). A scrub-grasslands, tran-

sitional from a mixed-prairie to a desert-
plains grasslands, dominated the draws
while the uplands probably were a short-
grass prairie (E. Johnson 1986a, 1987a).
Alkaline marshes began to dominate the
ﬂoors of the draws by the end of the
Paleoindian period (Holliday 1995d).
These hydrologic changes resulted both
from warming of water and from a reduc-
tion in effective precipitation that de-
creased the discharge of springs and seeps
(Holliday 1995d). Deposition of eolian
sediments in the draws, and as dunes on
the uplands, became increasingly com-

mon (Holliday 1997a, 1997b). Playas
and salinas held seasonal water as well as
locally accumulated eolian sediment
(Holliday et al. 1996).

Plainview occupations in good strati-
graphic context are known from four sites
on or near the Southern High Plains (see
Fig. 9.1). Plainview points are reported in
collections from seven other sites in the
region (Holliday 1997a). At the Plain-
view site (Sellards et al. 1947), the type
locality (Fig. 9.4), a thick bone bed was
embedded in pond deposits in an aban-
doned stream channel in Running Water

and no bone was recovered. A radiocar-
bon assay on soil humates yielded an age
of 9950 b.p. (E. Johnson et al. 1982),
while assays on bone yielded ages of
9360 b.p. and 8010 b.p. (Harrison and
Killen 1978).

At Ryan’s site (Hartwell 1991, 1995;

Hartwell et al. 1989; E. Johnson et al.
1987), Plainview points (Fig. 9.6), large
bifaces, and large ﬂakes were found
within lacustrine deposits of a very small,
extinct playa that overlooked Yellowhouse
Draw. The morphology of the points
ranged from pristine to reworked. The
site was a plow-disturbed cache (Fig. 9.7).
The Plainview occupation at Lubbock
Lake is characterized by the continuation
of kills of small herds of bison around the
marshy edges of ponds, the clustering or
grouping of bones in distinct concentra-
tions, and a change in weaponry design
and technology. The practice of resharp-
ening and reusing the points as butcher-
ing tools continued. The lithic tool kit
was complemented by a bone butchering
tool kit made from the bison being pro-
cessed in the locales. The Plainview occu-
pation at the site is radiocarbon dated to
10,000 b.p. (E. Johnson and Holliday
1980).

Test excavations at Mark’s Beach
(Honea 1980) uncovered disarticulated
remains from a bison in lacustrine de-
posits. Neither lithic nor bone tools were
recovered, but a radiocarbon assay on
bone yielded an age of 9920 b.p. (Honea
1980), and a sample of soil humates was
dated at ca. 9710 b.p. (Holliday 1995d).
Although this material was of Plainview
age, whether or not it represents a cul-
tural activity has yet to be determined.
Three Firstview sites have been exca-

vated in the region (see Fig. 9.1). At
Blackwater Draw Locality #1 ( J. Hester
1972), Firstview occupations are present
in the carbonaceous silts (Unit E [Haynes
1975, 1995]), but the stratigraphic, geo-
chronological, and archeological situation
of the material is not clear. Only a few
radiocarbon ages are available from this
unit, but at most it spans the period from
ca. 10,500 to 8500 b.p. (Haynes 1995).
At least three bison kill /butchering lo-
cales were excavated, two in the lower
part of the silts and one in the upper part
(Agogino et al. 1976; J. Hester 1972),
while a possible fourth locale is mentioned
in work by Agogino and Rovner (1969).

Draw (Fig. 9.5). The bone bed repre-
sented at least two large-scale kill events
that totaled more than one hundred bison.
One kill took place in the spring while
the other was in the early fall (E. Johnson
1989a). The lithic tool kit consisted pri-
marily of Plainview projectile points (re-
fashioned into butchering knives) with
a few amorphous ﬂake tools (Knudson
1983); bone butchering tools were not

recognized. Two radiocarbon assays on
bone yielded ages of 10,200 b.p. and
9860 b.p. (Speer 1986).

Testing at Lake Theo (Harrison and
Killen 1978) yielded Plainview projectile
points and other lithic tools and ﬂakes in
place stratigraphically above the Folsom
occupation. This material may represent a
number of camping events, as the lithics
were spread out through a 40-cm deposit

large bone bed in the upper silts contained
the remains of numerous bison in associa-
tion with a suite of projectile points and
amorphous lithic ﬂake tools ( J. Hester
1972; E. Johnson and Holliday 1997;
Sellards 1952). Sellards (1952) based his
Portales Complex on this suite of projec-
tile points. Wheat (1972) reexamined the
projectile points and concluded that most
were resharpened variants of the Firstview
design. Bones were jumbled and the de-
posit may have been trampled. At least
three episodes of surface weathering are
evident on the elements, indicating more
than one kill event (E. Johnson 1986b;
E. Johnson and Holliday 1997). Radio-
carbon assays yielded ages of ca. 8970 b.p.
and ca. 8690 b.p. that did not overlap at
2-sigma (E. Johnson and Holliday 1997).
These dates fall within the age range for
Firstview on the Southern High Plains
(E. Johnson 1987c; E. Johnson and Hol-
liday 1981) and indicate that at least two
Firstview occupational events are repre-
sented at the Clovis site.

San Jon (Roberts 1942), on the north-
western edge of the Southern High Plains
(see Fig. 9.1), was a stratiﬁed, multicom-
ponent site (Fig. 9.8) where cultural activ-
ities took place along the edge of a playa
basin (Fig. 9.9). The “San Jon” bone bed
in Area II yielded a minimum of ﬁve bi-
son, and articulated limb elements, par-
ticularly lower limbs, were common. Pre-
sumably, this bone bed represented a
small-scale bison kill at the edge of the
playa. The one projectile point recovered
from the bone bed was the type specimen
for the San Jon point (Roberts 1942),
and its tip was reworked (Hill et al. 1995).
Wheat (1972) subsumed the San Jon type
into his Firstview type. Organic sedi-
ments from within the bone bed yielded
an age of ca. 8360 b.p. (Hill et al. 1995).
At Lubbock Lake, Firstview peoples

continued to hunt and butcher small
herds of bison at the edge of the marsh-
lands (E. Johnson and Holliday 1981).
Bone concentrations and the stacking of
elements continued. Bone fracturing was
minimal, and therefore, bone tool manu-
facture and use were reduced and marrow
processing was rare. The amorphous
lithic ﬂake tools were common, and
Firstview points were resharpened and
reused as butchering tools. The Firstview
occupation at Lubbock Lake was radio-
carbon dated to ca. 8600 b.p. (Holliday
et al. 1983, 1985).

chaic, and Lubbock Lake (Fig. 9.10) and
San Jon are the only excavated sites for
this time period. The practice of hunting
and butchering small herds of bison con-
tinued. A bone concentration represent-
ing several individual bison consisted of
articulated to semi-articulated segments
indicating butchering units. None of the
elements had been broken for marrow.
Neither lithic nor bone butchering tools
were recovered, although numerous re-
sharpening ﬂakes indicated the use of sev-
eral lithic tools. Radiocarbon ages on soil
humates date the Early Archaic activity to
ca. 8000 b.p. (E. Johnson and Holliday
1989). The camp at San Jon was dated to
8000 b.p. on charcoal.

By about 6000 b.p., the lakes and
marshes in the draws had left signiﬁcant
accumulations of marl, but the dominant
sediment across the region, in and out
of the draws, was wind-blown material
(Holliday 1989b, 1995c, 1995d). Eolian
sedimentation was episodic but wide-
spread from 9000 b.p. until 5500 b.p.,
with most areas affected by 6500 b.p. Be-
tween 5500 b.p. and 4500 b.p., eolian
sedimentation occurred throughout the
Southern High Plains. This eolian sedi-
mentation culminated in signiﬁcant ﬁlling
of draws, construction of sand dunes, lo-
cal sedimentation in playa basins, and ad-
ditions to lunettes throughout the region.
This eolian activity marked peak aridity
in the Late Quaternary, and the period be-
tween 6500 b.p. and 4500 b.p. is known
as the Altithermal (Holliday 1989b).

The Altithermal coincides with the
Middle Archaic period. Conditions were
hot, dry, and dusty (Holliday 1989a;
E. Johnson and Holliday 1986). The mas-
sive eolian sedimentation that occurred
indicates further reduction in vegetation
cover, probably due to increased tempera-
tures and decreasing effective moisture in
the form of lower effective precipitation
(Holliday 1995d, 1997b). Dental abnor-
malities in bison at this time indicate poor
range conditions due to excess grit on the
vegetation. The presence of yellow-faced
gophers denotes semiarid to arid condi-
tions (E. Johnson 1987b; E. Johnson and
Holliday 1986). Open, treeless grasslands
covered the valleys, and available surface
water decreased considerably. Given the
climatic conditions derived from geologic
and faunal evidence, a desert-plains grass-
lands probably existed on the Southern
High Plains during the Middle Archaic.

time during the Late Holocene.

Archaic Period

In the Early Archaic, during the latter

part of the Early Holocene, available
moisture and humidity levels continued
to decrease, reﬂecting the intensiﬁcation
of the warming and drying trend and
more marked seasonality. By the end of
the Early Holocene, hard-water alkaline
marshes, localized desiccation, and eolian
sedimentation characterized deposition
in the draws (Holliday 1989b, 1995c,

1995d). Marshes that persisted in the
valley axes were surrounded by a treeless
mixed-grass prairie. Sedge beds and wet
meadows were absent (E. Johnson 1987a;
Johnson and Holliday 1986). On the up-
lands, eolian sediments accumulated as
sand dunes, in lunettes, and in playa ba-
sins as a result of reduced vegetation cover
and drought-induced wind deﬂation of
the High Plains surface.

Excavated Middle Archaic materials
in good stratigraphic context are docu-
mented at ﬁve sites (see Fig. 9.10). Three
sites yielded evidence for the excavation
of wells by prehistoric occupants in the
Middle Holocene. At Blackwater Draw
Locality #1 (Evans 1951; F. Green 1962)
at least nineteen wells are known. At
Mustang Springs (Meltzer 1991; Meltzer
and Collins 1987) dozens of wells were
discovered. Excavations at Marks Beach
(Honea 1980) exposed a purported well.
A hearth and associated Clear Fork gouge
were recovered in Middle Archaic context
from substratum 4A at 41LU26 (Bandy
et al. 1981; E. Johnson and Holliday
1986).

Despite the harsh conditions, relatively
intensive occupation continued through-
out this period at Lubbock Lake. At least
twenty-eight activity areas are known
to include camping events, bison kill /
butchering locales, and a large oven prob-
ably used for vegetal processing (E. John-
son and Holliday 1986). The oven is a
large oval basin ﬁlled with ash and capped
by a layer of burned caliche cobbles
(Fig. 9.11). A broken, worn sandstone
metate was found in the rock covering.
This feature was radiocarbon dated to
ca. 4800 b.p. (E. Johnson and Holliday
1986).

By 4500 b.p., the climate began to
ameliorate and return to relatively cooler
and more moist conditions that brought
about landscape stability and environ-
mental changes that generally have per-
sisted into modern times. Sedimentation
ceased, little wind erosion occurred, and a
stable vegetation cover returned. Forma-
tion of the Lubbock Lake Soil at Lubbock
Lake and similar soils at other localities
occurred (Holliday 1985c, 1990b, 1995b,
1995c). This landscape stability heralded
the establishment of essentially modern
conditions and a continental climate.
Range conditions improved, and a
mixed-grass prairie replaced the probable
desert-plains grasslands of the Middle
Holocene, both in the draws and on the
uplands. Localized marshlands returned
to the valley axes with a resurgence of
springs; occasional hardwood trees were
found in the draws. On the uplands,
playas and salinas held seasonal to year-
round water (Holliday 1995c, 1995d;
Holliday et al. 1996). More extensive sur-
face water was available, indicating more
available and effective moisture.

Late Archaic archeological materials
rarely are found in stratiﬁed contexts be-
cause sedimentation during this time was
very localized. Only three sites in the re-
gion have Late Archaic materials within
good stratigraphic context (see Fig. 9.2).
The lower midden at Chalk Hollow
(Wedel 1975; Lintz 2000) records
camping activities from at least three
different events dating between 2,000
to 4,000 b.p. Corner- and side-notched
Late Archaic points characterize the
deposits.

At San Jon in Area III, F. H. H. Rob-
erts, Jr. (1942), excavated a Late Archaic
bison kill, the only excavated bison kill
site for this time period on the Southern
High Plains. A minimum of seven bison
were killed and butchered at the edge of
the playa. Based on the bone bed distri-
bution map (Hill et al. 1995, ﬁg. 7),
skulls and mandibles were common, some
articulated limb and vertebral units oc-
curred (presumably representing butcher-
ing units), and bones or articulated units
were disassociated from each carcass. Or-
ganic sediments from the substratum in
which the bone bed occurs yielded an age
of ca. 3600 b.p. (Hill et al. 1995). The
two projectile points associated with the
bone bed were not identiﬁed as to type
(Hill et al. 1995).

At Lubbock Lake, the Late Archaic
is represented by at least nine occupa-
tion surfaces found buried within the
A-horizon of the Lubbock Lake Soil.
These surfaces are denoted by scattered
burned caliche (from disturbed hearths),
broken lithic tools, and both diffuse and
concentrated lithic ﬂaking debris. These
artifacts appear to represent camping ac-
tivities. Diagnostic artifacts have not been
recovered with the occupation surfaces,
but a Late Archaic age is based on strati-
graphic position and radiocarbon ages as-
sociated with the stratigraphic unit (Hol-
liday 1985a; Holliday et al. 1983, 1985).
Because this A-horizon represents a stable
land surface that existed well into the Ce-
ramic period, Late Archaic and Ceramic
age materials may be mixed in the upper-
most occupation surfaces. A Late Archaic
hearth has been excavated at 41LU29
(E. Johnson 1989b), on the eastern rim
of Yellowhouse Draw overlooking Lub-
bock Lake, and a Late Archaic age cache
was recovered from 41LU6 in Yellow-
house Draw less than 1 km upstream
from Lubbock Lake (Buchanan 1995).

Archaic age deposits have been investi-

gated in the Justiceburg Reservoir (Lake
Alan Henry) area on the Double Moun-
tain Fork of the Brazos River, down-
stream from Lubbock Lake about 97 km.
This area is situated in the same drainage
system as Lubbock Lake and is just off
the Southern High Plains, southeast of
Lubbock, on the Rolling Plains. Most
sites are in geologically unstratiﬁed de-
posits (D. Boyd et al. 1989, 1990). Site
types identiﬁed include camp sites, rock-
shelters, bison processing stations or kill
sites, and lithic procurement sites. At
least six sites (41GR207, 41GR287,
41GR376, 41GR383, 41GR456, and
41KT49) have been identiﬁed as Archaic
and another six (41GR471, 41KT33,
41KT34, 41KT52, 41KT53, and
41KT151) as Late Archaic in age based
on excavated features (primarily hearths),
radiocarbon ages, and artifact types
(D. Boyd et al. 1990).

Ceramic Period

The past two thousand years on the
Southern High Plains, encompassing
the Ceramic, Protohistoric, and Historic
periods, were characterized by shifts be-
tween ameliorated conditions (similar
to the Late Archaic and modern times)
and episodic droughts. This pattern of
episodic drought continues today and in-
dicates minor departures toward some
aridity through increased temperatures
and decreased effective moisture. Region-
ally, the details of this episodic pattern are
not clear. Although these droughts appear
not to have been severe enough to alter
the modern Southern Plains faunal com-
munities, they were severe enough to de-
nude the land of vegetation and cause sur-
face erosion that led to deposition and
alteration of the landscape (Holliday
1985a, 1990b; E. Johnson 1987a). How-
ever, a range change for the prairie vole
(Microtus ochrogaster) is an environmental
indicator. Between 1830 and 1240 b.p.,
this vole reestablished itself on the north-
ern portion of the Southern High Plains
(Willey and Hughes 1978b), reﬂecting
the ameliorated, more mesic conditions
that prevailed after 4500 b.p. during the
Late Archaic and early Ceramic periods.
After 1240 b.p., Microtus ochrogaster no
longer ranged onto the Southern High
Plains. The periodic droughts progres-
sively are less severe, or of shorter dura-
tion, or both. Coincident eolian activity

in the dune ﬁelds records the same events
(Holliday 1985c, 1995c, 1995d).

In upper reaches of the draws without

spring activity during this time, slope-
wash and eolian sedimentation occurred.
But in the lower reaches, a spring-fed
stream and wet meadow–marshland
complex existed along valley axes for the
past one thousand years (Holliday 1985a,
1995c, 1995d). Hackberry, native walnut,
and mesquite grew along the valley ﬂoor
and slopes. The local environs were those
of a mesquite savanna surrounding a ri-
parian marshland complex (E. Johnson
1987b).

The earlier part of the Ceramic period

(ca. 2000 to 1000 b.p.) appears to have
been one of transition from traditional
Archaic lifeways— denoted by the reten-
tion of Archaic point designs—to a newer
lifeway signaled by the adoption of tech-
nological changes brought about with
ceramics and the bow and arrow. Three
sites in the region with good stratigraphic
context have dart points or mixed dart and
arrow point assemblages (see Fig. 9.10).
Camping features have been excavated at
County Line, Blue Clay, and Deadman’s
Shelter ( J. Hughes and Willey 1978). At
Deadman’s Shelter (Willey and Hughes
1978b), dart and arrow points have been
found in association with pottery. Radio-
carbon ages of ca. 1740 b.p. and 1830
b.p. are the earliest dates associated with
arrow points and pottery in the region.
Several bison kills (Twilla, Bell, Strong,
Collier, Sitter, Finch, R.O., and Hoover
sites) found just east of the Southern
High Plains (see Fig. 9.10) contain a vari-
ety of Late Archaic point designs with ra-
diocarbon ages that averaged 1387 b.p.
(D. Hughes 1977).

This thousand-year transitional period

also is characterized by corner-notched
Scallorn arrow points and coarse-tem-
pered cordmarked pottery ( J. Hughes
and Willey 1978). Only a few Scallorn-
associated sites are known and they are
not well dated. The upper midden at
Chalk Hollow (Wedel 1975; Lintz 2002)
dated to this time, as did occupation
zones at Lake Creek ( J. Hughes 1962)
and Borger Bridge ( J. Hughes and Willey
1978). At Lubbock Lake, this period of
occupation is indicated by a hearth with
associated camping debris that included a
Scallorn point, modern bison remains,
lithic tools and ﬂakes, and bone beads
( J. H. Kelley 1974). Downstream at

41GR291 (at Justiceburg Reservoir or
Lake Alan Henry), a Deadman’s point
and Scallorn points were found associated
in a camp occupation (D. Boyd et al.
1990; see also D. Boyd, chapter 10, this
volume).

The later Ceramic period (ca. 1000 to
500 b.p.) is characterized by a mixed as-
semblage of Puebloan trade pottery and
Plains lithic tool types. The tradewares
are dominated by Mogollon ceramics,
representing the eastern variety of the Jor-
nada branch of the Mogollon culture (see
Perttula et al. 1995b). Numerous sites are
known from this time period, but few
occur in good stratigraphic context. Ex-
amples are such sites as Jim Arnold (Tun-
nell 1964), A769 (Harrison and Grifﬁn
1973), Floydada Country Club (Word
1963, 1991), Montgomery (Word 1965),
41CB27 (Parker 1982), Pete Creek,
Grape Creek, and Dockum Springs (Par-
son 1967), 41TY2 (Baxevanis et al. 1997;
Pope 1991), the lower level at Slaton
Dump (Booker and Campbell 1978),
Petree (Riggs 1972), Gresham Lake
(Breeding 1971), and Bull Hill (Shawn
1975).

At Lubbock Lake, game animal (mod-

ern bison, pronghorn antelope, coyote,
and wolf ) processing stations are found
in serial stratigraphic position. Although
these stations lack ceramics, radiocarbon
assays and stratigraphic position indi-
cate this latter part of the Ceramic as
the period of occupation (E. Johnson
1987a).

Protohistoric Period

Numerous Protohistoric sites are

known in the region, but again, few occu-
pations are in good stratigraphic context.
At Lubbock Lake, numerous occupation
levels attest to intense and repeated use of
the area. These levels are characterized by
Garza points, occur in serial stratigraphic
sequence, and have associated radiocar-
bon ages of ca. 500 to 300 b.p. (Holliday
et al. 1983, 1985; E. Johnson et al. 1977).
Living surfaces with associated hearths as
well as large game animal processing sta-
tions occur there.

Less than 1 km downstream from
Lubbock Lake, Protohistoric Garza occu-
pations within a geologically stratiﬁed
context have been excavated at 41LU26
and 41LU35 (Bandy et al. 1981). Wheat
(1955) investigated a Garza camp site on
the uplands overlooking Yellowhouse

Canyon in the vicinity of Buffalo Springs
Lake. Farther downstream at the Justice-
burg Reservoir (Lake Alan Henry) area,
several Garza occupations were tested
(D. Boyd et al. 1989, 1990), while two
sites (Longhorn and Headstream) span-
ning the Protohistoric and Historic peri-
ods that may be Garza Complex sites
were excavated (D. Boyd et al. 1990,
1993; D. Boyd and Peck 1992). The
Garza type site (Runkles 1964) and the
Lott site (Runkles and Dorchester 1987),
in geologically unstratiﬁed context, are
situated just off the Southern High Plains
along tributaries of the Double Mountain
Fork of the Brazos River.

Northeast of Lubbock Lake, in the
Running Water Draw system, a Garza oc-
cupation within a stratiﬁed context was
tested at the Floydada Country Club site
(Word 1963, 1991) in Blanco Canyon
near Floydada. Downstream about 5 km,
Garza occupations, mixed in unstratiﬁed
contexts with earlier and later compo-
nents, also were investigated at the Mont-
gomery site (Word 1965) and 41CB27
(Baugh 1992; Parker 1982). Northward
in lower Tule Canyon, an excavated
hearth at 41BI83 dates to this time (Katz
and Katz 1976), but it lacked diagnostic
artifacts. Farther north, Jack T. Hughes
(1971) tested a Garza occupation within
a stratiﬁed context at the Canyon City
Club Cave site along Palo Duro Creek at
the outskirts of Canyon, Texas. West of
Lubbock Lake just off the Southern High
Plains, Garza sites (bison kill and camp
sites) were excavated on the Mescalero
Plains near Bottomless Lake (Speth and
Parry 1978, 1980).

Historic Period

Historic period sites in good strati-
graphic context are extremely rare on the
Southern High Plains. This period is
marked by the appearance of European
trade goods and modern horse remains. It
is subdivided into aboriginal Historic and
Anglo-Historic times. At Lubbock Lake,
numerous aboriginal Historic occupation
levels are characterized by Washita points.
These levels occur in serial stratigraphic
sequence and have associated radiocarbon
ages of ca. 300 to 150 b.p. (Holliday et al.
1983, 1985). Processing stations are simi-
lar to ones in the Protohistoric and Ce-
ramic periods. They are distinctive, how-
ever, in the inclusion of the modern horse
as a game animal.

Farther downstream, aboriginal His-

toric sites have been investigated at
41LU35 (Bandy et al. 1981), 41GR484,
41KT53, and 41KT69 (D. Boyd et al.
1990). Several historic rock art sites are
present in the Justiceburg Reservoir (Lake
Alan Henry) area (D. Boyd 1992; D. Boyd
and Kibler 1993). Historic period glass
trade beads from the 1700s have been re-
covered from 41CB27 (Parker 1982) in
Blanco Canyon near Crosbyton and the
Headstream site (D. Boyd and Peck
1992; Peck et al. 1993) at Justiceburg
Reservoir (Lake Alan Henry). To the
north, two probable Comanche sites have
been excavated at Mackenzie Reservoir
( J. Hughes and Willey 1978) in Tule
Canyon, and distinctive hearths and post-
1840 glass seed beads were recovered
there. At Lubbock Lake, a Comanche oc-
cupation is represented by several activity
areas that have yielded glass seed beads
(Ladkin 1993, 1995). The Codgell (Word
and Fox 1975) and White (D. Suhm
1961) sites in Floyd and Yoakum Coun-
ties also contained glass seed beads.

European occupation of the Southern

High Plains began in the middle to late
1800s. The ﬁrst Europeans were buffalo
hunters and U.S. military units, followed
by sheepherders ( pastores), traders, ranch-
ers, and settlers. Few excavations of these
sites have been conducted. A buffalo
hunter’s camp, occupied sometime be-
tween 1874 and 1879, was tested at Jus-
ticeburg Reservoir (Lake Alan Henry)
(41GR528 [see Freeman and Boyd 1990]).
The pastores, Hispanic sheepherders from
New Mexico, began moving into the Ca-
nadian River valley in the early 1870s,
and by the late 1870s small settlements,
such as at Tascosa, were being established
in the valley (Archambeau 1946; A. Tay-
lor 1980), with the southernmost settle-
ment at Merrell-Taylor Village (Guffee
1976) on Quitaque Creek along the es-
carpment below Palo Duro Canyon. Test

at the Ellis site (Hicks and Johnson 2000;
Lichti 1994) in Yellowhouse Canyon near

High Plains, excavations at Adobe Walls
(T. Baker and Harrison 1986) along
the Canadian River revealed a wide vari-
ety of European goods available to the
area’s occupants during the late 1860s
to 1870s. Along Yellowhouse Draw in
the east-central Southern High Plains,
Singer Store was a trading post situated
at Lubbock Lake from 1883 to 1886
(W. Holden 1974; Hicks 2002). Testing
produced artifacts relating to the store
and its activities, as well as artifacts attest-
ing to buffalo hunting activity (E. John-
son 1987a; Hicks 2002). Archeological
exploration occurred at one of the XIT
Ranch headquarters ( Jackson 1976) near
Hereford.

Just off the Southern Plains in the Jus-

ticeburg Reservoir (Lake Alan Henry)
area, testing of historic sites (Freeman
and Boyd 1990) included that of a
sheepherder’s camp dating from the
1880s (41GR443), several dugouts oc-
cupied between the 1880s and 1900
(41GR474, 41GR263, 41GR392, and
41KT150), an 1880s to 1920s line
camp (41KT84), several homesteads
(41GR250, 41GR474, and 41GR443),
ranch headquarters (41GR13), and town
building (41GR331).

Investigations at an Anglo-American
dump in Lamb County documented two
dumping periods at the site, one episode
around 1915 and the other centered
around 1935 (Hicks et al. 1994). These
episodes corresponded with two periods
of population increase for the city of
Littleﬁeld. At Lubbock Lake, Anglo-
American dumps from the early twenti-
eth century were tested. Dumping epi-
sodes centered around 1940 and 1955,
corresponding to periods of population in-
crease for the city of Lubbock (K. O’Brien
1995).

Summary Discussion

The Late Quaternary archeological
and paleoenvironmental records of the
Southern High Plains are well preserved
in the draws, dunes, and lake basins of
the region. The ﬁll in the draws histori-
cally is most closely linked to the human
history of the region because several now-
renowned archeological sites have been
discovered in these settings. The draws
also provide the most complete and sensi-
tive regional environmental record so far
available.

At the beginning of the Paleoindian

occupation, the environment of the
Southern High Plains was for the most
part relatively cool and moist. The draws
had perennial ﬂowing water, and lake ba-
sins probably had permanent water.

By Folsom times, hydrologic condi-
tions had changed. Less ﬂowing water
was available in the draws as spring dis-
charge and runoff declined. Streams were
replaced with ponds and marshes. Eolian
sedimentation appeared in the strati-
graphic record between 11,000 and
10,000 b.p., and eolian deposition in the
draws, dunes, and playas became more
widespread through the Early Holocene.
This deposition culminated in the
Middle Holocene in signiﬁcant ﬁlling of
draws and construction of sand dunes.
This eolian activity likely marked peak
aridity in the Late Quaternary in response
to increased temperatures and lower effec-
tive precipitation relative to the preceding
or following periods. By about forty-ﬁve
hundred years ago, a change in climate
toward more moist and cooler conditions,
relative to the Middle Holocene, brought
landscape stability and environmental
changes that have more or less persisted
to the present. This stability resulted in
little Late Holocene sedimentation in the
region, other than in the draws.

This stratigraphic and paleoenviron-
mental scheme generally follows earlier
reconstructions of the paleoecology of the
Southern High Plains (see, e.g., Wendorf
1961; Wendorf and Hester 1975) but dif-
fers considerably in detail. The various
Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene cli-
matic intervals proposed in earlier schemes
are not identiﬁable in the stratigraphic
record now emerging due to problems of
dating, stratigraphic correlation, and
pollen preservation in the work that led
to the earlier schemes (Holliday 1987,
1995d, 1997).

The known archeological record for

the Southern High Plains provides a
lengthy and rich heritage for the region.
People have lived on and used the South-
ern High Plains for at least eleven thou-
sand years, and perhaps for as long as
people have been in the New World. Al-
though varying through time in variety,
quality, and plenitude, the environments
of the Southern High Plains have pro-
vided ample natural resources for the var-
ious peoples inhabiting the region. This
resource base is spread over large parame-

ters of seasonality, space, and time, and
the abundance or scarcity of such re-
sources as lithic materials, water, and
wood on the Southern High Plains has
inﬂuenced the adaptive responses to envi-
ronment and environmental change as
conditions went from pluvial, to xeric, to
mesic. The relationship between environ-
ment and the people that occupied that
environment, then, potentially could be
well deﬁned in such settings.

High-quality lithic materials were a lo-

calized resource at best, represented by
Alibates agate at the northern edge of the
region along the Canadian River and by
Tecovas jasper at the eastern edge of the
escarpment near Quitaque (e.g., Banks
1990; Holliday and Welty 1981). Ogal-
lala Formation quartzites and cherts
(generally of much poorer quality) were
available along the escarpment and at lo-
calized outcrops within the draws (Holli-
day and Welty 1981). Due to this limited
distribution, imported lithic resources,
particularly from central Texas (Edwards
Formation chert), played a major role in
the adaptive strategies utilized on the
Southern High Plains.

Resource availability of wood and wa-
ter closely mirrored the climatic changes
of the region. Both commodities were
available regionally and were locally abun-
dant during the Late Pleistocene and
Early Holocene but became much more
scarce and localized during the Middle
Holocene (Holliday 1989b, 1995c,
1995d; E. Johnson 1987b; Meltzer
1991). Surface waters in playas and draws
increased again in the Late Holocene
(Holliday 1995c, 1995d), with limited
wood resources available only within the
draws (E. Johnson 1987b). An episodic
pattern of droughts for about the past
two thousand years (Holliday 1985b,
1995c, 1995d, 1997b) undoubtedly af-
fected long-term adaptive strategies.
Coupled with the drought pattern for at
least the last ﬁve hundred years were the
steady inﬂux of various groups of nonlo-
cal peoples, from the Athabascans and
Comanche to the pastores and Anglo-
Americans, and the replacement of the
indigenous people.

The long occupation of the Southern

High Plains was primarily by hunter-
gatherer peoples, presumably practicing a
seasonal series of annual activities. In gen-
eral, Clovis peoples had a broad-spec-
trum, meat-related subsistence base in

which they were hunting and scavenging
a wide variety of game animals. With
widespread extinctions, bison became the
major game animal of post-Clovis peoples.
Later Paleoindian peoples had a very nar-
row-spectrum, meat-related subsistence
base, systematically cropping both small
cow-calf herds as well as large mixed herds
of bison. By the Middle Holocene, Ar-
chaic peoples had a mixed desert plant-
and meat-related subsistence base, and
they were forced to rely on wells for water
in the western and southern part of the
Southern High Plains. A mixed plant-
and meat-related subsistence base contin-
ued throughout Late Holocene Ceramic
through aboriginal Historic times, but
with more mesic vegetation and abun-
dant surface water (E. Johnson 1987b,
1991, 1994a; E. Johnson and Holliday
1986; Meltzer 1991).

The occupation of the Southern High

Plains through time by these hunter-
gatherer peoples appears to have been un-
dertaken by small groups of people for
both economic (hunting, plant process-
ing, and tool production and rejuvena-
tion) and short-term residential uses, with

repeated use of the landscape as well as
differential use of landscape features. Key
aspects missing from the record are long-
term home bases and quarries for lithic
resources. Quarries must have existed
along the outcroppings of Alibates and
Tecovas, but they have not been docu-
mented. Quarrying of outcrops of Ogal-
lala Formation materials has been docu-
mented on the Rolling Plains just off the
eastern escarpment in the Brazos River
drainage (E. Johnson 1994b).

Various Late Holocene peoples along
the Canadian River and associated drain-
ageways, in particular the Antelope Creek
peoples (see Brooks, chapter 11, this vol-
ume), practiced agriculture that modiﬁed
or changed lifeways and social organiza-
tion. This lifeway was brief on the South-
ern High Plains, being practiced for much
less than one thousand years and appar-
ently coming to an end in the a.d. 1400s
as outsiders moved into the region. From
then on into the 1800s, aboriginal occu-
pation of the northern Southern High
Plains was again by hunter-gatherers.
By the 1860s, a quick succession
of non-native peoples began using the

Southern High Plains for economic pur-
poses and then settling the region. By the
late 1870s this intrusion brought the ab-
original occupation of the region to a
close. The use of land and other resources
changed dramatically from the aboriginal
patterns to patterns of the non-native
peoples. The buffalo hunters decimated
the bison herds while the pastores and
ranchers used the plains grasslands to pas-
ture domestic stock (sheep, then cattle).
The early settlers plowed the grasslands to
raise domesticated crops. By the turn of
the twentieth century, towns were being
established on the uplands, away from the
traditional aboriginal resource bases of
the draws and playas.

The Palo Duro Complex
Redeﬁning the Early Ceramic Period
in the Caprock Canyonlands

Douglas K. Boyd

Paleoclimatic interpretations for the
Southern Plains suggest that the Early
Ceramic, or Late Prehistoric I, period was
probably wetter than the preceding Late
Archaic period, and it appears that condi-
tions were generally less favorable for bi-
son. While the precise relationships be-
tween climate, vegetation, and bison may
never be fully understood, a general de-
cline in the number of bison in the South-
ern Plains may have occurred around
a.d. 500, and populations probably
remained relatively low until around
a.d. 1200 (Dillehay 1974, 187; J. Hughes
1991, 8, 30). Just prior to or during this
time, two major events—the westward
spread of eastern Woodland culture and
the eastward spread of Southwestern
Puebloan culture—had a signiﬁcant and
widespread impact on the peoples of the
Southern Plains. The two traditions met,
or perhaps collided, along the eastern
margins of the Llano Estacado, and this
canyonland region, herein termed the
Caprock Canyonlands, apparently played
a prominent role in the cultural develop-
ments and interactions during the ﬁrst
millennium a.d.

The Woodland tradition spread east-
ward from the upper Midwest into the
Great Plains, arriving in north-central
Oklahoma by a.d. 100 –300, and in
south-central Oklahoma prior to a.d. 450.
There are a number of diagnostic traits,
such as “corner-notched dart and arrow
points, shell disc beads, burial in mounds

or ossuaries, an increase in the frequency
of ground stones, and the appearance of
tools associated with horticulture” (Vehik
1984, 175), but it is the distinctive cord-
marked pottery vessels (elongated forms
with conoidal bottoms) that are the hall-
mark of the Woodland tradition. Not all
of these diagnostic traits are manifest in
the Oklahoma Plains Woodland sites,
however, and it is not until ca. a.d. 800
that good evidence for agriculture and
semipermanent villages appears (Vehik
1984, 195 –97). Despite the absence of
deﬁnite evidence for pre-a.d. 800 agricul-
ture, it is notable that most of the Wood-
land complexes in the Southern Plains are
thought to have begun between a.d. 100
and 500 (Hofman and Brooks 1989).
Other researchers have noted that agricul-
ture probably appeared on the Plains dur-
ing this time. In the Chaquaqua Plateau
of southeastern Colorado, for example,
Robert G. Campbell (1976, 53 –54) sug-
gests a date of a.d. 500 for the appear-
ance of maize.

The Woodland tradition had spread
into the Delaware Canyon area of west-
central Oklahoma by around a.d. 50 –
250 (Ferring 1982, 1986a), and archeo-
logical evidence from sites on the Thur-
mond Ranch (Thurmond 1991) and the
Swift Horse site (Briscoe 1987) indicates
that it had spread into western Oklahoma
as early as a.d. 200 – 400. A thermo-
luminescence date of a.d. 520 on a cord-
marked sherd from the Tascosa Creek site

296

is the earliest occurrence of Woodland
pottery in the Texas Panhandle, but ab-
solute chronological evidence is limited,
and Woodland occupations probably be-
gan somewhat earlier. The appearance of
the Woodland tradition in the Panhandle
Plains occurred at approximately the
same time as the disappearance of the
Late Archaic bison-hunting lifestyle,
around a.d. 500. The Plains Woodland
remains in the Texas Panhandle are called
the Lake Creek Complex ( J. Hughes
1962, 1991).

At about this same time, the Jornada
Mogollon culture of south-central New
Mexico, Trans-Pecos Texas, and northern
Chihuahua (Lehmer 1948) expanded
across all of southeastern New Mexico
and onto the western edge of the Llano
Estacado. This eastern extension of the
Jornada Mogollon (Corley 1965a, 1965b;
Leslie 1979) may represent the spread of
Jornada Mogollon peoples, or at least
considerable expansion of their cultural
inﬂuence among neighboring peoples.
Additional Southwestern inﬂuence, indi-
cated by the sporadic occurrence of Mo-
gollon brownware pottery (see M. Miller
1995a; also E. Johnson and Holliday,
chapter 9, this volume), may be traced all
across the southern Llano Estacado, par-
ticularly around large playas or pluvial
lakes, and into the southern Caprock
Canyonlands. First recognized at a small
rockshelter in Swisher County, Texas, the
Palo Duro Complex (Willey and Hughes

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

10-A2946  4/13/04  12:20 PM  Page 297

1978b) appeared to represent a group of
hunter-gatherers who simply obtained
brownware pottery in trade, directly or
indirectly, with Jornada peoples. More re-
cent archeological ﬁndings of residential
base camps with pithouses and storage fa-
cilities at the Kent Creek (Cruse 1992)
and the Sam Wahl (Boyd et al. 1994)
sites are changing our perceptions about
who the Palo Duro peoples were, and it
now appears that the Jornada Mogollon
inﬂuence involved much more than just
pottery (see J. Hughes 1991).

Although there are many similarities
between the Plains Woodland–tradition
Lake Creek Complex and the Jornada
Mogollon–inﬂuenced Palo Duro Com-
plex, the differences in these manifesta-
tions have been interpreted as evidence
that two groups of people occupied the
Texas Panhandle Plains during the ﬁrst
millennium a.d. Assuming that the distri-
bution of pottery traditions represents the
maximum extent of cultural inﬂuence
(e.g., the extent of exchange networks,
diffusion of technology, or even the spread
of related peoples), Jim Couzzourt (1982,
1985) and Jack T. Hughes (1991) inter-
pret the archeological data to indicate that
a cultural boundary between Woodland
and Southwestern-inﬂuenced peoples ex-
isted along the drainage divide between
the Canadian and Red Rivers. As early as
the 1940s, Alex D. Krieger (1946, 1978)
observed the existence of this cultural
boundary and suggested that it repre-
sented the southern limit of Central
Plains–tradition complexes or inﬂuence.
It is notable that brownware pottery oc-
curs in very few sites in the Canadian
River drainage, while it is much more
common to the south in the Red River
and Brazos River drainages. Conversely,
while sites yielding Woodland pottery are
common in the Canadian River valley,
only a few are found in the northern trib-
utaries of the upper Red River, and none
are known south of the Prairie Dog Town
Fork. Consequently, deﬁning the rela-
tionships between the Palo Duro and the
nearby Plains Woodland and Southwest-
ern cultural phases and complexes is criti-
cal to understanding the Late Prehistoric
I period (ca. a.d. 500 –1100/1200) in the
Caprock Canyonlands.

The goals of this chapter are to: (1) de-

scribe the Caprock Canyonlands as an
archeologically signiﬁcant ecological sub-

PALO DURO COMPLEX / 297

region, (2) summarize the Late Holocene
culture history and paleoclimatic recon-
structions for the Caprock Canyonlands,
(3) identify pertinent regional cultural
phases and complexes that surround the
Palo Duro complex, (4) identify the im-
portant archeological remains that are
attributed to the Palo Duro complex,
(5) reevaluate and redeﬁne the Palo Duro
complex in light of recent archeological
ﬁnds, and (6) speculate on the intercul-
tural relationships between Palo Duro
peoples and the cultures around them.

This chapter evolved out of the ongo-
ing cultural resources studies at Lake Alan
Henry, a municipal-use water reservoir
built for the City of Lubbock, Texas.
From 1987 to 1993, Prewitt and Associ-
ates, Inc., of Austin, Texas, conducted
archeological surveys, testing, and data
recovery within the 11,280-acre project
area on the Double Mountain Fork of the
Brazos River in Garza and Kent Coun-
ties, Texas. Each phase of work resulted
in a separate archeological report, and the
publication of a regional synthetic arche-
ological overview concluded these studies.
The extensive research done in conjunc-
tion with the regional synthesis (Boyd
et al. 1997a) helped to redeﬁne the cul-
ture history of the Caprock Canyonlands.
One of the more signiﬁcant contributions
of this work is a thorough reevaluation
of the early Ceramic period Palo Duro
Complex, which is the subject of this
chapter.

The Caprock Canyonlands:
Environmental Diversity,
Paleoenvironment,
and Culture History

One of the important conclusions
reached during the course of the Lake
Alan Henry archeological investigations
is that the traditional view of the Texas
Panhandle Plains environment and ecol-
ogy is an oversimpliﬁcation that obscures
some very important concepts that have
signiﬁcant bearing on archeological inter-
pretations. The traditional archeological
view is that the Texas Southern Plains
comprises only two regions—the High
Plains and Lower Plains. The High Plains
and Lower Plains are distinct in many
ways, and each is broadly characterized by
its own geology and physiography, cli-
mate and hydrology, and ﬂora and fauna.

What became apparent during the course
of the investigations at Lake Alan Henry,
however, is that the archeology of the
project area did not ﬁt neatly with that
of either the High Plains or Lower Plains.
The greatest similarities were seen in
other project areas located in the rugged
canyonlands along the Caprock Escarp-
ment, but not to the west in the vast ex-
panses of Llano Estacado ﬂatlands or to
the east in the rolling hills that make up
most of the Lower Plains. Emerging from
this research, then, was the concept of the
Caprock Escarpment as its own archeo-
logical region— one that is intimately re-
lated to but distinct from the archeology
of the High Plains and most of the Lower
Plains.

The southern end of the High Plains,

which is physically separated from the
central Great Plains by the wide Cana-
dian River valley, is an isolated plateau
called the Llano Estacado. It is the single
dominating physiographic feature in the
southern Great Plains. It is a ﬂat, nearly
featureless plain broken only by occa-
sional ephemeral stream valleys (or draws)
and small basins called playas (that sea-
sonally hold rainwater) or pluvial lakes
(that intersect the underlying Ogallala
groundwater aquifer). To the east of the
Llano Estacado is the Lower Plains re-
gion, which largely comprises undulating
or rolling hills of soft Permian mudstones
that have been severely eroded. Hence,
other names that have been used for this
region include the Redbed Plains, Eroded
Plains, Rolling Plains, Western Rolling
Plains, and Low Rolling Plains.

While the notion that the High Plains

and Lower Plains are environmentally
unique is accurate, it is a gross oversim-
pliﬁcation. Sandwiched between the
Llano Estacado and the Lower Plains is
the Caprock Escarpment, which consti-
tutes the eastern edge of headward stream
erosion eating away at the High Plains
plateau. The Caprock Escarpment is of-
ten thought of as a single dividing line,
but it is more realistically viewed as a
long, north-south strip of rugged canyon-
lands separating the High Plains from the
Rolling Plains. The Caprock Canyon-
lands generally coincide with exposures of
Tertiary Ogallala and Triassic Dockum
Group Formations on any state geological
map. Because the Ogallala caliche and
Triassic sandstones are more resistant to

cus on the canyonlands of the Red River
(including Palo Duro Canyon). For vari-
ous political reasons, the National Park
Service never followed up on any of its
proposals (Flores 1990, 160 – 65), but
the State of Texas has created two small
parks along the Caprock Escarpment:
the 16,400-acre Palo Duro Canyon State
Park, and the 13,906-acre Caprock Can-
yons State Park. Just as modern humans
ﬁnd the Caprock Canyonlands to be
unique and inviting, so too did the pre-
historic Native Americans living in the
Southern Plains, and it is not surprising
to ﬁnd that the archeology of this subre-
gion also is unique. This revelation is not
entirely new, but the culture history syn-
thesis by Boyd et al. (1997) is the ﬁrst
attempt to formalize the concept of the
Caprock Canyonlands as a unique arche-
ological subregion.

The environmental characteristics of
the Caprock Canyonlands, and the many
subtleties that distinguish it from the
High Plains and Rolling Plains, are not
described in detail here. What is impor-
tant is recognition of the fact that, be-
cause of its geologic and geomorphic his-
tory, the Caprock Canyonlands was an
oasis in an otherwise arid landscape. For
prehistoric peoples, the canyonlands pro-
vided more abundant (in terms of quality
and quantity) and predictable resources
than anywhere else in the Southern Plains:
natural shelter, ﬁrewood, raw lithic mate-
rials, plant and animal foods, and, most
importantly, water. Freshwater springs
emerging primarily from the Ogallala
aquifer, and to a lesser extent from Trias-
sic and Quaternary aquifers, are common
all along the Caprock Escarpment, and
major riverine systems were generally
well watered in prehistoric times. Prior to
the depletion of groundwater aquifers in
the twentieth century, such springs and
spring-fed tributaries provided abundant
water and lush vegetation that attracted
humans and animals. Water has always
been, and still is, the single most critical
resource dictating the distribution of
plant, animal, and human communities
throughout the Southern Plains. Prehis-
toric peoples recognized this fact, and
they adapted their lifestyles and settle-
ment patterns accordingly.

In contrast to the well-watered canyon-
lands, surface water over most of the Llano
Estacado was (with a few exceptions such

erosion than anything above or below,
differential erosion has resulted in the for-
mation of a rugged canyonland topogra-
phy. The term “Caprock Canyonlands” is
a ﬁtting name for this north-south corri-
dor that divides the High Plains from the
Rolling Plains (Fig. 10.1).

Caprock Canyonlands is a term bor-
rowed from Dan Flores (1990), whose
book Caprock Canyonlands: Journeys into
the Heart of the Southern Plains is a trea-
tise on the unique ecological character of
the rugged canyons along the Caprock

Escarpment. Notably, the Natural Heri-
tage Policy Research Project, a Texas ecol-
ogy project sponsored by the Lyndon B.
Johnson School of Public Affairs at the
University of Texas at Austin, calls this
area the “Escarpment Breaks” and recog-
nizes that it is a distinct ecological subre-
gion. In addition, the National Park Ser-
vice recognized the ecological importance
of the escarpment canyonlands as early as
the 1920s, and in 1934 they considered
the development of a million-acre “Na-
tional Park of the Plains” that would fo-

as major pluvial lakes or spring-fed draw
segments) sporadically distributed, sub-
ject to considerable seasonal ﬂuctuation,
and generally unpredictable. The same is
true of the Rolling Plains, but the water
supply there also suffers from one addi-
tional problem. Any surface or ground-
water that passes through the Permian
redbed country becomes salinized, often
to the point of being undrinkable because
it is several times more salty than seawa-
ter. Therefore, it is likely that there were
large areas of the Rolling Plains where
little or no potable water could be found
during prehistoric times.

The resource-rich Caprock Canyon-
lands played a major role in the develop-
ment and evolution of cultures in the
Southern Plains. The escarpment area
seems to have been a critical zone, in
terms of subsistence and settlement, for
many different prehistoric populations
over many thousands of years. In a sim-
plistic fashion, the Caprock Canyonlands
may be viewed as a home base for many
cultures whose seasonally oriented activi-

ties extended over a much larger territory
that included the Llano Estacado and
Rolling Plains. Boyd et al. (1997) re-
viewed the regional paleoenvironmental
and cultural data for the Middle to Late
Holocene in the southern Panhandle
Plains and Caprock Canyonlands, and
summaries of their interpretations are
presented in Fig. 10.2. The various lines
of evidence that form the foundation of
these interpretations are not presented
here, but it is notable that the paleo-
environmental reconstruction and cul-
ture history are a general consensus of
studies done throughout the Southern
Plains. The focus of the remainder of
this chapter is the Late Prehistoric I cul-
tural period from prior to a.d. 500 to
ca. a.d. 1100/1200.

the Southern Plains, and the cultural
conditions and changes that characterize
the Palo Duro Complex cannot be fully
understood without a brief mention of
the archeological manifestations deﬁned
for surrounding areas (Fig. 10.3 and
Table 10.1). The Late Prehistoric I pe-
riod in the Caprock Canyonlands spans
the entire Plains Woodland stage of cul-
tural development in the Texas Panhandle
(i.e., the Lake Creek Complex), and the
latter part of the period is contemporane-
ous with late Plains Woodland/formative
Plains Village occupations in western
Oklahoma (i.e., the Custer phase) and
with unknown cultural groups in west-
central Texas (i.e., the Blow Out Moun-
tain phase). This period also coincides
with the Southwestern pithouse periods
in southeastern New Mexico and far
western Texas (i.e., the El Paso and Doña
Ana phases of the Jornada branch of the
Mogollon, the Querecho and Maljamar
phases of the eastern extension of the
Jornada Mogollon, and the 18 Mile and
Mesita Negra phases of the Middle Pecos)
and ends at the time of the pithouse to
surface pueblo transition. The reader is
referred to Bell (1984a), Brooks (1989),
Corley (1965a), Creel (1990), Hofman
(1975, 1978, 1984a, 1984b), Hofman
and Brooks (1989), J. Hughes (1991), Je-
linek (1967), LeBlanc and Whalen 1980,
Lehmer (1948), Leslie (1979), and Lintz
(1982, 1984, 1986) for general informa-
tion on these and other Plains Woodland
and Plains Village manifestations in the
southern Great Plains.

Many sites in the Caprock Canyon-
lands and surrounding areas date to the
Late Prehistoric I period and are of con-
siderable importance for deﬁning the Palo
Duro Complex (Fig. 10.4). Many of the
sites have been attributed to the Palo
Duro Complex, but a large number of
sites in the Texas Panhandle and western
Oklahoma have evidence of contempora-
neous Plains Woodland occupations.
Plains Woodland sites in the Texas Pan-
handle are attributed to the Lake Creek
Complex ( J. Hughes 1962, 1991). A de-
tailed summary of the Lake Creek Com-
plex is beyond the scope of this chapter
(see Boyd et al. 1997), but this manifesta-
tion is discussed later because it is critical
to deﬁning the nature of the interaction
between Plains Woodland and Palo Duro
Complex peoples.

Archeological Remains
of the Palo Duro Complex

Based on the 1973 –74 excavations at
Deadman’s Shelter in Mackenzie Reser-
voir, Patrick S. Willey and Jack T. Hughes
(1978b) proposed that the site was repre-
sentative of a widespread cultural mani-
festation characterized mainly by Mogo-
llon brownwares and early corner- and
basal-notched arrow points. Many other

sites in the Red River drainage had pro-
duced similar materials and were thought
to be related to this new “Palo Duro
Complex” (Willey and Hughes 1978b,
190). A few more Palo Duro sites have
been investigated since that time, includ-
ing some in the Brazos River drainage,
and the complex now covers a larger area
than was originally proposed (see Fig. 10.4
and Table 10.1). The chronology of the

Palo Duro Complex is known primarily
from radiocarbon dates from eight sites
(Table 10.2).

Most of the Palo Duro sites that have
been tested or excavated may be grouped
into one of two site type categories—
camp sites or rockshelters—and there ap-
pears to be considerable variability in site
function within these groups. Recent in-
vestigations have added a third category,

that of residential bases, to the site type
inventory, also adding a new dimension to
the settlement pattern. A fourth class of
archeological remains, that of human
burials, also has important implications
for deﬁning the complex. Each of these
site types is discussed below.

Residential Bases

The Kent Creek and Sam Wahl sites
are the only two sites that have been posi-
tively identiﬁed as residential bases of the
Palo Duro Complex. Two other sites that
have not been adequately investigated
have been tentatively proposed as possible
residential bases of the Palo Duro Com-
plex. These two sites are important be-
cause they highlight the fact that there
may be many other Palo Duro residential
base sites that have not yet been identiﬁed.
J. S. Hays (1986, 10 –11, 20) identi-
ﬁes a probable Palo Duro Complex site
(PPHM-A2042) in the Buffalo Lake Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge, Randall County,
Texas. This site was initially visited in
1980 by Hughes ( Jack T. Hughes ﬁeld-
notes, February 6, 1980), who observed a
greater density of cultural materials (e.g.,

bone fragments, ﬁre-cracked quartzite,
burned caliche, and lithic debris) than
seen at any other site in the refuge. Arti-
facts observed or collected consist of dart
points, arrow points (including some
Deadman’s), bifaces, unifaces, ground
stones, and sherds of Mogollon brown-
ware. A test pit indicated that substantial
buried deposits exist. Of particular im-
portance, Hughes noted that several de-
pressions at the site were probably pit-
houses. Without further testing, however,
the interpretation that the site represents a
Palo Duro pithouse village was tentative.
Tahoka Lake, a large pluvial lake in
Lynn County, Texas, also has been sug-
gested as a possible location of a pithouse
site that might be related to the Palo
Duro Complex (see Boyd 1995a, 1995b).
LeRoy Johnson, Jr. (1992 personal com-
munication), remembered seeing possible
pithouse depressions and Mogollon ce-
ramics in the vicinity of Tahoka Lake
many years ago, prior to the complete
cultivation of the area. Lacking an ade-
quate archeological investigation, how-
ever, it is impossible to evaluate the po-
tential for the existence of a Palo Duro

pithouse site near Tahoka Lake. Surface
collections from a site 5 km south of
Tahoka Lake have yielded corner-notched
and stemmed arrow points, indicating the
presence of Late Prehistoric I occupa-
tions, but no pottery was found (Riggs
1965). W. C. Watts (1963, 1– 4) notes
that undifferentiated brownwares have
been found near Tahoka Lake and at
many other lake sites on the southern
Llano Estacado. Watts’s (1963) study is
quite outdated, but another ceramic dis-
tribution study is in progress (Wiseman
et al. 1994) and eventually should pro-
vide much more detailed information on
Southwestern wares on the Llano Esta-
cado. Even with the limited amount of
data available at this time, the presence of
Palo Duro Complex occupations on the
southern Llano Estacado should not be
discounted.

Both of the sites that have been identi-
ﬁed conﬁdently as residential bases of the
Palo Duro Complex have been investi-
gated intensively. The Kent Creek site,
located along a spring-fed tributary of the
North Pease River in southeastern Hall
County, was excavated in 1985 –86 by

The ﬂoor of this structure was virtually
devoid of artifacts.

Because of their differences, Structure

1 is interpreted as a habitation while
Structure 2 is thought to represent a stor-
age facility, but they both exhibit some
similar characteristics. Both structures
have clay-plastered entryways, approxi-
mately 1 m wide and more than 2 m
long, in the form of ramps that gradually
slope upward from the ﬂoor level. The
pithouses are shallow, with ﬂoor levels at
approximately 35 cm below the ground
surface. Some erosional beveling of the
landform probably has occurred, but it is
unlikely that the houses were dug down
much more than 50 cm, and some form
of superstructure must have extended
above ground. Pieces of daub recovered
from the ﬁll of Structure 1 suggested that
it may have had a wattle-and-daub super-
structure. Patches of clay/gravel and large
rocks with plaster remnants found in the
ﬁll may indicate that Structure 1 had a
partial masonry superstructure.

The possible structure is a small (190
by 85 cm) subrectangular depression with
cobbles, gravel, and daub fragments mixed
in its ﬁll and a mano cache (n#3) along
one end. Since it is too small to have been
a habitation, this possible structure may
have served as a storage facility or perhaps
a small grinding shelter.

The precise duration of the occupa-
tions at the Kent Creek site are not well
established since there are only three ra-
diocarbon dates (see Table 10.2). The two
dates from the baking pit are problem-
atic. They may indicate reuse of the fea-
ture at different times, but the scenario of
two use episodes several hundred years
apart does not seem likely. The 1-sigma
ranges for these two dates do overlap
somewhat, at a.d. 902 –985, and the fea-
ture might date to this time. Another in-
terpretation is that the older date is accu-
rate while the upper sample may have been
contaminated by younger carbon. The
latter seems most likely since the standard
deviation for the upper baking pit sample
is quite large (i.e., ! 250 years). Since the
earlier baking pit date is very close to the
date for Structure 1, it is suggested that
the site occupations occurred primarily
around a.d. 700 –1000. Cruse (1992,
124) calibrated an average of the three

cupied between a.d. 690 and 1010, and

J. Brett Cruse (1992) and was the ﬁrst site
where habitation structures were identi-
ﬁed. The early occupation period at the
Sam Wahl site, situated in the canyon-
lands along the Double Mountain Fork
of the Brazos River in Garza County, was
identiﬁed as a residential base as a result
of excavations by Boyd et al. (1994). The
similarities and differences between these
two sites have important implications for
deﬁning the Palo Duro Complex.

Kent Creek Site (41HL66)

The 62 m2 of hand excavations at the
Kent Creek site uncovered two complete
rectangular pithouses, a possible third
structure, and ﬁve extramural features
(Fig. 10.5). The last consists of two oval
pits (one clay-lined and one clay-capped)
that may have functioned as storage facili-
ties, a small rock-lined hearth, an unlined
hearth, and a large baking pit (80 cm in
diameter and 30 cm deep) ﬁlled with ash,
charcoal, and burned rocks. Charcoal
from the lower and upper portions of the
baking pit provided calibrated radiocar-
bon age ranges of a.d. 733 –985 and a.d.
902 –1393, respectively. Two postholes

located just outside Structure 1 could
represent extramural activities, or they
may be related to the structure.

Structure 1 is a rectangular (4.3 by
3.3 m) pithouse with an east-facing en-
tryway centered along one long wall. In-
terior features include a trough or step-
down just inside the house (probably a
water trap), a large posthole just off cen-
ter, three other postholes along the front
and side walls, and two clusters of burned
caliche rocks, thought to be heating
ovens, on the ﬂoor. A subﬂoor human
burial (see subsection on burials below)
also was found in the center of Structure
1, but the house was abandoned at the
time the individual was interred, and the
burial pit could have destroyed a central
hearth. Charcoal from the ﬂoor of Struc-
ture 1 was radiocarbon dated to a.d.
665 –977, providing an approximate age
for the occupation of the pithouse and
the subﬂoor burial.

Structure 2 is a rectangular (2.3 by
3.3 m) house with a west-facing entryway
and no interior features except for shallow
“troughs” or depressions all along the
front and back walls (possible water traps).

the total duration of the occupations may
have been between one hundred and three
hundred years.

More than thirteen thousand artifacts
were collected from Kent Creek, includ-
ing ﬁfty-seven arrow points (Deadman’s
and Scallorn are the only identiﬁable
types), twelve dart points (some identiﬁed
as Ellis), a variety of other chipped lithic
tools (bifaces, unifaces, drills, gouges, and
spokeshaves), cores and debitage, twenty
manos and eight metate fragments, and
thirty-four brownware sherds. Of the
latter, most were identiﬁed as Jornada
Brown, Roswell Brown, or Middle Pecos
Micaceous Brown, while one sherd is un-
like any varieties of Jornada Mogollon
pottery and could represent a locally
made brownware. The faunal assemblage
indicates that the inhabitants killed and
ate more deer and/or antelope than they
did any other animals, and only one bi-
son element was recovered. Other ani-
mals that may have been utilized for food
include skunks, rabbits, and turtles, while
snake, prairie dog, and other rodent re-
mains are probably intrusive. Pollen analy-
ses provided somewhat equivocal results
(and a preservation bias is likely), but
slightly higher concentrations of cheno-
ams were observed in some features.
Charred plant remains recovered from
extramural features indicate that goose-
foot and purslane may have been food
resources, and juniper and cottonwood/
willow were used as ﬁrewood. In addi-
tion, charred oak acorns were recovered
from the ﬁll of the burial, from a trough
depression inside Structure 2, and from
the possible structure. Although the spe-
cies was not identiﬁed, it is likely that
these acorns represent the use of shin oak
(Quercus havardii) as a food resource.
The number of analyzed pollen and ﬂota-
tion samples was minimal, and Cruse
notes that “the possibility that horticul-
ture was practiced cannot be ruled out”
(Cruse 1992, 141).

The Kent Creek site is interpreted as a
multifunctional residential village, but its
size (i.e., the number of pithouses pres-
ent) is unknown because the excavated
area represents only a small portion of a
much larger site. The primary activities
that are evident at the site are hunting
and processing of small to medium-sized
animals; procurement, processing, and
possibly storage of plant foods; and a

full range of lithic tool manufacture and
maintenance.

Sam Wahl Site (41GR291)

The Sam Wahl site was discovered in

1987 (Boyd et al. 1989) and tested in
1988 (Boyd et al. 1990). Diagnostic and
unusual artifacts recovered consist of four
arrow points (including one Scallorn and
one Deadman’s), an untyped dart point,
two plain brownware sherds ( Jornada or
Roswell Brown), and a fragment of a pen-
dant made of nonlocal kaolinite that is vi-
sually identical to the hydrothermally al-
tered kaolinite found at Burro Mesa in
Big Bend National Park (Alex 1990). No
radiocarbon dates were obtained, and a

thermoluminescence date on a burned
rock yielded an erroneous age. The site
occupations were considered to date to
Late Prehistoric I times and to represent a
manifestation of the Palo Duro Complex.
Data recovery excavations in 1992
consisted of extensive mechanical excava-
tions (three long maintainer blade cuts
and 36 backhoe trenches) and hand exca-
vation of 106 units, each measuring 1 by
1 m (Fig. 10.6). The extensive mechani-
cal excavations were done in an effort to
locate buried structures and features, and
these excavations were quite successful.
Many of the features that were critical for
accurately interpreting the site (i.e., the
pithouse and storage pit features) were

ture complex that consists of a pithouse,
10 storage pits, and 2 baking pits that
are radiocarbon dated to ca. a.d. 600 to
1050/1100. The pithouse (Feature 37)
is an oval, basin-shaped depression that
is 3 by 3.5 m and was dug down ap-
proximately 40 cm below the former
ground surface into the bedrock substrate
(Fig. 10.8). Two large oval-basin metates
were found cached (i.e., stored upside
down) inside the pithouse, and a third
slab-type metate in the structure (found
in the backhoe trench) also may have
been cached. Subtle burned areas in the
central ﬂoor of the pithouse may repre-
sent an interior hearth(s); no deﬁnite en-
tryway was identiﬁed, but it may have
been to the southwest. Charred mesquite
beans were recovered from the ﬂoor of
the pithouse.

The ten storage pits (Features 17–20,
24 –25, 30 –32, and 39) are all quite sim-
ilar in morphology, being round in plan-
view and ranging from 85 to 110 cm in
diameter and 50 to 80 cm deep with
rounded to ﬂat bottoms and sides that ta-
per slightly inward (Fig. 10.9). All of the
pits are intrusive about 40 to 60 cm into
bedrock, and two had large oval-basin
metates cached (again upside down) at
the top of the pit. The ﬁll of these fea-
tures is generally fairly clean sandy sedi-
ment (except for one that may have been
backﬁlled with trash), and there is little
doubt that they represent storage pits.
They are all clustered into a relatively
small 8 by 8 m area (see Fig. 10.6), and it
is hypothesized that they were located in
this particular spot and dug into the bed-
rock in order to provide rodent-proof
storage. The estimated storage capacities
of these pits range from 0.24 to 0.31 m3
for the smallest to 0.53 to 0.68 m3 for the
largest. Flotation samples did not provide
deﬁnitive evidence of what was being
stored, but charred grass seeds (four taxa)
were abundant and may represent the use
of grass linings inside the pits.

Other features associated with the
early occupation period include two bak-
ing pits that presumably were used to
cook some type of plant food. Unfortu-
nately, ﬂotation of the feature ﬁll failed to
yield any deﬁnitive macrobotanical evi-
dence of what plants were being cooked.
Notably, the rocks used in the construc-
tion of one of the baking pits included

Fig. 10.7. Graph of calibrated radiocarbon dates from the Sam Wahl site.

ﬁrst encountered in maintainer bladecuts
and backhoe trenches, and they might
not have been discovered otherwise.

By the end of the data recovery inves-

tigations, 37 cultural features had been
documented and 3,970 artifacts had been
recovered. Site chronology is established
by eleven radiocarbon dates that indicate
numerous occupations over a long period
of time (Fig. 10.7). When the features,
calibrated radiocarbon dates, and artifacts
were analyzed, it was clear that they were
separable into three time periods that
were deﬁned as separate analysis units.

A burial component consists of a single

cairn-covered burial (discussed below)
that is radiocarbon dated to ca. a.d. 230
to 400. This burial is some two centuries
earlier than, and may be unrelated to, the
earliest occupational evidence at the site.
The late occupation period is deﬁned by
1,916 artifacts and two features that are
radiocarbon dated to ca. a.d. 1150/1200
to 1350/1400. These later occupations
postdate the Palo Duro Complex and ap-
pear to have been quite different from the
earlier occupations.

The early occupation period is attrib-

uted to the Palo Duro Complex and is
represented by 1,445 artifacts and a fea-

twenty-ﬁve recycled groundstone frag-
ments (mano, metate, and indeterminate
fragments) representing 31 percent of the
total rocks.

In addition to the pithouse/storage
pit/baking pit complex, two bedrock
mortars were found 170 m southwest of
the pithouse. Although these features can-
not be directly dated, they are indirectly
associated with the early occupation pe-
riod because a broken pestle was found
on the ﬂoor of the pithouse. This pestle
provides circumstantial evidence that
mortars were used at approximately the
same time as the pithouse.

One of the late occupation period fea-
tures (Feature 12) is of particular impor-
tance and is radiocarbon dated to ca. a.d.

1200. It is a well-deﬁned, ovate (2 by
3 m) charcoal-stained area that is super-
imposed on, and deﬁnitely postdates, two
of the storage pits (Features 17 and 18).
A small charcoal-ﬁlled pit along one edge
of the stain appears to represent an in situ
unlined hearth. This feature is interpreted
as representing an ephemeral surface
house with a small interior ﬁreplace. If
this interpretation is correct, then the oc-
cupants of the Sam Wahl site may have
shifted from living in pithouses during
Palo Duro times to living in surface
houses after ca. a.d. 1100.

The early occupation is interpreted as
a small pithouse village of the Palo Duro
Complex. Plant procurement, processing,
and storage were major activities. Except

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

for the mesquite beans found in the pit-
house, the speciﬁc plants that might have
been utilized are not well documented.
Charred remains of some other plants,
such as Chenopodium and cucurbit seeds,
may represent food resources, but their
archeological contexts do not conﬁrm
this interpretation. The charred cucurbit
seeds cannot be identiﬁed as to species
and probably represent a wild species
(such as buffalo gourd) rather than a cul-
tivated variety, but the absence of domes-
ticated plants in the macrobotanical
samples from 41GR291 cannot be in-
terpreted as an absence of agriculture al-
together. Since the absence of cultigen
remains could be due to differential pres-
ervation or plant-processing techniques
that did not result in charred remains,
the question of whether the early occu-
pants were involved in farming must
remain open.

The archeological evidence (primarily

the features and artifacts) suggests that
there were dramatic changes in site func-
tion and subsistence activities around
a.d. 1100. In general, the early occupa-
tion period is characterized by a greater
dependence upon plant processing (i.e.,
more and larger groundstone tools), and
the late occupation period is characterized
by a greater reliance upon hunting (i.e.,
more arrow points) and an increase in the
manufacture of chipped stone tools (i.e.,
more unmodiﬁed debitage). It is hypoth-
esized that the increasing importance of
hunting activities and the shift from pit-
houses to surface houses are related to
climatic changes that occurred around
a.d. 1100. There is not enough evidence
to determine whether the late occupations
represent a late variant of the Palo Duro
Complex or something else entirely.

Camp Sites and Rockshelters

Twelve camp sites and four rockshel-
ters that have been tested/excavated con-
stitute the bulk of the archeological data
for the Palo Duro Complex. Boyd et al.
(1997) present individual site summaries
for Palo Duro camp sites and rockshel-
ters, but here they are discussed only
brieﬂy as a group.

Subsurface investigations at many
open camp sites have produced deﬁnable
Palo Duro components with artifact as-
semblages that are useful for comparative

purposes, while investigations at other
camp sites have yielded only minimal
evidence of Palo Duro occupations
(Table 10.3). The level of work at these
sites varies from minimal testing with
scattered units to comprehensive excava-
tions involving large blocks of contiguous
units. The discreteness of the Palo Duro
components or occupations and the qual-
ity of the data reporting also range from
very good to very poor. Thus, one must
take into account the quality and quan-
tity of the archeological data when eval-
uating the interpretations offered by
various investigators. To illustrate the
differences, it is notable that only ﬁve of
the camp sites meet the following criteria:
(1) have discrete Palo Duro components
with deﬁnable artifact assemblages of more
than one thousand specimens, (2) have
had more than 30 m2 of hand excavation,
and (3) have adequately reported excava-
tion data that are useful for comparative
purposes. As discussed later, however, it is
clear that the camp sites vary considerably
in terms of site function and intensity of
use/occupation.

One point in regard to open camp site

investigations is worth stressing. Most
camp sites attributed to the Palo Duro
Complex were investigated before pit-

house structures were recognized as an
important component of the complex.
The existence of residential base villages
with semipermanent structures was not
realized until about 1986, and archeolo-
gists were not consciously searching for
such evidence prior to this time. Cruse
(1992) excavated at the Kent Creek site
for quite some time before accidentally
discovering the pithouses there, and a
substantial mechanical testing effort at
the Sam Wahl site was speciﬁcally de-
signed to search for buried houses. Since
the pithouses at these sites were unde-
tectable on the surface, it is very possible
that many of the camp sites listed in
Table 10.3 are actually residential bases.
Sites that have a wide diversity of features
and artifact types, brownware ceramics,
and large groundstone tool assemblages
are particularly likely to be residential
bases.

The South Sage Creek site, for ex-
ample, is a good candidate for a possible
residential base. It is the only other site in
the region that has yielded a complete
large-basin metate, like those found in as-
sociation with the pithouse and storage
pits at the Sam Wahl site. Unfortunately,
the South Sage Creek site was not recog-
nized as a Palo Duro Complex site at the

time that the data recovery work was
planned, and without anyone having
realized the potential for structural re-
mains, the investigation strategy was
quite different from that employed at
the Sam Wahl site.

Four rockshelters in the Caprock

Canyonlands contain evidence of occupa-
tions by Palo Duro peoples or date to
Palo Duro Complex times. The archeo-
logical evidence suggests that the canyon-
land rockshelters were used in different
ways by Palo Duro peoples (Table 10.4).
Occupations at Boren Shelter No. 2
(lower shelter) were brief and periodic,
generating little cultural debris (only
twenty-eight artifacts, excluding deb-
itage). Occupations at the Canyon City
Club Cave also appear to have been brief
and generated few artifacts (n#44, ex-
cluding debitage), but the greater number
of projectile points and bones indicates
that hunting was a primary activity. In
contrast, a higher frequency of artifacts
(n#643, excluding debitage) indicates
that occupations at Deadman’s Shelter
were much more intensive (i.e., of longer
duration and more frequent). While hunt-
ing is well represented (i.e., points ac-
count for 15 percent of all artifacts), the
number of manos and metates is excep-

In addition, the total artifact assemblage
from Deadman’s is quite variable and cer-
tainly denotes a wide range of activities.
Consequently, the data are interpreted
to mean that occupations at Deadman’s
Shelter were more like those at multifunc-
tional camp sites or residential bases than
those at the other rockshelters.

Burials

Human burials in the Southern Plains

are particularly important because they
provide direct evidence of cultural be-
haviors other than subsistence activities
documented at most sites. There are only
ten locations in the region that include
burials dating to Late Prehistoric I times
and that have a bearing on deﬁning or
explaining the Palo Duro Complex
(Fig. 10.10). Of these, only seven burials
at ﬁve localities are deﬁnitely or possibly
afﬁliated with the Palo Duro Complex.
The burial of an adult male, in an al-
most extended position with its legs semi-
ﬂexed in an oval pit inside Deadman’s
Shelter, is described by Willey and Hughes
(1978b, 154, 190). The skeleton was ac-
companied by the following artifacts as
grave offerings: a complete terrapin (mud
turtle) shell, two mussel shells, and nine
modiﬁed deer bones (an awl, an ulna, and
seven neatly stacked split metapodial
halves). The burial apparently occurred
during or near the end of Stratum D
times, radiocarbon dated to a.d. 79 –383
(see Table 10.2). Based on similarities in
cranial measurements, Willey (1978) in-

dicated that Deadman’s cranium was
most similar to skeletal populations at
Pecos pueblo and to Middle Woodland
and Kansas Hopewell populations. He
tentatively suggested a possible genetic
afﬁliation representing a mixture of
Southwestern and Woodland traits.

The burial of an adult female, tightly

ﬂexed in a circular pit in the ﬂoor of
Structure 1 at the Kent Creek site (see
Fig. 10.5), contained four modiﬁed deer
bones (one awl and three split metapodial
halves) and three modiﬁed mussel shells as
grave offerings. One of the mussel valves
had a ground edge and may have been
used as a scraper, while the other two had
drilled holes, were found in the chest area,
and probably were worn as pendants. The
tip of an arrow point was found beneath
the skeleton, and since the grave ﬁll was
otherwise devoid of cultural material,
Cruse (1992, 55) speculated that an ar-
row wound may have been the cause of
death. Since the pit was dug into the ﬂoor
and the gravelly ﬁll was piled up above
the level of the ﬂoor, the pithouse must
have been abandoned immediately after
the interment. Thus, a radiocarbon date
on charcoal from the ﬂoor of Structure 1
places the approximate age of the inter-
ment at a.d. 665 –977 (see Table 10.2).

The Jim Arnold site, also located along

Kent Creek in Hall County, consists of
an approximately 60-cm thick cultural
zone exposed in a gravel pit. Two separate
but closely spaced burial pits observed
in the wall of the gravel pit were subse-
quently investigated by Curtis D. Tunnell

(1964). Both burials had been disturbed
by gravel operations and subsequent
slumping of the edges of the gravel pit
walls. Hence, the skeletal materials and
artifacts that were recovered are incom-
plete, but sufﬁcient information was sal-
vaged to indicate the nature of the graves.
Burial 1, a young adult female, had been
dislodged from the burial pit, but four
modiﬁed deer bones (two awls and two
awl fragments) were found with the re-
deposited skeletal remains. Burial 2, an
adult male, was partially intact, probably
in a semiﬂexed position, inside an oval
pit. Associated grave offerings, which
were found in situ, consisted of six modi-
ﬁed deer bones (three awls and three split
metapodial halves), three mussel shells
(two unworked valves and one with
notches along its ventral edge), and a
bifacial chert knife.

The graves at the Jim Arnold site, lo-
cated within 1 m of each other, are simi-
lar in that both were primary interments
in shallow oval pits, both were in identi-
cal stratigraphic contexts with identical
pit ﬁll, and both contained modiﬁed deer
bones. Tunnell (1964) noted that the
burial pits were intrusive into a sterile
zone from the bottom of the overlying
cultural zone. No investigation of the cul-
tural zone was made, but ﬂint artifacts
and bison bones were noted and dart
points were found on the surface. Tunnell
(1964) could not determine their age and
cultural afﬁliation, but subsequent re-
searchers ( J. Hughes 1991; B. Miller
1992; Willey and Hughes 1978b, 190)
have indicated that the Jim Arnold burials
are probably associated with the Palo
Duro Complex, and they noted that the
burial site is situated less than 2 km from
the Kent Creek site. Lacking a radiocar-
bon date or any temporally diagnostic ar-
tifacts, this burial is assigned to the Palo
Duro Complex only on the basis of simi-
larities in mortuary offerings.

The four burials described above are
considered to be afﬁliated with the Palo
Duro Complex, and they exhibit many
similar mortuary characteristics. All are
primary burials containing modiﬁed deer
bones as grave offerings, and three of the
burials contained a combination of deer
bone awls, split deer metapodials (awl
preforms), and modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed
mussel shells. The burials differ in pit
shape (round to oval) and in skeletal

precise location is not stated, the Double
Burial site is situated between 50 and
100 km north of the Kent Creek site.

The Double Burial is undated, but the
associated points indicate that it is proba-
bly contemporaneous with, and perhaps
related to, the Palo Duro Complex. This
was suggested by Willey and Hughes
(1978b, 190) based primarily on the sim-
ilarities of the burial points to the Dead-
man’s arrow point style. This interpreta-
tion is plausible, but the fact that these
two individuals probably were killed by
arrows tipped with Deadman’s-like points
is equally important. An alternative inter-
pretation is that these individuals may
have been killed by people of the Palo
Duro culture rather than having been
Palo Duro peoples themselves, and this
possibility also has been noted by Chris-
topher Lintz (1986, 225).

The only other burial that might pos-

sibly be associated with the Palo Duro
Complex is one found at the Sam Wahl
site. It is a single, cairn-covered human
interment (Feature 23 in Fig. 10.6) that is
radiocarbon dated to a.d. 256 – 415. The
human skeletal materials were found in
an oval pit and are interpreted as a sec-
ondary (i.e., bundle) burial of a middle-
aged male. The bones were extremely
fragmented and jumbled, and their con-
text (in a tight cluster in one portion of
the pit) suggested that they might have
been conﬁned inside an organic container
such as a basket or a hide bag. The only
grave inclusions were a ground and fac-
eted piece of hematite (i.e., paint stone)
and a Scallorn arrow point 6 cm long.
The latter was found in a context suggest-
ing that an arrow had been laid over the
bone cluster.

Since the Sam Wahl site burial dates to
the transitional Archaic period and is ear-
lier than the earliest documented occupa-
tions at the site, it is possible that the bur-
ial is not associated with the Palo Duro
Complex at all. This interpretation is
supported by the fact that the Sam Wahl
burial is quite different from the three
Palo Duro burials described above, none
of which are secondary cairn burials. An
alternative interpretation is that the burial
is afﬁliated with the early Palo Duro
Complex. Three lines of circumstantial
evidence suggest that this interpretation is
tenable: (1) the burial at the Sam Wahl
site is approximately contemporaneous

placement within the pits (nearly ex-
tended to tightly ﬂexed), but differences
in their intrasite contexts (one in a house,
two in open camp sites, and one in a
rockshelter) may account for some of this
variability.

Two individuals buried in a single
cairn-covered pit in Donley County were
excavated in 1938 (Witte 1955). Both
were buried in ﬂexed positions, but one
was reported to have been placed “head
downward” on top of a “carefully prepared
sitting burial” (Witte 1955, 85). The
skeletons represent adults (sex not deter-
mined) who had apparently been killed.

Two arrow points were found among the
ribs and left scapula of the ﬁrst individ-
ual, and ﬁve arrow points were found in
the torso and pelvic areas of the second
person. The points, several of which have
impact breaks, are quite similar to Dead-
man’s points in that they have corner to
basal notches and long prominent barbs
(see Witte 1955, plate 13), but the burial
specimens are generally larger (i.e., longer
and wider with slightly broader expand-
ing stems) and have serrated blades. No
grave offerings were present, but the
points indicate that the burial dates to the
Late Prehistoric I period. Although its

with the Palo Duro Complex burial at
Deadman’s Shelter; (2) the associated
Scallorn arrow point, although unusually
large, would not be stylistically out of
place in the Palo Duro Complex; and
(3) the burial was found at a pithouse vil-
lage of the Palo Duro Complex. Based on
the current evidence, however, the cul-
tural afﬁliation of the burial from the
Sam Wahl site is debatable, and the possi-
bility that it represents a burial of a tran-
sitional Archaic or even a Plains Wood-
land (i.e., Lake Creek) individual cannot
be discounted.

Redeﬁnition of the
Palo Duro Complex

Chronology

Many components attributed to the
Palo Duro Complex have been radiocar-
bon dated (Fig. 10.11; see Table 10.2).
Occupations that are attributable to the
Palo Duro Complex may have begun dur-
ing transitional Archaic times (ca. a.d.
1–500) but are deﬁnitely recognizable
by at least a.d. 500. Palo Duro occupa-
tions apparently continued until around
a.d. 1100, but they seem to disappear

quite suddenly. Thus, the Palo Duro
Complex is contemporaneous with the
Plains Woodland occupations in the
northern Texas Panhandle (i.e., the Lake
Creek Complex) and western Oklahoma,
the Blow Out Mountain phase of west-
central Texas, and the pithouse phases of
the Jornada Mogollon and Middle Pecos
areas.

Subsistence and Site Function
Material Culture

A comparison of artifacts recovered
from residential base camps, rockshelters,
and camp sites of the Palo Duro Com-
plex indicates that there are some signiﬁ-
cant similarities and differences between
and among these site types. The data
presented in Tables 10.5 and 10.6 show
that the Palo Duro material culture is ex-
tremely diverse overall but that there are
some sites, presumably where limited or
special activities occurred, where the di-
versity is rather low. The site data may be
compared using the artifact diversity in-
dex (see Table 10.6) as a crude represen-
tation of the variability in activities that
occurred on site. Not surprisingly, the
residential bases have the widest range of

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

activity diversity, with ﬁfteen to sixteen
of the seventeen artifact categories repre-
sented. Deadman’s Shelter also has a high
activity diversity, with ﬁfteen categories
represented, while all of the camp sites
exhibit moderate artifact diversities with
between ten and thirteen categories repre-
sented. Boren Shelter No. 2 has the low-
est artifact diversity with only nine of the
seventeen categories represented.

Two other calculations presented in
Table 10.6 are useful for further compar-
ing and contrasting these components.
One is the total artifact density, calcu-
lated as the number of artifacts per square
meter of excavation, and the other is the
adjusted artifact density, calculated as the
number of artifacts (excluding unmodi-
ﬁed debitage) per square meter of excava-
tion. These artifact densities are consid-
ered to be crude measures of the relative
intensity and/or duration of occupation.
The Kent Creek site and Deadman’s
Shelter have much higher total artifact
densities than do any of the other sites.
As discussed below, this situation may be
due to differences in site function or in
the total duration and intensity of the oc-
cupations, but one other factor also plays
a role in the unusually high artifact den-
sity seen at Kent Creek. The Kent Creek
site has a signiﬁcantly higher percentage
of unmodiﬁed debitage (accounting for
97 percent of all artifacts recovered) than
does Deadman’s Shelter (debitage repre-
sents 86 percent of all artifacts) or any
other site (debitage represents 76 to
91 percent of all artifacts). The differen-
tial availability of lithic source materials
seems to be a partial explanation for the
higher total artifact density at Kent Creek,
because it is the only site where good-
quality chert is immediately available and
abundant. Tecovas jasper, which is found
in the stream terrace gravels exposed on
site, comprises more than 90 percent of
all the stone artifacts at Kent Creek, and
most of the corticate debitage represents
stream-worn gravels (Cruse 1992, 72, and
table 2). Because the Kent Creek occu-
pants were sitting on a chert source area,
it is not surprising that they would gener-
ate a higher percentage of waste lithic de-
bris than would people in areas located
much farther from good-quality lithic
sources.

The immediate availability of lithic
material is only a partial explanation for

this phenomenon, because when the ad-
justed artifact densities are compared, the
Kent Creek site falls to second place, but
it still appears to have been used more in-
tensively than most of the other sites. The
adjusted artifact density indicates that the
most intensively occupied site is Dead-
man’s Shelter, and the radiocarbon dates
suggest that this may be due in part to the
long duration of repeated occupations
there (perhaps as much as ﬁve hundred to
eight hundred years). The spatial conﬁne-
ment of activities within the rockshelter
also may have played a role in that refuse
accumulation would be expected to be
much more concentrated.

The Kent Creek site, with the second
highest adjusted artifact density, has radio-
carbon dates that indicate this residential
base was occupied for at least 200 to 400
years and perhaps as long as 400 to 600
years. In contrast to Kent Creek, the least
intensively used site (except for Boren

Shelter No. 2) is Sam Wahl, and its radio-
carbon dates indicate that it was occupied
repeatedly for a long time, perhaps as
much as 450 years during the early occu-
pation period (see Fig. 10.11). Thus, one
must suspect that the differences in the
artifact densities at these two sites are re-
lated primarily to site function rather
than the duration of the occupations.

Another calculation useful for identi-
fying site function is the projectile point/
grinding tool index (see Table 10.6), cal-
culated as the number of projectile points
divided by the number of grinding tools
(manos, metates, and pestles only). The
projectile point/grinding tool index is a
crude measure of the relative importance
of hunting versus plant processing within
each component. When the adjusted arti-
fact densities are compared with the pro-
jectile point/grinding tool indexes, the
Palo Duro components display consider-
able variability that may be attributed to

differential site function and use intensity
(Fig. 10.12).

Somewhat surprisingly, the Kent Creek
site has the highest representation of hunt-
ing activities while the Sam Wahl site is
at the opposite end of the spectrum. The
vast difference in the index for each of
these residential bases is interpreted as
evidence that these two residential bases
functioned quite differently. While the
diversity of artifacts indicates that both
sites were multifunctional, the data pre-
sented in Fig. 10.12, along with other
lines of evidence discussed below, support
the interpretation that the Sam Wahl site
was a specialized residential base and that
the primary activities there were related
to the processing, storage, and utilization
of plant foods. The low artifact density at
Sam Wahl is further explained by the fact
that these activities would have generated
much less residue, particularly chipped
stones, than would hunting activities.

All of the Palo Duro camp sites exhibit

similar artifact densities but vary consid-
erably in terms of site function. While
hunting activities are fairly well repre-
sented at the County Line, Fatheree, and
South Ridge sites, plant processing was
very much the dominant activity at the
Blue Clay, South Sage Creek, Gobbler
Creek Bridge, and Cat Hollow sites. In
this regard, the latter sites are more like
the Sam Wahl site than they are the other
camp sites.

The chipped stone tool assemblages

from Palo Duro sites (see Table 10.5)
may be characterized as being rather ho-
mogeneous, but the relative frequencies
of artifacts vary considerably from site to
site. When only the chipped stone tools
(i.e., projectile points, drills, gouges, bi-
faces, cobble tools, unifaces, and edge-
modiﬁed ﬂakes) are considered and sites
with stone tool samples of fewer than
ﬁfty specimens are excluded, some inter-
esting patterns emerge. Unifaces and
edge-modiﬁed ﬂakes are the most com-
mon tools, and they respectively consti-
tute between 10 to 40 percent and 20 to
53 percent of all chipped stone tools in a
single site. Most of these tools cannot be

linked to speciﬁc functions, but they oc-
cur in relatively high frequencies both in
sites where activities were mainly hunting
oriented and in sites where plant process-
ing was the dominant activity. Projectile
points, bifaces, and cobble tools are less
common in general but are quite variable
from site to site, respectively constituting
between 2 to 43 percent, 3 to 24 percent,
and 2 to 26 percent of the chipped stones
at any one type of site. There is a ten-
dency for cobble tools to be much better
represented at plant-processing sites, and
it has been suggested that these tools may
have been used to refurbish (i.e., peck the
surfaces of ) grinding stones (Boyd et al.
1994, 78 –79, 145). Two classes, drills
and gouges, are generally rare and respec-
tively make up between 0 to 5 percent
and 0 to 8 percent of chipped stone tools
at any one site.

Most of the gouges found at Palo
Duro sites are Clear Fork–type unifaces
(E. Turner and Hester 1993, 246 – 49),
and they usually have some evidence of
haft wear. There is a tendency, albeit
weak, for these tools to be better repre-
sented at sites where intensive plant pro-
cessing occurred. If gouges were used for
wood working, as has been suggested for
south Texas (Hester et al. 1973), then it is
possible that they were used as adzes for
making and maintaining digging sticks or
other wooden tools. Alternatively, gouges
could have been used to tip the ends of
some type of multipurpose scraping/plan-
ing tool or digging stick (Ray 1941, 161–
62). Of particular interest, Clear Fork
gouges have been found in sufﬁcient fre-
quencies and at enough Palo Duro Com-
plex sites to dispel the popular notion
that they are diagnostic Archaic tools in
the Panhandle Plains (e.g., Bagot and
Hughes 1979, 50; Etchieson et al. 1977,
33, 35; 1978, 83; 1979, 353; D. Hughes
1984, 116; J. Hughes 1991, 19).

Dart points are present at some sites,
and despite the possibility of earlier com-
ponents in some cases, there seems to be
growing evidence for the contemporane-
ous use of dart and arrow points in the
Southern Plains between ca. a.d. 200 and
500 (see Boyd et al. 1997). The arrow
points associated with the Palo Duro
Complex are characterized as early cor-
ner-notched and stemmed forms that are
usually typed as Scallorn and Deadman’s,
respectively. However, arrow point assem-

blages also are characterized by a great
deal of variability, and there are seldom
but a few specimens from any one site
that can be considered classic Scallorn or
Deadman’s forms. One need only look at
the early arrow point forms from the Sam
Wahl, Kent Creek, and Deadman’s Shel-
ter sites (Figs. 10.13–10.15) to see the di-
versity in gross morphology. Points typed
as Deadman’s generally have the diagnos-
tic long slender barbs and long straight or
bulbous stems, but other variations in-
clude specimens with shorter, often re-
worked barbs and wider Scallorn-like ex-
panding stems. Most of the points typed
as Scallorn do not ﬁt the classic wide-

stemmed form illustrated by Turner and
Hester (1993, 230) but conform more
closely to the coryell and eddy varieties il-
lustrated by Jelks (1962, ﬁg. 13). The
Scallorn and Scallorn-like specimens
from Palo Duro sites often appear to be
nothing more than reworked Deadman’s
points with the barbs shortened or re-
moved altogether.

Groundstone tools are obviously well
represented at some Palo Duro sites (see
Table 10.5), but the assemblage from
Sam Wahl is rather unique in comparison
with that from the other sites. There ap-
pear to be three sets of grinding tools rep-
resented at the Sam Wahl site. One set

consists of the thin oval pestles used with
pointed-oval bedrock mortars. These may
be tools for grinding mesquite beans, as
has been suggested for mortars (bedrock
and portable) and pestles throughout the
southwestern United States (Bell and
Castetter 1937). The abundance of pes-
tles at Mesilla phase sites in the Tularosa
Basin is considered to be evidence of ex-

tensive mesquite processing (Carmichael
1986, 220), and it is possible that bed-
rock mortars, which are common in the
Caprock Canyonlands, may have been
used in a similar fashion.

The second set of grinding tools con-

sists of ﬂat-faced manos, usually sand-
stone, used with ﬂat-slab metates, and the
third set consists of convex-faced manos,

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

usually quartzite, used with oval-basin
metates. The latter set is the best repre-
sented of the grinding tools at the Sam
Wahl site. Caching (or storing) of com-
plete large oval-basin metates may indi-
cate that this grinding tool kit was the
most important in terms of the amount
of material being processed at Sam Wahl.
Although less abundant, the grinding
tools from the Kent Creek site do exhibit
roughly the same morphological variabil-
ity as do those from Sam Wahl. At Kent
Creek, no complete metates were found,
but the fragments represent both slab and
basin types (one fragment was of a thick
slab with a deeply worn concavity), and
the manos are either oval in shape with
ﬂat or convex faces or they are rectangular
with ﬂat faces. Two of the rectangular
manos have beveled faces.

When the groundstone assemblages
from the residential bases are compared
by material type and completeness, an in-
teresting pattern emerges (Table 10.7).
Metate fragments heavily dominate the
assemblage at Sam Wahl, but they are only
moderately abundant at the Kent Creek
site. In addition, most of the metate frag-
ments at Sam Wahl were recycled (i.e.,
reused as hearthstones), while none of
those at Kent Creek were found in re-
cycled contexts. Since Triassic sandstones
and Quaternary gravel outcrops are im-
mediately available at both sites, the dis-
tance to material sources is not a factor
affecting the frequency of grinding tools.
Thus, some other factor must account for
these differences. While it is possible that
grinding activities were simply more im-
portant at Sam Wahl than at Kent Creek,
this explanation is not totally satisfactory.
S. H. Schlanger (1990, 1991) has ob-
served that complete and fragmentary
ground stones are considerably more
abundant in village sites that were occu-
pied for longer periods of time. The early
occupations at the Sam Wahl site lasted
for some four hundred years or more
(based on six radiocarbon dates), certainly
long enough for numerous grinding im-
plements to have been broken and re-
cycled. The chronology of the Kent
Creek site is less precise (see discussion
above), but it may have been reoccupied
for only one or two centuries. If this is
the case, then the lower frequency of
grinding tool recycling could be a func-
tion of time rather than evidence that

*Grinding area is an approximation that is ﬁgured as length times width. It slightly overestimates the
grinding areas of most manos because they are subrectangular, oval, or round rather than rectangu-
lar or square.

grinding activities were less important at
Kent Creek. As discussed later, differen-
tial abandonment processes (i.e., planned
versus unplanned) are evident at these
sites and at dwellings within these sites.
The results of a study of groundstone

tools in the Jornada Mogollon area by
M. A. Calamia (1991) support the inter-
pretations that the Sam Wahl and Kent
Creek sites are both residential bases but

that their functions are somewhat dif-
ferent. It was observed that complete
manos are much more common in special-
activity sites, while broken manos are more
common in residential bases. Calamia
(1991, ﬁg. 8) shows that only about 38 per-
cent of the manos found at Jornada Mo-
gollon residential bases are complete,
compared to about 77 percent complete
manos at special-activity sites. The higher

frequency of broken manos at residen-
tial bases is thought to be related to the
greater intensity and/or duration of occu-
pations that occurred there. The percent-
ages of whole manos at the Sam Wahl and
Kent Creek sites (about 40 percent at
each) are very close to the ﬁgure given for
Jornada Mogollon residential bases.

Calamia (1991, ﬁgs. 2 –7) also uses
mano size as an indirect measure of resi-
dential mobility and intensity of plant
processing in the Jornada region. He
demonstrates that manos are generally
smaller at special-activity sites than at res-
idential bases and that there is a general
increase in the size of manos through
time (from the Archaic period to the El
Paso phase). Other researchers have sug-
gested that increasing mano size is a re-
ﬂection of increasing dependence upon
plant foods in general and horticulture in
particular (e.g., Mauldin 1991, 1993a).

When the mano size data for the Sam
Wahl and Kent Creek sites are compared
(Table 10.8), another interesting pattern
emerges (albeit with the understanding
that the sample sizes are quite small and
thus interpretations are tentative). Al-
though ground stones are most abundant
at the Sam Wahl site, the manos there are
considerably smaller than those at the
Kent Creek site. These data may indicate
that grinding activities were more inten-
sive at the Kent Creek site but that the
overall duration of occupations was longer
at the Sam Wahl site. If the site occupa-
tions were sequential, these data could
reﬂect increasing dependence upon plant
resources through time, as is suggested for
the Jornada area. But there is no evidence
indicating that the Kent Creek site occu-
pations are primarily later than those at
the Sam Wahl site. In fact, the chrono-
metric evidence points to the contrary,
and it appears that the Palo Duro compo-
nents are more or less contemporaneous
but that occupations of the Sam Wahl site
lasted longer (i.e., the post–a.d. 1100 late
occupation period) than at the Kent Creek
site. If the Palo Duro occupations at these
sites were indeed contemporaneous (per-
haps with Sam Wahl being occupied
more frequently), then the data may be
interpreted as representing differences in
site function. This interpretation is pre-
ferred, and it is possible that differences in
the grinding tools between these sites are
due to the processing of different plants.

The ceramics from Palo Duro sites are
interesting for a variety of reasons. Sherds
are usually absent or rare in most sites
(see Table 10.5), accounting for less than
9 percent of all artifacts (excluding deb-
itage), but sherds are quite common at
the Blue Clay and South Ridge sites,
where they comprise 22 percent and
16 percent of all artifacts (excluding deb-
itage), respectively. The total absence of
pottery sherds in some Palo Duro sites
could be due to limited investigations,
but their absence at other sites that have
produced large artifact samples is intrigu-
ing. The fact that no sherds were found
at the County Line and Gobbler Creek
Bridge sites, despite fairly extensive inves-
tigations, may indicate that pottery was
not being used by the inhabitants. From
a functional perspective, one should not
expect pottery to be present at every site
occupied by Palo Duro peoples, and it
should not be surprising to ﬁnd special-
activity sites with no pottery.

The brownware pottery found at Palo

Duro sites is generally classiﬁed as be-
longing to the Jornada Mogollon tradi-
tion. Detailed visual analyses by south-
western ceramists (such as Jack Hedrick,
Regge Wiseman, and Helene Warren)
have identiﬁed several different varieties
that probably represent different source
areas within southeastern New Mexico
and/or western Texas. The types that have
been speciﬁcally identiﬁed are Jornada
Brown (and/or Alma Plain), Roswell
Brown, Middle Pecos Micaceous Brown,
South Pecos Brown, and McKenzie
Brown. Some researchers recognize many
regional variations of Jornada Mogollon
brownwares and are willing to make vi-
sual type identiﬁcations in some cases,
while others think that few or no types
may be identiﬁed accurately by visual ex-
aminations alone. Petrographic studies of
brownwares from several Palo Duro sites,
however, generally support the visual type
identiﬁcations made by various ceramic
experts.

Petrographic studies of Palo Duro
Complex brownwares include two sherds
from 41BI265 (Etchieson et al. 1977, 64);
three sherds from Deadman’s Shelter, six
from the Kent Creek site, and three from
the South Sage Creek site (D. Robinson
1992); and ﬁve sherds from the Sam
Wahl site (D. Robinson 1994). These
petrographic data indicate that there is

PALO DURO COMPLEX / 317

considerable compositional variability in
the brownwares, representing different
source areas. These studies also have
conﬁrmed that almost all of this pottery
is of nonlocal origin and was made in the
Jornada Mogollon or Middle Pecos areas.
As yet, there have been no convincing
studies to indicate that brownware pot-
tery was made in the Caprock Canyon-
lands or southern Llano Estacado, al-
though occasional sherds that do not
match any varieties of Jornada brownware
are considered to be possible candidates
for locally made wares (e.g., one sherd at
Kent Creek was identiﬁed as possibly be-
ing of local manufacture).

There may be some evidence, albeit

weak, for temporal differentiation of
brownware types. Thicker brownwares
tempered with crushed igneous rocks pri-
marily containing quartz and feldspars,
such as the Jornada Brown/Alma Plain
found at Deadman’s Shelter, appear to be
the earliest brownwares in the Texas Pan-
handle Plains, perhaps dating as early as
a.d. 100 –300. Thinner sherds with more
variable crushed rock tempers may be
later examples. In particular, some sherds
found at the Kent Creek and South Sage
Creek sites contain signiﬁcant quantities
of biotite (see D. Robinson 1992, 1994)
and have been tentatively identiﬁed as
Middle Pecos Micaceous Brown, while
some distinctive sherds from the Sam
Wahl site have been tentatively identi-
ﬁed as South Pecos Brown. According to
Arthur J. Jelinek (1967), these wares were
manufactured in the Middle Pecos area
between a.d. 800 and 1300.

There are some interesting patterns in
the distribution of bone and mussel shell
artifacts. Most notable is the presence of
modiﬁed deer bones (primarily metapo-
dial awls and awl blanks) and modiﬁed
and unmodiﬁed mussel shells (scrapers,
pendants, and shell blanks) in human
burials. As mentioned above, the use of
these items as mortuary offerings is in-
triguing, but their signiﬁcance is not un-
derstood. Excluding burial contexts, the
distribution of modiﬁed bones within
Palo Duro sites (see Table 10.5) is almost
certainly related to differential preserva-
tion rather than differing site function.
The total absence of modiﬁed bones in
residential bases and camp sites does not
mean that no bone artifacts were used
at these sites. Since bones are generally

sparse and poorly preserved in open sites,
it is reasonable to assume that bone tools
could have been deposited but subse-
quently lost to deterioration.

Modiﬁed bones are found in only one
site, the intensively occupied Deadman’s
Shelter, where bone preservation was very
good. Since differential preservation does
not seem to be a factor in any of the
rockshelters, one may assume that bone
tools were not commonly used and/or
were discarded in the ephemerally occu-
pied rockshelters. The twenty-one bone
artifacts found at Deadman’s Shelter in-
clude awls and awl blanks made of split
deer metapodials, polished deer antler
tips (ﬂaking tools?), and unidentiﬁable
fragments that were cut, polished, and/or
incised. One fragment with two drilled
holes in it may have been a pendant.

Mussel shell fragments are common in

many Palo Duro sites, and differential
preservation is less likely to have been a
factor affecting the distribution of shell
artifacts. Mussel shells occasionally were
used as scrapers, but the most common
forms of modiﬁcation (such as cut edges,
drilled holes, notches, and surface etch-
ing) probably represent shell jewelry or
waste debris as a by-product of the manu-
facture of shell jewelry. Evidence for the
use of shell jewelry and/or the manufac-
ture of shell ornaments was found at the
South Sage Creek, Sam Wahl, and Kent
Creek sites.

Features

A comparison of feature types for Palo
Duro Complex sites (Table 10.9) shows a
wide range of generalized and speciﬁc ac-
tivities and supports the differential site
functions seen in Fig. 10.12. As expected,
the diversity of features is greatest for the
residential bases and is somewhat less
variable for camp sites and rockshelters.
There are some obvious correlations, such
as the presence of pithouses and storage
pits only at residential bases, but the most
ubiquitous features at all sites are rock-
lined and unlined hearths, burned rock
clusters, and baking pits. While the for-
mer types are considered general heating
and cooking features, the baking pits are
more substantial rock-lined or rock-ﬁlled
pits that are interpreted as plant-cooking
ovens (see Boyd et al. 1994, 38 – 43, 135 –
38, for descriptions of baking pits found
at Lake Alan Henry). Baking pits were

are uninterpretable (and they are likely
to be biased by differential preservation)
or they are just large enough to provide
some interpretable information. When
the probably intrusive animal bones are

weeded out and burning or butchering is
taken into account, the minimum num-
bers of individuals of speciﬁc taxa are so
low that it is impossible to determine the
relative dietary importance of various ani-

found at the Gobbler Creek Bridge and
Cat Hollow sites, as were large quantities
of burned rocks thought to be residue
discarded during pit baking. Because of
the tremendous quantities of burned
rocks at these sites, they are interpreted as
specialized plant-processing camp sites.

There is considerable variability in the
architecture of the roughly contempora-
neous pithouses at the Kent Creek and
Sam Wahl sites (Table 10.10). These pit-
houses include both ovate and rectan-
gular forms, their sizes vary somewhat
(with ﬂoor areas ranging from 7.6 to
14.2 m2), and the entry directions are
all different. As described earlier, there
also are many differences in the interior
features and in the construction of the
superstructures.

Faunal and Floral Remains

Faunal remains provide substantial
evidence for the use of animals as food
resources by Palo Duro peoples. The ani-
mal bones recovered from various sites
(summarized in Table 10.11), generally
have been treated in one of three ways:
they have been completely ignored during
analysis; they have been identiﬁed by taxa
and listed but not analyzed; or they have
been identiﬁed by taxa and analyzed for
evidence of modiﬁcation (e.g., burning
and butchering) and their distributions
have been carefully studied. This differ-
ential treatment helps explain many
of the question marks that appear in
Table 10.11. It also is important to real-
ize that in many cases, particularly when
dealing with rodents and other burrowing
animals and with rockshelter assemblages,
it is unclear whether animals were intro-
duced into sites by natural processes or by
human activity.

The largest faunal assemblages are
from the Kent Creek site and Deadman’s
Shelter. At both of these sites, deer is the
only medium-sized or large animal recog-
nized as having been a signiﬁcant food
resource; bison is poorly represented. A
wide variety of other small animals are
present, but their relative importance as
food resources is comparatively low or
unclear. In contrast to these sites, Boren
Shelter No. 2 has faunal evidence indicat-
ing that rabbits and rodents were the most
frequently eaten animals.

The faunal assemblages at all of the
other sites are either so meager that they

mals. Thus, even though they were care-
fully analyzed, many of these smaller fau-
nal assemblages produced little more than
a grocery list of animals that were likely
to have been or deﬁnitely were hunted.
The faunal remains from the Chalk Hol-
low site, although apparently a sizable
and interesting assemblage, have not been
analyzed at all.

Freshwater mussel shells are consis-
tently present in Palo Duro sites, and
there is some evidence that they may have
been utilized as food. For example, heated
hinge fragments (presumably heated to
cause the live mussel to open) were re-
covered from the South Sage Creek site.
Mussel remains have not been found in
sufﬁcient quantities, however, to suggest

that they were an important food re-
source. They certainly were never used by
Palo Duro peoples to the extent that they
were in other areas. Large accumulations
of shells in the East Levee site, 41TG91
(Creel 1990), near San Angelo, and at
sites at Lake O. H. Ivie (Treece et al.
1993e, 519 –23) indicate that mussels
were an important food for peoples in the
Colorado and Concho River valleys, but
there is no such evidence for the Caprock
Canyonlands. In fact, the relatively high
frequency of modiﬁed mussel shells and
single unmodiﬁed valves (but never
whole mussels) in Palo Duro Complex
sites and burials suggests that the shells
themselves may have been much more
important than the mussels.

Palynological samples have been taken
and analyzed from several Palo Duro sites
(Kent Creek, Sam Wahl, and Gobbler
Creek Bridge), but the fossil pollen in
these samples consistently has been found
to be seriously degraded, and the data are
generally considered unusable for eco-
nomic (or paleoenvironmental) interpre-
tations (Bryant 1993; Dering 1994b; De-
ring and Bryant 1992; R. Jones 1990).
Phytoliths have been extracted from fea-
ture sediments at Lake Alan Henry sites,
but the resulting data are generally not
useful for subsistence interpretations.
Unlike pollen, the phytoliths have been
found to be well preserved, but the inter-
pretations are limited by the current state
of the art (primarily the inability to rec-

ognize speciﬁc taxa and the lack of com-
parative collections, but phytolith analysis
has improved considerably in recent
years). One notable exception is that cal-
cium oxylate crystals found in sediments
associated with a baking pit at the Gobbler
Creek Bridge site are thought to be from
prickly pear (Cummings 1990, 541).
Macrobotanical remains recovered
from sediment ﬂotation provide the most
useful evidence for interpreting the plants
that were or may have been used as food
resources (Table 10.12). Carbonized seeds
of many different plants have been re-
covered from sediments in a variety of
contexts (e.g., on pithouse ﬂoors, in stor-
age and baking pits, and in nonfeature
samples), and in all cases the charring is
thought to be the result of human activi-
ties (as opposed to natural ﬁres). The
question, then, is which plants were used
as food and which plants may have been
burned accidentally or used in some other
manner, such as for fuel. The data pre-
sented in Table 10.12 show various plant
taxa as being either present or moderately

abundant in charred form but do not of-
fer any hint of why the seeds were burned.
Various analysts generally address these
questions on a case by case basis, taking
many factors into account (e.g., the nature
of the plant, the frequency of charred
seed occurrence in various contexts, and
ethnographic evidence for utilization of
plants).

While any of the taxa listed may repre-
sent food resources, the taxa that are most
abundant (in terms of the quantity of
charred seeds from individual samples
and the ubiquity of their occurrence in
multiple samples from different types of
features) are more likely to have been
used for food. Of all of the taxa listed,
however, only the mesquite beans and
shin oak acorns have been found in
archeological contexts that strongly sug-
gest they were used for food. Phil Dering
(1994, 335 – 41) provides an interesting
discussion of the probable use of mes-
quite at the Sam Wahl site, and Cruse
(1992, 121) discusses shin oak acorns
found at the Kent Creek site.

It also is notable that Chenopodium is
much more abundant than any other taxa
and is associated with three types of fea-
tures (pithouse, storage pits, and baking
pits) at the Sam Wahl site. Dering (1994,
341) suggests that the ubiquity of charred
goosefoot at the Sam Wahl site, in con-
trast to its absence at other Lake Alan
Henry sites, is evidence that goosefoot
was being processed as food. While goose-
foot was very abundant in one storage pit
ﬂotation sample, it was not consistently
found in sufﬁcient quantity in other stor-
age pit samples to indicate that it was the
principal plant food that was being stored.
In addition to noting the evidence for

food use, Dering (1994, 340 – 41) ob-
served that four species of grass seeds con-
sistently were found in storage pits at the
Sam Wahl site, but they were not recov-
ered in any other type of feature. He
speculated that this situation may be evi-
dence that the pits had been lined with
grass, rather than that grass seeds were be-
ing stored in the pits.

There is no deﬁnitive evidence for the
range of plant foods that might have been
processed in the baking pits (see Hines
et al. 1994 for a detailed discussion of pit
roasting) at residential bases or at special-
ized camp sites or what season(s) of the
year the pits might have been used. There
are a multitude of possibilities, however.
Baking pits may have been used: (1) dur-
ing one time of the year for cooking a
particular plant, (2) during one time of
the year for cooking a variety of different
plants, (3) during multiple seasons for
cooking a few speciﬁc plants, or (4) dur-
ing multiple seasons for cooking a wide
variety of plant foods. It is likely that the
baking pits were used primarily during
the late spring, summer, and fall, when a
wide range of wild plant foods (e.g., seeds,
beans, berries, tubers, and tunas and pads)
are available for exploitation. Given the
paucity of direct evidence, it is impossible
to know whether these ovens were multi-
seasonal and multifunctional (i.e., used
for cooking many plant foods as they be-
came available) or season and resource
speciﬁc (i.e., used primarily for cooking
some superabundant plant food during
one particular season).

Based on ethnographic evidence for
arid and semiarid environments (e.g.,
Basehart 1960; Castetter and Opler 1936,
35 –38; Pennington 1963; Sonnichsen

10-A2946  4/13/04  12:21 PM  Page 321

1958), many different plants were cooked
in pit ovens, but the principal ones were
agave, sotol, prickly pear, yucca, and
corn. Agave is not found in the Caprock
Canyonlands today and probably never
ranged that far north. Sotol, although not
found there today, may have been present
there in the past since its current range
has been seriously altered by modern
ranching practices (see Boyd et al. 1994,
264). Prickly pear and yucca are ubiqui-
tous in the area today and probably were
abundant in Palo Duro times as well. Al-
though it is not known whether the Palo
Duro peoples practiced horticulture, corn
is yet another possible plant food that was
roasted in ovens.

Although the contemporaneity of the

grinding tools, baking pits, and storage
pits has been demonstrated by the radio-
carbon dates from the Sam Wahl site, it is
not known if the artifacts were used to-
gether as part of an integrated technology
for some speciﬁc resource(s) or if they
were used independently for different
resources. Some foods may have been
ground before being cooked, or vice versa,
and these foods may or may not have
then been stored for future use. It also is
possible that many plants were ground
while only a few were cooked and/or
stored. Again, the possibilities are numer-
ous, and there is no hard evidence to sup-
port any one interpretation.

Besides the possible oven-baked plant
resources mentioned above, a wide range
of other plants may have been important
food resources, including but not limited
to all of the plants listed in Table 10.12.
Boyd et al. (1994, 264 – 66) provide a de-
tailed discussion of the various plants that
could have been signiﬁcant food resources
in the Caprock Canyonlands and Rolling
Plains. The plants and plant parts that
may have been sufﬁciently abundant and
nutritious to have been utilized inten-
sively as food resources by Palo Duro
peoples are (in no particular order): seeds
of various grasses and ﬂowering plants
(e.g., dropgrass and cheno-ams); various
roots and tubers (e.g., buffalo gourds and
prairie turnip); pads, stalks, fruits, and/or
bulbs of desert succulents and cacti (e.g.,
yucca, sotol, prickly pear, and cholla);
various cucurbits (e.g., bottle gourds);
acorns of shin oak and possibly live oak
(remnant groves of live oak are present at
Lake Alan Henry); possibly pecan or

PALO DURO COMPLEX / 321

hickory nuts (charred Carya sp. wood
from a hearth at 41GR484 indicates that
pecan or hickory was once in the Lake
Alan Henry area); and mesquite beans.
There are undoubtedly many other plants
that might have been important food re-
sources, but they are perhaps less obvious
in the ethnographic or archeological rec-
ords. A variety of horticultural crops (e.g.,
corn, squash, and beans) should not be
discounted as possible food resources de-
spite their absence in the archeological
record.

Of all the plants mentioned above,
shin oak and mesquite warrant further
consideration as having been important
or staple sources of food for Palo Duro
peoples. The extent of shin oak distribu-
tion in the Caprock Canyonlands today is
not well known, but it is conﬁned mainly
to areas where sandy calcareous soils pre-
dominate and in areas with limestone
outcrops. Assuming that its distribution
was similar in the past, one may only
speculate that shin oak may have been
sufﬁciently abundant in some areas to
have comprised a signiﬁcant food resource
for Palo Duro peoples. The occurrence of
charred acorns (tentatively identiﬁed as
shin oak because it is the only species that
grows in the immediate vicinity today) in
several feature contexts at the Kent Creek
site is intriguing evidence. Since shin oak
is not a particularly good fuel source, the
acorns are not likely to have been intro-
duced incidentally or accidentally. Al-
though the use of shin oak acorns for food
is not well documented ethnographically,
their use by prehistoric peoples in and
around the northern Llano Estacado has
been suggested by various researchers (e.g.,
M. Collins 1971, 76; Leslie 1979, 185).
Mesquite, on the other hand, is well
documented in the ethnographic litera-
ture as a staple resource for many peoples
in the southwestern United States and
northern Mexico (Bell and Castetter
1937, 21–33), along the Texas coast and
in central Texas (Covey 1961, 66, 86 –
87, 100), and in the Rio Grande delta
(Salinas 1990, 117–19). Although direct
archeological evidence is limited, mes-
quite has been suggested as having been
an important resource throughout the
Jornada Mogollon region (Brethauer
1979; Carmichael 1986, 220; Leslie 1979,
186), and even the historic Comanche
and Kiowa of the Texas Panhandle Plains

utilized mesquite beans as food (G. Carl-
son and Jones 1940, 530; Galvin 1970,
30 –31; Vestal and Schultes 1939, 33 –
34). Nutritional data compiled by Hiles
(1993) indicate that mesquite pods and
beans are very high in protein, carbohy-
drates, ﬁber, and sugar.

Boyd et al. (1994, 265 – 66) dispel the

myth that mesquite was not present or
was rare in the Texas Panhandle Plains
prior to late nineteenth-century ranching.
The distribution of mesquite has certainly
increased dramatically due to historic and
modern ranching and agricultural prac-
tices (Flores 1990, 60 – 61; Kirkpatrick
1992, 141). Its rapid spread into new
areas (such as uplands) that were once
devoid of mesquite is the source for the
common misconception that there was
no mesquite before ranchers came. How-
ever, early historic accounts (e.g., C. Bai-
ley 1951, 105, 121; Foreman 1937, 97;
Parker 1984, 170 –71, 184) clearly indi-
cate that mesquite trees were very abun-
dant in riverine environments prior to
cattle grazing (and overgrazing), root
plowing and chaining, and control of
range ﬁres. The mid-nineteenth-century
distribution of mesquite suggests that it
was abundant throughout the Caprock
Canyonlands in prehistory, and it is the
best candidate for having been a staple re-
source (but not necessarily the only one)
for Palo Duro peoples. It also should be
noted that charred mesquite beans should
not be expected to be common in the
archeological record even if they were ex-
tensively utilized. Most ethnographic ac-
counts indicate that beans were crushed
and ground before being cooked. If they
were not cooked in pod or bean form, the
chances of their being charred, and hence
preserved in the archeological record, are
much lower.

Five main interpretations can be de-
rived from the Palo Duro Complex sub-
sistence data. First, bison hunting and use
of bison as a food resource are poorly
documented. That bison were present
during Late Prehistoric I times is unques-
tionable since bison remains dating to
this time are found in many sites. Bison
remains are exceedingly rare in this time,
however, compared to the preceding Late
Archaic period. Even at sites where the
artifactual evidence indicates that hunting
was an important activity, the principal
game animals appear to have been deer

10-A2946  4/13/04  12:21 PM  Page 322

322 / HIGH PLAINS AND CANYONLANDS

and smaller animals. In addition, no bi-
son kill or butchering localities are known
for the Palo Duro Complex, and it ap-
pears unlikely that any form of commu-
nal bison hunting occurred. From this,
one may infer that bison were somewhat
scarce in, but never absent from, the Cap-
rock Canyonlands during Palo Duro
times (assuming that people would have
hunted them much more if large popula-
tions of bison had been present). While a
general scarcity of bison remains has been
noted for the Southern Plains between
a.d. 500 and 1200 (Dillehay 1974), this
situation does not preclude the possibility
that bison were abundant in other areas at
this time. Treece et al. (1993e, 523 –24)
note that bison remains dating to this
time period are well represented in sites at
O. H. Ivie Reservoir in west-central Texas.
The second major point is that mul-
tiple lines of evidence indicate that the
primary subsistence resources for Palo
Duro peoples were plant foods. Although
hunting activities are fairly well repre-
sented at some sites, some evidence for
the use of plant foods is found at all Palo
Duro sites, and it is overwhelmingly
dominant in many components. The con-
temporaneous use of storage pits, baking
pits, at least two kinds of portable grind-
ing tool kits (i.e., mano/metate sets), and
bedrock mortars/pestles at residential
bases all denote a heavy emphasis on
plant foods. The activities that occurred
at these sites were often of sufﬁcient dura-
tion to warrant the construction of pit-
houses, and it is likely that these residen-
tial villages were occupied on a seasonal
basis.

Third, while a wide range of plant
foods probably was utilized, it may be hy-
pothesized that, just as they were impor-
tant in the Jornada Mogollon and Eastern
Jornada areas, mesquite beans and shin
oak acorns also may have been important
foods for Palo Duro Complex peoples.
Many Eastern Jornada camp sites may
have been occupied by people harvesting
these foods, and it has been noted that
“acorns and mesquite beans mature at
about the same time (August– early Sep-
tember) but vary in different areas and
different years; the two foods were pos-
sibly harvested at the same time when
possible” (Leslie 1979, 185 –86). A simi-
lar exploitation strategy may have been

used by peoples living in the Caprock
Canyonlands.

The fourth point is that in spite of the
absence of domesticated plant remains or
deﬁnite agricultural tools, the possibility
that Palo Duro peoples practiced some
form of limited horticulture must be con-
sidered. The introduction of domesti-
cated plants into the southwestern United
States has been characterized as a “monu-
mental nonevent” that had “little imme-
diate impact on native human popula-
tions” (Minnis 1985, 310). It was the
intensiﬁcation of agricultural production,
rather than its mere introduction, that
had signiﬁcant and widespread impacts
upon prehistoric economies. Following
Bennet Bronson’s (1977) terminology, it
may be suggested that although Palo Duro
peoples were not agriculturalists (“those
dependent upon cultivated plants”), they
could have been cultivators (“those for
whom crops are not necessarily major
economic items” [Bronson cited in
Minnis 1985, 338]). Lacking deﬁnitive
evidence, it can only be suggested that
limited plant cultivation may have been
incorporated into a seasonal pattern of re-
source collection (Minnis 1985, 331). It
is likely that Palo Duro peoples were at
least aware of farming, since agricultural
systems were well established in the
Southwest by a.d. 500 –700 (Minnis
1985, 310; Woodbury and Zubrow
1979, 50 –51), in the Central Plains by
a.d. 900 (Adair 1988, 114), and in south-
central Oklahoma (Vehik 1984, 196)
and northeastern Texas (Perttula 1992a,
13; Perttula and Bruseth 1983, 17) by
a.d. 800. Richard I. Ford (1985, 352,
362 – 64) suggests that the Southern
Plains may have been a corridor for the
continued eastward spread of cultigens
(speciﬁcally maize and beans), and pre-
sumably farming technologies, from the
American Southwest. If so, the Palo Duro
Complex may even have played some
critical role in the diffusion process.

The ﬁnal major point is that there is
ample evidence for considerable variabil-
ity in site function. This variability has
been observed not only between different
types of sites but also between sites of a
single type. The differences between the
contemporaneous pithouse occupations
at the Kent Creek and Sam Wahl sites
are particularly notable. This diversity of

site function is indicative of a high degree
of residential mobility within the Palo
Duro Complex, which in turn is sugges-
tive of a seasonal organization of subsis-
tence activities.

Seasonality, Residential Mobility,
and Settlement Pattern

Reconstructing the settlement pattern

of the Palo Duro culture is a daunting
task given the paucity of deﬁnitive sea-
sonality data and the constraints imposed
by the small sample of sites that have
been adequately investigated. Limited in-
ferences may be made, but they are based
largely on indirect and circumstantial evi-
dence. Thus, the interpretations offered
in this section are tentative and should be
viewed cautiously and critically.

It can be stated with some degree of
conﬁdence that the Palo Duro peoples or-
ganized their subsistence activities on a
seasonal basis. This interpretation is based
in large part on the fact that the distribu-
tion, abundance, usefulness, and pre-
dictability of various plant and animal
resources in the Caprock Canyonlands
varies according to the seasons and cer-
tainly did so in prehistoric times as well.
When the residential bases, rockshelters,
and camp sites are considered together,
the adaptive strategy of Palo Duro Com-
plex peoples must be viewed as extremely
mobile and predominantly plant oriented.
The discovery of pithouses and substan-
tial storage facilities at sites in the Cap-
rock Canyonlands constitutes new evi-
dence requiring a total reevaluation of the
settlement pattern of Palo Duro Complex
peoples.

As discussed below, it may be inferred
from the archeological evidence that Palo
Duro peoples maintained a high degree
of residential mobility in response to sea-
sonal changes in the availability of food
resources. Although the seasonality of
their occupations is speculative, rockshel-
ters and camp sites probably represent
habitation sites that were occupied at dif-
ferent times of the year than were the res-
idential bases. Two types of Palo Duro
rockshelters have been noted; some, such
as Boren Shelter No. 2, were used only
on an ephemeral basis, while others, such
as Deadman’s Shelter, were intensively oc-
cupied. It is notable that the material cul-
ture from Deadman’s Shelter mimics that

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

10-A2946  4/13/04  12:21 PM  Page 323

from the residential bases and denotes the
considerable importance of grinding plant
foods and hunting deer and smaller ani-
mals. There is no convincing direct evi-
dence for seasonality, but it is likely that
there was winter or cold-weather use of
larger rockshelters as short-term residen-
tial bases and ephemeral use of smaller
rockshelters by smaller groups (possibly
families or task groups) during various
seasons, perhaps mainly as temporary ha-
vens from inclement weather.

Camp sites range from multifunctional

locations where hunting was an impor-
tant component (e.g., the County Line
site) to very specialized activity areas
where the grinding and cooking of plant
foods were nearly exclusive activities
(e.g., the Cat Hollow and Gobbler Creek
Bridge sites). It is likely that some of this
variation in subsistence activities is related
to different seasons of occupation. Again,
there is no good evidence for seasonality,
but most of the plants that would have
been cooked at the specialized plant-
processing localities ripen or are ready for
harvest during the late spring to fall. The
absence of storage pits at camp sites sug-
gests that they were not occupied during
the winter. If the plant foods that were
processed were intended for storage, one
might expect that some of these plant-
processing camp sites would be located in
close proximity to residential bases. This
situation does seem to be the case at Lake
Alan Henry, as evidenced by the close
proximity of the Cat Hollow and Sam
Wahl sites.

The two residential bases also appear
to have functioned in different ways. At
the Sam Wahl site, baking, grinding, and
storage of plant foods were extremely im-
portant activities, but the use of animal
resources appears to have been minimal.
At Kent Creek, grinding, cooking, and
storage of plant foods also are evident and
represent important activities, but hunt-
ing of deer and smaller animals was sig-
niﬁcantly more important than at Sam
Wahl. The differences in storage tech-
niques used at these sites are particularly
notable and probably relate to variations
in site function. While pit storage is well
represented at the Sam Wahl site, it is
only minimally represented at Kent Creek
where above-ground storage may have
been more common. As discussed below,

PALO DURO COMPLEX / 323

however, it is somewhat difﬁcult to trans-
late the apparent functional differences
between these sites directly into interpre-
tations of the seasonality of occupation.

Perhaps of equal or greater importance

to the recognition of the variability be-
tween the residential bases is the fact that
the Kent Creek and Sam Wahl sites are,
in many ways, more similar than they are
different. The presence of permanent
habitation structures and storage facilities
at both of these sites provides consider-
able evidence for speculating on the sea-
sonal orientation of subsistence activities.
From a theoretical perspective, pithouse
dwellings generally imply some degree of
residential mobility and seasonal organi-
zation of activities, storage generally im-
plies seasonal changes in resource avail-
ability, and subterranean food storage
implies the use of plant foods. These con-
cepts are important for understanding the
Palo Duro culture’s settlement pattern,
and they warrant more consideration.

In the southwestern United States, re-
cent research has emphasized the impor-
tance of understanding residential mobil-
ity (e.g., Carmichael 1990; B. Nelson
and LeBlanc 1986; Whalen and Gilman
1990). Shifting away from the view that
pithouses are evidence of sedentism, most
researchers now embrace the view that
the pithouse period may have been char-
acterized by considerable and varying
degrees of residential mobility (e.g.,
O’Laughlin 1980, 1993; Whalen 1977,
1978, 1980b). Bearing in mind that
“hunter-gatherer adaptations come in
many kinds, with many levels of mobility”
(Whalen and Gilman 1990, 73), some in-
ferences can be made about the nature of
residential mobility in the Texas Panhan-
dle Plains during the latter half of the ﬁrst
millennium a.d. Patricia A. Gilman states
that “pithouse structures are the most
adaptive and useful choice of habitation
under conditions of biseasonal settlement
systems, dependence upon stored foods,
and cold season sedentism” (Gilman
1987, 548). If this idea holds true beyond
the Southwest, then the pithouse occupa-
tions at the Kent Creek and Sam Wahl
sites can be interpreted as having been at
least seasonal, and possibly biseasonal,
residences. However, it should not be
assumed that the mere presence of pit-
houses is indicative of a single site func-

tion or a particular season of occupation.
This assumption does not seem to be
valid for the Jornada Mogollon region
(Carmichael 1986, 218), nor is it particu-
larly tenable for the Caprock Canyon-
lands. In fact, until archeological data
prove otherwise, it is probably safer to
assume that differences in architectural
styles, storage facilities, artifact assem-
blages, and macrobotanical remains could
relate directly to variations in site func-
tion and/or the seasonality of occupation.
Storage in general, and subterranean
storage in particular, has been interpreted
as evidence of seasonally oriented resource
distribution and residential mobility (Bin-
ford 1990; DeBoer 1988; Goland 1983;
Ingold 1983; O’Laughlin 1993; Raymer
1988; H. Ward 1985). Boyd et al. (1994,
262) provide a more detailed discussion
of the implications of storage at the Sam
Wahl site, but a few major ethnographic
observations need to be considered:
(1) Bulk food storage generally occurs at
the locality where the resource is procured
or harvested; (2) subterranean storage in
temperate climates almost always involves
storage of plant foods (both wild and do-
mesticated); (3) one important function
of pit storage is to conceal foodstuffs
during periods of site abandonment;
(4) stored foods are usually consumed at
or near the storage locality; and (5) con-
sumption of stored foods most often oc-
curs during the winter—the lean season
when most food resources are scarce.

Based on these observations, one pos-

sible scenario is that the Sam Wahl and
Kent Creek sites were occupied between
late summer and late fall when plant
foods were harvested and stored. Archeo-
logical evidence for the use of mesquite
beans (and possibly goosefoot) at Sam
Wahl and the use of shin oak acorns (and
possibly goosefoot) at Kent Creek sup-
port this interpretation. The use of stor-
age implies that the sites also may have
been occupied during the middle to late
winter, at which time the stored foods
were consumed. It is more speculative,
however, to infer that the sites were occu-
pied continuously from fall through win-
ter or that they may have been abandoned
during late fall to early winter and re-
occupied during mid- to late winter. As-
suming that one reason for subterranean
storage was concealment, the predomi-

nant use of storage pits at Sam Wahl may
be interpreted as evidence that the site
was temporarily abandoned during late
fall and early winter. In contrast, the pre-
dominant use of above-ground storage at
Kent Creek could mean that this site was
not temporarily abandoned during this
time, perhaps because the inhabitants had
greater access to other resources such as
game animals. Thus, it is possible that
differences in site function and seasonal-
ity are at least partially responsible for
some of the archeological differences be-
tween the Kent Creek and Sam Wahl sites.
Numerous ethnoarcheological and
archeological case studies (e.g., Cameron
and Tomka 1993) suggest that the caching
of complete and fully functional metates
at the Sam Wahl site may be evidence of
planned abandonment on an episodic or,
more likely, seasonal basis. Schlanger
(1990, 1991) notes that complete tools
are often found in use contexts (i.e.,
cached or left in primary activity areas)
within village sites, presumably because
the last abandonment was perceived as
temporary by the ﬁnal inhabitants. The
last inhabitants at Sam Wahl, who left the
metates stored upside down on storage
pits and inside the pithouse, probably left
fully expecting to return to the site.

In contrast, Structure No. 1 at the Kent
Creek site may have been abandoned hast-
ily and its inhabitants may have left with
no intention of returning. This pithouse
probably was abandoned permanently
upon the death and burial of one of its
occupants. J. Brett Cruse (1992, 136 and
ﬁg. 27) was able to deﬁne two distinct ac-
tivity areas (a lithic work area and a food
storage/processing area) based on the dis-
tribution of artifacts within the structure.
Some of the tools that were left behind,
including a mano and a side scraper, were
complete. The presence of these whole
tools does not necessarily mean that the
occupants did not salvage any usable items
from the house, but it does suggest that
the ﬁnal abandonment was unplanned
and disorderly. Brooks (1993a) notes sim-
ilarly well-deﬁned artifact patterning in
the interior of a Plains Village period
Washita River phase house that burned.
The burning of the house could have been
accidental, but it seems more likely that it
was intentional upon the death of a child
occupant who was buried inside. In either

case, the abandonment was unplanned,
and the house-ﬂoor artifacts, including a
grinding basin and ﬁve manos, were left
in their primary contexts, reﬂecting the
locations of household activities.

If limited horticulture was incorpo-
rated into their subsistence base, Palo
Duro peoples might have occupied the
villages on a biseasonal basis. The people
may have occupied the villages during
planting season in early spring, aban-
doned the site while foraging and hunt-
ing during the summer, and returned in
the late fall to harvest the crop and stay
through the winter. A simplistic model
of pre-reservation Western Apache horti-
culture, as deﬁned by J. R. Welch (1991),
is useful for understanding one way in
which such subsistence activities might
have been scheduled. No genetic afﬁlia-
tion with Athapaskan-speaking peoples is
intended nor is it suggested that this
model is a direct analog for Palo Duro
culture adaptation. It is simply one pos-
sible scenario for how Palo Duro peoples
might have organized a biseasonal adapta-
tion involving limited horticulture.

According to Welch (1991), the pre-
reservation Western Apaches’ diet con-
sisted of “roughly equal amounts of culti-
vated, gathered, and hunted foods.” He
states that

Apache horticulturalists integrated culti-
vation with foraging through scheduling
and resource procurement task groups
(see Binford 1980). When a food source
failed, greater emphasis could be placed
on the other two, or on raiding. Family
clusters based loosely on clan afﬁliations
were the main settlement and subsis-
tence units. These clusters contributed
labor to the cultivation (mainly maize
and cucurbits). . . . The cultivation cycle
began as early as March and as late as
July with digging out silted irrigation
ditches and clearing and planting ﬁelds.
The very old and young sometimes re-
mained at the farmsteads to weed, pro-
tect, and irrigate the crops while others
descended to harvest cactus fruits and
other late spring and early summer
foods. Additional gathering took place
until the band reunited in early Septem-
ber to harvest and store food for late
winter and early spring and to prepare
for fall hunting. (Welch 1991, 78, 81)

The concentration of Palo Duro sites
in the Caprock Canyonlands suggests that
these people made this area their home
for most of the year because it offered the
most abundant and predictable food re-
sources and the widest range of other es-
sential resources such as wood and water.
When, why, and how often they moved
about within the canyonland environ-
ment and adjacent regions is still a mys-
tery because too many pieces of the puz-
zle, particularly good subsistence and
seasonality data, are still missing. At this
point, one can only speculate on the pre-
cise manner in which residential bases,
rockshelters, and camp sites ﬁt together
to form a coherent picture of the adaptive
strategy of the Palo Duro peoples.

Geographic Range and
Intercultural Relationships

The vast majority of sites and compo-
nents attributed to the Palo Duro Com-
plex are situated in the escarpment breaks
along the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the
Red River and the Double Mountain
Fork of the Brazos River. This area con-
stitutes the core of the Palo Duro Com-
plex. Besides the Palo Duro sites that
have already been discussed (see Table
10.1), other possible Palo Duro compo-
nents that have not been tested may be
present at Lake Alan Henry (41GR256 in
Boyd et al. 1989, table 12) and in Cap-
rock Canyons State Park (41BI365 in
Bagot and Hughes 1979, ﬁg. 43; 41BI265
in Etchieson et al. 1977, ﬁg. 23). Since
Palo Duro components have been found
in all three of the intensively surveyed
canyonland areas (i.e., Mackenzie Reser-
voir, Caprock Canyons State Park, and
Lake Alan Henry), one must speculate
that the complex may be well represented
all along the Caprock Escarpment, in-
cluding the intervening areas that have
yet to be studied. So little archeological
work has been done over most of the
Caprock Canyonlands that our view is
limited to a few little windows into the
landscape. By extrapolating site data from
these intensive survey areas, however, it
seems likely that there would be a very
high density of Palo Duro Complex sites
in other areas of the canyonlands, partic-
ularly along all major tributaries. One
must also realize that for every Palo Duro
Complex site that has been identiﬁed,

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

10-A2946  4/13/04  12:21 PM  Page 325

many more probably go unrecognized be-
cause the prehistoric cultural activities did
not generate, or the archeologists failed
to ﬁnd, any diagnostic residue.

As mentioned above, the northern
boundary of the Palo Duro Complex
seems to overlap the southern boundary
of the Lake Creek Complex. Couzzourt
states that “Deadman points, characteris-
tic to diagnostic of the Palo Duro Cul-
ture, are rare to absent in the northern
Panhandle, though they do occur, as do
some seemingly ‘intermediate’ types be-
tween corner-notched and base-notched
types” (Couzzourt 1988, 47). Mogollon
brownwares also are relatively rare in the
Canadian River valley (as compared to
the Caprock Canyonlands), but a few
Palo Duro components are found in the
upper headwaters of the Prairie Dog
Town Fork (i.e., upstream from Palo
Duro Canyon State Park as far as Buffalo
Lake) and even into the Lake Meredith
area of the Canadian River in the north-
ern Panhandle of Texas (see Figs. 10.3
and 10.4). Thus, the area of overlap is the
drainage divide between the Canadian
River and Prairie Dog Town Fork, and
it is this zone that has been proposed as
a territorial border between the Plains
Woodland and Southwestern-inﬂuenced
cultures (Couzzourt 1982; Cruse 1992;
J. Hughes 1991; Krieger 1946, 1978).
The evidence for violence and inter-
cultural conﬂict seems to support the ex-
istence of a cultural boundary between
Palo Duro and Lake Creek/Plains Wood-
land peoples. The Palo Duro woman who
was buried, presumably by her relatives,
in the pithouse at the Kent Creek hamlet
probably was killed by non–Palo Duro
peoples. The cultural identity of the two
men who were killed and buried together
in a single grave in the Donley County
site is uncertain, but they may have been
killed by members of the Palo Duro
group. Could they have been Lake Creek
or Plains Woodland peoples?

Other Plains Woodland or transitional

Archaic burials to the northeast of the
Palo Duro area also have evidence of vio-
lence. Numerous human burials exposed
by shoreline erosion at Lake Altus, in
Greer County, Oklahoma, represent
cemeteries dating to the Plains Wood-
land period and into the Custer phase
(Agogino and Button 1985; Boyd 1982;

PALO DURO COMPLEX / 325

Button and Agogino 1986, 1987). These
burials occur mainly as primary (usually
ﬂexed) skeletons in isolated graves but
also include a few secondary burials and
one primary interment of ﬁve individuals.
Although many of the burials contained
no artifacts and have not been dated, they
are found at sites dominated by Late Pre-
historic I materials, including abundant
cordmarked pottery. Cordmarked sherds
have been found in the ﬁll of two of the
burials, and sherds from one were identi-
ﬁed as Stafford Cordmarked, a diagnostic
type of the Custer phase (Boyd 1982,
10 –16). In addition, a single burial is
dated to a.d. 470 – 650 (uncalibrated),
and the multiple interment of ﬁve indi-
viduals is dated to a.d. 590 –770 (uncali-
brated) (Button and Agogino 1987, 19,
31). While the pottery suggests that these
cemeteries might be afﬁliated with the
Custer phase, the dates indicate that some
of the burials are earlier. To which cul-
tural complex or period the Lake Altus
burials are assigned is a matter of seman-
tics and the lack of chronological control.
Of particular importance, however, are
the two clear cases of violence within the
Lake Altus cemeteries. One individual,
possibly a bundle burial, had an untyped
fragmentary arrow point embedded in
the ulna (Boyd 1982, 15 –16; LeVick and
LeVick 1966). One of the individuals in
the multiple burial had a fatal blow to the
head, and the composition of the mul-
tiple burial group—an elderly male (with
the head injury), a middle-aged female,
two juvenile males, and a female child—
led Van Button and George Agogino
(1987, 30 –31) to speculate that the en-
tire group had been killed.

Another multiple burial in western
Oklahoma provides evidence for violence
during the transitional Archaic period.
Francie Gettys (1991) reports that Bur-
ial 2 at 34RM668 consisted of three ﬂexed
skeletons in a single interment. One of the
individuals was beheaded prior to burial,
and corner- and side-notched dart points
associated with two individuals are inter-
preted as the cause of death. Two radio-
carbon dates on bone collagen indicate
that these individuals were killed and
buried between a.d. 210 and 440 (Okla-
homa Archeological Survey 1993). This
multiple burial, which is approximately
contemporaneous with the Sam Wahl site

burial, provides evidence for intercultural
conﬂict immediately preceding or per-
haps early in Palo Duro Complex times.
The archeological evidence indicates
that intercultural conﬂicts had begun at
least by the ﬁrst few centuries a.d. and
continued throughout the ﬁrst millen-
nium a.d. While there is no indisputable
evidence indicating that the Palo Duro
and Lake Creek/Plains Woodland peoples
were enemies, both groups were engaged
in conﬂicts of some type and it seems
likely that enmity existed between them.
If the Double Burial victims were Plains
Woodland individuals who were killed by
Palo Duro peoples, the evidence argues
for a cultural boundary between Palo
Duro and Lake Creek/Plains Woodland
peoples somewhere in the vicinity of the
Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River.
The few Palo Duro components found
along the Canadian River (i.e., the South
Ridge, the Maintenance Barn, and Fa-
theree sites) are located well inside the
area where Lake Creek occupations are
common. Given the possibility of warfare
between these cultures, this phenomenon
is somewhat difﬁcult to explain. These
sites indicate that Palo Duro peoples ven-
tured into the Canadian River valley, but
it is not known if this venture represents
an unusual occurrence or if there may have
been consistent overlap and/or periodic
ﬂuctuation in the territorial boundary.
The presence of occasional brownware
sherds in some Lake Creek components
could indicate that there was some form
of exchange between the two groups.

There are many possible explanations
for the relationship between the Palo Duro
and Lake Creek (and other Plains Wood-
land) peoples, and a few of them are of-
fered here, as food for thought: (1) The
Palo Duro and Lake Creek peoples were
never enemies, their territories overlapped,
they interacted frequently, and other
groups were responsible for the violence;
(2) the Palo Duro and Lake Creek peoples
were longtime enemies who came from
very different cultural traditions, the ter-
ritorial boundary between them ﬂuctu-
ated, and the Palo Duro culture extended
into the Canadian River valley at some
time; (3) the Palo Duro and Lake Creek
peoples may have coexisted peacefully for
some time, but hostilities developed near
the end of the Late Prehistoric I period;

10-A2946  4/13/04  12:21 PM  Page 326

326 / HIGH PLAINS AND CANYONLANDS

or (4) the Palo Duro and Plains Wood-
land cultural traditions actually represent
many different groups (rather than just
two) who interacted with each other in
various ways (as allies or enemies) at dif-
ferent times.

The extent of the Palo Duro Complex

to the east is uncertain. Diagnostic Palo
Duro artifacts were not recovered in the
surveys and testing at Truscott (Etchieson
et al. 1978) and Crowell (Etchieson et al.
1979) Reservoirs, nor have they been re-
ported elsewhere in the Texas Rolling
Plains. Thus, it is not certain whether
Palo Duro peoples avoided the region or
perhaps ventured there occasionally but
left behind no diagnostic artifacts that
archeologists have recognized. It does
seem unlikely that residential bases would
be common in some parts of the Texas
Rolling Plains. Even if some riverine areas
had sufﬁcient fresh water and other re-
sources to support such occupations,
these areas would have been isolated oases
within a sea of saline water and sparse re-
sources. And, being outside their primary
territory, such isolated villages would have
been much more vulnerable to attack.

It is not known whether the Palo Duro
Complex extends south into the canyon-
lands of the upper Colorado River drain-
age. Little archeological work has been re-
ported immediately south of Lake Alan
Henry, but one gets the impression that
Deadman’s-like points and Mogollon pot-
tery are rare. No pottery or early stemmed
arrow points were found during recent
survey and testing at Mitchell Reservoir,
but Scallorn-like points indicate that
some occupations occurred during Late
Prehistoric I times (Lintz et al. 1991,
1993). There are not sufﬁcient archeolog-
ical data to indicate whether the upper
Colorado River (in Borden, Dawson,
Howard, Mitchell, and Scurry Counties)
was or was not occupied by Palo Duro
peoples. The Big Spring site (Sommer
1971) in Howard County, for example,
has produced artifacts similar to those of
the Palo Duro Complex, but the context
and age of these materials are not certain.
If this site represents a Palo Duro compo-
nent, which is possible, it would provide
evidence that the complex does extend
into the upper Colorado River drainage.
Immediately southeast of the Palo
Duro Complex is the aceramic Blow Out
Mountain phase. It is possible that this

poorly deﬁned cultural entity is misrepre-
sented because the apparent absence of
ceramics may be due to inadequate arche-
ological sampling. The Blow Out Moun-
tain phase appears to be different from
the Palo Duro Complex in some ways,
but the projectile points are similar.
While no true Deadman’s points are re-
ported in the area, the arrow points of
the Blow Out Mountain phase include
stemmed Bonham-like varieties that look
like Deadman’s with shorter barbs or
without barbs (see Creel 1990, ﬁg. 42;
Wulfkuhle 1986, ﬁg. 132), and they are
quite similar to many of the stemmed
points found at Palo Duro sites. Not
much is known about the Blow Out
Mountain phase because the East Levee
site (41TG91) is the only site that has
been investigated intensively (Creel
1990), except for burials. Thus, it is quite
speculative to comment on the relation-
ship between the Palo Duro and Blow
Out Mountain cultures at this time.

A large number of excavated burials
have been attributed to the Blow Out
Mountain phase, and they constitute an
important data base. Unfortunately, pub-
lished data are nonexistent or inadequate
for most of these burials, and none have
been radiocarbon dated. In the 1930s,
Cyrus Ray (1932, 1933, 1936, 1946) in-
vestigated numerous burials found on
prominent hills and ridges, both as iso-
lated cairn-covered burials and as large
rock cairns containing individual and
multiple graves. These “covered mounds”
or “stone cist mounds” as Ray (1932,
1933) called them, represent cemeteries
that usually contain primary burials in
ﬂexed positions, but cremated remains
are sometimes present as well. Many
burials in the region are found inside
rock-lined cists, but most contain few
grave goods and no diagnostics. Hence,
their association with the Blow Out
Mountain phase is tentative and is based
on the fact that some of the burials have
stemmed (Bonham-like) arrow points as-
sociated with them. It is interesting that
Ray (1933, 23) suggests a southwestern
origin for the cist-lined graves observed in
many of the Abilene-area burial mounds,
but the diversity of Blow Out Mountain
mortuary traits (e.g., lined and unlined
graves, with and without cairns, contain-
ing primary interments, bundle burials,
and cremations) has not been studied in

any detail. What is important, however,
is that the stemmed points in Blow Out
Mountain burials are somewhat similar to
points found in the Palo Duro Complex,
and the contexts of many of the points
indicate that they represent the cause of
death rather than grave offerings.

The Roberts Covered Mound No. 3
(probably in Taylor County) is a good ex-
ample of a Blow Out Mountain phase
cemetery, and Ray (1933) reports that
this mound contained ten individual in-
terments. Two were bundle burials,
found in the upper part of the mound,
and one of these had a stemmed (Alba-
like) arrow point associated with it (Ray
1933, plate 8). The other eight were pri-
mary ﬂexed burials in individual cists,
and very few artifacts were found in asso-
ciation (a bison toe bone and a bone awl
are the only items mentioned). Five of the
primary burials had no mandibles, and
their absence could not be attributed to
any form of disturbance. Ray (1933, 19 –
20) suggested that the jaws had been taken
as war trophies. A mandible also was miss-
ing from one cist grave in the nearby Al-
exander Mound (Ray 1933, 22).

Robert E. Forrester (1951) reports
similar ﬁndings in a series of burials in
Shackelford County. Eighteen individuals
were found in four separate burial areas,
or “burial plots,” within three hundred
yards along a creek terrace. Of particular
interest, two young males in Burial Plot
II (a single grave) had been killed. Both
had stemmed arrow points found in con-
texts indicating that they were the cause
of death. One individual was missing his
hands and feet, and cut marks on the dis-
tal end of the ulna suggest that they were
removed as war trophies. In addition, the
charred mandible of a child was found in
the chest area of one skeleton, indicating
that this war trophy had been worn as a
pendant.

Of nine individuals in Burial Plot III,
which is similar to Ray’s (1933) covered-
mound cemeteries, two adult males
(Skeletons 4 and 5) were buried with
grave offerings reminiscent of those in
Palo Duro Complex burials (i.e., mussel
shells and deer bone tools). A stemmed
arrow point was found in association with
one man (Skeleton 4) who had been
buried in a single grave with three other
people (Skeletons 1–3 are an elderly fe-
male and two infants). The point has

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

10-A2946  4/13/04  12:21 PM  Page 327

proximal and distal breaks that appear to
be impact related (the proximal break is
almost identical to the one on the arrow
point embedded in the humerus of Skele-
ton 2 in Burial Plot II), and the point
probably represents the cause of death.
If this interpretation is correct, it is quite
possible that the other three individuals
buried in the same grave also were killed.
None of the Shackelford County buri-

als have been radiocarbon dated, but the
association with early types of arrow points
indicates that they date to Late Prehistoric
I times and also suggests a likely afﬁliation
with the Blow Out Mountain phase (Creel
1990, 17). These points are basically simi-
lar to the Alba, Bonham, and Sabinal
styles, but they do not quite ﬁt into a
single type. Forrester (1987) has since sug-
gested that they be called Moran points.
Several cairn burials have been found
in and near O. H. Ivie Reservoir in Con-
cho, Coleman, and Runnels Counties, and
two of them date to Late Prehistoric I
times. Although it is not yet reported in
detail, Lintz et al. (1993, 647– 49) men-
tion a burial excavated by the Concho
Valley Archeological Society at 41CN94
that is similar to the Shackelford County
burials and yielded a Sabinal arrow point
( J. A. Jaquier 1993, personal communica-
tion). At 41CC237, a child cremation
and a bundle burial of an adult male prob-
ably were interred at the same time in a
single cairn-covered grave (Lintz et al.
1993, 649 –59). Although the artifacts
found in the burial pit (thin bifacial pre-
forms, unifacial tools, debitage, modiﬁed
limonite fragments, and nineteen Olivella
shell beads) are not temporally sensitive,
a radiocarbon date of a.d. 280 –570 (cali-
brated) was obtained on bone collagen
from the adult skeleton. A possible cut
mark observed on one rib may be evi-
dence of dismemberment, and the man-
dible is notably absent from the burial.

The evidence for violence in Blow Out
Mountain phase burials (and in culturally
unassigned burials such as at 41CC237)
is intriguing, but it is too early to draw
any ﬁrm conclusions. Perhaps the Palo
Duro peoples were engaged in conﬂicts
with peoples to the south and southeast,
as well as with groups to the north and
northeast. The taking of human jaws as
war trophies attests to the intensity of the
hostilities, which had perhaps escalated to
the point of all-out warfare.

PALO DURO COMPLEX / 327

To the west and southwest of the Palo
Duro Complex are the Middle Pecos and
Eastern Jornada Mogollon culture areas.
Lying between is a sizable portion of the
Llano Estacado that one would think
was virtually uninhabited based on the
paucity of published archeological data.
While this perception may be true to an
extent, there is evidence that people tra-
versed the Llano using southeastward-
ﬂowing drainages as highways, and there
is evidence for more-than-ephemeral Late
Prehistoric occupations at some large
playa and pluvial lakes on the southern
Llano. The only well-documented Late
Prehistoric playa lake site in the southern
Llano Estacado is the Salt Cedar site
(M. Collins 1968). Occupations at this
residential base, which currently marks the
easternmost edge of the Eastern Jornada
Mogollon, date primarily after a.d. 1100
but may have begun during Late Prehis-
toric I times.

Based on survey evidence alone, it may

be speculated that the Palo Duro Com-
plex extends up onto the eastern edge of
the southern Llano Estacado. The possi-
bility that a Palo Duro component may
be present in Lynn County has been
mentioned, and early stemmed arrow
points and Jornada brownware pottery
have been found at several playa lake sites
in Lubbock County (C. Brown 1985,
1990a, 1990b, 1991a, 1991b, n.d.). The
presence of Palo Duro occupations on the
southern Llano has yet to be conﬁrmed
through excavations, but it is possible that
at least a few components did exist around
playa and pluvial lakes. If this is the case,
there is still much to be learned about
how these High Plains sites ﬁt into the
overall Palo Duro subsistence and settle-
ment pattern.

Despite the geographic gap in the re-
gional data, the Palo Duro Complex con-
tains deﬁnite evidence, in the form of
brownware pottery, that there was some
transfer of material culture from the Jor-
nada Mogollon area across the southern
Llano Estacado and into the Caprock
Canyonlands. There also is other circum-
stantial evidence for some form of cul-
tural interaction and exchange of ideas
between Jornada Mogollon and Palo Duro
peoples. It is this author’s opinion, appar-
ently one that is also shared by J. Brett
Cruse (1992) and Jack Hughes (1991),
that the interaction between these groups

was direct, that the Jornada inﬂuence
upon the Palo Duro culture was quite
strong and consistent through time, and
that it involved much more than just the
acquisition of pots. The nature and ex-
tent of the interaction between the East-
ern Jornada peoples and the Palo Duro
culture is a research problem that is likely
to be controversial. Although the ideas
discussed below admittedly are specula-
tive, it is hoped that they will spur debate
between southwestern and Southern
Plains archeologists.

Pottery constitutes the only direct evi-
dence for inﬂuence from the Jornada Mo-
gollon area. Almost all of the pottery
sherds found at Palo Duro sites are iden-
tiﬁed generically as some variety of Jor-
nada Mogollon brownware. Most are
tempered with crushed igneous rocks and
are indisputably of nonlocal origin when
found in the Texas Panhandle Plains. The
varieties that have been identiﬁed ( Jor-
nada Brown, Alma Plain, El Paso Brown,
Roswell Brown, South Pecos Brown,
Middle Pecos Micaceous, and McKenzie
Brown) were manufactured in the Jor-
nada Mogollon or Middle Pecos areas,
and very few brownware sherds have been
identiﬁed as possibly being locally made
wares. The consistent presence of small
quantities of nonlocal brownwares in
many Texas sites indicates that the Palo
Duro peoples maintained at least periodic
contact with Jornada Mogollon peoples
over a long period of time. Pottery sherds
are not very abundant, but sometimes as
many as four vessels are represented at a
single Palo Duro site. Ceramics are sufﬁ-
ciently scarce to indicate that the supply
of pots was rather limited, perhaps be-
cause Palo Duro groups did not make
journeys to the Jornada region on an an-
nual or regular basis, or perhaps because
of the high labor cost involved in trans-
porting large, fragile vessels over long
distances on foot. Exactly how the pots
made their way into the Panhandle Plains
region is not known. Although interme-
diary groups could have been involved,
the relatively short distance between the
Caprock Canyonlands and the Pecos
River valley (250 to 300 km) suggests
that Palo Duro peoples acquired pots di-
rectly from the Eastern Jornada groups.
Other evidence for the Palo Duro
Complex having been inﬂuenced by the
Jornada Mogollon culture is circumstan-

tial, but it is nonetheless strong. The ar-
chitectural similarities between the Palo
Duro and Eastern Jornada pithouses are
particularly intriguing. Various research-
ers have noted similarities between the
Palo Duro pithouses and those of the Jor-
nada Mogollon area, while noting the
lack of similarities with houses of nearby
Plains Woodland and Plains Village Com-
plexes (Boyd 1995a, 1995b; Boyd et al.
1994, 116 –17, 260; Cruse 1992, 127–
29; J. Hughes 1991, 26). Although rect-
angular and circular pithouses are found
among many cultures and the shape alone
is not diagnostic, when the combination
of traits is considered, the closest archi-
tectural parallels are clearly to the west
and southwest rather than to the north or
east. It is notable also that pithouses in the
Jornada Mogollon area exhibit consider-
able architectural variability, and if the
sample of three is any indication, so do
the pithouses of the Palo Duro Complex.
Rectangular structures—both surface
and pithouses—are known for Southern
Plains Woodland and Plains Village Com-
plexes, but they are very different from
those at the Kent Creek site (Boyd et al.
1994, 116). In contrast, Cruse (1992,
127–29) notes that many architectural
traits observed for the Kent Creek pit-
houses are similar to those seen in Jornada
Mogollon pithouses. Particularly diagnos-
tic are the ramped entryways, which are a
common feature in Jornada pithouses but
are not seen in any Plains Woodland or
Plains Village houses. Other architectural
parallels between Kent Creek and Mogo-
llon pithouses include small trough fea-
tures or steps just inside the entryway,
comparable variability in interior ﬂoor
area, the use of a single large roof support
post, and the practice of subﬂoor burials
inside houses.

In addition, there is one example that

shows a striking parallel between Kent
Creek and the Jornada area. A rectangular
pithouse (Pitroom R-2) excavated at the
Merchant site in Lea County, New Mex-
ico, is very similar in size, shape, and en-
try conﬁguration to Structure 2 at Kent
Creek (see Leslie 1965, ﬁg. 3, with Cruse
1992, ﬁgs. 6 and 10). Unfortunately,
there are no radiocarbon dates directly as-
sociated with either structure, and R. H.
Leslie’s (1965) assessment that the Mer-
chant site dates to the ﬁfteenth century is
based solely on a few decorated pottery
sherds (which make up only a small per-

centage of the total ceramic assemblage)
and could be very misleading. Cruse
(1992, 129) notes that the elongated
trough features along the front and back
walls of Structure 2 are unique to the
Kent Creek pithouses.

Similarly, the ephemeral pithouse at

the Sam Wahl site has no analogs in
nearby Plains Woodland or Plains Village
Complexes, but very similar round to
oval structures are present in the Key-
stone Dam area near El Paso (Carmi-
chael 1985, 142 – 49; O’Laughlin 1980,
135 – 49) and at the Fox Place and King
Ranch sites near Roswell (Wiseman
1981, 174 –75; 1988, 229; 1993, per-
sonal communication). The Keystone
Dam structures date earlier (ca. 550 b.c.
to a.d. 150) than the Sam Wahl pithouse,
while the King Ranch structures are later
(ca. a.d. 1150 –1300). Unpublished dates
for the Fox Place pithouses indicate they
were used in the 1200s and 1300s (Regge
Wiseman 1997, personal communica-
tion). Southwestern pithouse occupations
are continually being pushed back earlier
in time, and it seems likely that Jornada
Mogollon pithouses will prove to be the
prototypes for those in the Caprock
Canyonlands.

There also are broad similarities in the
subsistence strategies and settlement pat-
terns of the Palo Duro and Eastern Jor-
nada peoples. Mesquite and shin oak have
been identiﬁed as probable staple foods
utilized by both groups. Except for a
slightly lower rainfall and minor differ-
ences in plant and animal communities,
the Mescalero Escarpment on the west
edge of the Llano Estacado is in many
ways similar to the Caprock Escarpment.
Consequently, it should not be surprising
that human populations adapted to these
areas in a similar manner. Many of the
subsistence and settlement pattern char-
acteristics proposed for the Eastern Jor-
nada area are similar to adaptive strategies
that Palo Duro peoples may have em-
ployed in the Caprock Canyonlands.
Leslie (1979) notes that the Querecho-
Maljamar phases are characterized by pit-
house villages and seasonal camp sites, a
heavy dependence upon plant foods, the
predominant use of oval basin metates
and convex-faced manos, and the domi-
nant use of a variety of corner-notched
arrow points.

The same amount of variability in ar-

row point morphology within the Palo

Duro Complex is evident in the arrow
points of the pithouse period in the East-
ern Jornada area (Leslie 1978). The cor-
ner- and basal-notched stemmed arrow
points of the Palo Duro Complex are
very similar to and exhibit the same range
of variability as Leslie’s (1978) Types 3A
through 3E, including occasional serrated
blades. These points are associated with
Leslie’s (1978, ﬁg. 13) Querecho phase,
although the dates that he gives for this
phase are probably far too recent. Jelinek
(1967, 103 –105, 110) also documents a
similar variety of points in the Late Ar-
chaic through Late 18 Mile phases and
notes that serration is most strongly asso-
ciated with pithouse occupations of the
Early 18 Mile through Early Mesita Ne-
gra phases (a.d. 800 to 1100).

Similarly, the most common points as-

sociated with the Blow Out Mountain
phase are a variety of stemmed points
that do not ﬁt neatly into a single type
but are similar to arrow points of the Palo
Duro Complex and Eastern Jornada areas
(e.g., Type 3D in Leslie 1978). Regardless
of the names one assigns to them, there
seems to be some morphological continu-
ity between the stemmed arrow points of
the Palo Duro Complex, the Blow Out
Mountain phase, the Eastern Jornada,
and Middle Pecos areas. While corner-
notched dart points (i.e., Ellis-like points)
of the Panhandle Plains Late Archaic bi-
son hunters may be the prototypes for
ubiquitous Scallorn-like arrow points of
the Lake Creek and Palo Duro Com-
plexes, the unusual Deadman’s arrow
points seem to appear suddenly and
rather early (probably before a.d. 500).
There is no precursor evident among
Southern Plains Late Archaic points, and
it is possible that the prototype for Dead-
man’s points may be found in the Shumla
dart points of the Lower Pecos and south
Texas areas. Shumla-like dart points are
present but rare throughout much of the
Jornada area at least as far west as Las
Cruces, New Mexico (MacNeish 1993b,
179). In addition, the corner-notched to
stemmed (and sometimes serrated) Pen-
dejo points found in southern New Mex-
ico (along with Shumla and Hueco
points) are quite similar to the early
stemmed arrow points found in the Cap-
rock Canyonlands and west-central Texas.
In the Jornada area, Pendejo points are
found in the Late Archaic and in the
Mesilla phase (MacNeish 1993b, 183 –

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

10-A2946  4/13/04  12:21 PM  Page 329

84), and they could be the prototype for
similar arrow points in the Palo Duro
Complex and Blow Out Mountain phase.

The rather sudden appearance of
Deadman’s-like arrow points may only
signal the adoption of the bow and arrow
by indigenous groups, or it may mark the
appearance of new peoples in the Cap-
rock Canyonlands (i.e., the Palo Duro
Complex) and in west-central Texas (i.e.,
the Blow Out Mountain phase). This au-
thor prefers the latter interpretation and
suggests that strong evidence for the ar-
rival of new peoples is found in the buri-
als throughout the region. A growing
amount of evidence—some deﬁnitive,
some circumstantial— denotes the forma-
tion of territorial boundaries and increas-
ingly widespread violence among many
Southern Plains cultures during the ﬁrst
millennium a.d. These events set the stage
for the escalating warfare seen during later
Plains Village times (Brooks 1994a).

If Palo Duro peoples were newcomers

to the Caprock Canyonlands sometime
between a.d. 1 and 500, where did they
come from? Perhaps Krieger (1946, 80 –
82) was on the right track in the mid-
twentieth century when he observed that
there was virtually no difference in the
archeology of the New Mexico and Texas
portions of the southern Llano Estacado.
He suggested that the Southern High
Plains had been “actually inhabited by
Puebloans, if only seasonally” (Krieger
1946, 80). Given the evidence for cul-
tural inﬂuence from the west, one must
look to the Jornada Mogollon region (in-
cluding its eastern extension east of the
Pecos River) as the most likely area of ori-
gin for many cultural traits of the Palo
Duro Complex. It is not suggested that
Palo Duro peoples were direct lineal de-
scendants of Jornada Mogollon peoples.
Although this certainly is one possibility,
there simply is not enough evidence to
support such a statement. There is sufﬁ-
cient evidence, however, to suggest that
Palo Duro peoples may have been descen-
dants of hunter-gatherers who, having
lived in close contact with Jornada Mogo-
llon peoples in what is now southeastern
New Mexico and far western Texas, mi-
grated east or northeastward onto the
Southern Plains.

What became of the Palo Duro Com-
plex is equally problematic and perplex-
ing. Without going into the myriad of
possibilities regarding the fate of this cul-

PALO DURO COMPLEX / 329

ture, the most logical idea is one that
links the Palo Duro Complex (and per-
haps the Blow Out Mountain phase) with
the Toyah phase of central and south
Texas. Harry Shafer (1977) originally
proposed that the Toyah culture was de-
rived from Southern Plains bison-hunting
peoples who migrated southward. LeRoy
Johnson (1994, 271–81) has elaborated
upon this idea and proposes that the clas-
sic Toyah phase retains enough subtle
traits, primarily in pottery styles and
manufacturing techniques, to link it to
the Jornada Mogollon cultural tradition.
While much of its material culture repre-
sents classic Plains bison-hunting gear
(i.e., the beveled Harahey skinning knives
and Plains-style hafted end scrapers), the
pointed-stemmed Perdiz point is distinc-
tive, and its logical prototype is found in
the stemmed arrow points of the Blow
Out Mountain culture. Johnson (1994)
suggests that Toyah peoples are descen-
dants of groups who made Jornada Mo-
gollon–tradition pottery, slightly modi-
ﬁed their stemmed arrow points into the
distinctive Perdiz style, and adopted a
Plains bison-hunting lifestyle. He also
suggests that the Mogollon inﬂuence may
have been indirect and that the earliest
Toyah peoples could have come from the
Southern Plains rather than from the Jor-
nada Mogollon region.

I would further modify Johnson’s
(1994) hypothesis and suggest that the
Blow Out Mountain phase is somehow
related to the Palo Duro Complex. Al-
though purely conjectural, these manifes-
tations may prove to be northern and
southern variants of the same cultural
tradition. The stemmed Bonham-like ar-
row points that characterize the Blow
Out Mountain phase are little more than
modiﬁed Deadman’s points, but the latter
represent the earliest narrow-stemmed ar-
row point form in the Texas Panhandle
Plains. Consequently, the Deadman’s
point is the logical prototype for the
stemmed Blow Out Mountain points and
ultimately, if Johnson (1994) is correct,
for Perdiz points as well. Although it will
be difﬁcult to determine whether the Palo
Duro Complex and the Blow Out Moun-
tain phase are ancestral to the Toyah
phase, this hypothesis is worth testing.
One possible scenario is that, as the
climate dried and bison populations in-
creased in the Southern Plains around
a.d. 1100 –1300, peoples of the Palo

Duro Complex and the Blow Out Moun-
tain phase quickly adopted a Plains bison-
hunting lifestyle and material culture, and
they began to migrate southward. This
migration may have been spurred, in a
domino effect, by pressures from south-
ward-migrating Athapaskan-speaking
peoples who moved from the Central
Plains into the Southern Plains around
a.d. 1300 –1400 (but that is another
story altogether). The wide geographic
range and the extreme archeological vari-
ability that characterize the Toyah phase
may be partially explained if these proto-
Toyah peoples spread throughout central
and south Texas within one or two centu-
ries and eventually displaced or assimi-
lated with but also adopted traits from in-
digenous groups.

Summary of Conclusions

The Palo Duro Complex has been
redeﬁned in light of recent archeological
ﬁnds. The complex dates to the period
between a.d. 500 and 1100/1200, and a
wide range of activities and site functions
are inferred for the three types of habita-
tion sites that are recognized. The Kent
Creek and Sam Wahl sites are identiﬁed
as residential bases where people lived in
pithouses while procuring, processing,
storing, and consuming a wide range of
wild plant foods. Mesquite beans and
shin oak acorns have been identiﬁed as
possible staples, but other plants such as
goosefoot and buffalo gourds also may
have been important foods. Although no
cultigens have been found, this situation
does not preclude the possibility that lim-
ited horticulture was practiced at residen-
tial sites. Occupations at these villages
were at least seasonal (i.e., during late
summer to fall harvest and into winter)
and may have been biseasonal (i.e., dur-
ing planting and then again during fall
harvest and into winter).

Palo Duro peoples lived in rockshelters

and open camps at various times of the
year and for different reasons. Some rock-
shelters were occupied on a sporadic and
ephemeral basis, while others were more
intensively used and may have served as
relatively permanent bases. Some camp
sites were little more than specialized pro-
cessing sites where baking and grinding
of plant foods were the primary activities,
while others were multifunctional bases
where considerable hunting and process-

ing of animals was done. Deer and small
animals appear to have been the principal
game animals. Bison were hunted but do
not appear to have been a major food re-
source, and the evidence suggests that
populations may have been relatively low.
Palo Duro culture is now viewed as
representing semisedentary peoples who
maintained a high degree of residential
mobility in order to exploit a wide range
of resources that were locally available
and abundant on a seasonal basis. Sites
of this complex are found mainly in the
Caprock Canyonlands, an ecological sub-
region that offered the most predictable
and widest range of subsistence resources
(water, plants, and animals) within a rela-
tively arid landscape. The home territory
for Palo Duro peoples was in the upper
drainages of the Red and Brazos Rivers,
although they may have ranged on occa-
sion north into the Canadian River valley,
east into the Rolling Plains, south into
the upper Colorado River drainage, and
west onto the Llano Estacado.

Human burials provide evidence of
widespread violence in and around the
Caprock Canyonlands during the Late
Prehistoric I period, and the Palo Duro
culture may have come into periodic con-
tact with enemy peoples to the north and
east (Lake Creek or Plains Woodland
groups) and to the south and southeast
(Blow Out Mountain and other unde-

ﬁned groups). Palo Duro peoples did
maintain some form of cultural contact
with the Jornada Mogollon peoples of
southeastern New Mexico and western
Texas over a long period of time. There
appears to be a signiﬁcant amount of Jor-
nada Mogollon cultural inﬂuence across
the southern Llano Estacado and into the
Caprock Canyonlands, and the Palo Duro
Complex exhibits many traits (e.g., im-
ported brownware pottery and pithouse
architectural styles) that were derived,
whether directly or indirectly, from the
Jornada Mogollon region. In addition,
the similarities between the subsistence
and settlement patterns proposed for the
Palo Duro Complex and those proposed
for their eastern Jornada Mogollon neigh-
bors may be more than a mere coinci-
dence. In summary, it is unclear whether
the Palo Duro Complex represents an ac-
tual migration of Jornada Mogollon or re-
lated peoples or whether it simply repre-
sents indigenous Southern Plains people
who came under the widespread inﬂu-
ence of Jornada Mogollon culture or
something much more complex.

From Stone Slab Architecture to Abandonment
A Revisionist View of the Antelope Creek Phase

Robert L. Brooks

When Francisco Vázquez de Coronado’s
entrada crossed the Texas and Oklahoma
Panhandles in the summer of 1541, there
was no evidence that the region had been
occupied by a village society living in
dwellings built with stone slabs. Coro-
nado encountered the Jumanos, Quere-
chos, and the Teyas, highly mobile bison-
hunting and gathering bands. Yet ﬁfty to
one hundred years before the appearance
of the Spanish, numerous villages of this
culture—which archeologists have termed
the Antelope Creek phase (Lintz 1984,
1986)—were spread throughout the pan-
handle regions of Texas and Oklahoma.
Because of the apparent abandonment of
the region and the absence of oral history
pertaining to these people, their culture
history remains elusive.

Antelope Creek phase sites have been
studied since the early part of the twenti-
eth century, but many questions remain
unanswered concerning the origins of
these people, their way of life, and ulti-
mately, their disappearance from the
Southern High Plains. However, my pur-
pose is not to recapitulate the extensive
work and documentation done on Ante-
lope Creek (see Krieger 1946; Lintz 1984,
1986). Instead, I characterize salient
themes of Antelope Creek culture and ex-
amine them from a revisionist perspec-
tive. Revisionism here is not drawn from
post-processualism (Hodder 1986) but
from an attempt to interpret the archeo-
logical record based on what we currently

know of the material record of Antelope
Creek (Binford 1983, 19 –22). Much of
the existing work on Antelope Creek has
stressed the cultural-historical, albeit ma-
terial culture, record rather than interpret-
ing this information in relation to Ante-
lope Creek social, political, and economic
lifeways. For example, it is well known
that people of the Antelope Creek phase
built stone slab single-room and multi-
room structures. However, what were the
implications of this architectural style for
the ongoing Antelope Creek cultural sys-
tem between ﬁve hundred and eight hun-
dred years ago? I discuss in a similar fash-
ion areas such as subsistence, technology,
social organization, trade, and warfare.
The origins of the Antelope Creek phase
and the biological characteristics of these
people are also explored from this per-
spective of an interpretable record.

A General Overview
of Antelope Creek

The Antelope Creek phase represents a

provocative mix of masonry architecture
reminiscent of pueblos in the southwest-
ern United States and a material culture
bearing many similarities to Central Plains
village farming societies. Between roughly
a.d. 1200 and 1500, numerous settle-
ments of the Antelope Creek culture were
present along the Canadian and North
Canadian Rivers and their principal tribu-
taries in the Oklahoma and Texas Pan-

331

handles (Fig. 11.1). Important studied
sites include Antelope Creek 22 (W. Hol-
den 1930; C. S. Johnson 1939), Ante-
lope Creek 24 (Dufﬁeld 1970), Chimney
Creek (E. Baker and Baker 1941), Coetas
Creek Ruin 55 (Studer 1934), Alibates 28
(Dufﬁeld 1970b), Tarbox (W. Holden
1930), Saddleback ( Green 1967; T. Hol-
den 1934), Arrowhead Point (Green
1967), Medford Ranch (Dufﬁeld 1964),
Footprint (Green 1967), Spring Canyon,
Conner, Pickett, Roper, Sanford, Canyon
City (Dufﬁeld 1970b), and Landergin
Mesa (Lintz 1990a) in Texas; and Stam-
per (Watson 1950), Roy Smith (Schnei-
der 1969), Two Sisters (Lintz 1979; Dun-
can 2002) and McGrath (Lintz 1976),
and possibly Odessa Yates (Brosowske
and Bement 1998) in Oklahoma. Gener-
ally, these sites occur in Southern High
Plains settings, frequently on high ter-
races or mesas at some distance from wa-
ter supplies.

In this portion of the southern Great
Plains, the landscape is characterized by
overlapping sequences of alluvial fans
trending northwest from the Edwards
Plateau to the Rocky Mountains (Lintz
1984, 39). Geomorphological degrada-
tion of these landforms has resulted in
the formation of shallow basins and relic
Pleistocene lake valleys. This degrading of
the alluvial fans has also resulted in ero-
sional remnants to the east and west, es-
sentially circumscribing the area. To the
east, erosion of the fans and relic valleys

Five major plant ecosystems are present
that attest to an extensive array of plants
available within the region (Wright and
Meador 1979). While these associations
are dominated by native grasses, a variety
of edible wild plants such as chickasaw
plum, lambsquarter, and marsh elder also
occur. These plants were used by Ante-
lope Creek phase people as a source of
starchy foods, as were the introduced
tropical domesticates of corn, beans, and
squash (Lintz 1986).

Previous Investigations and
Cultural Taxonomy

Previous Field Investigations

Lintz (1986, 5 –20) has presented an
excellent and thorough overview of previ-
ous studies of the Panhandle aspect and
the Antelope Creek phase. Other signiﬁ-
cant summaries of Antelope Creek can be
found in Krieger (1946, 17-74), Hughes
(1968), R. Campbell (1969), and Hof-
man et. al (1989b). Because of the lim-
ited ﬁeld research undertaken at Antelope
Creek sites since Lintz’s synthesis in the
mid-1980s, I can impart relatively little
new information to the existing literature.
However, a brief history of previous in-
vestigations will set the stage for future
sections of this chapter and also serve to
explain some of our difﬁculties in inter-
preting the archeological record as it per-
tains to the Antelope Creek phase.

Dr. T. L. Eyerly of Canadian Baptist
Academy, between 1907 and 1912 (see
Eyerly 1907), conducted initial investiga-
tions at village sites in the Panhandle re-
gion. Eyerly’s work was focused on sites in
the Wolf Creek valley (Ochiltree County)
and involved minimal excavations, other
than at Handley Ruin (Buried City).
However, Eyerly was the ﬁrst to take note
of the vertically set stone slabs within the
house walls. A few years later, in 1914 –
15, J. Walter Fewkes reportedly con-
ducted limited work at Handley Ruin,
again in the Wolf Creek valley, where a
burial was recovered (Moorehead 1931).
During 1917, Joseph Thoburn of the
University of Oklahoma conducted sur-
vey work in the Oklahoma Panhandle,
and he documented numerous prehistoric
sites, including some later identiﬁed as
Antelope Creek occupations.

Beginning in 1919, Warren K. Moore-
head of Phillips Academy initiated a pro-

has left a pronounced escarpment, char-
acterized by rugged terrain and steep re-
lief. To the west, the Pecos River dissected
the Llano Estacado, creating a second dis-
tinctive escarpment. From my perspec-
tive, this circumscription may have played
a signiﬁcant role in the continuity and
change observed in Antelope Creek phase
culture. These rather crude boundaries
would have served as permeable barriers
to contact with other groups as well as ex-
pansion of Antelope Creek settlements to
adjacent regions. Other characteristics of
the landscape were also essential to the
formation of this rather complicated cul-
tural context.

Within the Canadian River valley are
found outcrops of Alibates agatized dolo-
mite. Serving as a source for chipped
stone tool manufacture since approxi-
mately twelve thousand years ago (Lintz
1986, 45, 48), the Alibates quarries ap-
pear to have been especially favored dur-
ing Late Prehistoric village farming times.
I think it signiﬁcant that many Antelope
Creek settlements are found in settings
surrounding the “core area” where Ali-
bates ﬂint is most abundant and of the
highest quality. These and other geologic
formations also provided the limestone

slabs that were used in construction of
the masonry architecture. Without the
presence of this geological phenomenon,
such a distinctive style of architecture
probably would not have arisen.

The use of speciﬁc soil types for settle-

ment location does not appear to have
been a major determining factor in site
selection. However, most Antelope Creek
settlements are found on soils that are
well drained and could potentially be re-
charged by alluvial deposition. Because of
the restrictive climatic conditions within
the region, I suspect that fertile soils would
be necessary to foster agricultural produc-
tivity. Christopher Lintz (1986) and L. F.
Dufﬁeld (1970b) have presented a thor-
ough treatment of the animal communi-
ties that are found throughout the Okla-
homa and Texas Panhandles. They list
numerous species of animals, including
bison, pronghorn antelope, mule deer,
elk, jackrabbit and cottontail rabbit,
badger, porcupine, and numerous small
rodents, distributed among three ecosys-
tems. Evidence from Antelope Creek
phase site investigations suggests that bi-
son was a preferred species in the pro-
curement regime, with lesser emphasis on
mule deer, pronghorn, and smaller game.

gram of research in the Canadian River
valley. Although he principally surveyed
the valley for sites (recording more than
one hundred), Moorehead (1921) also
examined Handley Ruins in 1920. Less
than ten years later, University of Penn-
sylvania researchers Ronald Olsen and
J. Alden Mason were present in the Texas
Panhandle studying Plains culture. Olsen
continued earlier efforts at surveying the
Canadian River valley, whereas Mason
(1929) conducted excavations at Alibates
28. William C. Holden of Texas Tech
University undertook some of the more
extensive work at Antelope Creek sites
during this period. Holden excavated at
Tarbox, Antelope Creek 22, and Saddle-
back and Lookout ruins. His reports (see
W. Holden 1933) represent the ﬁrst de-
tailed documentation of Antelope Creek
architecture and site structure although,
as Lintz (1986, 10) notes, there were
sometimes inconsistencies and inaccura-
cies in his accounts. In 1932 E. B. Sayles
of the Gila Pueblo Institute also followed
up on Holden’s work at Alibates 22 and
28 and Saddleback Mesa. Although Sayles
did not conduct extensive ﬁeldwork in
the Panhandle, he had considerable im-
pact on Floyd Studer, who was initially
at Canadian Baptist Academy and later
the Panhandle-Plains Historical Society.
Studer, a protégé of Eyerly’s at Canadian
Baptist Academy, conducted investiga-
tions for almost thirty years at Antelope
Creek phase sites, including major exca-
vations at Saddleback Mesa, Coetas Creek
Ruins, and Alibates 28 (Studer 1931).

The Great Depression, with the fed-
eral Works Progress Administration and
the Federal Emergency Relief Act, ush-
ered in a new era of archeological investi-
gations in the Texas and Oklahoma Pan-
handles. Antelope Creek sites such as
Antelope Creek Ruins 22, 22A, 23, 24;
Alibates 28, 28A, 30; and Chimney Rock
Ruin were the recipient of much of the
federal program’s archeological initiative.
C. Stuart Johnson conducted excavations
at the Stamper site in Texas County, Okla-
homa, although no report was generated
from this work. A short time later, Joseph
Thoburn conducted work at the Roy
Smith site in Texas County, Oklahoma.
However, Thoburn’s investigations fo-
cused on an old stone corral rather than
the more archeologically productive room
block at Roy Smith. In the Texas Pan-

handle, Ele Baker and Jewell Baker (1941)
excavated a number of Antelope Creek vil-
lage ruins, including Antelope Creek 22,
23 and 28A, and Chimney Rock Ruins.

The 1940s and the 1950s were decades
in which relatively little attention was fo-
cused on Plains Village sites in the Pan-
handle region. The decade of the 1960s
marked a return to university-sponsored
research. Archeologists at the University
of Oklahoma conducted further investi-
gations at the Roy Smith site (Schneider
1969). Jack Hughes of West Texas State
University and the Panhandle-Plains Mu-
seum also conducted investigations at a
number of Antelope Creek sites in the re-
gion, among them Roper, Pickett, San-
ford, and Cottonwood Creek Ruins. In
addition, he extended survey efforts into
smaller tributary drainages of the Cana-
dian River. Construction of Sanford
Reservoir in the mid-1960s also resulted
in the study of Antelope Creek villages
that were to be inundated. Most of this
work was undertaken in 1964 by Lathel
Dufﬁeld, who excavated at Spring Can-
yon, Medford Ranch, Conner, 41MO5,
Turkey Creek, Arrowhead Peak, and Foot-
print (Couzzourt and Couzzourt 1996;
Dufﬁeld 1964).

The last three decades of the twentieth
century bear witness to work at a quite a
few Antelope Creek sites. Unfortunately,
only some of these more recent investiga-
tions have resulted in substantial publica-
tions. Chris Lintz, in addition to his syn-
thesis of Antelope Creek, also excavated
at the Two Sisters site, adjacent to the
Stamper site in the Oklahoma Panhandle.
Jack Keller (1975) conducted investiga-
tions at Black Dog Village in connection
with construction done by the Texas De-
partment of Transportation. The Pan-
handle Archeological Society, working
with members of the professional com-
munity, examined the Marsh, Jack Allen,
Zollars, Emery Ruin, and Big Blue Can-
yon sites (Lintz 1986, 18). Work contin-
ued at Lake Meredith (formerly Sanford
Reservoir), as Gerald M. Etchieson inves-
tigated the South Ridge site (Etchieson
1979). Lastly, the Texas Historical Com-
mission and Lintz spent two ﬁeld seasons
at Landergin Mesa (Lintz 1990a).

Over the past century, considerable
work has been undertaken at many Ante-
lope Creek phase sites. However, it must
be recognized that much of the early work

was done without adequate provenience
controls and lacked a grounding in the
complexities of the archeological record.
Even work by professionals beginning in
the 1930s and continuing into the 1960s
suffered from technological limitations.
For example, few excavations utilized
water screening of sediments to extract
a greater yield and variety of material re-
mains. In a similar fashion, ﬂotation as a
data recovery procedure was either not
yet developed enough for ﬁeld use or not
commonly used. Thus, many of the exca-
vated sites suffer in a qualitative and
quantitative sense because of the absence
of statistically representative faunal and
ﬂoral samples. Much could be said for
other objects in an archeological matrix
that could pass through quarter-inch
hardware cloth. Of course, these data re-
covery problems were not unique to the
archeology of the Panhandle region; they
were the methodological paradigm of an
earlier age of archeological ﬁeld tech-
niques. It must be noted, though, that
our understanding of Antelope Creek
phase culture is compromised by such
omissions from the archeological record.

Cultural Taxonomy of Antelope Creek
Rendering order to our universe of
archeological data has been a fundamen-
tal problem in archeology since we began
to make concerted efforts to compare and
contrast site assemblages and to look at
broader regional relationships. In early
twentieth-century archeological studies,
most classiﬁcation efforts were unsystem-
atic and also largely impressionistic. At-
tempts at classifying Antelope Creek were
no exception. To some extent, these ef-
forts in the Panhandle region were exacer-
bated by the complicated nature of the
Antelope Creek culture, which bore re-
semblance to the material culture of the
Plains and to the architecture of the
Southwest. Archeologists attempting to
characterize Antelope Creek were swayed
by these factors as well as the comments
and actions of their peers.

Warren K. Moorehead was the ﬁrst to
name the sites found along the Canadian
River, referring to them as the Canadian
Valley culture, the Texas Panhandle cul-
ture, and the Panhandle culture. With
Moorehead’s classiﬁcation, Antelope
Creek was identiﬁed with a regional land-
scape, the Panhandle, rather than a cul-

ture context. Holden followed this lead,
using terms such as Canadian culture,
Panhandle Canadian culture, and Slab
House culture. As is the case with Moore-
head, Holden’s terminology focused more
on geographical or architectural elements
of the sites than on relationships to other
areas. E. B. Sayles, while using a south-
western classiﬁcation system, simply re-
ferred to Antelope Creek sites as the Pan-
handle phase. However, it was too early
for the temporal-spatial deﬁnition of
phase in a general sense, and the term
was viewed as a southwestern derivation.
Floyd Studer added to what was becom-
ing a culture area classiﬁcation problem
by referring to Antelope Creek sites as
Post-Basketmaker culture, Texas Pan-
handle culture, or Pueblo culture. Two
of his terms are clearly southwestern in
origin and hint of relationships to the
Southwest.

It was not until Alex Krieger’s (1946)

efforts to systematize the cultural-taxo-
nomic nomenclature in the 1940s that
Antelope Creek characterizations were
scrutinized and a more pragmatic set of
terms was utilized to deﬁne this complex
culture. While establishing the “Pan-
handle aspect,” Krieger more succinctly
deﬁned the complicated set of material
traits and architecture as the Antelope
Creek focus, pointing out that temporal
parameters were inadequate for more
reﬁned treatment. The Panhandle aspect
remained a viable concept until the
1960s. The only challenge during this pe-
riod was Virginia Watson’s (1950) effort
to establish the Oklahoma Panhandle An-
telope Creek–like sites as a separate com-
plex, the Optima focus. This concept met
with little acceptance, and the “Antelope
Creek focus” remained as a consensus
term. Somewhat later, Robert G. Camp-
bell amended the term “Panhandle as-
pect” to include the Antelope Creek focus
as well as the Apishapa focus (R. Camp-
bell 1969). Fred Schneider (1969) argued
that it was more acceptable to deﬁne a
Panhandle aspect with no subunits. How-
ever, because of Campbell’s work with
the Apishapa focus, this proposal also was
seen as unduly complicating the taxon-
omy of the region.

In the 1980s, Lintz (1986) revised this

cultural historical framework based on
the variant concept as discussed by Don-
ald J. Lehmer (1954). With Lintz’s re-

classiﬁcation, the Panhandle aspect be-
came the Upper Canark variant. Within
this variant were the Antelope Creek
phase and the Apishapa phase. Somewhat
later, David Hughes and Alicia Hughes-
Jones (1987) identiﬁed the Handley Ru-
ins and Buried City as a separate cultural
entity, the Buried City Complex. Thus,
as it currently stands, the Upper Canark
variant comprises the Antelope Creek
phase, the Apishapa phase, and the Buried
City Complex. The Zimms Complex,
initially viewed as possibly related to the
Upper Canark variant, is probably more
properly associated with the Redbed
Plains variant (Brooks and Drass 1996).
Undoubtedly, with further reﬁnement of
the chronology for this cultural expres-
sion, and increasing understanding of
social and political actions within the re-
gion, the taxonomic structure of the re-
gion will be enhanced.

Adjacent Cultural Complexes

Antelope Creek phase people existed
alongside a number of other Plains socie-
ties as well as groups in the Southwest (see
Fig. 11.1). The Apishapa phase that oc-
curs in southeastern Colorado is similar
to Antelope Creek in the presence of ma-
sonry architecture and some aspects of the
material culture (R. Campbell 1969; Gun-
nerson 1989; Ireland 1968). Also within
the region of the Antelope Creek phase is
the Buried City Complex (D. Hughes
1986). Buried City masonry architecture
is very similar to that at Antelope Creek
sites, but this culture contains a different
material assemblage and the subsistence
regime is one less focused on farming
and bison hunting. To the east is found
the Zimms Complex with its Antelope
Creek–like house ﬂoor plan but without
stone slab walls and with a more tradi-
tional Southern Plains cultural assem-
blage (Brooks 1989).

Origins of Antelope Creek

As is the case for most cultural-histori-
cal reconstruction, the origins of the An-
telope Creek phase have been the subject
of considerable interest. Unfortunately,
data pertaining to these origins have been
elusive. From my perspective, some of
the interpretations have served to further
confound this issue. With the obvious
presence of stone slab architecture remi-

niscent of the Southwestern Pueblo cul-
ture, some earlier researchers maintained
that the actual origins were in the South-
west (see Sayles n.d.; Studer 1931). How-
ever, others, such as Mason (1929), rec-
ognized the obvious Plains origin of the
material assemblage and considered Ante-
lope Creek to be a Plains-adapted society.
In subsequent years, many archeologists
examining these Panhandle cultural com-
plexes adopted the position that the Ante-
lope Creek phase was a Plains phenome-
non (Baerreis and Bryson 1966; J. Hughes
1968; Watson 1950; Wedel 1967). Jack
Hughes (1962) argued that Antelope
Creek was of Caddoan afﬁliation and
probably developed from localized Wood-
land populations. Contrary to this, David
A. Baerreis and Reid A. Bryson (1966)
argued that Antelope Creek populations
migrated south from the Central Plains
because of deteriorating climatic condi-
tions. The relationship to Plains groups
was supported by early physical anthro-
pological studies that demonstrated bio-
logical relationships to Plains physical
populations (McWilliams and Johnson
1979; D. Patterson 1974). Robert Camp-
bell (1969) attributed Antelope Creek
culture to groups moving from the Cha-
quaqua Plateau in southeastern Colorado
into the Panhandle region. Others sought
to explain the complexity in cultural iden-
tity to a multiple origin concept (Bous-
man 1974; Krieger 1946).

Lintz (1986, 218 –35) critically ana-
lyzed these multiple origin hypotheses.
His examination demonstrated that most
of these theories have some ﬂaws in their
arguments as well as in their supporting
evidence. In his conclusion to this reex-
amination, Lintz (1986, 253) suggests
that Antelope Creek represents an indige-
nous group (possibly the Lake Creek
Complex) that borrowed architectural de-
sign concepts from the Southwest, partic-
ularly the Pueblo II period architectural
style.

Since Lintz’s analysis, some additional
work has been done that bears on the is-
sue of origins of Antelope Creek. Begin-
ning with the Southwestern District
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Overview
(Hofman et al. 1989b), Douglas Owsley
of the Smithsonian Institution initiated a
systematic study of the biological charac-
teristics of Southern Plains Village popu-
lations. This project followed on his many

FROM STONE SLAB ARCHITECTURE TO ABANDONMENT / 335

years of studying Central and Northern
Plains Village populations. More recently
(1993 –95), Owsley examined Archaic,
Woodland, and Antelope Creek remains
at the Panhandle-Plains Museum. Al-
though none of his research had been
published as of 2001, some results from
this work merit discussion. First, there
appears to be considerable confusion in
the craniometric analysis conducted by
Patterson (1974) and McWilliams and
Johnson (1979). Owsley’s work found
little to suggest a biological relationship
between Antelope Creek populations and
other Southern Plains Village groups such
as the Washita River phase or groups in
the Central Plains at this time. Further-
more, there seems to be little continuity
with earlier Archaic and Woodland popu-
lations in the region. Thus, Antelope
Creek may represent a distinct population
with little genetic afﬁnity with earlier
groups in the Panhandle or surrounding
Plains or Puebloan societies. While this
brings into question all of the preceding
arguments for the origin of Antelope
Creek, it does little to clarify the prob-
lem. Even the Buried City Complex rep-
resents a cultural complex that can be
more easily explained from a biological
perspective. Individuals in the Buried
City Complex have physical traits much
like those found in resident Woodland
groups for the Panhandle. In this regard,
they are distinct from surrounding Ante-
lope Creek populations (Douglas Owsley
1998, personal communication).

It is also signiﬁcant to consider that

no other new evidence on this origin
dilemma has come forth since the mid-
1980s or so. While Lintz (1986, 253)
suggested Lake Creek as a possible pro-
genitor for Antelope Creek, no additional
data have prompted increased support for
this argument. I would suggest here that
no clear linear argument can be supported
for the origin of the Antelope Creek
phase. Previously, I endorsed Lintz’s argu-
ment of an indigenous local group that
had a pronounced ﬂorescence in the
Late Prehistoric period. However, if local
Woodland populations are of different
biological (genetic) origins than the An-
telope Creek population, this argument
quickly loses credibility. It is clear that we
must await further data analysis and in-
sights to explain the origins of Antelope
Creek populations and how they came by

their unique mix of cultural and architec-
tural heritage.

Biological Characteristics
of the Antelope Creek
Phase People

I have mentioned that earlier bioarche-
ological studies of Antelope Creek popu-
lations have emphasized close relation-
ships to existing populations of Southern
Plains Villagers (McWilliams and John-
son 1979; Patterson 1974). However,
biometric as well as discrete trait analysis
and paleopathological indicators have un-
dergone signiﬁcant reworking in since the
1980s and 1990s (see Buikstra and Ube-
laker 1994). Reanalysis of Antelope Creek
remains beginning in 1988 by Owsley
has resulted in a restructuring of our
perspective on these Panhandle groups.
Craniometric restudy of individuals from
Antelope Creek sites has demonstrated
that these people were roundheaded with
a moderate cranial vault. They were of
moderate height compared to other Vil-
lage Farming populations and had few
other highly distinguishing characteristics.
Washita River phase groups were long-
headed and had rather pronounced cra-
nial vaults. We also know from Owsley’s
work that Antelope Creek men exhibited
arthritic degeneration in the arm joints,
probably from mining of the sizable lime-
stone slabs used in house construction.
They also exhibited little evidence of den-
tal problems. This condition could have
been due to the large quantity of ﬂuorine
in the groundwater that would have been
absorbed and used as ﬂuoride by the
body to limit tooth decay. Overall, Ante-
lope Creek phase groups demonstrated
few characteristics of a group under se-
vere nutritional distress. Judith Habicht-
Mauche et al. (1994) conducted a study
of changes in plant use from C3 to C4
pathways using stable carbon isotope
analysis of skeletal remains. Their work
showed that there appeared to be little
change in the diet of Antelope Creek
phase communities through time. How-
ever, what was intriguing was a difference
between males and females regarding
diet. This apparent difference in nutrition
may be a function of Antelope Creek
men being out on long-distance hunting
forays, thus eating different plant or ani-
mal foods, while women, left at the vil-

Chronometric Assessment of
the Antelope Creek Phase

Slightly more than sixty radiocarbon
dates, roughly ﬁve archeomagnetic assays,
and some additional relative dates based
on southwestern trade wares and associ-
ated dendrochronology dates (Lintz 1986,
1991) have been obtained for this cultural
complex. These assignments place the
Antelope Creek phase in the Texas and
Oklahoma Panhandle region between
a.d. 1200 and 1500. I would question,
however, based on events in other por-
tions of the Southern Plains, whether
many of the accurate calibrated dates for
Antelope Creek would extend beyond
ca. a.d. 1450, which marks a major tem-
poral juncture between Late Prehistoric
Plains Village society and the ensuing
Protohistoric period. This same phenom-
enon is also observed in the Southwest
and Midwest. A number of researchers
have tied this phenomenon to signiﬁcant
climatic change occurring in the Central
and Southern Plains at this time (Artz
and Reid 1984; S. Hall 1983, 1985;
Webb et al. 1993).

Donald Blakeslee (1994) has con-
ducted a major revision in radiocarbon
dates based on a variety of correction fac-
tors. These revisions demonstrate a high
degree of contemporaneity between
Southern Plains and Central Plains vil-
lage traditions. Thus, settlement of the
Southern Plains and Central Plains by
Plains Village societies was a concurrent
process. There also does not appear to be
any longitudinal variation to the radiocar-
bon dates of Antelope Creek phase sites
in the Panhandle region. The conﬁrma-
tion of this conclusion, however, must
await trend surface analysis of radiocar-
bon assays and their occurrence on the
Panhandle landscape. I found it difﬁcult
to establish the temporal limit of Ante-
lope Creek phase settlements. While
many of the multiroom villages were oc-
cupied for considerable periods of time,
the calibration range for an individual
date and the standard deviation of the ra-
diocarbon sample make it difﬁcult to
qualify the duration of a speciﬁc site. A
site may be occupied for a limited num-
ber of years (e.g., twenty to thirty years).

11-A2946  4/13/04  12:22 PM  Page 336

336 / HIGH PLAINS AND CANYONLANDS

Because the standard deviation of the ra-
diocarbon sample exceeds this range (e.g.,
ﬁfty years), it becomes impossible to fur-
ther reﬁne the period of time during
which a particular Antelope Creek settle-
ment was occupied.

Settlement and Architecture

Antelope Creek phase sites in the re-
gion are thought to number in the hun-
dreds. These settlements consist of tem-
porary camps; a hierarchy of habitation
sites including isolated farmsteads/home-
steads, hamlets, and larger villages (Lintz
1986); possibly some small bison-kill pro-
cessing stations (Brooks and Flynn 1988);
and quarry sites. The more permanently
inhabited sites are typically situated on
steep terraces, elevated knolls in the ﬂood-
plain, or occasionally, in more westerly
sites, on remote mesas. Surveys in the
Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles (Bro-
sowske and Bement 1998; Etchieson
1980; Guidry et al. 1979) have demon-
strated that the principal tributary streams
have a higher site density than do the
North Canadian and Canadian Rivers.
I suspect water quality issues may have
brought about this location choice. Cli-
matic change would have led to drier
conditions, the water table would have
dropped, and that change would perhaps
have led to higher mineral content in the
major river valleys. An alternate explana-
tion is that good land was often in de-
mand for both residences and agriculture,
prompting Antelope Creek groups to
place settlements near rivers on land that
was not ideal for farming.

The most distinctive element of Ante-
lope Creek phase settlement is the use of
large stone slabs in wall construction.
These slabs were used in single or double
rows, placed vertically to form the wall
base, and plastered in place with adobe
mortar. In a few isolated cases, the slabs
are horizontally mounted, as was the style
in the Southwest. Details of the masonry
construction vary greatly from site to site
and often from structure to structure
within a village. Lintz (1986) has attrib-
uted this variation to functional differ-
ences, engineering constraints, and design
changes over time. In his overview of
these masonry forms at the many Ante-
lope Creek phase villages, he identiﬁed
eleven unit types (Lintz 1986, 86 –129).

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

Fig. 11.2. Variations in masonry architecture in the Antelope Creek phase (Lintz 1986, 87).

These types ranged from isolated circular
masonry structures with no doorway to
large rectangular multiroom dwellings
(Fig. 11.2). Widely spaced single dwell-
ings along tributary streams may reﬂect a
loosely aggregated community political
organization. At the other end of the spec-
trum were large compound room struc-
tures such as Antelope Creek Ruin 22
(Fig. 11.3), which resembled a single-
story pueblo and contained some thirty

rooms, although the archeological evi-
dence indicated that at least some of the
room blocks were accretional. Individual
room size ranged from less than 5 m2 to
more than 60 m2. There is also evidence
that settlement size as well as organiza-
tional structure underwent signiﬁcant
change midway through the Antelope
Creek phase. During the early portion of
the phase, there were greater numbers of
aggregated room units. Around a.d. 1350,

11-A2946  4/13/04  12:22 PM  Page 337

FROM STONE SLAB ARCHITECTURE TO ABANDONMENT / 337

it appears that residential construction
began to emphasize single room struc-
tures, although they were of greater size
than those present during the earlier por-
tion of the phase (Lintz 1986).

Lintz (1986, 133 – 41) established six
different types of residential aggregation.
Typical Antelope Creek phase dwelling
features included a passageway entrance, a
depressed central ﬂoor channel, and occa-
sionally a raised platform (altar?) found on
the west wall (Fig. 11.4). Roof supports
consisted of four interior posts usually
tethered around a well-prepared central
hearth. Storage pits that were subse-
quently ﬁlled with refuse are often pres-
ent within houses or in the village area.

There exists considerable information
on the nature of stone slab architecture as
well as its integration into the community
patterning of the Antelope Creek phase.
What is less well explored are the explana-
tory mechanisms regarding the function-
ality of such dwellings and the social im-
plications of the sometimes multiroom
residential units. Why construct houses
of stone slab architecture and what are
the behavioral implications of such con-
struction? It has been argued that stone
slabs were used as the preferred building
material because of the absence of a reli-
able source of wood timbers. However,
this argument lacks documentation of a
shortage of wooded zones where timbers
would be accessible. Similarly, if the
shortage of wood for timbers was the crit-
ical issue, should we not also expect other
groups on the western edge of the High
Plains to resort to stone for residential
construction? While Late Prehistoric
Plains Villagers in western Kansas and
western Nebraska constructed slightly
subterranean earth lodges (Wedel 1967),
there are no indications that stone was
used anywhere else in the region except
for the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles.
Patricia A. Gilman (1987) has suggested
that for southwestern pithouses (as well as
above-ground pueblos), climatic factors
may have inﬂuenced architectural choices.
This explanation may also apply to the
stone slab houses of the Antelope Creek
phase. The ﬂoors of the houses can be
considered as shallow subterranean (usu-
ally less than 30 cm) in character. This
below-ground situation, combined with
the stone slab and plastered walls, would
function to ameliorate extreme heat and

cold. This particular architectural design
would also serve as a screen against the
often-brutal winds that push through the
Panhandle region.

The energy expenditure for mining of

the stone slabs and house construction
was considerable. While I can ﬁnd no
published reports on the volume of stone
slabs used in building some of the larger
aggregated room units at sites such as An-
telope Creek 22 and 28, construction
must have involved well over a ton of
stone. There are clear indications that
many Antelope Creek phase people suf-
fered from the physical effects of quarry-
ing this stone and shaping the slabs for
use in building (Douglas Owsley 1998,
personal communication). The level of
effort involved in stone slab architecture
construction implies that this was an es-
sential part of Antelope Creek society.
The use of masonry architecture also
probably requires greater logistical orga-
nization than the use of wood. Sources of
suitable stone would need to be identiﬁed.
Then, work parties would need to be mo-
bilized to mine the necessary quantity of
stone. Stonemasons undoubtedly had to
shape at least some of the slabs and to
oversee placement of the stones during
wall construction. Many Antelope Creek
phase villages display considerable skill in
wall construction and design, although
the work is not as precision-crafted as
that found in some southwestern pueblos.
As I noted earlier, stone slab architec-
ture also has behavioral implications that
pertain to residential permanence. Arche-
ologists working in the Southwest have
increasingly turned their attention to the
issue of housing construction and what
it means with respect to duration of
stay or village permanence (Diehl 1990;
McGuire and Schiffer 1983). Randall H.
McGuire and Michael B. Schiffer (1983)
have identiﬁed two aspects of time and
energy investment in construction: (1) the
minimization of manufacturing cost and
(2) the minimization of maintenance cost.
As they explain (McGuire and Schiffer
1983, 282), these strategies represent in-
verse relationships; greater investment in
production and construction reduces
maintenance cost, while investment in
maintenance promotes a longer use-life,
although with punctuated periods of resi-
dential upkeep. McGuire and Schiffer
(1983) further suggest that the anticipated

duration of stay is the most important
factor inﬂuencing production and main-
tenance energy expenditures. The im-
plications here are that production and
maintenance costs will be high when a
group intends to remain at given location
for a prolonged period. The use of stone
slabs in wall construction obviously meets
the criteria for high construction/produc-
tion cost as well as the designing of
dwellings for maintainability. This raises
some questions pertaining to the readjust-
ment of the settlement pattern that oc-
curred during the late portion of the
phase. If climatic deterioration was driv-
ing a change in settlement structure to-
ward a less aggregated society, why con-
tinue to invest in the high production
cost of stone slab houses? There is not
currently an answer to this question, and
it must await further research on Ante-
lope Creek residential units, especially as-
semblages found within the single-room
dwellings.

The high level of production and
maintenance needed for masonry archi-
tecture also potentially affects subsistence
practices. While Antelope Creek phase
groups may have participated in bison
hunts, it is not yet known whether these
were of the duration and distance from
the village that are documented for his-
toric Plains societies (see Weltﬁsh 1977).
The high production cost for stone slab
residences makes it unlikely that hunters
would be away from the village for up to
three months of the year. Similar argu-
ments have been made regarding more
eastern Plains Village societies such as the
Washita River phase (Brooks 1993a).

I am also intrigued by the nature of
the aggregated room blocks found in the
Antelope Creek phase and what they im-
ply about social organization. Lintz
(1986) has argued that Antelope Creek
has its roots in the Woodland cultures of
the Texas Panhandle, while others attrib-
ute this cultural complex to prehistoric
Plains societies from areas to the north-
east or the east (Bryson and Baerreis 1966;
J. Hughes 1968). It must be recognized,
however, that none of the Plains Village
societies contemporaneous with Antelope
Creek displays a residential architecture
pattern that features a communal, multi-
room structure. Many Antelope Creek
settlements have aggregate room blocks
that were accretional (rooms were added

to the original units over time); however,
this situation does not apply to all Ante-
lope Creek phase ruins. At some sites,
such as Antelope Creek 28, multiroom
units were added during the same con-
struction phase. It has been well demon-
strated in the archeological record that
kinship and social organization are re-
ﬂected in the spatial conﬁguration of resi-
dence (Rapaport 1969). From my per-
spective, the kinship/social organization
necessary for this type of aggregated, mul-
tiroom residential pattern is inconsistent
with what we ﬁnd for Plains societies. In-
stead, it bears a much greater resemblance
to the type of kinship structure expressed
at southwestern pueblos (Hill 1970). It
may not be a true southwestern puebloan
social organization, but there are more
afﬁnities to the Southwest than to the
Plains. More than anything else, this dis-
cussion demonstrates that much remains
to be learned about the nature of Ante-
lope Creek phase architectural practices;
current and future research efforts should
have greater focus on examining the
underlying structure of architectural
expression.

Subsistence

The subsistence economy of Antelope

Creek phase society was based on the
growing of cultigens, hunting, and the
collecting of edible wild plants, although
the particular mix of the economy proba-
bly varied seasonally as well as annually
based on climatic conditions and others
factors. In general, I doubt that dietary
practices varied much from those found
among other Southern Plains Village
complexes where hunting, especially of
bison, played an equal or greater role
than horticultural pursuits. However, as
noted earlier, much of the archeological
investigation of Antelope Creek sites oc-
curred in the early phases of methodolog-
ical reﬁnements in data recovery. Thus,
charred plant remains and small faunal
elements were highly underrepresented
in the available collections. Corncobs and
cupules, squash, and beans have been re-
covered from the excavations of Antelope
Creek phase sites. What is less clear, how-
ever, is the supporting cast of domesti-
cated native plants and wild species that
were undoubtedly harvested. Limited
studies have identiﬁed acorns, hackberry,

mesquite, wild buckwheat, plums, per-
simmons, prickly pear, mallow, and cat-
tail (Dean 1986; F. Green 1967; Keller
1975). To demonstrate the disparity that
exists due to the lack of procedures such
as ﬂotation recovery, we need only look at
botanical recovery from the Lonker site
(34BV4). The Lonker site is a Plains Vil-
lage settlement located in the Oklahoma
Panhandle in northern Beaver County,
Oklahoma. Excavated in the winter of
1982, ﬁll from ﬁve refuse pits was pro-
cessed through a ﬂotation device to re-
cover macro- and microbotanical remains.
This procedure resulted in the recovery of
corn, bean, tropical squash, sunﬂower,
purslane, goosefoot, knotweed, domesti-
cated marsh elder, bulrush, and other un-
identiﬁed seeds (Brooks 1994a, 22 –23).
These problems in data collection
methodologies also exist for the study of
hunting practices. Larger species such as
bison, mule deer, antelope, and some
smaller species are present in the collec-
tions from the early excavations. Addi-
tionally, research by Dufﬁeld (1970b)
and Keller (1975) identiﬁed nineteen spe-
cies of mammals, thirteen species of bird,
six species of amphibians, and reptiles,
mollusks, and rarely ﬁsh (see Lintz 1986,
241– 45, for a more detailed account of
faunal exploitation). However, whether
the counts for minimum number of spec-
imens are a reliable witness to their place
in a procurement regime during the An-
telope Creek phase is questionable.

It does appear that substantial change
in subsistence practices took place around
a.d. 1350, at the same time that the settle-
ment system was being restructured.
While Dufﬁeld (1970b) argues that de-
pendence on bison declines after a.d.
1300, Lintz (1986, 243), to the contrary,
argues that bison procurement was in-
creasing at the expense of an agricultural
system suffering from climatic degrada-
tion. More recent analyses of this phe-
nomenon by Habicht-Mauche et al.
(1994), using stable isotope ratios to ex-
amine changes in the percentage of bison
in the diet over time, were inconclusive.
Interestingly, their study revealed that fe-
male diets were more varied, with greater
quantities of C3 and CAM plants com-
pared to what was found in the male diet.
There is also some difference of opinion
pertaining to the processing of bison.
One characteristic of bison processing in

the Antelope Creek phase is the shatter-
ing of the bison bone, presumably to ex-
tract bone marrow for grease production.
Lintz (1998, personal communication)
views this as remaining fairly constant
throughout the Antelope Creek phase,
even with the possible increase in bison
procurement. Jack Hughes (1997, per-
sonal communication), on the other hand,
perceives an increase in bone rendering
with the transition from early to late An-
telope Creek phase bison procurement.

There are also behavioral implications
pertaining to Antelope Creek subsistence
practices that have not been explored.
The ﬁrst of these implications involves
the agricultural system. We casually speak
of Antelope Creek people as agricultural-
ists. But what does this mean? What is
their commitment to agricultural produc-
tion? Ester Boserup (1965), in a seminal
study that addressed the conditions and
pre-conditions of agricultural growth,
noted considerable differences in the
complexity of an agricultural system and
how it evolves. Based on a study of Meso-
american agricultural societies, she identi-
ﬁed ﬁve incremental levels of agricultural
production: (1) forest-fallow, (2) bush-
fallow, (3) short-fallow, (4) annual crop-
ping, and (5) multicropping. Prehistoric
Plains societies have been traditionally as-
sociated with Boserup’s lowest level of
agricultural intensity, that of the forest-
fallow system or what has been more
commonly known as slash and burn agri-
culture. In a slash and burn system, po-
tential garden plots are burned off, with
large trees girdled for clearing. There is
only limited consideration of ﬁeld main-
tenance because the ﬁeld burning im-
pedes weedy plant growth and invasion
until the garden crops are well started.
Thus, the principal tool of the slash and
burn system is the digging stick, with
minimal use of the hoe.

Plains Village agricultural systems in

the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles
provide interesting insights into this tech-
nological adaptation. Returning to the
Lonker site, a Plains Village settlement in
the Oklahoma Panhandle, we ﬁnd only
digging sticks used as potential agricul-
tural tools; there were no scapula hoes
or other hoe-like implements (Brooks
1994a). Antelope Creek phase sites in the
Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles have
limited numbers of bison scapula hoes,

considerably less than the quantity of bi-
son scapula, horn core, and innominate
hoes found at Turkey Creek phase and
Washita River phase sites to the east
(Brooks 1987; Drass 1997). However,
the presence of the scapula hoe in Ante-
lope Creek phase sites creates a series of
questions about agricultural intensity.
Does the occurrence of these items in An-
telope Creek villages indicate that agricul-
tural intensity was perhaps greater than
previously identiﬁed for Plains Village
cultures in the Oklahoma and Texas Pan-
handles? Another possibility is that hoes
have a somewhat different function in
Antelope Creek sites compared to Bose-
rup’s observations. Striations (wear pat-
terns) on scapula hoes run perpendicular
to the blade and demonstrate consider-
able evidence of polish and/or sheen.
Thus, it would appear that the scapula is
being thrust into the soil either in a hoe-
or shovel-like function. This function is,
most likely, an agricultural practice such
as weeding ﬁelds—an activity that would
typically be conducted in bush-fallow or
short-fallow cropping. At this point, there
is no conclusive evidence to support alter-
native models of agricultural production.
Further examination of agricultural tools
from Antelope Creek phase settlements is
needed because these artifacts hold the
power to explain much about the agricul-
tural system in which they were used.
Animal exploitation by Antelope
Creek populations is somewhat more
difﬁcult to address. I have already intro-
duced the concept that bison hunting
may not have involved a lengthy period
away from the village. However, other
factors related to the Habicht-Mauche
et al. (1994) study of stable isotopes may
shed some light on this issue. Males ap-
pear to have a more dominant C4 path-
way signature. This situation possibly
suggests that the men were away from the
village for greater periods and were more
likely to consume bison than the women.

Technology

Artifacts recovered from Antelope
Creek phase sites reﬂect assemblages that
have adapted to local conditions over a
number of centuries. Thus, artifacts re-
ﬂect technological responses to the imme-
diate environment and also larger regional
contexts. Artifact assemblages present at

340 / HIGH PLAINS AND CANYONLANDS

Antelope Creek sites are typically repre-
sentative of prehistoric Plains Village so-
cieties. Artifacts manufactured of chipped
stone are most commonly manufactured
from Alibates agatized dolomite found at
quarries north of Amarillo, Texas. There
appears to be little use of materials ac-
quired from distant sources, with the pos-
sible exception of obsidian. Materials de-
scribed include arrow points, scrapers,
knives, drills or perforators, and crude
hoes. Typical arrow points include trian-
gular forms such as Fresno, Washita, and
Harrell; corner-notched varieties are
found less frequently. Bifacial knives are
often present in the assemblage and in-
clude the characteristic alternately beveled
(diamond) variety. Other bifacial forms
include the guitar pick scraper/preform
(Lintz 1986, 35). Unifacial end and side
scrapers are generally made from large
ﬂakes and reﬂect the Antelope Creek
population’s extensive hide treatment
and working industry. Numerous tools
are also derived from pieces of ﬂaking de-
bris that exhibit little or no intentional
modiﬁcation.

The chipped stone tool industry is an
interesting mix of expedient and curated
tool behavior (e.g., Binford 1979). Hunt-
ing weapons (the arrow points) appear to
be the more expedient tool, whereas the
butchering and hide working tools are
more intensively curated. This distinction
is evident in the manufacture of these
items. The triangular arrow points are
typically made from secondary or interior
ﬂakes derived from a ﬂake-tool reduction
sequence. The arrow points, while well
made, are not elaborately worked and
would probably not be viewed as a high-
cost item. This situation is further sub-
stantiated by the limited instances where
arrow points are recycled or retooled after
breakage. A much different situation is
present with bifacial knives and unifacial
scrapers. Bifacial knives, especially the
alternately beveled knife, are what Peter
Bleed (1986) has termed “overdesigned.”
The thick midsection accomplished
through alternately resharpening the
blade results in a tool that is both highly
reliable and also maintainable. It is likely
that these tools were perceived as high-
cost items; diamond-beveled knives are
one of the more extensively curated or re-
cycled tools in the chipped stone inven-
tory. I would argue that unifacial scrapers

are also manufactured for reliability. The
design of these tools emphasizes a thick
midsection that stands up well to the
high levels of stress resulting from hide
processing. These tools also involve con-
siderable manufacturing cost; the unifa-
cial design is only slightly less costly to
manufacture than a bifacial implement.
Unifacial scrapers were also being re-
sharpened and/or recycled upon break-
age, reinforcing their place in the tool in-
ventory as a curated item.

Implements of ground stone include
grinding basins, manos, abraders, ham-
merstones, ornaments, pipes, and celts.
Manos and metates are frequently of
southwestern style, and in some instances,
manos are of the two-handed variety.
Robert J. Hard (1990) has examined
mano length in the Southwest and found
a general increase in their length with
the transition from pithouse to pueblos.
A similar study of mano length during
the Antelope Creek phase might prove
informative in examining the issue of
changes in agricultural productivity from
the early to late periods. Sandstone abrad-
ers are virtually identical to those found
in the Turkey Creek and Washita River
phases farther to the east on the Southern
Plains. I suspect these abraders are repre-
sentative of considerable bone tool manu-
facture. Celts, typically made from ig-
neous materials, also occur at many
Antelope Creek phase settlements. To
me, it is somewhat paradoxical that the
occurrence of celts roughly parallels that
in more eastern Southern Plains Village
cultures, even though there should be
much less wood processing in the Ante-
lope Creek phase because of the dimin-
ished emphasis on wood in architectural
design. The presence of tubular elbow
pipes, although limited in number, attests
to some smoking activities. From recent
paleoethnobotanical studies on the South-
ern Plains, it is reasonable to assume that
tobacco was being grown and/or possibly
received in trade (Adair 1988). It is less
clear, though, whether the smoking of to-
bacco was strictly a religious practice or
whether it had become more of a social
function by Late Prehistoric times on the
Plains. Many of the pipes are of a distinc-
tive red stone originally thought to be
catlinite from the quarries in Minnesota.
Recent sourcing studies on similar pipes
from other Plains village sites in the

Oklahoma Panhandle have shown that
much of this material is from a separate
source in Kansas (Brosowske and Bement
1998). Lintz (1990b) has also identiﬁed
a source of red stone in eastern New
Mexico. Groundstone ornaments are
infrequently found and are usually in
association with burials. In a few in-
stances, textile samples were recovered.
Plaiting, twining, and coiling were the
manufacturing techniques utilized in this
basketry.

The ceramic assemblage is character-

ized by the predominance of Borger
Cordmarked, typically a globular vessel
with a rounded base and straight rims
that are either vertical or slightly ﬂared
(Fig. 11.5). Vessel walls are of moderate
thickness (ca. 5 to 6 mm) and are slightly
thinner near the rim. Surface treatment
consists of vertically aligned cord impres-
sions or smoothed-over cord impressions.
Because of the lack of distinctiveness
(clarity) in the cordmarking for some of
the Borger/Stamper Cordmarked vessels
noted at the Roy Smith site in the Okla-
homa Panhandle, Schneider (1969) has
commented that it appears the cord im-
pressions were applied when the clay was
nearly dry. There is also occasional treat-
ment of the rim in the form of castella-
tions or rim tabs.

A few collared vessels reminiscent of
the Central Plains tradition ceramic wares
occur at Antelope Creek site. Their oc-
currence has been used to support the hy-
pothesis of Central Plains people migrat-
ing to the Texas Panhandle. Chris Lintz
and Kathryn Reese-Taylor (1997) have
examined collared and noncollared rim-
sherds from the Antelope Creek 22 and
28 sites, as well as from the Roper and
Cottonwood Creek sites in the Canadian
River valley, and, using petrographic
analysis, subsequently compared them to
similar sherds from an Iktari phase site
(25NC29) in central Nebraska. They
found that there was no similarity in the
clay or paste of the Nebraska and Texas
Panhandle sherds, further dispelling the
idea of a migration of people out of the
Central Plains.

Southwestern ceramics occur at many
Antelope Creek phase sites. These are un-
doubtedly trade wares as their paste and
composition bear characteristic signatures
of Puebloan manufacture. Included are a
variety of Black on White types, Jeddito

are erroneously called rasps. Freshwater
mollusks were used for spoons and scrap-
ers and were also shaped into pendants.

The bone tool assemblage is obviously
diverse. What is even more impressive is
the extensive labor investment in the man-
ufacture of agricultural tools. It is not
uncommon for broken scapula hoes to
display evidence of mends. This energy
investment is also interesting in that the
agricultural system is a marginal one
that came under increasing stress around
a.d. 1350. If agricultural productivity is
becoming less efﬁcient, why not revert to
a system that uses simple digging sticks
rather than hoes that require considerable
time and effort to manufacture? There
also appears to be a potential conﬂict be-
tween the use of bison bone for tool man-
ufacture and the use of bison bones in the
production of bone grease. Studies of ele-
ments being shattered for marrow extrac-
tion and grease production may provide
some clues as to whether there is compe-
tition among these two activities for bi-
son elements.

Trade and Warfare

Trade and warfare can be viewed as
alternative responses to the same issue
within prehistoric cultures, that of negoti-
ating social conﬂict (R. Hall 1977, 503 –
505; Pauketat 1994, 20). While most dis-
cussions of the negotiation of social con-
ﬂict have dealt with chiefdoms, there is
little reason to suspect that similar pro-
cesses were not operating at lower levels
of sociocultural complexity, such as that
of tribes. The formation of alliances be-
tween groups can be used as a means of
defusing intersocietal competition and
conﬂict. Alliances can be established
through a variety of social and economic
mechanisms ranging from marriage to ex-
change. Here, material and nonmaterial
“goods” represent trade and/or exchange
(Spielmann 1991b). In the well-studied
example of trade between southwestern
Pueblos and bison-hunting Plains socie-
ties, one of the more critical items of ex-
change is food (Spielmann 1983). This
trade can be viewed as a means of negoti-
ating conﬂict over desired foodstuffs:
corn by the Plains groups and bison
meat, hides, and possibly bone grease
on the part of the Pueblos.

The alternative to trade is organized

yellow ware, Lincoln Black on Red,
St. John’s polychrome, Agua Fria Glaze
on Red, as well as other glaze wares (Lintz
1986, 34). Most of these fall within the
established temporal range of the Ante-
lope Creek phase. Lintz (1991) has sug-
gested that these may originate from a
limited number of eastern “gateway”
pueblos.

As is the case with other Southern
Plains Village cultural complexes (e.g.,
Washita River and Turkey Creek phases),
the most distinctive technological assem-
blage in the Antelope Creek phase is that

of bone tools. Bone tools are abundant at
most village sites, with the most common
forms being bison scapula hoes and
squash knives, bison tibia digging sticks,
bison femur hide grainers, awls made
from rib edges, split ribs and splinters,
and split deer metatarsals. There are also
pins, pegs, and shaft straighteners made
from bison metatarsals, as well as wedges.
Smaller bones or splinters were used in
the manufacture of eyed needles. Antler
billets and tines were used to make
chipped stone tools. There are also forms
such as a modiﬁed bison rib that I suspect

warfare. In warfare between societies, the
goal is to force competing groups to aban-
don land or resource areas that are con-
tested. This goal is accomplished through
major attacks on the principal settlements
with the expectation of forcing them to
abandon the whole region or to reduce
their numbers to the point that they are
no longer a threat. Another strategy is
using repeated raids to force groups to
abandon areas of preferred resources.

Trade can also be viewed as one among
a variety of strategies in risk management,
especially in regard to agricultural pro-
duction (Halstead and O’Shea 1989).
Under circumstances of scarce resources,
situational trade relationships would be
arranged with nearby groups. Trade
would be for foodstuffs, with the ex-
change item either being nonfood mate-
rial or an agreement to defer trade until a
later date (deferred reciprocity).

Trade Items

As discussed in the section on technol-
ogy, one of the most frequent trade items
encountered in Antelope Creek phase sites
is southwestern ceramic wares. These in-
clude a variety of styles: Black on White
wares, polychromes, yellow wares, and
glazes (Lintz 1986, 1991). It has been
suggested that most of these sherd types
originate with the more eastern Pueblos
in New Mexico (Lintz 1991, 91). Lintz
also notes that the trade in southwestern
wares appears to intensify through time.
In addition to ceramics from the South-
west, there are also olivella and columella
shell beads, conch shell gorgets and pen-
dants, and tinklers, as well as obsidian,
turquoise, and mica. Obsidian appears
to be a highly valued trade items, per-
haps equal to that of the southwestern
ceramics.

Obsidian as an item of trade has some

interesting characteristics. It is highly
portable and also an item of value because
of its quality and widespread use. The
Odessa Yates site in the Oklahoma Pan-
handle, another Plains village expression,
contains large quantities of obsidian; in
fact, there is more obsidian at Odessa
Yates than at all Antelope Creek sites
combined (Brosowske and Bement
1998). The large quantities of this mate-
rial at Odessa Yates suggest that there may
either be a centralized redistribution point
for obsidian or that a down-the-line redis-

tribution system was operating. Source
analysis of obsidian from Odessa Yates in-
dicates that most of the obsidian was ob-
tained from the Jemez Mountains region
of New Mexico (Brosowske and Bement
1998).

Trade items from the Southeast and
the Plains are extremely limited in the as-
semblages of Antelope Creek phase settle-
ments. There are virtually no Caddoan
wares from the Red River region nor are
there any Spiroan materials from the Ar-
kansas River valley. This may be a signiﬁ-
cant statement on Caddoan social rela-
tionships, as Caddoan sherds are found
on Turkey Creek and Zimms phase sites
in western Oklahoma (Drass 1997). They
do not, however, appear to extend be-
yond this region of western Oklahoma
into the Antelope Creek cultural area.
Few items from the Central Plains region
occur at Antelope Creek sites. These in-
clude principally Niobara jasper materials
in small numbers. As noted earlier, the
collared rim wares that are found at An-
telope Creek phase sites bear no relation-
ship to pottery vessels from Central
Plains settlements.

Warfare

In this chapter, I am suggesting that
the warfare seen in the Antelope Creek
phase archeological record is more a con-
sequence of the defense of territory and
competition for critical resources—such
as bison herds (protein), fertile soils, and
possibly lithic resources (e.g., the Alibates
quarries)—as suggested by Thomas Biolsi
(1984, 144 – 62) than the ethnocentrism
and revenge suggested by John C. Ewers
(1994, 397–98). Evidence for warfare is
present in the destruction of dwellings
and villages, the presence of fortiﬁcations
and/or other defensive structures, and
traumatic injuries resulting from combat
(e.g., fractures, puncture wounds, embed-
ded projectile points, and cut marks re-
ﬂecting scalping, mutilation, or dismem-
berment; see Brooks 1994b, 320). We
must also critically evaluate the spatial
distribution of the archeological and bio-
archeological data.

Burned structures are present at some,
but not all, Antelope Creek sites, includ-
ing a number surrounding the Alibates
chert quarries. While burned dwellings
are often attributed to raids, there are
many other possible reasons for burned

structures, including natural grass ﬁres,
accidents within houses, and the inten-
tional burning of the residence as part of
a mortuary ritual associated with the
death of a household member. Thus,
burned structures are a questionable
source of evidence on conﬂict. The only
burned residence clearly associated with
conﬂict is that found at the Footprint site
(F. Green 1967). Better archeological
support for evidence of warfare includes
the presence of defensive features. Along
the western perimeter of the Antelope
Creek region, four sites occur on high
mesas: Saddleback Mesa, Landergin Mesa,
Mesa Alamosa, and Congdon Butte. To-
ward the east, one occurs, namely Arrow-
head Peak. Considering the difﬁculty in
reaching these high places and their dis-
tance from water, I would suggest these
are either lookouts serving as defensive
outposts or sanctuaries where groups
retreated when invading parties were
sighted.

The bioarcheological data most clearly

reﬂect the conﬂict that Antelope Creek
phase people were experiencing with
other societies. Two individuals from the
Antelope Creek 22 site have physical in-
juries suggestive of conﬂict (Patterson
1974). An adult male has a perforation
of the right scapula, while an adult female
has a perforation of the third segment of
the sternum. More conclusive evidence
is present at the Footprint site (F. Green
1967). Here, the remains of eleven adults,
six subadults, and four infants were found
in three bell-shaped pits within a burned
subterranean structure. These individuals
were disarticulated and intermixed among
the three pits, and some of the remains
were charred from intense heat. Other
disarticulated remains were found in a
layer of clean sand and gravel overlying
the house ﬂoor but underneath charred
timbers from the burned house. In an-
other pit within the same structure, ten
adult skulls were found in a cluster, one
with an attached cervical vertebra and a
ﬂint knife of Alibates chert lying under the
skull (see F. Green 1967 for a sequencing
of these events). A similar cluster of adult
skulls was also reportedly found at a site
in the Oklahoma Panhandle near Guy-
mon (Texas County).

The evidence for warfare points to a
greater intensity of conﬂict in the western
portion of the Antelope Creek phase re-

gion. If exchange and warfare were reﬂex-
ive expressions of the negotiation of con-
ﬂict, then the presence of greater trade
interaction with Puebloan groups to the
west would also explain the greater preva-
lence of warfare to the west (for a differ-
ent perspective, see Spielmann 1991a).
Lintz (1986, 251–52) has suggested that
a Puebloan group from the Chaco Can-
yon area moved into the middle Rio
Grande Valley, thereby disrupting well-
established relationships between the An-
telope Creek phase and Puebloan socie-
ties. One possible group involved in this
disorder was an eastern Mogollon group
living in the Sierra Blanca region of south-
eastern New Mexico and the Texas Pan-
handle. Here, trade in items such as bison
hides and meat may have represented the
motivation for violence. Another possibil-
ity was competition over Alibates chert,
the highly prized stone used in much of
the stone tool manufacture. For Puebloan
societies that were lacking in high-quality
lithic resources, Alibates chert may have
been a reason (although rather unlikely)
to forcibly expel the Antelope Creek
phase people from the region.

Mortality in Antelope Creek
Phase Society

Sample size and biased data collection
strategies signiﬁcantly impede our under-
standing of mortality in Antelope Creek
populations. Particularly during the early
years of archeological work, there was
little systematic investigation of graves
that were encountered at archeological
sites. There are forty-seven burials repre-
senting slightly fewer than seventy indi-
viduals from nine sites. Based on the size
of many Antelope Creek hamlets/villages,
this ﬁgure is a marked underrepresenta-
tion of the number of people likely to
have died during the occupation span of
most communities. Although earlier re-
searchers suggested that cemeteries may
have been present near villages, none of
these reports has been substantiated. Cur-
rently, the only documented cemetery is
Big Blue Creek (Couzzourt and Couz-
zourt 1996; Lintz 1986, 164). It is un-
clear whether village inhabitants did not
utilize cemeteries, instead burying indi-
viduals in separate locations, or whether
cemeteries were perhaps established on a
community-wide scale with one cemetery

serving a number of villages. The absence
of data limits our ability to establish mor-
tality proﬁles for communities, to exam-
ine the wellness of the population, to
identify the causes of death, and to un-
derstand the overall respect for the de-
ceased as reﬂected in mortuary practices.
Deceased members of Antelope Creek
society were typically placed as individual
interments in shallow graves. In most in-
stances, the individuals were buried in a
ﬂexed or semiﬂexed position. The ab-
sence of cremations would suggest that
treatment of remains did not follow the
mortuary pattern of burning observed for
the nearby Zimms phase (Brooks et al.
1992). Rocks were frequently piled over
the burials (87 percent), possibly in an ef-
fort to discourage scavengers (e.g., dogs
and coyotes). Roughly half of the recorded
burials (n!24) have been found within
houses, with the remainder occurring
within 50 to 100 m of architectural fea-
tures (Lintz 1986, 164).

Of particular note is the placement of
burials within structures. More than 80
percent of the twenty-four burials are ei-
ther at ﬂoor level or above the ﬂoor. Based
on additional information on this phe-
nomenon compiled by Lintz (1986, 165),
it appears that the deceased were interred
in the rooms at the time of, or shortly af-
ter, abandonment. He further suggests
that the use of the architectural features
may serve as markers for the society. I
suspect that detailed study of the nature
of the abandonment process and the mor-
tuary behavior associated with burial may
lead to better understanding of this prac-
tice. However, as few burials are currently
being excavated due to ethical consider-
ation of Native American beliefs about
the disturbance of human remains, de-
tailed research of this nature is not likely.
Attempts to discern status differentia-
tion through the examination of associ-
ated funerary objects has also proven elu-
sive. Lintz’s (1986, table 33) tabulation of
funerary inclusions with Antelope Creek
phase burials indicated that slightly more
than half of the studied burials contained
grave offerings. There does not appear to
be any marked discrimination based on
age or sex; children and adults, males and
females exhibit approximately the same
proportions of funerary objects. The only
revealing status information comes from
examination of funerary object distribu-

tion by category when compared to age
and sex criteria (Lintz 1986, table 34). If
we discount the burials from the Foot-
print site, which may represent special-
ized mortuary practices related to a con-
ﬂict event, there are some interesting
patterns in grave associations. First, non-
indigenous grave goods are almost exclu-
sively objects of southwestern derivation.
They are also found only with women
and children (Lintz 1986, table 34).
Grave goods found with males, on the
other hand, appear to be of indigenous
origin. With the above-noted exclusion
of the Footprint site remains, there is a
clear correspondence in the association
of items with gender-related work activi-
ties. For example, there are no projectile
points found in funerary association with
women. It is my impression that the so-
cial dimension of mortuary behavior por-
trays two signiﬁcant patterns. First, there
is little differential treatment of deceased
members of Antelope Creek phase soci-
ety, and second, most of the status varia-
tion noted in burials can be attributed to
the presence of objects derived from the
Southwest.

Abandonment

The Antelope Creek phase represents
one of the more striking cultural manifes-
tations to appear on the Southern Plains.
This distinction is especially signiﬁcant
when we consider that this phase rapidly
disappeared from the Texas and Okla-
homa Panhandles sometime after a.d.
1450/1500. Two important questions
bear on the disappearance of the Ante-
lope Creek phase: (1) What are the fac-
tors that brought about the decline of this
culture and eventual abandonment of
their settlements, and (2) what happened
to the Antelope Creek people?

Lintz (1984, 1986) has stressed the de-

terioration of climatic conditions favor-
able to agriculture as a principal reason
for the decline in Antelope Creek socie-
ties. Around a.d. 1350, there are three
signiﬁcant changes in the settlement/sub-
sistence regime that he argues are indica-
tive of these stressful times. First, there is
a restructuring in architectural /residence
design. Greater numbers of single-room
structures replace the multiroom settle-
ments of the early subphase. This restruc-
turing, Lintz (1986) argues, is a means of

G&S Typesetters PDF proof

11-A2946  4/13/04  12:22 PM  Page 344

344 / HIGH PLAINS AND CANYONLANDS

dispersing the population to meet declin-
ing agricultural production. Second, the
settlement pattern changes from an em-
phasis on the main valley of the Canadian
River to drainages where spring-fed tribu-
taries are present. Such a locational shift
likely reﬂects a search for better sources of
water. Considering the labor investment
in residence construction, this shift repre-
sented a major commitment on the part
of the Antelope Creek people. They were
shifting their settlement location and con-
structing new stone slab houses, albeit
now as single-room dwellings. The third
consideration is what appears to be a sig-
niﬁcant increase in the procurement of bi-
son. However, John D. Speth and Susan L.
Scott (1988) have suggested this change
was a function of increased trade rather
than diminished agricultural productivity.
Lintz’s argument is well reasoned, es-

pecially in light of the climatic change
documented for the region (Baerreis and
Bryson 1966) and the abandonment of
settlements and regions taking place at
this time in the Southwest and the South-
ern Plains (Cameron and Tomka 1993).
What I ﬁnd especially compelling, how-
ever, is the commitment of Antelope
Creek people to retain a labor-intensive
architectural way of life. Why attempt
to retain this stone architecture pattern
rather than abandon it in favor of more
portable dwellings?

The other issue involved with aban-
donment of the Antelope Creek phase is
the question of where the people went.
Arguments in the past have suggested that
they moved onto the Central Plains to es-
cape drought conditions and evolved into
the Pawnee ( J. Hughes 1968). This argu-
ment is based on the remarkable similar-
ity in the internal house design of the
Pawnee and the Antelope Creek phase
(Weltﬁsh 1977). However, this hypothe-
sis leaves the Antelope Creek phase people
with approximately ﬁfty years to evolve
from the use of stone slab architecture to
earth lodges. Lintz (1986) and John Lud-
wikson (1978) have discounted this argu-
ment based on chronological consider-
ations and ethnohistoric accounts. It is

more difﬁcult to assess the argument that
Antelope Creek people evolved into one
or more of the nomadic bison-hunting
groups encountered by Coronado in
1541. If so, then the ethnohistories and
tribal oral histories are lacking informa-
tion on this episode in the past. A signiﬁ-
cant factor here is the absence of continu-
ity between the material assemblages from
the Antelope Creek phase and that from
the Jumanos, Querechos, Teyas, and pos-
sibly other groups found in the region
some ﬁve hundred years ago.

Information about the demise of the
Antelope Creek phase remains just as elu-
sive as that of its origins. However, we can
examine the nature of the abandonment
process and hope to gain some insight into
how settlements were abandoned and/or
rebuilt at new locations. By examining the
processes taking place when settlements
are permanently abandoned, I think we
can also gain some insight into the nature
of this people’s ultimate destination.

Conclusion

With this chapter I have reintroduced
some of the questions and paradoxes that
have plagued our understanding of the
Antelope Creek phase over three-quarters
of a century. While my summary of Ante-
lope Creek obviously leaves substantial
ground uncovered, it does discuss many
of the critical areas one must study in or-
der to understand this cultural complex.
It should be clear from this overview that
vast areas of the Antelope Creek phase are
poorly understood or not understood at
all. However, this situation is as it should
be, as it reveals our lack of understanding
and our need to better comprehend the
past. I have a few suggestions and com-
ments pertaining to the future study of
the Antelope Creek phase:

1. Most of the work conducted on the
Antelope Creek phase took place in the era
prior to reﬁnement of our data recovery
techniques. Some of the previously studied
sites may yield signiﬁcant new information
if further investigations are initiated. This is

especially true in the areas of subsistence
practices, artifact discard, and the examina-
tion of site abandonment processes.

2. Much of the Antelope Creek mys-
tique is linked to the biological characteris-
tics of the population. While study of this
area is clouded by the propriety of examin-
ing human remains, for tribes as well as
archeologists, systematic evaluation of the
biological nature of these groups is critical
to our understanding of the origin and
ultimate destination of the group and its
culture.

3. The Antelope Creek phase has been
bereft of much interest in archeological in-
vestigation for the last quarter of the twen-
tieth century. However, this scenario is
rapidly changing. In Oklahoma, one disser-
tation was recently completed on Antelope
Creek (Duncan 2002), and a second disser-
tation is well underway on another Plains
village cultural complex in the Panhandle.
There possibly may be an equal number in
Texas. This renewed study, I think, reﬂects
the lack of knowledge about this culture,
which is an obvious challenge in the arche-
ological community. It is to be hoped that
these studies will bring with them a clearer
understanding of this dynamic culture.

While responsibility for the content of
this chapter rests solely with the author, a
number of individuals have contributed
to its development. First of all, I am in-
debted to Chris Lintz for graciously al-
lowing me to explore the mystique of An-
telope Creek culture. He is the foremost
expert on this paradoxical and enigmatic
cultural expression and would have been
the most logical choice to write this chap-
ter if not for other commitments. I have
beneﬁted from discussing many of the
concepts introduced in this chapter with
various members of the Oklahoma
Archeological Survey. They include Lee
Bement, Scott Brosowske, Richard Drass,
and Marjy Duncan. Finally, I want to
thank my wife Pam for critically reading
this manuscript and improving the clarity
of some of my arguments.

The Archeology of the Post Oak Savanna of East-Central Texas

Ross C. Fields

The primary goal of this chapter is to
present an overview of the culture history
of the Post Oak Savanna of east-central
Texas. This aim is accomplished by sum-
marizing the wealth of data recovered
during the last two decades of the twenti-
eth century in and near ﬁve project ar-
eas— Cooper Lake, Lake Fork Reservoir,
Richland/Chambers Reservoir, Jewett
Mine, and Gibbons Creek Mine—that
provide a north-south transect along the
western edge of east Texas. This chapter
focuses on data from the two areas with
which I am most familiar (Cooper Lake
and Jewett Mine); I use them as a spring-
board to point out overall trends in the
prehistory of the region. Even within
these two areas, I chieﬂy discuss the
archeological data from the sites where
the most work has been done and where
components can be isolated. What this
leaves out are the data from survey and
testing projects, as well as the data from
excavated sites where the remains of mul-
tiple components cannot be separated.
Where appropriate and feasible, informa-
tion from the other project areas listed
above is discussed, but I have not at-
tempted detailed evaluations of the arche-
ological data from these other projects.
The Post Oak Savanna occupies that
part of the western Gulf Coast Plain that
lies between the pine forests of deep east
Texas and the Blackland Prairie to the
west (Fig. 12.1). As such, it is at the west-
ern edge of the eastern U.S. woodlands.

As the name indicates, it is a vegetational
region characterized by hardwood for-
ests mixed with prairies. The forests are
dominated by a variety of species of nut-
producing oaks and hickories, and these
natural plants apparently played a vital
role in prehistoric subsistence. The region
also supports a rich fauna, with taxa such
as white-tailed deer, turtles, and various
small mammals being especially impor-
tant prehistorically.

The southern part of the area under
study here is drained by the southeastward-
ﬂowing Trinity and Brazos Rivers, while
the Sulphur and Sabine Rivers ﬂow east-
ward through the northern part. The cli-
mate throughout the region is temperate.
Mean annual temperatures range from
63° F in Delta County in the north to
68° F in Grimes County in the south, with
a corresponding increase in the length
of the growing season from 233 days to
278 days. Mean annual precipitation
varies from 36.6 inches to 45.0 inches;
rainfall tends to be more abundant in the
northern counties (Delta, Hopkins, Rains,
Van Zandt, and Wood) and in Grimes
and Madison Counties at the southeast-
ern edge of the region, while rainfall aver-
ages less than 40 inches elsewhere (Nat-
ural Fibers Information Center 1987).
Just when this modern climate, and
ﬂora and fauna approximating those of
the Historic period prior to disruption by
modern land use practices, became estab-
lished remains debatable, but the data

347

presented by Michael B. Collins and
C. Britt Bousman (1993, 59) suggest that
this happened about three thousand years
ago. Offering abundant natural resources,
the region was occupied intensively by
Native Americans at this time and later,
and this intensive habitation partly ex-
plains the high frequency of archeologi-
cal sites dating to the Late Holocene
(Fig. 12.2). Also contributing to the
scarceness of earlier archeological re-
mains, however, are changes in the land-
scape that removed many pre–Late Holo-
cene sites through erosion and deeply
buried others. Thus, while the record re-
covered to date is primarily a Late Holo-
cene one, this record almost certainly ex-
aggerates a general increase through time
in occupational intensity in the Post Oak
Savanna. Because earlier sites are so few
and paleoenvironmental conditions are so
poorly understood, this narrative focuses
mainly on the last few thousand years of
the archeological record.

The study area for this summary is
based only partly on environmental fac-
tors. This review is limited to the Post
Oak Savanna and the adjacent eastern
edge of the Blackland Prairie speciﬁcally
to avoid dealing with northeastern Texas
on the east, and north-central and central
Texas on the west. Thus, this study inten-
tionally skirts the Caddo heartland, and it
ignores the wealth of data obtained from
numerous projects on the central and
western Blackland Prairie, the Eastern

tance east of chert-rich central Texas (see,
e.g., Frederick and Ringstaff 1994).

The study area for this summary, then,

encompasses parts of fourteen counties,
extending some 300 km from Delta
County on the north to Grimes County
on the south. The northern edge is de-
ﬁned to include Cooper Lake because,
while it is actually in the eastern Black-
land Prairie, this part of the Sulphur
River valley has recently yielded impor-
tant information about the prehistory of
this edge of the Caddoan area, and Post
Oak Savanna habitat is present in part of
the Cooper Lake basin. The study area is
not extended any farther north, however,
to avoid the distinctly different (at least
during the Late Prehistoric period) Red
River valley (Bruseth 1998; see also Pert-
tula, chapter 13, this volume).

The second anchor for this discussion

is the Jewett Mine and adjacent Lake
Limestone. These project areas are about
200 km south of Cooper Lake in the up-
per Navasota River valley, with some of
the Jewett Mine sites straddling the divide
between the Navasota and Trinity Rivers.
Important projects between Cooper Lake
and the Jewett Mine include Lake Fork
Reservoir, which is in the Sabine River
drainage, and Richland/Chambers Reser-
voir, which is situated near where the
Trinity River enters the Post Oak Savanna.
One of the notable gaps in archeological
coverage for the region occurs down-
stream from this latter project area—the
stretch of the Trinity River Valley that
separates Freestone and Leon Counties
on the west from Anderson and Houston
Counties on the east.

The southern limit of the study area is

marked by the Gibbons Creek Mine on
the lower Navasota River. While the Post
Oak Savanna runs southwestward from
Grimes County all the way to the other
side of the Guadalupe River, the study
area discussed here does not extend be-
yond the Brazos River. There are two
main reasons for this delimitation. First,
the prehistory of the southwestern part
of the Post Oak Savanna apparently has
more to do with the archeology of central
Texas and the coastal area than that of
eastern Texas (see, e.g., Rogers 1995b,
1997). And second, while there have been
some interesting recent studies of sites in
the Brazos River valley (e.g., Bowman
1985, 1991; Roemer and Carlson 1987;

Fig. 12.1. Map showing the Post Oak Savanna of east-central Texas and major archeological
projects.

Cross Timbers, and the eastern Edwards
Plateau (e.g., Ray Roberts Reservoir,
Lewisville Lake, Lavon Lake, Lake Ray
Hubbard, Mountain Creek Lake, Bard-
well Lake, Navarro Mills Reservoir,
Aquilla Reservoir, Whitney Lake, Waco
Lake, Fort Hood, Stillhouse Hollow Lake,
North Fork Reservoir, and Granger Lake
[see Prikryl 1993 for a summary]). For at
least certain parts of the prehistoric pe-

riod, these areas had culture histories that
were distinctly different from those of
east-central Texas, and this differential
provides some rationale for viewing them
separately. This is not to say, of course,
that these areas are irrelevant to the arche-
ology of the Post Oak Savanna. In fact,
one of the things that makes east-central
Texas interesting is its position at the edge
of the Caddoan area and only a short dis-

POST OAK SAVANNA OF EAST-CENTR AL TEXAS / 349

Pre–Late Archaic Period

Cooper Lake

Only one site with an isolable compo-

nent dating to this interval, the Finley
Fan site (41HP159), has been excavated
and analyzed (Gadus et al. 1992), al-
though it is likely that materials of this
age are intermixed with later deposits at a
number of sites, especially along the up-
land edge adjacent to the valley. The Fin-
ley Fan site is situated in the upper depos-
its of a thick Holocene alluvial fan. Most
of the archeological materials are Late Ar-
chaic in age, but a Middle Archaic com-
ponent (Analysis Unit 3/4) dating to
4500 –3000 b.c. was found in the lower
part of the excavations. The work in this
low-density cultural deposit uncovered
four cultural features, all of which are
burned rock concentrations interpreted
as food-processing facilities or general-
purpose hearths, and recovered a small
collection of 465 lithic artifacts. The arti-
facts are dominated by unmodiﬁed deb-
itage, but small numbers of dart points
(one Yantis and two untyped fragments),
other shaped tools, modiﬁed ﬂakes, cores,
and ground/battered stones were found
as well (Fig. 12.3). Because of poor pres-
ervation, no faunal or macrobotanical re-
mains were recovered.

The remains appear to represent small
occupational loci adjacent to the hearths.
The intensity of use appears to have been
quite low, and comparisons with later sites
at Cooper Lake suggest that the Middle
Archaic occupations of Finley Fan were
relatively short lived and infrequent.
Nonetheless, the materials recovered are

Archaic component at the Finley Fan site

tionation; Sabine River assays are on nutshells/charcoal, not corrected for fractionation;
Richland/Chambers Reservoir assays are mostly on charcoal/nutshells with a few on human
bones, not corrected for fractionation; Jewett Mine assays are mostly on charcoal/nutshells
with a few on soil humates or human bones, most corrected for fractionation; Gibbons Creek
Mine assays are on charcoal/nutshells, most corrected for fractionation.

Thoms 1993), most of the projects on
the Brazos and beyond to the Colorado
River have been relatively limited in scope
(with Rogers’s 1995b and 1997 work at
the Sandow Mine in Lee County being
an important exception), and this limited
scope makes it difﬁcult to incorporate the
results of these projects into a cultural-
historical narrative.

The summary below is broken down

into three major time periods, the ﬁrst
dealing with archeology that is more than
about four thousand years old (i.e., pre-
dating the Late Archaic period), the sec-
ond encompassing the interval from ca.
2000 b.c. to about a.d. 800 (i.e., the Late
Archaic and Woodland or Early Ceramic
periods), and the third discussing prehis-
toric archeology postdating a.d. 800
(i.e., the Late Prehistoric period). Use of
this simple scheme accomplishes several
things. First, it provides a way to separate
out the earliest remains, which are so
skimpy that it is hard to do more than
catalog their existence. Second, it partly
parallels traditional chronologies based on
technological changes in weaponry and
food preparation (i.e., the introduction of
the bow and arrow and pottery vessels),

so it should be easy to relate what is said
here to chronologies in other areas. And
third, it allows for more narrative ﬂow
than would be possible if the timeline
were segmented into a greater number of
temporal units, some of which currently
have only limited support in the radio-
carbon evidence.

One issue that this summary does not

address is use of the region by Native
Americans during the Historic period.
Materials dating to this interval are few
and far between in the project areas listed
above, with the most conspicuous historic
Native American sites in the Post Oak
Savanna— Gilbert, Pearson, and Vinson
(Dufﬁeld and Jelks 1961; Jelks 1967;
J. Smith 1993)—representing Norteño
or Wichita groups that moved southward
into Texas in the seventeenth and eigh-
teenth centuries. While this topic is
certainly an interesting one, its proper
geographic frame of reference is all of
north-central Texas rather than the Post
Oak Savanna. Further, except for the pub-
lication of the report on the 1960s excava-
tions at the Vinson site ( J. Smith 1993),
not much new information has appeared
recently on these “Norteño” sites.

more suggestive of residential occupations
than use strictly for procurement/process-
ing tasks.

Jewett Mine and Lake Limestone

Components predating the Late Ar-
chaic period also are scarce in the upper
Navasota River basin, with only two exca-
vated sites apparently containing substan-
tial materials dating to this temporal in-
terval (Fields 1990). Both sites are in the
uplands along a tributary to the Navasota
River, and the archeological remains are
contained in sandy colluvium. The earlier
of these is Analysis Unit 4/5 at the Lambs
Creek Knoll site (41LN106), where a
single radiocarbon assay of ca. 8000 b.c.
and the small collection of classiﬁable
dart points (one Golondrina, one Hoxie,
one Woden, one untyped specimen with
a parallel stem, and four untyped lanceo-
late points [Fig. 12.4]) suggest that a Late
Paleoindian–Early Archaic component is
present (although a couple of sandy-paste
sherds in these deposits attest to the in-
clusion of later materials as well). These
deposits contained a single burned rock
hearth and yielded a modest collection of
997 lithic artifacts. The formal tool as-
semblage contains an unusually high per-
centage of unifaces, with most of the
other tools being dart points and other
bifaces. Because of poor preservation, al-
most no faunal or macrobotanical re-
mains were recovered.

A somewhat later component was
identiﬁed as Analysis Unit 4/5 at the
Charles Cox site (41LN29A). While no
radiocarbon dates were obtained from
these deposits, a pre–Late Archaic age is
suggested for some of the remains by the
dated Late Archaic deposits above and by
the relatively high proportion of untyped
expanding-stem and parallel-stem dart
points (n!9; Fig. 12.5), although four
later points (Axtell, Gary, and Neches
River types) and a single earlier point
(San Patrice) are included as well. No cul-
tural features were found in this unit, but
scattered burned rocks suggest the former
presence of burned rock hearths. The
lithic artifact collection consists of 2,359
specimens, with the formal tools being
dominated by dart points and other bi-
faces. This component yielded no faunal
remains at all and very few macrobotani-
cal remains.

in the area, both of these pre–Late Ar-
chaic components are interpreted as resi-
dential bases that were used infrequently.
While somewhat higher use intensity is
indicated for the Charles Cox than the
Lambs Creek Knoll site, it is difﬁcult to
relate this higher use intensity to differ-
ences in occupation length and/or fre-
quency of use, and there is insufﬁcient
evidence to suggest that this reﬂects an
increase in population densities through
time. The evidence from these two sites is
consistent with the ideas that the upper
Navasota River basin was used by foragers
during this time and that population den-
sities were low.

Late Archaic and
Woodland Periods

Cooper Lake

In the upper Sulphur River basin,
components dating to the Late Archaic
and Woodland periods are moderately
common, with the best excavated ex-
amples occurring at six sites: Finley
Fan (41HP159), Tick (41DT6), Spike
(41DT16), Johns Creek (41DT62), Hur-
ricane Hill (41HP106), and 41HP137
(Fields et al. 1993, 1997; Gadus et al.
1992; McGregor 1996; Perttula 1990a).
Analysis Unit 1/2 at the Finley Fan site is
the sole isolated and excavated Late Ar-
chaic component. Although datable ma-
terials were scarce, the evidence suggests
that this component dates to ca. 1650 –
150 b.c. The work in this part of the site
identiﬁed two burned rock hearths and
yielded 2,937 lithic artifacts. The formal
tools are dominated by bifaces and a vari-
ety of dart points, including two Dawson,
two Gary, two Kent, two Morrill, two
Trinity, one Wesley, one Yantis, four Yar-
brough, four untyped specimens, and
12 fragments (Fig. 12.6), but gouges,
unifaces, cobble tools, and ground/bat-
tered stones also were recovered. Faunal
and macrobotanical remains were not
preserved.

As in the earlier component at this
site, the Late Archaic remains appear to
represent small, hearth-associated occupa-
tional loci. The intensity of use, although
somewhat higher than for the earlier
component at the Finley Fan site, is low
compared to later sites in the area, and it
is suggested that the Late Archaic occupa-
tions of the Finley Fan site were short

lived and infrequent. The artifacts recov-
ered appear to indicate residential rather
than limited-purpose extractive tasks,
however.

The Tick and Spike sites are similar,
both being situated in alluvium on low
ﬂoodplain knolls adjacent to the South
Sulphur River. Both have middens dating
to the Woodland and Early Caddoan pe-
riods and containing abundant artifacts

and faunal remains. The Woodland com-
ponent at Tick (Analysis Unit 3/4) ap-
pears to date chieﬂy to ca. a.d. 50 –700,
while that at Spike (Analysis Unit 3/4)
dates primarily to ca. a.d. 1–800. No fea-
tures were found in the Woodland com-
ponent at Tick, but the Woodland depos-
its at Spike contained two possible dumps
of hearth debris, one small pit, one large
pit, and one possible posthole. The arti-

fact collections from these deposits con-
sist of 17,559 lithic items, 78 ceramic
vessel sherds, and 75 bone/antler/shell
tools or ornaments (mostly awls, but also
antler pressure ﬂakers, beamers, a graver/
scraper, and beads). The 19 arrow points
recovered represent later materials trans-
located down from the overlying later de-
posits, and this situation is probably true
for the ceramics as well, since they are so
few in number and no different from the
pottery in the overlying Late Prehistoric
contexts. The formal lithic tools are dom-
inated by bifaces and dart points; per-
forators, gouges, unifaces, cobble tools,
ground stones, hammerstones, and pitted
stones are present in much smaller num-
bers. These deposits contained 172 dart
points, with 76 percent of the classiﬁable
specimens being Gary points; most of the
remainder are typed as Dawson and Kent
(Fig. 12.7). Both components yielded
large faunal collections containing a di-
verse array of taxa, with turtles, deer, rab-
bits, other small mammals, and mussels
being most common; the Spike site also
yielded a few elements identiﬁed as bison.
The modest collections of macrobotanical
remains consist mostly of hickory nut-
shells, with Pediomelum (formerly referred
to as Psoralea) rhizome fragments, acorns,
and vetch/peavine seeds occurring in
small numbers.

The Johns Creek site sits in probable
alluvial deposits on a low knoll adjacent
to Johns Creek on the ﬂoodplain of the
South Sulphur River. The radiocarbon
assays provide equivocal evidence about
the chronology of the site, but the diag-
nostic artifacts suggest occupations over
much or all of the Woodland period and
a light later deposit is present as well. The
Woodland component (Analysis Unit
3/4) lacks midden deposits and no cul-
tural features were found, but a sample of
3,348 lithic artifacts was obtained. The
collection of formal tools consists mostly
of bifaces and dart points, with small
numbers of perforators, gouges, unifaces,
cobble tools, ground stones, hammer-
stones, and pitted stones. The three ar-
row points clearly are intrusive, while the
collection of 56 dart points is dominated
by specimens classiﬁed as Gary or Kent
(77 percent of the classiﬁable specimens).
Organic materials were poorly preserved,
and the faunal collection is too small to
be informative. The meager macrobotani-

cal collection contains hickory and pecan
nutshells, acorns, and wild plum seeds.
Hurricane Hill is a large upland site
with a complex history of use, although
most of the archeological remains appear
to represent occupations during the early
and middle parts of the Late Prehistoric
period and the Woodland period. Wood-
land materials are best represented in a
portion of the site termed the Southwest
rise, where a midden deposit and numer-
ous cultural features were encountered
and a modest artifact sample was ob-
tained (Perttula 1995a, 1999, 387). Un-
fortunately, this part of the site yielded al-
most no faunal or botanical remains. The
artifacts assigned to the Woodland period
component consist of nineteen dart points
(79 percent typed as Gary), ﬁfty-one other
chipped stone tools, eight cores, and one
hematite axe. Small numbers of arrow

points (n!4) and ceramics (n!45) were
recovered, but these mostly represent later
use by Caddoan peoples. While a few of
the features relate to the later component
(e.g., an extended burial and an intrusive
pit), most of the features are interpreted
as being associated with the Woodland
component. Included are twelve pits,
nine postholes or possible postholes, six
possible bundle burials, four single cre-
mations, two multiple cremations, and
one hearth. The burials appear to consti-
tute a structured cemetery, perhaps repre-
senting a fairly short span of time, and
the postholes and pits may mark an adja-
cent locus of domestic activities. Accord-
ing to Timothy K. Perttula, the remains
are indicative of multiseasonal but not
year-round use for residential purposes.
While the delta 13C value of "15.0 ‰
obtained on the collagen fraction of bone

from Burial 15 implies that C4 plants,
possibly including maize, were an impor-
tant part of the diet, maize has not been
recovered from any Woodland site in the
project area.

Site 41HP137, which is located in an
upland setting near Hurricane Hill, is a
small site that appears to have both
Woodland and Late Prehistoric compo-
nents. Because of uncertainty about the
extent to which materials from these
components may be mixed, it is difﬁcult
to interpret 41HP137 on an assemblage
level. Regardless, the site did yield an in-
teresting collection of botanical remains
from two pit features that were dated to
the Woodland period (uncorrected dates
of 140 b.c. and a.d. 490). This collection
consists of hickory nutshells, cultivated
squash rind fragments, acorn shells, and
tuber and rhizome fragments identiﬁed
tentatively as Psoralea (McGregor 1996),
and this hints at a subsistence base con-
taining both wild and cultivated plants.
In sum, it appears that the Woodland

period saw a substantial increase in the
intensity of site use over the Archaic pe-
riod, and this change probably at least
partly reﬂects increased population densi-
ties. Occupations of at least moderately
long duration are suggested for most, if
not all, of the Woodland components at
Cooper Lake, and frequent reuse is indi-
cated for several. This increased redun-
dancy in the use of certain locales sug-
gests decreased residential mobility. The
Cooper Lake sites appear to have been
used for broad ranges of procurement,
processing, and maintenance activities,
but there is no evidence of fully sedentary
populations. Subsistence pursuits focused
on the hunting of a wide variety of wood-
land, woodland-edge, and aquatic taxa
and on the gathering of wild plant foods.
While there is some indication of the use
of squash, there is no evidence for sub-
stantial reliance on horticulture. Thus,
these Woodland components may be in-
terpreted as hunter-gatherer residential
bases.

Jewett Mine and Lake Limestone

The upper Navasota River basin was
occupied intensively during the Late Ar-
chaic and Woodland periods (Fields 1987,
1990; Fields and Klement 1995; Fields
et al. 1991; M. Mallouf 1979). Late Ar-
chaic components have been isolated at

the following eight sites: Buffalo Branch
(41FT311, Analysis Unit 3), Rena Branch
(41FT334, Analysis Unit 5/6), Charles
Cox (41LN29A, Analysis Unit 3), Alley
Road (41LN149B, Analysis Unit 4/5),
Moccasin Springs (41LN247C, Analysis
Units 3 –5), Old Union Bridge (41LT12,
Analysis Unit 4), Carl Sadler (41LT17,
Analysis Unit 4/5), and 41LT44 (Analy-
sis Unit 1). Components dating predomi-
nantly to the Woodland period are pres-
ent at the Rena Branch (Analysis Unit 4),
Charles Cox (Analysis Unit 2), Harris
Hole (41LN30, Analysis Unit 1/2), Alley
Road (Analysis Unit 3), Old Union
Bridge (Analysis Unit 3), and Carl Sadler
(Analysis Unit 3) sites. The Bottoms
(41FT89, Analysis Unit 3), Buffalo
Branch (Analysis Unit 2), Lambs Creek
Knoll (41LN106, Analysis Unit 3), and
Cottonwood Springs (41LN107, Analysis
Unit 2/3) sites have components with
mixed Late Archaic and Woodland mate-
rials or components dating to the Late
Archaic–Woodland transition. In all,
twenty components dating to this inter-
val have been isolated, and sixty-two of
the eighty-ﬁve radiocarbon dates from
archeological contexts at the mine pertain
to this interval (4000 –1250 b.p.; see
Fig. 12.2).

Three of these sites (Old Union

Bridge, Carl Sadler, and 41LT44) are sit-
uated along the Navasota River, ﬁve sites
(Charles Cox, Harris Hole, Lambs Creek
Knoll, Cottonwood Springs, and Alley
Road) are along tributaries to the Nava-
sota River, and four sites (Bottoms, Buf-
falo Branch, Rena Branch, and Moccasin
Springs) are along the upper reaches of
tributaries to the Trinity River. Old
Union Bridge, Carl Sadler, and Harris
Hole sites are in alluvial settings, while
the deposits at the other sites are primar-
ily colluvial. Midden staining was present
at Charles Cox (Analysis Units 2 and 3)
and maybe Old Union Bridge, and most
sites have limited ranges of feature types.
The features identiﬁed include the fol-
lowing: ﬁfty-one concentrations of burned
rocks interpreted as hearths, shallow bak-
ing pits, or discarded hearth debris (and
large quantities of scattered burned rocks);
one possible nonrock hearth; two pits of
unknown function; one concentration
of groundstone tools; and eight deﬁnite
or possible human burials. Seven of the
burials were at a single site (Cottonwood

Springs), where they constituted a small
cemetery dating to ca. 2800 –2000 b.p.
Six of the burials in this cemetery con-
tained cremations, and two were accom-
panied by exotic offerings (galena and a
slate gorget).

The artifact collections from these
twenty components consist of 59,441
lithic items and just 104 ceramic vessel
sherds. Most of the formal lithic tools are
dart points and other bifaces, but other
tool types—perforators, gouges, unifaces,
cobble tools, ground and battered stones,
pitted stones, and pigment stones— oc-
cur as well. Small numbers of arrow points
were recovered from some components
(totaling 29 points and fragments), but
they appear to be intrusive from later oc-
cupations. The dart point collection con-
sists of more than 400 specimens. The
best represented groups among the clas-
siﬁable specimens are Dawson (19 per-
cent), Gary (9 percent), Kent (8 percent),
Neches River (6 percent), and Godley
(5 percent), as well as a variety of untyped
expanding-stem (14 percent), parallel-
stem (14 percent), and contracting-stem
(7 percent) forms (Fig. 12.8). Dawson,
Gary, Godley, and Kent points appear to
have been used throughout this interval,
while Neches River points are most fre-
quent in Woodland components. Minor
types that are most common in Late
Archaic components are Axtell and
Yarbrough.

Most of the ceramics (92 percent)
are in Woodland components or mixed
Woodland and Late Archaic components,
and it is certain that the few sherds in
Late Archaic contexts are intrusive. The
ceramics are almost evenly split between
the sandy-paste ware that one would ex-
pect for this time period (e.g., Story
1990) and grog- or bone-tempered ce-
ramics, which are found more often in
later contexts at the mine and elsewhere
in the southern part of east Texas. Given
this, it is possible that many of these are
intrusive later specimens and that ceram-
ics were an even less prominent part of
the material culture than is implied by
the small number of sherds found in
Woodland contexts at the mine. Another
interesting aspect of the ceramic collec-
tion is the inclusion of two additional,
unusual kinds of pottery: two sherds that
are tempered with shell and two sherds
that are untempered but have a ﬁne

are predominantly hickory (Carya),
with a few sites also containing walnut
(Juglans). Based on these limited data, it
appears that subsistence pursuits focused
on woodland resources, and there is no
evidence for horticulture during this time.
Of these twenty Late Archaic and Wood-
land components, ﬁfteen (at eleven sites)
are interpreted as residential bases and
ﬁve (at three sites) as procurement/pro-
cessing locations. Five of the residential
base components (at three sites) are lo-
cated along the Navasota River, while the
others are in the uplands to the east. All
ﬁve of those in riverine settings are inter-
preted as general-purpose residential bases
(i.e., lacking a special focus on particular
activities). In contrast, the upland com-
ponents consist of two general-purpose
residential bases (at two sites) and eight
residential bases at which activities fo-
cused heavily on plant processing and sec-
ondarily on hunting (at seven sites). This
distinction suggests that Late Archaic–
Woodland settlement systems were sched-
uled based on the occurrence of plant
foods. Eleven of the residential sites ap-
pear to have been occupied with low or
moderately low frequency, suggesting low
population densities overall. A greater in-
tensity of use is indicated for the other
four residential bases, and this situation
probably reﬂects more frequent reoccupa-
tion, the relatively long-term nature of
the occupations, or both.

The ﬁve analysis units interpreted as
procurement/processing locations appear
to have had a primary focus on plant pro-
cessing and a secondary focus on hunt-
ing-related activities. Four components
(at two sites) are in the Trinity River ba-
sin in the eastern part of the study area,
while the ﬁfth is along a Navasota River
tributary to the west. The moderately
high to high frequency of use suggested
for three of these is surprising in view of
the low use frequency indicated for most
of the residential sites, and it suggests
highly scheduled reuse of particular re-
source patches.

The data from these twenty compo-
nents are consistent with the idea that
Late Archaic–Woodland groups were
chieﬂy foragers. Procurement/processing
locations suggesting logistical use are not
frequent, and the few that have been
identiﬁed suggest intensive exploitation
of particular locales. Settlement systems

kaolin paste. The shell-tempered speci-
mens, and maybe the kaolin-paste sherds
as well, may be related to the possibly early
shell-tempered ceramics found at Rich-
land/Chambers Reservoir (McGregor
and Bruseth 1987, 180). The ceramics
from Woodland contexts in the mine area
are too few and too small to contribute
much information about the range of ves-
sel forms, and only a very few display
nondistinctive decorations (e.g., random
body punctations or incised lines).

Because of the sandy sediments and
poor preservation, some of the Late Ar-
chaic and Woodland components at the
Jewett Mine and Lake Limestone have
yielded no faunal remains at all. Where
animal bones have been recovered, they
tend to be few in number and highly
fragmented. The only identiﬁable speci-
mens are deer and turtle. Macrobotanical
remains are not well preserved either, al-
though most of these components have
yielded burned nutshells. The nutshells

POST OAK SAVANNA OF EAST-CENTR AL TEXAS / 355

appear to have been highly scheduled,
probably on a seasonal basis, with resi-
dential sites in riverine settings differing
from those in the uplands. Comparisons
with earlier components are difﬁcult, but
the much greater frequency of Late Ar-
chaic–Woodland components and the
overall greater intensity of use suggest in-
creased population densities, decreased
territories, or both. This theory also is
suggested by the occurrence of the ceme-
tery at the Cottonwood Springs site
(41LN107).

Late Prehistoric Period

Cooper Lake

The Cooper Lake area has yielded
abundant information on the Late Prehis-
toric period, especially for the early part
(a.d. 800 –1200). Components dating
mostly to this interval have been fully iso-
lated at ﬁve of the excavated sites— Tick
(41DT6, Analysis Unit 2), Spider Knoll
(41DT11), Spike (41DT16, Analysis
Unit 1/2), Thomas (41DT80), and Doc-
tors Creek (41DT124)—and these are
the ones providing most of the summary
data below (Cliff 1995; Fields et al. 1993,
1994a, 1997; W. Martin 1996). In addi-
tion, the Hurricane Hill site (41HP106)
has an important early Late Prehistoric
component recognized on the North rise
(Perttula 1999). Many other excavated
sites (e.g., Manton Miller [41DT1],
Ranger, [41DT37], Luna [41DT52],
Lawson [41HP78], Arnold [41HP102],
Cox [41HP105], and 41HP137) have
cultural deposits of this age as well, al-
though separation of the early Late Pre-
historic remains from earlier or later ones
has proven difﬁcult.

Three of the six sites where early Late

Prehistoric components have been iso-
lated are on ﬂoodplain knolls adjacent to
the river and appear to be in alluvial con-
texts, while the other three are on old ter-
races (Spider Knoll and Doctors Creek)
or upland landforms (Hurricane Hill)
with limited colluvial deposition. All six
sites have middens, and all but Tick have
numerous cultural features, including
nineteen hearths, three possible hearth
dumps, one rock hearth, one shell-ﬁlled
pit, eighty-two other pits, thirteen pits/
postholes, eighty-seven postholes, three
shell concentrations, and thirteen human
burials.

The features associated with the early
Late Prehistoric component at Hurricane
Hill occur mostly in the part of the site
known as the North rise (Perttula 1999).
Most of the postholes may represent two
overlapping, and hence sequentially occu-
pied, houses. Because they were not fully
exposed, it is difﬁcult to interpret them
fully, but the number, arrangement, and
size of the postholes and their apparent
association with two middens, a number
of pits, several isolated postholes, two
hearths, and several burials indicate that
this part of the Hurricane Hill site sup-
ported a small permanent settlement dur-
ing the Early Caddoan period.

At the Spider Knoll site, the spatial
arrangement of the features suggests the
patterned use of the site over time. One
area was used most consistently for domi-
ciliary activities and outside activities as-
sociated with small and medium pits and
probably structures such as brush arbors
and drying racks. Another area was used
primarily for outside activities associated
with large pits, and a third area was used
chieﬂy for trash disposal. This patterned
use of space implies residential occupa-
tions that were long lived, but the houses
built at the site were not the sorts of sub-
stantial structures expected for year-round
occupations. Instead, they probably were
more like brush arbors (albeit large ones,
measuring 8 to 10 m in diameter) sup-
ported by small, widely spaced posts and
were more suitable for seasonal use. Deci-
pherable feature patterning was not found
at the Spike, Thomas, or Doctors Creek
sites, but this probably can be ascribed to
the more limited excavations there.

The artifacts from the ﬁve components

assigned most securely to the early part
of the Late Prehistoric period consist of
38,178 lithic items, 2,500 ceramic ves-
sel sherds, 6 ceramic pipe sherds, and
777 bone/shell /antler tools or ornaments
(mostly awls, but also engraved pins, antler
pressure ﬂakers, beamers, gravers/scrapers,
pestles, beads, and a ﬁshhook). The for-
mal lithic tools are dominated by bifaces
and projectile points, and other tool
forms—perforators, gouges, unifaces,
cobble tools, ground stones, pitted stones,
and hammerstones— occur in smaller
numbers. Arrow points occur about three
times more frequently than dart points
(855 versus 279), but the latter occur in
sufﬁcient numbers to show that the atlatl

continued to be used after the introduc-
tion of the bow and arrow. The most
common arrow point groups are Colbert
(29 percent of the classiﬁable specimens)
and Steiner (22 percent), with Catahoula
(7 percent), Friley (4 percent), Scallorn
(3 percent), Alba (2 percent), and a vari-
ety of other forms occurring in smaller
numbers (Fig. 12.9); the largest group
of untyped specimens have contracting
stems (9 percent). Gary points are by far
the most numerous among the classiﬁable
dart points (67 percent), with most of the
remainder typed as Gary/Kent (8 percent)
or Kent (6 percent).

Most of the ceramics (65 percent) are

tempered primarily with grog, while
bone, sometimes in combination with
grog, is the second most common tem-
pering agent (30 percent). Shell temper-
ing occurs infrequently (2 percent), and
these sherds almost certainly are intrusive
from later deposits at the sites. Because
the sherds tend to be small, it is difﬁcult
to determine vessel forms, but it seems
that they represent primarily simple
bowls, globular bowls, barrel-shaped jars,
small globular jars, and large restricted
jars. Only 14 percent of the pottery is
decorated, mostly with punctations
and/or incised or engraved lines. Relating
the sherds to deﬁned types usually is not
easy, but most of the decorated specimens
bear similarities to such Caddoan types as
Crockett Curvilinear-Incised and Pen-
nington Punctated-Incised (Fig. 12.10).
Present in small numbers are sherds with
decorative treatments (e.g., overhanging
incised lines, incised lips, or punctated
raised panels) that are more common on
ceramics from the Lower Mississippi Val-
ley (Phillips 1970), and some of these have
been classiﬁed as Coles Creek types. Also
present in consistently small numbers are
base-body sherds from ﬂowerpot-shaped
vessels that are strongly reminiscent of
Williams Plain. Most of the ceramic pipe
sherds are not very distinctive, but at least
one represents a long-stemmed Red River
pipe (Hoffman 1967).

All ﬁve sites yielded large faunal collec-

tions, as did the Hurricane Hill Early
Caddoan component. All show that deer,
turtles, rabbits, and mussels were impor-
tant subsistence resources, and all contain
a variety of other taxa as well, including
ﬁsh, amphibians, turkey and other birds,
and various small mammals. None of the

portance of maize and other cultigens re-
mains one of the major unanswered ques-
tions for the area. Based on the absence
of constructed mounds or elaborate buri-
als (all of the burials at Cooper Lake lack
grave goods), it is clear that the area was
occupied by groups with less complex so-
cial systems than those of early Late Pre-
historic Caddoan groups to the north,
east, and south.

Evidence for Native American use of
the Cooper Lake area during the second
half of the Late Prehistoric period is
much sparser, and it appears that the area
was essentially abandoned by about a.d.
1500. Only two excavated sites, Hurri-
cane Hill (41HP106) and Peerless Bot-
toms (41HP175), have isolable compo-
nents that date to this interval (Fields
et al. 1993; Perttula 1999), although
some of the early Late Prehistoric sites
discussed above, particularly Spider
Knoll, probably continued to be used
into the 1200s (Fields et al. 1993, 1997;
Perttula 1999).

The part of the Hurricane Hill site
that was occupied during this time is
known as the South rise. While the arti-
facts and subsistence remains associated
with this component have not been fully
analyzed and reported, the component
has been dated and the feature assemblage
has been isolated. The features consist of
four middens, two clay-lined hearths,
twenty-three pits, three burials, one dog
burial, and ninety-eight postholes. Most
of the postholes apparently represent two
overlapping houses with central hearths.
Because the hearths partly overlap and be-
cause several large interior postholes may
mark main support post locations for
both structures, it is surmised that the
structures were associated and used se-
quentially. The radiocarbon evidence in-
dicates that one structure dates to the last
half of the a.d. 1200s, with the other dat-
ing to the ﬁrst half or three-quarters of
the 1300s (Perttula 1997, 173 –75).
Neither set of postholes exhibits a well-
deﬁned pattern clearly indicating the
house walls, but Perttula (1999, 106 –
109) suggests that the two structures
measured approximately 6.0 by 7.5 m
and about 7.1 by 7.6 m. Based on these
two structures, the associated middens
and other features that may represent out-
side activity areas, and a possible third
structure, it is clear that the South rise

sites yielded bison remains. Hickory nut-
shells occur ubiquitously (but not abun-
dantly), and a variety of other kinds of
macrobotanical remains have been recov-
ered. Included are acorns, pecans, Pedio-
melum rhizome fragments, squash rind
fragments, maize, and seeds of Rubus,
vetch/peavine, hackberry, maygrass, sun-
ﬂower, knotweed, cheno-am, grape,
honey locust, sumpweed, bedstraw, sedge,
spurge, bindweed, pigweed, wood sorrel,
and wild plum.

The archeological data from the early
Late Prehistoric components at Cooper
Lake indicate an increase in the intensity
of site use over the Woodland period, and
this change probably reﬂects continued
increases in population densities. All of
the components summarized above show
evidence of long-duration occupations
and frequent reuse, which suggests in-
creased redundancy in site use and fur-
ther decreases in group mobility. The

sites appear to have been used for broad
ranges of procurement, processing, and
maintenance activities, and at least one
(Hurricane Hill) apparently supported
year-round (or maybe multiseasonal) oc-
cupation. The variety of features present
at most of the other the sites hints that
they may have been used as seasonal camp
sites. The macrobotanical remains indi-
cate primary reliance on wild plant foods,
with tropical cultigens making modest
contributions, and this theory may be
supported by the moderate caries rates
presented by Diane Wilson and D. Gen-
try Steele (1997, 231) in their summary
of the human remains from Cooper Lake.
On the other hand, substantial consump-
tion of maize is implied by the delta 13C
values ranging between "15.3 ‰ and
"17.6 ‰ for the collagen fractions of
bones from three Early Caddoan burials
at Hurricane Hill (Wilson and Steele
1997, 233). The issue of the dietary im-

stakes—and recovered a large artifact
sample consisting of 1,947 ceramic vessel
sherds, 7 pipe fragments, 1 ceramic bead,
126 arrow points, 4 dart points, 360
other chipped stone tools (including an
unusually large number of small end
scrapers), 219 cores, 13,365 pieces of un-
modiﬁed debitage, 30 ground or battered
stones, and 16 bone tools. The majority
of the typable arrow points are classed as
Turney (37 percent) or Perdiz (34 per-
cent), with most of the remainder being
Cliffton, Fresno, and Talco (Fig. 12.11).
Both of the classiﬁable dart points are
typed as Gary.

The ceramic collection is unusual not
only because of the large number of sherds
but also because many of the sherds are
relatively large, allowing reconstruction of
vessel sections. The sherds are distinctive
in that 41 percent contain shell temper
(the remainder have grog and/or bone)
and 5 percent are red slipped. A number
of vessel forms are represented, including
several kinds of carinated bowls, simple
bowls, deep bowls, globular jars, large
and small cylindrical jars, and bottles and
a couple of the forms that are more typi-
cal of Plains vessels than Caddoan ones
(Fields et al. 1993). Nonetheless, most of
the ceramics can be related comfortably
to such Caddoan types as Ripley En-
graved, Avery Engraved, Simms Engraved,
McKinney Plain, Nash Neck-Banded, and
Emory Punctated-Incised (Fig. 12.12).
Only two of the pipe fragments are dis-
tinctive; one appears to be part of an
elbow-shaped pipe, while the other has
a short stem that is not typical of either
elbow-shaped or Red River pipes. The
bone tool collection, although small, is
interesting because it contains a grooved
bison (?) rib possibly representing a rasp.
Faunal remains were not well pre-
served, and only a small collection was re-
covered. The best represented taxa are
deer and turtles, with birds, small mam-
mals, bison, and pronghorn occurring in
smaller numbers. The macrobotanical re-
mains consist mostly of hickory nutshells,
with Pediomelum rhizome fragments,
honey locust and water locust seeds,
pecans, acorns, black walnuts, hackber-
ries, squash rind fragments, and maize
cupules occurring less commonly. The
subsistence data are consistent with the
interpretation of a mixed hunter-gatherer
and horticultural economy. The distribu-

supported a small permanent occupation
during the ﬁrst part of the second half of
the Late Prehistoric period. The delta 13C
value of "15.2 ‰ on skeletal materials
from Burial 13 on the South rise suggests
that C4 plants contributed signiﬁcantly to
the diet, but it is difﬁcult to relate the
earlier carbon isotope data from Hurri-
cane Hill to maize consumption with
certainty.

The Peerless Bottoms site is buried
within alluvial fan deposits along Finley
Branch on the south side of the South
Sulphur River ﬂoodplain. The chrono-
metric and artifactual evidence indicates
that it dates primarily to the latter part
of the Late Prehistoric period, probably
ca. a.d. 1400 –1500. The excavations lo-
cated ﬁve potential cultural features—

tional evidence suggests that the area
sampled represents an outside activity area
associated with an undiscovered structure,
and comparisons with other sites in the
project area suggest that this component
represents a single long-lived residential
occupation, probably a small farmstead.
In sum, the middle and late parts of

the Late Prehistoric period at Cooper
Lake are somewhat difﬁcult to interpret
because of the limited number of exca-
vated components, but it is clear that
there were changes in settlement strate-
gies from the early part of this period.
The two analyzed components appear to
have seen long-lived occupations involv-
ing broad ranges of activities, and at least
one, and probably both, were used by
sedentary groups. Limited residential mo-
bility is indicated, and these sites proba-
bly were similar functionally (i.e., they
were small farmsteads occupied by groups
with mixed hunter-gatherer and horticul-
tural economies). There is no evidence for
substantially greater reliance on cultigens
than during the early part of the period,
and there is no indication of a shift to a
bison-oriented hunting strategy, although
bison are present at Peerless Bottoms and
not at the earlier sites (except the Wood-
land component at the Spike site).

The small number of isolable compo-
nents dating to this late interval makes it
clear that this stretch of the Sulphur River
valley was occupied less densely during
this time than before. In fact, small num-
bers of late artifacts occur at many sites
that predominantly predate ca. a.d. 1200,
and because of their small numbers these
artifacts suggest that most of the late com-
ponents in the project area represent non-
intensive, presumably limited-purpose
use. Thus, there is reason to question
whether the two excavated components
discussed above are typical for the area.
From this perspective, it appears that
settlement systems during the second half
of the Late Prehistoric period may have
included limited numbers of residential
sites but relatively large numbers of lim-
ited-function procurement/processing
sites. This situation implies an increase in
logistical mobility over the early Late Pre-
historic period.

The artifacts from the eleven Late Pre-

historic components consist of 43,465
lithic specimens, 1,703 ceramic vessel
sherds, 4 ceramic pipe fragments, and
6 bone tools (with mixed Analysis Unit
1/2/5 at 41FT89 contributing an addi-
tional 15,336 lithics, 556 vessel sherds,
and 7 pipe fragments). The formal lithic
tools are dominated especially heavily by
projectile points, but perforators, gouges,
other bifaces, unifaces, cobble tools,
ground and battered stones, pitted stones,
and pigment stones are also present.
The collection from one site (Moccasin
Springs) contains an unusually large
number of scrapers made on blades. The
projectile point collection consists of
more than 500 specimens, with arrow
points occurring almost twice as fre-
quently as dart points. While the bow
and arrow was the predominant method
of taking game, it appears that the atlatl

continued to be used as well, especially
during the early half of the period. Perdiz
is by far the best represented arrow point
type (43 percent of the classiﬁable speci-
mens; see Fig. 12.13), although this late
style occurs almost exclusively at only a
few sites (Bottoms, Moccasin Springs,
and Old Union Bridge). Early arrow
points that occur more widely but in
small numbers include specimens typed
as Scallorn (5 percent), Steiner (4 per-
cent), and a variety of untyped forms
with expanding or parallel stems (12 and
7 percent, respectively). The most com-
mon dart point types, chieﬂy from com-
ponents dating to the early part of the
period, are Dawson (20 percent of the
classiﬁable specimens), Kent (10 percent),
Neches River (7 percent), and Gary (6 per-
cent); 37 percent are untyped points (16
percent with parallel stems, 12 percent
with expanding stems, and 9 percent with

Limestone: Rena Branch (41FT334,
Analysis Unit 2), Charles Cox (41LN29A,
Analysis Unit 1), Lambs Creek Knoll
(41LN106, Analysis Units 1 and 2), Alley
Road (41LN149B, Analysis Units 1 and
2), Moccasin Springs (41LN247D,
Analysis Unit 1/2/3), Old Union Bridge
(41LT12, Analysis Units 1 and 2), and
Carl Sadler (41LT17, Analysis Units 1
and 2) (Fields 1987, 1990; Fields et al.
1991; M. Mallouf 1979). The Bottoms
site (41FT89) also has an important Late
Prehistoric component (Analysis Unit
1/2/5), but it is mixed with Woodland
materials and is difﬁcult to interpret on
an assemblage basis. Just twenty-one of
the eighty-ﬁve radiocarbon dates from
archeological contexts at the mine pertain
to this interval (1250 –250 b.p.; see
Fig. 12.2), and this low percentage appar-
ently reﬂects decreased intensity of use
over the preceding periods.

Two of these sites (Old Union Bridge

and Carl Sadler) are on the Navasota
River, three (Charles Cox, Lambs Creek
Knoll, and Alley Road) are along tributar-
ies to the Navasota River, and three sites
(Bottoms, Rena Branch, and Moccasin
Springs) are along the upper reaches of
tributaries to the Trinity River. The Old
Union Bridge and Carl Sadler sites are in
alluvial settings, while the deposits at the
others are mostly colluvial. Middens were
present at the Bottoms, Moccasin Springs,
and perhaps Old Union Bridge sites.
Eight components lack cultural features
entirely, and only four concentrations of
burned rocks interpreted as hearths or
discarded hearth debris, two postholes,
one pit of unknown function, one burial,
and one cache of cores were found in the
remaining three components. Sixteen ad-
ditional burned rock concentrations and
three pits were recorded at the Bottoms
site, but it is hard to be certain that these
are associated with the Late Prehistoric
component. This uncertainty is especially
the case for the rock concentrations, since
rock hearths and scattered nonfeature
burned rocks are much more common in
earlier (i.e., Late Archaic–Woodland)
contexts in the region. One additional
human burial dating to the Late Prehis-
toric period was found at the Cotton-
wood Springs site (Fields and Klement
1995), but the associated occupational
debris was so sparse at this predominantly
Late Archaic–Woodland site that a late
component was not isolated.

contracting stems). The collection of
bone tools, all of which are from Moc-
casin Springs, contains 2 antler pressure
ﬂakers, 3 pointed tools fashioned from
long bone splinters (2 have parallel
grooves along their margins suggesting
use as rasps), and 1 deer metatarsal with
parallel grooves across one face, which
also may be a rasp.

The ceramics are overwhelmingly (96
percent) grog or bone tempered. Most of
the remainder are classiﬁed as the sandy-
paste ware that occurs in small numbers
in Woodland contexts at the mine and
elsewhere across southeastern Texas, and
a few sherds belong to the kaolin-paste
ware also used earlier in the region. It is
unclear if these minor groups represent
ceramics actually used during the Late
Prehistoric period or if they are intrusive
from the earlier deposits. While most of
the tempered ceramics are plain, some
exhibit decorations (e.g., random body
punctations, brushing, diagonal incising,
pinching, engraving, neck-banding, and
appliquéd strips or nodes) that are charac-
teristic of pottery in Caddoan sites to the
east (Fig. 12.14). The motifs on a few
sherds are strongly reminiscent of those
on deﬁned Caddoan types (e.g., Holly
Fine Engraved, Killough Pinched, May-
delle Incised, Patton Engraved, Poyner
Engraved, and Weches Fingernail Im-
pressed), although design execution tends
to be sloppier on the sherds from the Jew-
ett Mine sites. Hence, it appears that
some, and probably all, can be related to
the Caddoan ceramic tradition in one
way or another, be they pots made by
Caddo peoples or copies made by local
groups.

While sherds occur ubiquitously in the
Late Prehistoric components, they are fre-
quent in only a few. In fact, 95 percent
are from just two sites (Moccasin Springs
and Old Union Bridge), with the mixed
component at the Bottoms site also yield-
ing a sizable sample of 556 sherds. In all
three of these cases, most of the sherds
probably relate to use during the latter
part of the Late Prehistoric period. These
late ceramics apparently represent a vari-
ety of bowl and jar forms. The later col-
lections also are distinguished by being
the only ones to contain ceramic pipes.
Although few in number, the recovered
specimens appear to represent short-
stemmed forms that are unlike either the

elbow-shaped form or the long-stemmed
Red River form that are found most often
across eastern Texas.

As for the earlier components, faunal
and macrobotanical remains tend to be
poorly preserved. Most of the Late Pre-
historic components have yielded small
numbers of animal bones, but only Moc-
casin Springs contained abundant faunal
remains that give a good idea of the range
of resources used by these people. Deer,
turtles, and rabbits are the most common

taxa from this site, with other small
mammals, bison, ﬁsh, birds, lizards, and
snakes being represented as well. Carya
nutshells are by far the most common
plant remains; recovered in small quanti-
ties were Quercus nutmeats and shells,
Corylus nutmeats, and several kinds of
seeds (cheno-am, Vitis, Leguminosae, and
Portulaca). There is no evidence for horti-
culture at these components.

nents, four along the Navasota River (at

POST OAK SAVANNA OF EAST-CENTR AL TEXAS / 361

Old Union Bridge and Carl Sadler) and
one at the far eastern end of the study
area (Moccasin Springs), are interpreted
as residential bases; another upland site
(Bottoms) may have been used in a simi-
lar fashion during this time, but the Late
Prehistoric component at this site cannot
be separated from the earlier Woodland
materials. The other six Late Prehistoric
components (at Rena Branch, Charles
Cox, Lambs Creek Knoll, and Alley Road)
are interpreted as procurement/process-
ing locations. These sites suggest that the
Late Prehistoric period saw a change in
settlement strategies from the Late Ar-
chaic and Woodland periods and that
there were changes within the Late Pre-
historic period as well.

While many of these components are

not well dated, two of the residential
components (at Moccasin Springs and
Old Union Bridge) and one unit with
both Late Prehistoric and Woodland ma-
terials (at the Bottoms site) stand out
from the others in their high frequencies
of vessel ceramics, most of which can be
related to Late Caddoan types, and the
occurrence of ceramic pipes. These three
components are the only ones to contain
Perdiz points, and it is likely that these
components date primarily to the latter
half of the Late Prehistoric period (al-
though small numbers of other kinds of
points suggest that earlier occupations are
represented also). The other Late Prehis-
toric components, both those interpreted
as residential bases and as procurement/
processing locations, contain far smaller
collections of typable arrow points and
hence are more difﬁcult to assess tempo-
rally, but most of the types represented
are suggestive of occupations dating to
the early half of the period.

All three of the residential bases dating

to the early part of the period are along
the Navasota River. Two of these appear
to have been focused on plant processing
and to a lesser extent on hunting-related
activities, while the third exhibits no such
emphases. One appears to have been oc-
cupied moderately infrequently, but high-
intensity use is indicated for the other
two components. The greater use inten-
sity could be due to the long-term nature
of the occupations, more frequent reoccu-
pation, or both. Vessel ceramics are more
common than in the early Late Prehis-
toric procurement/processing locations or

the residential bases dating to the Wood-
land period, suggesting that ceramic con-
tainers were used relatively frequently at
these sites.

Five of the early Late Prehistoric pro-
curement/processing locations appear to
have been focused on activities related to
hunting, and the sixth may have been
used for varying purposes during differ-
ent occupations. All six are located east of
the Navasota River, suggesting primarily
logistical use of the uplands and a restric-
tion of residential activities to the river
valley. This change from earlier periods,
and the heavy emphasis on hunting-
related activities, supports the idea of or-
ganizational differences between early
Late Prehistoric settlement systems and
those of the Late Archaic and Woodland
periods. These components exhibit sub-
stantial variability in the frequency of re-
occupation, with low-frequency use indi-
cated for one, moderately low-frequency
use suggested for two, and high-frequency
use indicated for three. As noted above,
vessel ceramics are relatively infrequent
here compared to the residential bases,
and this situation probably reﬂects the
shorter occupations and narrower ranges
of activities.

As noted above, only two excavated
components date predominantly to the
later part of the Late Prehistoric period.
Both are residential bases, with the one
along the Navasota River having been fo-
cused primarily on plant processing and
secondarily on hunting and the one in
the uplands supporting a similar range of
activities but with relatively little manu-
facture of plant processing tools. Both
were used intensively, probably reﬂecting
the relatively long-term nature of the oc-
cupations and/or their frequent reoccupa-
tion. The especially high frequencies of
vessel ceramics suggest relatively great ex-
traregional mobility and/or interaction
and point to changes in cooking tech-
nologies, supporting the conclusion that
the site occupations were relatively long
lived.

Based mostly on the abundance of
Caddoan ceramics in these components
and the lack of evidence for permanent
occupations (i.e., structures), Fields et al.
(1991) suggested that these sites were used
by Caddo Indians as base camps in sup-
port of forays by hunting parties or other
procurement/processing task groups, or

perhaps by groups in transit between the
eastern and central parts of present-day
Texas. It is equally plausible, however,
that they were created by local hunter-
gatherer groups and that the ceramics are
the result of trade or the borrowing of
ideas about ceramic manufacture and dec-
oration. The small sample of two human
burials found so far in late Late Prehistoric
contexts at the mine supports this latter
interpretation in that they almost cer-
tainly are not those of Caddoan farmers.
Both contained ﬂexed skeletons lacking
offerings, and the bones yielded delta13C
values ("21.1 ‰ and "22.3 ‰) much
lower than would be expected for people
who consumed maize regularly.

In sum, the Late Prehistoric period
seems to have seen two major changes in
settlement strategies. In the early part of
the period, residential bases were situated
in the Navasota River valley, and the up-
lands were used primarily for hunting-
related activities. This change represents a
shift to more logistically organized strate-
gies from the forager systems that charac-
terized the Late Archaic and Woodland
periods. The late part of the Late Prehis-
toric period may have seen a return to
foraging strategies, although it is also pos-
sible that the scarcity of procurement/
processing locations dating to this period
is more apparent than real. Perhaps such
sites are present but were not used with
sufﬁcient intensity to be distinguishable
archeologically (as suggested by the ar-
cheological record at the Cottonwood
Springs site), or maybe the procurement/
processing sites created during this period
are outside the Jewett Mine study area.

Temporal and Spatial
Trends in the Data

Technologies

Several notable patterns regarding
when and how technologies changed in
the Post Oak Savanna can be seen in the
archeological data. First, the fact that dart
points make up about one-quarter of the
projectile points in Late Prehistoric con-
texts at Cooper Lake and about one-third
of those in comparable contexts at the
Jewett Mine suggests that the atlatl con-
tinued to be used after the bow and arrow
was introduced ca. a.d. 800. This situa-
tion appears to have been particularly
true through the ﬁrst half of the Late Pre-

the importance of pottery, and regardless
of time period, ceramics played a more
prominent role in the material culture at
Cooper Lake than at the Jewett Mine.

It is difﬁcult to use the data from other

project areas in the Post Oak Savanna to
elaborate on this pattern because of prob-
lems with isolating components and be-
cause of varying recovery strategies (e.g.,
the extensive use of plowing and system-
atic surface collections at Lake Fork Res-
ervoir). Nonetheless, the mean ratios of
sherds to shaped chipped stone tools in
sites dating predominantly to the Wood-
land and Late Prehistoric periods at both
Richland/Chambers Reservoir (ratio !
1.1:1 based on Bird Point Island, Adams
Ranch, Irvine, Polecat Hill, Little Cedar
Creek, and 41FT161B; data taken from
table 18-3 in Bruseth et al. 1987, 237,
with biface fragments added) and the Gib-
bons Creek Mine (ratio ! 1.0:1 based
on 41GM166, 41GM181, 41GM201,
41GM205, 41GM224, 41GM281, and
41GM282; data taken from Rogers 1993,
1994, 1995a) are intermediate between
the mean site values for the Jewett Mine
(0.8:1) and Cooper Lake (1.5:1). In
contrast, the ratio (51:1) for sites at Lake

Fork Reservoir (Bracheen, Gilbreath,
Grimes, Hines, Killebrew, Osborn,
Spoonbill, and Taddlock; data taken from
tables 5-1 and 6-4 in Bruseth and Pert-
tula 1981) is vastly higher than any of the
others, indicating the much more promi-
nent role played by ceramic vessels in the
material culture of the settled villagers
who lived in this part of the Sabine River
valley.

Additional evidence of changes in
cooking technologies can be found in the
features. For example, burned rock con-
centrations interpreted as hearths or shal-
low baking pits are most frequent in Ar-
chaic contexts at both Cooper Lake and
the Jewett Mine, although nonfeature
burned rocks (disturbed or displaced
hearths?) are not so restricted. In fact,
based on ratios of shaped chipped stone
tools to total burned rocks, it appears that
the greatest changes occurred between the
early and late parts of the Late Prehistoric
period in both areas (Fig. 12.15). This
situation parallels the dramatic increase
in the use of ceramic containers for food
preparation during this same interval.
The ratios for the few pre–Late Archaic
components are quite similar, as is the ra-

Fig. 12.15. Graph of shaped chipped stone tools versus weight of burned rocks by time period

historic period; later components still
contain some dart points, but in much
lower frequencies. While some of these
points undoubtedly represent mixing
with earlier deposits, the numbers are so
high and the pattern so consistent that it
seems unlikely that mixing could account
for all of the dart points in the Late Pre-
historic sites. Other project areas in the
Post Oak Savanna contribute limited in-
formation on this issue, in part because
most sites are multicomponent and poorly
stratiﬁed (at best). For example, James E.
Bruseth et al. (1987, 241, 245, 247) posit
continued use of the atlatl during the Late
Prehistoric period at Richland/Chambers
Reservoir, but the small artifact sample
from one site in an alluvial setting in this
project area (41FT193) suggests that
this was not the case at all locations
(McGregor and Bruseth 1987, 173). At
the Gibbons Creek Mine, Late Prehis-
toric components are present at most
of the excavated sites (e.g., 41GM181A,
41GM201, 41GM205, 41GM281, and
41GM282; Rogers 1993, 1995a), but be-
cause of the difﬁculty of isolating compo-
nents and dating them it is hard to tell if
the bow and arrow and atlatl were used
contemporaneously.

The second technological change dis-
cussed here is the use of ceramic contain-
ers. While Woodland contexts at both
Cooper Lake and the Jewett Mine do con-
tain small numbers of sherds (the ratios of
sherds to shaped chipped stone tools are
only 0.1:1 and 0.2:1, respectively), there
is reason to suspect that some or maybe
even all of the ceramics are intrusive from
later occupations. Thus, it appears that
ceramics were at best a minor part of the
material culture during the Woodland pe-
riod. Pottery is only marginally better
represented in early Late Prehistoric con-
texts at the Jewett Mine (the ratio of
sherds to shaped chipped stone tools is
0.5:1), and it is clear that activities re-
lated to the use of ceramics were not im-
portant at the sites used during this tem-
poral interval. In contrast, vessel sherds
are almost as frequent as shaped chipped
stone tools in early Late Prehistoric con-
texts at Cooper Lake (0.9:1), and they
outnumber tools in contexts dating to the
latter part of the Late Prehistoric period
in both project areas (5.7:1 at Cooper
Lake and 2.8:1 at the Jewett Mine). Thus,
both areas exhibit time-related trends in

POST OAK SAVANNA OF EAST-CENTR AL TEXAS / 363

tio for the single Late Archaic component
at Cooper Lake and the mean value for
the Late Archaic components at the Jew-
ett Mine. These low ratios suggest similar
cooking practices involving extensive use
of rocks for heat retention during baking
and roasting. The great variability in the
values for the Late Archaic components at
the Jewett Mine probably reﬂects intersite
variability in the resources processed and
perhaps seasons of use (see the section
“Site Functions, Settlement Strategies,
and Use Intensity” below).

Interestingly, the ratios for the Wood-

land and early Late Prehistoric compo-
nents are virtually the same within each
project area but different between project
areas. The moderate value for the early
Late Prehistoric period at Cooper Lake
probably can be attributed at least partly
to the moderately frequent use of ceramic
vessels and to the increased use of boiling
versus roasting and baking. The compa-
rable value for the Woodland period sug-
gests that this may not be the sole expla-
nation, however, since there is no evidence
for substantial use of pottery during this
period. Although not testable with the
data currently at hand, this change also
could reﬂect the use of new plant foods
that did not require roasting or baking.
The fact that the Woodland and early
Late Prehistoric values for the Jewett
Mine are lower than those for Cooper
Lake suggests that groups occupying
the southern Post Oak Savanna did not
follow the same trajectory in terms of
changes in cooking practices as did those
living in the northern part. This diver-
gence may relate to the lesser importance
of ceramic vessels at the Jewett Mine
compared to Cooper Lake during the
early Late Prehistoric period, and it might
indicate differences in the kinds of subsis-
tence resources as well.

Subsistence

Almost no direct data pertaining to
subsistence have been recovered from the
components predating the Late Archaic
period. Slightly better information is
available for the Late Archaic and Wood-
land periods at the Jewett Mine, while the
Cooper Lake sites have contributed useful
information for the later part of this in-
terval. The overall subsistence pattern
prior to the Late Prehistoric period ap-
pears to have entailed hunting of a wide

variety of animals that frequented wood-
land, woodland-edge, and aquatic envi-
ronments (with only minimal use of
grassland taxa), and gathering of wild
plant foods, including hardwood nuts,
seeds, and tubers/rhizomes. Very limited
amounts of squash at one site at Cooper
Lake indicate some use of cultigens, but
there is no reason to think that they con-
tributed signiﬁcantly to the diet. Hence,
the Native Americans who lived in the
Cooper Lake and Jewett Mine areas dur-
ing the Late Archaic and Woodland peri-
ods appear to have been hunter-gatherers.
Similar hunting patterns prevailed
throughout the succeeding Late Prehis-
toric period in both project areas, with
one possible minor exception. Speciﬁ-
cally, bones positively identiﬁable as bison
are most common in contexts dating to
the later part of the Late Prehistoric pe-
riod, although bones identiﬁed as possible
bison are not so restricted. This circum-
stance may hint at increased use of bison
after a.d. 1400, and some support for
this theory can be found in the increased
frequencies of formal scrapers at some
late sites, but neither the overall tool
assemblages nor the faunal collections
themselves point to a shift toward bison-
oriented economies. Rather, it appears
that bison were simply a small part of
what was a predominantly woodland-
oriented hunting strategy.

While the poor preservation of macro-
botanical remains at the Jewett Mine sites
makes it difﬁcult to be certain, the plant
remains recovered to date and the limited
stable carbon isotope evidence indicate
that Late Prehistoric groups in the upper
Navasota River basin used wild plant
foods and were not horticulturists. This
is not the case for the Cooper Lake area,
however. Most of the Late Prehistoric
sites in the upper Sulphur River basin
have yielded small quantities of maize and
squash, as well as hardwood nuts, a vari-
ety of seeds, and tuber/rhizome frag-
ments. It is clear that tropical cultigens
contributed to the diet of groups who oc-
cupied the area during both the early and
late parts of the period, but they are not
sufﬁciently abundant to indicate true
agricultural economies. Instead, it appears
that limited horticulture may have been
incorporated into a hunter-gatherer sys-
tem that had its roots in the preceding
Woodland period, or perhaps even ear-

lier. Possibly contradicting this interpre-
tation are the stable carbon isotope values
from a sample of the burials at Hurricane
Hill, which suggest substantial reliance
on C4 plants. Whether this ﬁnding repre-
sents the consumption of maize or other
C4 plants is unknown, however.

The regional data show that the wood-

land-oriented hunting strategy seen at
Cooper Lake and the Jewett Mine pre-
vailed throughout the Post Oak Savanna.
This prevalence exists in contexts dating
to the early and late parts of the Late Pre-
historic period at Lake Fork Reservoir
(Perttula 1990, part II, 30 –52), Wood-
land and Late Prehistoric contexts at
Richland/Chambers Reservoir (Bruseth
et al. 1987, 238), and Woodland and
Late Prehistoric contexts at the Gibbons
Creek Mine (Nash 1993; Rogers 1994,
120, 149). Bison bones occur in small
numbers in some of these sites, but they
are not especially frequent in contexts
dating to the late part of the Late Prehis-
toric period. Hence, the regional data do
not support diachronic changes in hunt-
ing strategies.

Greater variability is evident in the
use of plant foods across the Post Oak
Savanna. Sites at Lake Fork Reservoir in-
dicate that maize was an important sub-
sistence resource throughout the Late Pre-
historic period (Perttula 1990, part II,
30 –52), and it appears that groups who
lived in this stretch of the Sabine River
basin relied on farming far more than did
groups at Cooper Lake. Moving south-
ward to the Trinity River basin, macro-
botanical remains from contexts post-
dating the Late Archaic period point to use
of the same kinds of wild plant foods—
hardwood nuts, a variety of seeds, and tu-
bers/rhizomes—that were used at Cooper
Lake (Bruseth et al. 1987, 243). The only
tropical cultigen is maize, and it occurs in
very small quantities only in contexts dat-
ing to the last half of the Late Prehistoric
period. Hence, groups who lived in this
area clearly were predominantly hunters
and gatherers. Subsistence data from the
Gibbons Creek Mine are especially sparse,
but hardwood nutshells occur in most
sites and liliaceous bulb fragments were
recovered from a single site (Dering 1993,
1994a; Rogers 1993, 74, 174, 214; 1994,
120, 149; 1995a, 56, 153). Consistent
with the lack of cultigens at Gibbons
Creek is the low stable carbon isotope

value on human remains from a Late
Prehistoric burial at 41GM205 (Rogers
1993, D.1–D.3).

Site Functions, Settlement
Strategies, and Use Intensity

Judging from their comparably diverse
assemblages of stone tools, all of the exca-
vated sites at Cooper Lake appear to have
been used in a generally similar manner:
predominantly as residential sites of one
sort or another. None functioned primar-
ily as processing or procurement loca-
tions. It is certain that these kinds of sites
exist in the area, however, and the fact
that none have been identiﬁed probably
can be attributed to their low archeologi-
cal visibility. In fact, there are hints that a
number of chieﬂy early Late Prehistoric
sites were used in a much more restricted
fashion during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric period and that this may have
been related to a change toward more lo-
gistically organized settlement strategies.
The functional differences that can be
seen between sites at Cooper Lake appear
to have been more a matter of degree
than kind and can be best seen in the fea-
tures. For example, the Archaic compo-
nents at the Finley Fan site have only a
single kind of feature, and these compo-
nents apparently represent a relatively
short-term use as a hunter-gatherer camp
site. At the other end of the scale, the
Late Prehistoric component at Hurricane
Hill clearly represents a settlement of
hunter-gatherer horticulturists who were
sedentary, or nearly so, and the Peerless
Bottoms site can be interpreted in this
way as well. Occupying the middle
ground are the early Late Prehistoric
components at Spider Knoll, Spike,
Thomas, and Doctors Creek. These sites
have middens and numerous features and,
judging from the structural evidence at
Spider Knoll, appear to have seen re-
peated occupations of perhaps seasonal
length by hunter-gatherer horticulturists.
Some of the Woodland components
probably represent occupations similar in
nature to those of the early Late Prehis-
toric period, judging from the presence of
middens at Tick and Spike and the small
cemetery and associated features on the
Southwest rise at the Hurricane Hill site,
while others may represent less frequent
residential use (e.g., the Johns Creek site).
The excavated data from Cooper Lake

are too sparse to allow much to be said
about settlement strategies during the Ar-
chaic period. Nonetheless, low-intensity
use by hunter-gatherer groups is likely,
and this probably reﬂects low population
densities, high residential mobility, short-
duration occupations, and infrequent site
reuse. The increased intensity of use dur-
ing the Woodland period probably repre-
sents longer-term site occupations and
more frequent reuse of some sites, and
this may be traced to decreased residential
mobility and perhaps increased popula-
tions. There is no evidence for increased
logistical mobility among these hunter-
gatherer groups, however. This pattern
reached its culmination in the early part
of the Late Prehistoric period. While hor-
ticulture contributed to the resource base,
the area was still occupied by groups with
at least moderate residential mobility. A
single site, Hurricane Hill, shows evidence
for year-round (or multiseasonal) use, but
most sites probably were occupied for no
longer than a season at a time, although
they were reused frequently. Settlement
strategies changed signiﬁcantly in the lat-
ter part of the Late Prehistoric period.
Fewer sites were used for residential pur-
poses, but they were occupied by groups
who were largely sedentary. Many other
sites were used much less intensively,
probably chieﬂy for procurement/pro-
cessing tasks, and this circumstance ap-
pears to represent increased logistical
mobility over the early Late Prehistoric
period.

Most of the excavated components at
the Jewett Mine, especially those dating
to the Late Archaic and Woodland peri-
ods, also are interpreted as having been
used for residential purposes based on
their diverse stone tool assemblages, but
it is difﬁcult to compare these sites to
those at Cooper Lake because nondurable
features such as postholes and pits are
poorly preserved in the thick sands that
blanket the area. Nonetheless, these kinds
of features were not frequent at the few
sites where they might have been pre-
served (e.g., the Bottoms and Moccasin
Springs sites), and this suggests that the
Jewett Mine residential occupations were
of shorter duration (i.e., less than seasonal
length) than most of those at Cooper
Lake. Several kinds of residential sites
have been documented at the mine, how-
ever. Some were focused primarily on

plant processing and secondarily on hunt-
ing-related activities as well as a range of
maintenance activities, while at others
these activities were more balanced. These
differences probably can be attributed to
the sites having been used at different
times of the year when different resources
were available.

The Jewett Mine also has a number of
components, most dating to the early Late
Prehistoric period, that are interpreted as
procurement/processing locations based
on limited diversity in the stone tool as-
semblages. Hunting-related activities are
especially well represented at many of
these, while at others plant processing
may have been more important than
hunting. Several explanations can be of-
fered for the difference between the Jew-
ett Mine and Cooper Lake in terms of
the frequency of these kinds of compo-
nents at the excavated sites, with the most
likely one revolving around the different
kinds of depositional settings in the two
project areas (i.e., it is easier to isolate
components in the often thick sands at
Jewett). Perhaps also contributing to the
difference, though, is the fact that the
Jewett Mine sites represent a broader
range of environmental settings (e.g., a
major river valley, a major drainage di-
vide, and major and minor tributary val-
leys) than the Cooper Lake sites, all of
which are within or immediately adjacent
to a major river valley.

In sum, the Jewett Mine sites point to

a similar trajectory in changes in settle-
ment strategies, albeit with differences in
timing, such as that identiﬁed at Cooper
Lake. The few pre–Late Archaic compo-
nents at Jewett Mine suggest nonintensive
use by mobile hunter-gatherers, indicat-
ing low population densities and infre-
quent site reuse. More intensive use is
indicated for the Late Archaic and Wood-
land periods. This greater intensity of use
may mark increased population densities,
more frequent reuse of individual sites, or
longer-term occupations. The hunter-
gatherers who occupied the area still op-
erated primarily as foragers, however,
moving their residential bases frequently.
Settlement systems may have been sched-
uled on a seasonal basis, with different
activity sets (perhaps related to different
subsistence resources) represented at resi-
dential sites in riverine and upland set-
tings. During the early Late Prehistoric

12-A2946  4/13/04  12:27 PM  Page 365

POST OAK SAVANNA OF EAST-CENTR AL TEXAS / 365

period, residential activities were increas-
ingly restricted to lowland sites, while the
uplands were used mostly for hunting-re-
lated procurement/processing tasks. This
change indicates that logistical strategies
became more important, but, unlike at
Cooper Lake, there is no evidence that
this change was accompanied by in-
creased sedentism within the upper Nava-
sota River basin itself. During the late
part of the Late Prehistoric period, the
Jewett area apparently saw a return to for-
ager-oriented hunter-gatherer strategies
entailing more equable use of upland and
lowland settings. The high intensity of
use and the relatively small number of
sites suggest that individual occupations
were of longer duration and that residen-
tial mobility was lower than during the
Late Archaic and Woodland periods.

These patterns in occupational inten-
sity are illustrated by Fig. 12.16, which
plots the numbers of shaped chipped
stone tools per square meter of controlled
excavations by time period, excluding the
pre–Late Archaic components since the
data are so scanty (the ratios have been
adjusted for different time period lengths).
Shaped chipped stone tools are used in-

stead of total lithic artifact counts, as
used by Fields et al. (1991, 1993) for
both Cooper Lake and the Jewett Mine,
because of differences between the areas
in lithic procurement and reduction
strategies.

Speciﬁcally, the Jewett Mine sites have
high ratios of debitage to shaped chipped
stone tools (58:1 at Jewett versus 21:1 at
Cooper Lake, using only the sites exca-
vated by Prewitt and Associates, Inc., to
eliminate recovery and analysis biases),
apparently because of the much more
common use of ﬁne-grained materials
(67 percent of the debitage at Jewett is of
ﬁne-grained chert, as opposed to 3 per-
cent at Cooper Lake [these ﬁgures are site
means rather than total percentages]) and
the staged reduction of bifaces imported
from central Texas at Jewett (as indicated
by the relatively numerous biface caches
there). This situation is reﬂected not only
by high debitage frequencies at the Jewett
Mine sites but also by the fact that more
of the debitage from Jewett is small and
entirely decorticate (84 percent of the
debitage at Jewett is smaller than 21 mm
and 71 percent is entirely decorticate,
while the ﬁgures for Cooper Lake are

63 and 49 percent [these ﬁgures are site
means rather than total percentages]).
Hence, including debitage in the density
calculations would unfairly inﬂate the val-
ues for the Jewett sites.

Fig. 12.16 shows that both areas start
out with a very low intensity of use dur-
ing the Late Archaic period. The patterns
for the two areas diverge after this, how-
ever. At Cooper Lake, use intensity in-
creased steeply through the Woodland
and early Late Prehistoric periods, fol-
lowed by a decrease in the later part of
the Late Prehistoric period. This trend
points to increasingly frequent site reuse
and probably longer individual occupa-
tions, followed by less intensive residen-
tial use during the late Late Prehistoric
period.

The Jewett Mine sites show a much
more gradual increase in use intensity
through the early part of the Late Prehis-
toric period, consistent with the idea that
site occupations were not as frequent or
as long lived as at Cooper Lake and that
population densities may have been lower.
As noted above, the evidence indicates
that for the later part of this interval, this
increase in use intensity may have been
related to increased logistical use and less
residential use. A much steeper increase
in intensity is indicated for the late part
of the Late Prehistoric period, perhaps in-
dicating rough (although still lower over-
all) comparability with the early Late Pre-
historic period at Cooper Lake. The fact
that the ratios for the two late compo-
nents at Jewett are higher than those for
the single late component at Cooper
Lake is intriguing given that the latter
appears to represent a single-component
occupation by largely sedentary hunter-
gatherer horticulturists, while the former
are more likely to represent repeated,
shorter-term residential occupations by
hunter-gatherers. Assuming it is not a
function of the small number of sites in-
volved, this difference may reﬂect the
more logistical nature of the late Late Pre-
historic settlement strategies at Cooper
Lake (i.e., more frequent performance of
procurement/processing tasks away from
residential sites, resulting in decreased
tool densities).

Between Cooper Lake and the Jewett

Mine, it appears that most of the exca-
vated sites at Lake Fork Reservoir served
residential functions, at least during the

12-A2946  4/13/04  12:27 PM  Page 366

366 / EASTERN AND NORTHERN TEXAS

Late Prehistoric period. This is most
clearly the case at the Hines and Spoon-
bill sites, where posthole patterns repre-
senting houses were found, but many
other sites (e.g., Taddlock, Steck, Gil-
breath, Grimes, Killebrew, Osborn, and
Sandhill) have middens and clearly were
used for more than procurement/process-
ing activities (Bruseth and Perttula 1981).
Further, Perttula (1994a) lists a number
of known or potential mound sites in this
stretch of the Sabine River basin, and it
is clear that this part of the Post Oak Sa-
vanna was used intensively by sedentary
farmers during most if not all of the Late
Prehistoric period.

Farther south, the data suggest that
most of the excavated sites at Richland/
Chambers Reservoir also were used for
residential purposes during the Late Pre-
historic period (Bruseth et. al 1987, 241,
244, 246), although there are some sites
in the area (e.g., the streamside concen-
trations of mussel shells and artifacts at
41FT193 and 41NV139) that probably
were used in a more limited fashion. The
house patterns at the Bird Point Island
site point to occupations of some duration
by hunter-gatherers during the ﬁrst half
of the period, while other components
that are contemporaneous, slightly earlier,
or later (e.g., at Bird Point Island, Adams
Ranch, Irvine, and Little Cedar Creek)
have middens and numerous features sug-
gesting intensive use but no houses. These
components may represent occupations
that were seasonal in length and compa-
rable to most of the early Late Prehistoric
components at Cooper Lake. Shorter-
term but still residential occupations may
be represented by the Late Archaic–
Woodland components at sites such as
Bird Point Island, Adams Ranch, and
41FT200, judging from the artifact as-
semblages and the presence of large de-
pressions interpreted as roasting ovens
associated with hunter-gatherer band
coalescence at the ﬁrst two of these sites
(Bruseth et. al 1987, 225, 237).

At the Gibbons Creek Mine in the
southern Navasota River basin, the exca-
vated sites appear similar to most of those
at the Jewett Mine in that they generally
lack middens (except at 41GM281), they
have numerous burned rock features but
few other features, and they contain gen-
eralized (rather than specialized) stone
tool assemblages (Rogers 1993, 1994,

1995a). Based on these similarities, it is
possible that the Gibbons Creek sites,
dating mostly to the Woodland and Late
Prehistoric periods, represent short-term
residential occupations by hunter-gather-
ers. On the other hand, there are two
pieces of evidence suggesting that some of
these sites may have functioned more as
procurement/processing locations than
as residential camp sites. Speciﬁcally, the
sites at the Gibbons Creek Mine have
much lower frequencies of shaped chipped
stone tools (the overall ratio of debitage
to shaped chipped stone tools is 106:1)
than do the sites at the Jewett Mine or
Cooper Lake (58:1 and 21:1, respec-
tively), perhaps implying that the occu-
pations were especially short lived. Sec-
ondly, the Gibbons Creek sites have
greater quantities of burned rocks (the
overall ratio of burned rock weight to
shaped chipped stone tools is 2.2:1, ex-
cluding 41GM166, 41GM281, and
41GM282, for which burned rocks are
not quantiﬁed in the report) than the
Jewett Mine or Cooper Lake sites (1.3:1
and 0.3:1, respectively), suggesting that
certain kinds of processing activities were
quite important.

Sociocultural Interaction

It is difﬁcult to address the topic of so-

ciocultural interaction with much preci-
sion because of the complex relationships
between trade, other kinds of interaction
between groups, and the various kinds of
mobility (i.e., residential versus logistical,
intraregional versus extraregional). None-
theless, there are some clear patterns.

First, truly exotic items are universally

scarce. For example, obsidian ﬂakes (at
Cooper Lake and the Jewett Mine), ga-
lena (at Cooper Lake, Jewett Mine, and
Gibbons Creek Mine), and marine shell
beads (at Cooper Lake) have been recov-
ered, but they are so few in number that
it is clear that they represent down-the-
line exchange rather than any substantial
involvement in especially far-ﬂung trade
networks. Tools and ﬂakes of chert from
the Ozark Mountains apparently occur
in fair numbers at Lake Fork Reservoir
(Perttula 1984, 140), but these materials
have not been identiﬁed in other project
areas. (It is likely that these Ozark cherts
were actually from gravel aggregates in
Ouachita Mountain sources.)

The distributions of the typed projec-

tile points, as presented by Elton R. Pre-
witt (1995), convey some information
about interaction, but they must be used
with caution since projectile point styles
seldom correlate speciﬁcally with social
groups. Nonetheless, the fact that many
of the most common types in the Post
Oak Savanna (e.g., Gary, Dawson, Kent,
Yarbrough, Alba, Catahoula, Colbert, Fri-
ley, and Steiner) occur widely across the
eastern third of Texas but not farther west
indicates that there was sufﬁcient interac-
tion among groups who lived in the east-
ern part of the state to lead to some de-
gree of uniformity in dart and arrow
point styles. The only major types that
have more westerly distributions are
Perdiz and Scallorn. While both of these
types could represent increased interac-
tion with groups who lived to the west
during parts of the Late Prehistoric pe-
riod, the case is stronger for Perdiz (i.e.,
the second half of the Late Prehistoric pe-
riod) than for Scallorn given the hetero-
geneity evident in this latter type.

Interestingly, there are a few projectile

point types, most of them minor, that
point to differences between the northern
and southern parts of the Post Oak Sa-
vanna and suggest relatively localized in-
teraction spheres. For example, the Ar-
chaic dart point types Trinity and Yantis
occur mostly in the north and suggest ties
between the Post Oak Savanna and areas
to the east, while Archaic types Axtell and
Hoxie have restricted distributions to the
south and extending westward to central
Texas. Later dart point styles Godley and
Neches River oletha also are relatively
common south and west of the Trinity
River. Among the arrow points, triangu-
lar types such as Turney, Talco, and Maud
occur in the north but not the south, as
do occasional examples of types such as
Homan, Keota, Huffaker, and Washita.
The triangular types securely link this
part of the Post Oak Savanna to north-
eastern Texas proper, while the latter
types indicate interaction with groups liv-
ing north of the Red River and west onto
the Plains.

The ceramics also point to some clear

differences between the northern and
southern parts of the Post Oak Savanna.
The Woodland-age sandy-paste ceramic
tradition that is characteristic of the south-
ern part of east Texas is not represented at
all at Cooper Lake, and the pottery dat-

Mine. Otherwise, the ceramics clearly re-
late to Caddoan wares, with most of the
identiﬁed types (e.g., Maydelle Incised,
Poyner Engraved, and Weches Fingernail
Impressed) indicating contact with groups
in the Neches River drainage east of the
Trinity. The ceramics from most of the
excavated sites at the Gibbons Creek
Mine (Rogers 1993, 102, 160 –73, 210 –
12; 1994, 116; 1995a, 108 –23, 168 –71)
are the sandy-paste ware that occurs
throughout southeastern Texas, ﬁrst in
Woodland contexts and then in some
Late Prehistoric contexts (e.g., on the up-
per coast). Two sites (41GM281 and
41GM282) also have sizable samples of
pottery tempered with grog or bone.
Some of these probably are related to the
Late Prehistoric San Jacinto ware that oc-
curs on the upper coast to the east and
southeast, while small numbers of sherds
bear designs similar to those seen on Cad-
doan pottery to the northeast.

The ﬁnal line of evidence concerning
interaction deals with lithic raw material
procurement and the use of nonlocal
sources. Fig. 12.17 shows that Cooper
Lake and the Jewett Mine are dramati-

cally different in this respect, and the
evidence indicates that the relationships
between the use of nonlocal lithics and
interaction (or maybe mobility) are not
always simple. Cooper Lake shows a
simple decrease through time in the use
of nonlocal materials, although they were
not frequent during any time period.
Most of the identiﬁed specimens proba-
bly represent gravels from the Red River,
and the data could suggest an overall de-
crease in interaction with groups living to
the north. This theory is not supported
by the ceramic evidence, however, and it
is equally plausible that the graph in
Fig. 12.17 reﬂects decreased demand for
higher quality materials rather than de-
creased interaction. In any case, the
lithics point to greater use of materials
from the Red River than from central
Texas. They do not say much about inter-
action to the west, east, or south, how-
ever, since these areas do not contain
lithic materials that are likely to have
been imported or that could be distin-
guished readily from the local Cooper
Lake materials. The nonlocal items that
were imported were brought in as ﬁnished

Fig. 12.17. Graph of percentage of shaped chipped stone tools of nonlocal materials by time
period for Cooper Lake and the Jewett Mine. The graph includes only components assignable
to single periods and excludes the Late Prehistoric component at the Hurricane Hill site
(41HP106) because of its anomalously high values (between 3 and 7 percent); where the per-
centages are derived from multiple components, the symbols indicate means, while the bars
show ranges.

ing to the early part of the Late Prehis-
toric period in the upper Sulphur River
basin shows clear ties to the Caddoan area
to the east and north, based on the pre-
dominance of Crockett Curvilinear-
Incised/Pennington Punctated-Incised
among the decorated wares, the consis-
tent occurrence of Williams Plain pottery,
and the occasional occurrence of Spiro
Engraved ceramics as well as sherds as-
signable to Coles Creek types. The pot-
tery from the single excavated late Late
Prehistoric site also indicates strong con-
nections both northward to the Red River
and eastward to the Cypress Creek basin,
judging from the presence of types such
as Avery Engraved, Ripley Engraved, Tay-
lor or Wilder Engraved, McKinney Plain,
and Emory Punctated-Incised. This late
collection also contains sherds represent-
ing a few globular jars that are more rem-
iniscent of Plains vessel forms than those
found in this part of the Caddoan area,
however, and this circumstance points to
westward or northwestward contacts.

At the Jewett Mine, most of the pre-
sumably early pottery is the sandy-paste
ware typical of the southern part of east
Texas, while a few shell-tempered sherds
and a few sherds with kaolin pastes hint
at local experimentation with ceramic
manufacture. The pottery from early Late
Prehistoric contexts indicates interaction
with Caddoan groups to the east, based
on the small numbers of sherds typable as
Holly Fine Engraved and Weches Finger-
nail Impressed. The later pottery, with
its high incidence of brushing and a few
sherds typable as Maydelle Incised, Kil-
lough Pinched, Poyner Engraved, and
Patton Engraved, also indicates ties to
Caddoan groups living east of the Trinity
River, speciﬁcally to Hasinai Caddo
groups in the Neches and Angelina River
basins.

Not far south of Cooper Lake, Cad-

doan pottery is especially abundant at
Lake Fork Reservoir, and most of the
types identiﬁed (e.g., Canton Incised,
Sanders Engraved, Ripley Engraved, and
McKinney Plain) point north to the Red
River or east toward the Cypress Creek
basin (Bruseth and Perttula 1981, 77–
91). Moving farther south to Richland/
Chambers Reservoir, sandy-paste pottery
apparently is present, as are a few argu-
ably early shell-tempered sherds that may
relate to similar ceramics at the Jewett

tools, and the very small quantities of
debitage of these materials reﬂect tool re-
furbishing rather than manufacture.

A very different pattern is evident at
the Jewett Mine. Nonlocal lithics, mostly
from central Texas, were used commonly
during all time periods but especially dur-
ing the Late Archaic period and the late
part of the Late Prehistoric period. This
evidence certainly indicates substantial in-
teraction with groups who lived west of
the Blackland Prairie, and the fact that
the use of nonlocal lithics did not change
much over time is intriguing in view of
the other changes that occurred, appar-
ently suggesting that lithic raw material
procurement strategies were largely sepa-
rate from the strategies that conditioned
settlement patterns. An explanation for
this circumstance can be found in the
tools and debitage made of these materi-
als and the occasional caches of nonlocal
lithics. Speciﬁcally, the data indicate that
these materials were brought into the
Jewett Mine area as large biface and uni-
face blanks, which were then reduced
further. Sometimes they were made into
tools that were used in the Jewett area,
and sometimes the tools or blanks were
exported for use elsewhere. This scenario
accounts for the extreme intersite vari-
ability in the percentages of nonlocal
lithics shown in Fig. 12.17, since some
sites saw more reduction of imported
lithics while use of tools of these materials
was more common at other sites. This
pattern indicates that the Jewett area
served as a conduit for the transport of
central Texas materials into the eastern
part of the state for much of the Holo-
cene, which is not surprising given its lo-
cation at the western edge of the wood-
lands and not far east of numerous source
areas for abundant high-quality lithics.
Elsewhere in the Post Oak Savanna,
lithics from central Texas occur in small
numbers at the Gibbons Creek Mine, but
the vast majority of the tools in the Gib-
bons Creek sites are made of local materi-
als (Robert Rogers 1995, personal com-
munication). As at Cooper Lake, it is
hard to know if this presence of tools
made from local materials relates to lim-
ited sociocultural interaction or little de-
mand for central Texas lithics. The data
from Richland/Chambers Reservoir sug-
gest a decrease in the use of chert over
time, reﬂecting decreased mobility west-

ward across the Blackland Prairie and de-
creased territory sizes (McGregor 1987,
1993), but it is unknown how decreasing
mobility and territory size relate to
changes in interaction. At Lake Fork Res-
ervoir, nonlocal lithics from a variety of
sources (central Texas, the Ouachita and
Arbuckle Mountains via the Red River,
and Ozark Mountains gravels) are pres-
ent, and there are changes through time
in the frequencies of these materials (Pert-
tula 1984). It is difﬁcult to factor out the
effects of interaction and mobility, how-
ever. In sum, there is much variability
across the Post Oak Savanna in the use of
lithics obtained from nonlocal sources,
and it is clear that the frequency of im-
ported lithics is not always a good indica-
tor of sociocultural interaction. On a
gross level, however, it is noteworthy
that most of the nonlocal materials from
Cooper Lake and Lake Fork Reservoir in
the northern part of the region are from
the Red River, while to the south most
of the nonlocal materials were derived
from central Texas.

Summary

Because the archeological record of the

Post Oak Savanna dates mostly to the
Late Holocene, it is difﬁcult to say much
about the pre–Late Archaic cultures of
the region. In fact, for much of the west-
ern edge of east Texas, even Late Archaic
components are so infrequent that it is
hard to discern coherent patterns in the
archeological data. Nonetheless, it is clear
that the region was used by hunter-gath-
erers during this time, and the evidence
from Cooper Lake and especially the Jew-
ett Mine indicates that these groups oper-
ated largely as foragers, that is, moving
their residential bases frequently to take
advantage of temporal and spatial changes
in resource availability. Population densi-
ties probably were low, and group terri-
tories may have been relatively uncon-
strained. Large territories and widespread
interaction may account for the extensive
distributions of the most common dart
point types, but there are a few types with
restricted distributions suggesting distinct
localized interaction spheres in the north-
ern and southern parts of the region. This
north-south distinction is also evident in
the importation of nonlocal lithics, with
materials from the north being more

common in the Sulphur and Sabine ba-
sins and central Texas materials being
more frequent in the Trinity and Nava-
sota basins.

While it sometimes has proven difﬁ-
cult to isolate components dating to the
Woodland period, the data from Cooper
Lake, Richland/Chambers Reservoir, the
Jewett Mine, and the Gibbons Creek
Mine suggest that a forager-oriented
hunter-gatherer settlement strategy per-
sisted throughout this period. Squash re-
mains were found at one Woodland site
at Cooper Lake, but there is no other evi-
dence that horticulture contributed to the
subsistence base. Further, there is no in-
dication of sedentism. It does appear,
however, that the Post Oak Savanna was
used more intensively during this time
than before. This greater use intensity
likely reﬂects increases in populations,
more frequent reoccupation of favored
sites, and occupations of longer duration
than during the Archaic period. Ceramic
technology was introduced in parts of
the region during this interval (at, e.g.,
Richland/Chambers Reservoir, Gibbons
Creek Mine, and maybe Jewett Mine),
but this technological change was not
universal and there is no evidence that it
was accompanied by signiﬁcant changes
in lifeways. Nonetheless, the occurrence
of sandy-paste pottery only in the south-
ern part of the region and the apparent
differences in the timing of this innova-
tion indicate that the north-south distinc-
tion noted above for the Archaic period
continued into the Woodland period.
That this was the case is also indicated by
the patterns in the use of nonlocal lithics.
The settlement strategies of the Native

Americans who occupied the Post Oak
Savanna changed during the Late Prehis-
toric period, and intraregional variability
became even more pronounced during
this time. There is no doubt that these
changes were related in part to the devel-
opment of the Caddo culture in north-
eastern Texas proper and adjacent parts
of Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana.
This change in settlement strategy was
most conspicuously the case in the part
of the Post Oak Savanna traversed by the
Sabine River, as this area was occupied
throughout the period by sedentary Cad-
doan farmers.

POST OAK SAVANNA OF EAST-CENTR AL TEXAS / 369

Cooper Lake area to the north in an in-
tensive fashion during the Late Prehis-
toric period, with the ﬁrst half of the pe-
riod being marked by residential mobility
and the latter half by increased sedentism
and increased logistical use but decreased
population densities. The Richland/
Chambers Reservoir area saw a similar
trajectory involving intensive use during
the early half of the period and decreased
population densities in the latter half. At
Richland/Chambers Reservoir, however,
the greatest evidence for sedentism, albeit
occasional (i.e., it is not the case at all
sites) and not associated with horticul-
ture, was during the early Late Prehistoric
period, with more forager-oriented, resi-
dentially mobile systems entailing limited
horticulture being the case after that. In
both of these areas, the decreased inten-
sity of use during the late part of the pe-
riod may have been related to population
aggregations elsewhere in the Post Oak
Savanna or, perhaps more likely, in the
Caddoan area itself.

Evidence for horticulture or any de-
gree of sedentism at all is lacking from
the two southernmost project areas con-
sidered here: the Jewett Mine and the
Gibbons Creek Mine. At the former,
the settlement strategies of local hunter-
gatherer groups changed during the early
Late Prehistoric period such that residen-
tial occupations were restricted to the
Navasota River valley while the uplands
to the east were used mostly for hunting-
related activities. This change may have
been prompted by pressures from Cad-
doan groups to the east, but the lack of
data from the part of the Trinity River
basin east of the Jewett Mine prevents se-
rious evaluation of this hypothesis. The
late part of the Late Prehistoric period
saw another change in how Native Ameri-
cans used the area, but there are ambigui-
ties about how this change should be in-
terpreted. It may be that the region was
occupied by local forager-oriented hunter-
gatherers who interacted regularly with

Caddoan groups to the east, or it may be
that the area was used mostly by the Cad-
dos on hunting trips or other kinds of
forays to the west. It is harder to recon-
struct settlement strategies at the Gibbons
Creek Mine, although the most recent
work there does hint at changes during
the late part of the Late Prehistoric period
that may parallel those at the Jewett Mine.
In any case, it is clear that the lower
Navasota Basin was occupied by mobile
hunter-gatherers throughout the Late Pre-
historic period.

The kinds of ceramics and projectile

points and the types of nonlocal lithic
materials from Late Prehistoric contexts
all point to continued distinctions be-
tween the northern and southern parts of
the Post Oak Savanna, and these proba-
bly mark increasingly localized develop-
ments. In the north, the strongest ties
were with groups living to the east in
northeastern Texas proper and to the
north along the Red River and beyond.
This area was not homogeneous cultur-
ally, however. Groups living in the Sabine
basin were fully involved in the Caddo
culture, while those farther north in the
Sulphur basin were only marginally so.
To the south, especially in the Navasota
basin, Caddoan lifeways never took hold,
but it is clear that there was substantial
interaction with Caddoan groups to the
east. Further, continued contact with
central Texas is reﬂected in the use of
nonlocal lithics, and some of the ceramics
from the Gibbons Creek Mine point to-
ward the upper coast.

On one level, the intraregional vari-
ability that characterized the Post Oak Sa-
vanna during the Late Prehistoric period
can be ascribed to varying degrees of inte-
gration into the Caddoan culture, a situa-
tion that is not surprising given the pe-
ripheral location of the region relative to
the Caddo heartland. This explanation is
not wholly satisfactory, however. It is
clear that some of this variability had its
roots in distinctions dating to the Archaic

period, and it probably can be explained
best as the result of overlap between per-
sistent local variations on common adap-
tive strategies, differences in interaction
spheres, variability in the adoption of
new technologies and subsistence prac-
tices, and differences in the acceptance of
new ideologies among groups who had
occupied the woodlands of eastern Texas
for millennia. Of course, this issue per-
tains to an area much larger than the Post
Oak Savanna, emphasizing the critical
need for more comparative studies that
integrate archeological data between re-
gions rather than simply within them.

The Prehistoric and Caddoan Archeology of the
Northeastern Texas Pineywoods

Timothy K. Perttula

This chapter considers the diverse charac-
ter of the prehistoric and Caddoan arche-
ological record in the Pineywoods of
northeastern Texas. This area is essentially
bounded by the broad Red River and its
tributaries to the north, the interdigitat-
ing woodlands and prairies bisected by
the Trinity River drainage on the west,
the stately longleaf pines and impenetra-
ble swamps along the Neches and An-
gelina Rivers, and the Arkansas and Loui-
siana state lines (an arbitrary boundary to
be sure). Native Americans settled in the
region some twelve thousand years or
more ago and ranged through its forests,
grasslands, and broad ﬂoodplains and
wetlands as mobile hunter-gatherers.
About two thousand years ago, at the on-
set of the Woodland period, these Native
Americans (whom we consider ancestral
to the Caddo peoples) began to settle
down in recognizable territories, to make
better use of native seeds and tropical
cultigens as well as the bountiful nut mast
and white-tailed deer, and to practice the
art of ceramics as they adopted new food-
processing technologies.

From this milieu developed the vi-
brant and sophisticated prehistoric Caddo
culture about a.d. 800. The prehistoric
Caddos were prosperous horticulturists
and traders, lived in dispersed sedentary
hamlets and villages along well-watered
streams, and built temples and burial
mounds to mark the ceremonial and reli-
gious places sacred to important priests

and chiefs across the cultural landscape.
The Caddos remained in parts of north-
eastern Texas until as late as 1842, coop-
eratively living and interacting with the
European and American colonizers of
their land until they moved, or were re-
moved, to the Brazos River valley in the
1840s and 1850s (see Carter 1995 and
F. Smith 1996 for excellent summaries
of the nineteenth-century history and tra-
vails of the Caddo peoples) and then to
Oklahoma in 1859.

The main purpose of this chapter is to
summarize the current state of knowledge
concerning the prehistoric and early his-
toric archeological record of the Piney-
woods, while also discussing relevant sites
in the adjoining Post Oak Savanna of
northeast Texas (Fig. 13.1). First, I con-
sider the natural setting of the area and
the history of archeological investigations
in the region and then turn to a succinct
but broad presentation of the native his-
tory of the region. Much attention is
given to the Late Caddoan period (ca.
a.d. 1400 –1680) archeological record (as
deﬁned by Story 1990), particularly what
archeologists working in the Sabine River
and Big Cypress Creek basins have come
to call the Titus phase. I focus on the Ti-
tus phase because our knowledge of this
span of Caddo prehistory is reasonably
well developed (e.g., Perttula 1992a,
1998c; Perttula and Nelson 1998; Thur-
mond 1985, 1990a; R. Turner 1978,
1992) and because this focus provides the

370

best opportunity to understand what pre-
historic Caddo groups in east Texas were
like before, and immediately after, Euro-
peans invaded the area (Perttula 1998c).
I also consider the archeology of other
Late Caddoan groups that lived along
Red River and in deep east Texas.

Natural Setting

Northeastern Texas has three main bi-
otic communities: the Post Oak Savanna
or Oak Woodlands, the Blackland Prairie,
and the Pineywoods (Diamond et al.
1987). The area of interest discussed
herein lies principally within the modern
distribution of the Pineywoods and the
Post Oak Savanna, with a small portion
of the Blackland Prairie at the western
margins of the region (Fig. 13.2).

The Post Oak Savanna is a narrow
southwest-northeast trending woodland
belt that marks a natural transition zone
or ecotone between the more xeric Black-
land Prairie to the west and the more
mesic Pineywoods to the east (Küchler
1964). Both the Post Oak Savanna and
the Pineywoods have medium-tall to tall
broadleaf deciduous forests, and shortleaf
and loblolly pines are common in the
Pineywoods on upland ﬁne sandy loam
soils with adequate moisture. Small areas
of tallgrass prairie may be present in both

PREHISTORIC AND CADDOAN ARCHEOLOGY OF THE PINEYWOODS / 371

Sabine, Cypress, Neches, and Angelina
drainages contain a diverse hardwood and
swamp forest, with natural levees, point
bar deposits, old stream channels, oxbow
lakes, and backwater swamps.

The climate of the region is humid,
with a mean annual precipitation of at
least 120 cm; periods of maximum rain-
fall occur in the spring and fall seasons.
Droughts are not uncommon, and den-
drochronological analyses of tree rings
for the last 1,000 years suggest that there
were numerous wet and dry spells during
that era (Stahle and Cleaveland 1994,
1995). Dry conditions and the worst
droughts occurred in the late a.d. 1200s,
in the mid-1400s and 1600s, and then
again in the mid-1700s (Stahle and
Cleaveland 1995, ﬁg. 4). The period
between a.d. 1549 and 1577 has been
suggested to have been the worst June
drought in the past 450 years (Stahle
et al. 1985). More favorable crop growing
conditions probably occurred during the
intervening years, especially between ca.
a.d. 1390 and 1440, then in the late part
of the sixteenth century and early seven-
teenth century, and ﬁnally, at the begin-
ning of the eighteenth century, when
Spanish and French colonists settled
among the Caddo peoples in earnest.
These climatic perturbations presumably
affected the predictability and success of
the maize harvests during the Caddoan oc-
cupation of the Pineywoods and Post Oak
Savanna. Certainly similar perturbations
in the Holocene also affected the range,
distribution, and abundance of naturally
occurring plants and animals during the
long prehistoric Native American settle-
ment of northeastern Texas (see M. Col-
lins and Bousman 1993, 57–59; Ferring
1994b). How these droughts affected the
ﬂow of the numerous upland springs so
important as water sources to the Caddos
in the Pineywoods is unknown.

The Holocene paleoenvironmental
record for northeastern Texas is not par-
ticularly well understood, although paleo-
environmental data from Prairie-Savanna
Texas pollen cores and stable carbon iso-
topes have proved useful to Ross C. Fields
and Steve Tomka (1993) in modeling
Paleoindian and Archaic mobility strate-
gies in the northeast Texas archeological
region. A 14,000-year stable isotopic
record from the Aubrey site in the Trinity
River basin in north Texas documents

signiﬁcant changing climatic conditions,
with wetter (and perhaps slightly cooler)
or more humid climates from ca. 11,000
to 7500 years b.p., then again between
4000 and 2000 b.p., and after 1,000 years
ago (Humphrey and Ferring 1994, ﬁg. 8).
It was drier than today between 7,500
and 4,000 years ago and between about
2,000 and 1,000 years ago. It is interest-
ing that fossil vertebrate, pollen, and
stable isotope data from central Texas
and the Edwards Plateau tell a somewhat
different story, highlighting two dry cli-

matic peaks between ca. 7000 and 3000/
2500 b.p. and after 1,000 years ago (see,
e.g., Toomey et al. 1993). While these
presumed climatic changes have implica-
tions for the relative position of the prai-
rie-forest border, the possible presence or
absence of bison, and the natural resource
potential of the Pineywoods and Post Oak
Savanna, it remains to be determined how
these broad environmental changes actu-
ally are related to the changing character
of the archeological record from north-
eastern Texas.

Since then, most of the information
about the Paleoindian, Archaic, Wood-
land, and Caddoan archeological record
in the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna
of east Texas comes from a disparate array
of privately funded archeological research,
including: (1) avocational archeological
investigations and Texas Archeological
Society ﬁeld schools (see Corbin and Hart
1998; Jelks 1967; Middlebrook 1994,

Texas at Austin (Fields 1979; Story 1981,
1982, 1995, 1997) and Stephen F. Austin
State University ﬁeld schools in archeol-
ogy (see Corbin and Hart 1998). There
has also been extensive professional arche-
ological work in a number of state- and
federally funded or permitted reservoirs
in the Sabine, Sulphur (see also Fields,
chapter 12, this volume), Neches, and
Big Cypress drainage basins (K. Anderson
1972; K. Anderson et al. 1974; Bruseth

et al. 1994; Sherman et al. 1997), and the
Red River Army Depot/Lone Star Army
Ammunition Plant in Bowie County
(Cliff and Peter 1994b). Recently, there
has been archeological research associated
with the development of a federal wildlife
management area in the middle and lower
Sulphur River basin (Cliff et al. 1996a,
1996b; Largent et al. 1997). There have
also been archeological efforts associated
with levee and realignment work along
the Red River in and around the Texar-
kana area (Cliff et al. 1997; D. Kelley and
Coxe 1998; D. Kelley and Guccione

History of Investigations

Archeological research in northeastern
Texas has a lengthy history that has been
thoroughly discussed, particularly in
Story (1990), Thurmond (1990a), Guy
(1990), and Perttula (1992a). Substantial
archeological investigations began with
the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sci-
ences expedition in 1911 along the Red
River—mostly in northwestern Louisiana
and southwestern Arkansas (Schambach
1983; D. Kelley 1997)—but Clarence

Moore (1912) did record several impor-
tant Caddo mound sites, and he con-
ducted excavations at the Moore/Higgin-
botham site (3MI3/30), situated a few
miles east of the Texas state line (D. Kel-
ley and Coxe 1998).

Much of our knowledge of the prehis-
toric use of the region is primarily based
on the 1930s excavations by the Univer-
sity of Texas at aboriginal sites and ceme-
teries (e.g., A. Jackson 1933, 1934; Pearce
1932a, 1932b) throughout the region,
and then extensive late 1930s to early

of the numerous pot hunters and relic
collectors in northeastern Texas (Nelson
and Perttula 1997; Perttula and Nelson
1999). Most of the larger Caddoan ceme-
teries and habitation sites in the region
(including those on federal lands) have
been located and dug by pot hunters
during the last ﬁfteen years of the twenti-
eth century (Perttula 1992a, 1992b), al-
though site looting and vandalism has
been a persistent problem in the region
since the early 1900s (Perttula 1993b,
24 –25). Very little, if any, reliable arche-
ological data from pot hunter digs have
been accessible to the professional archeo-
logical community. The indiscriminate
collecting of lithics and ceramics from
sites exposed along the shorelines of fed-
eral- and state-maintained reservoirs in
the region has also unfortunately de-
stroyed many prehistoric Caddoan arche-
ological sites as well as much useful arche-
ological information.

The Northeast Texas
Pineywoods and Post Oak
Savanna Archeological Record

The Native American settlement of
the Post Oak Savanna and Pineywoods of
northeastern Texas is a story that began
more than eleven thousand years ago, and
“is long, complex, and endlessly fascinat-
ing” (Schambach 1993, 1). From the
archeological record of this region, one
may grasp bits and pieces of the tale: the
mobile Paleoindian and Archaic foragers;
the long-distance trade and exchange of
goods (e.g., lithic raw materials); the de-
velopment of sedentary communities of
foragers and possibly pre-maize cultigen
users (see, e.g., G. J. Fritz 1994); the
adoption of ceramics and the bow and ar-
row; the development of complex Cad-
doan horticultural and agricultural socie-
ties (Perttula 1996); the use of earthen
mounds; and the seemingly rapid aban-
donment of much of the region in the sev-
enteenth and eighteenth centuries. This
abandonment was due in large measure
to the effects of European-introduced dis-
eases as well as the European colonization
of traditional Caddoan territory, followed
by the permanent expulsion of Caddo
groups. Many of the archeological details
of these events and developments are well
known (see especially Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993, 69 –187; Story 1990,
163 –366; Thurmond 1988a, 1990a).

Paleoindian and Archaic Periods

For the period prior to about seven
thousand to eight thousand years ago, the
northeastern Texas archeological record
primarily consists of surﬁcial, mixed, or
isolated ﬁnds of diagnostic projectile
points (see L. Johnson 1989; Story 1990)
based on comparisons with well-dated
and stratiﬁed sites to the east and west of
the region (see D. Anderson et al. 1996,
15; Bousman et al., chapter 2, this vol-
ume; M. Collins, chapter 3, this volume).
At the Forrest Murphey site (41MR62),
for example, Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
and other lanceolate projectile point
forms and tools were found in several dis-
crete concentrations on a high terrace
above Big Cypress Creek (Fig. 13.3); fau-
nal remains from extinct elephants were
also recovered in apparent association
(Story 1990), which is rather rare (see
Meltzer and Bever 1995). The Delta
Bone Quarry 5 (41DT86) on the North
Sulphur River had a buried hearth and
an antler tool (Slaughter and Hoover
1963, 1965), and charcoal from the
hearth has a calibrated 1-sigma age of
9170 –8082 b.c., broadly contempora-
neous with Clovis, Folsom, and Dalton
complexes in the region.

Undoubtedly other discrete archeolog-
ical components are present in the region
(as shown by the buried Finley Fan site
occupied as early as 6400 years b.p. [Ga-
dus et al. 1992] and the spatially discrete
Late Paleoindian John Pearce site in the
Red River basin [see Fig. 13.3] in north-
western Louisiana [Webb et al. 1971]),
but they have proven to be quite difﬁcult
to deﬁne and recognize. For example, a
provocative but poorly known Paleo-
indian site has been reported by avoca-
tional archeologists in deep sand deposits
on the Neches River where it had been
exposed by Lake Palestine shoreline ero-
sion. Thirty-ﬁve Paleoindian lanceolates,
primarily Dalton and Scottsbluff forms,
projectile point preforms, drills, scrapers,
and channel ﬂakes have been found there,
with most of the tools manufactured us-
ing cherts from the Edwards Plateau of
central Texas and cherts and quartzites
from the Ouachita Mountains (Perttula
1989a). The site also contains a Folsom
point, two channel ﬂakes, and a Folsom
preform of Alibates agatized dolomite.
In another case, Dalton and early side-
notched (Big Sandy?) points, knives,
scrapers, bone tools (antler ﬂakers), and

cut bone (some fossilized) have been doc-
umented from blue clay deposits buried
in a Red River gravel bar north of Shreve-
port, Louisiana (Claude McCrocklin
1994, personal communication.

Paleoindian materials have been recov-
ered at a number of archeological sites in
the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna of
northeastern Texas (see Bousman et al.,
chapter 2, this volume). The early Paleo-
indian (ca. 11,500 –9500 years b.p., based
on uncalibrated dates and age estimates)
archeological materials include Clovis and
Folsom ﬂuted lanceolate points, com-
monly manufactured on high-quality non-
local lithic raw materials, along with scrap-
ing tools (Story 1990, table 44). Unﬂuted
lanceolates—usually resharpened and
beveled— dominate the Late Paleoindian
period (ca. 9500 –8000 b.p.) material cul-
ture record in the region, including Dal-
ton (L. Johnson 1989, ﬁg. 7; Wyckoff
and Bartlett 1995), San Patrice, and
Scottsbluff points that are concentrated in
northeastern Texas and locales to the east
(see, e.g., J. W. Saunders and Allen 1997,
ﬁg. 2), as well as early side-notched points
and Albany beveled bifaces or knives (see
L. Johnson 1989, ﬁg. 13; Webb et al.
1971), Quince-style scrapers, end and
side scrapers, denticulates, burins, and bi-
facial adzes. San Patrice projectile points
and associated tools are typically manu-
factured on local raw materials ( J. W.
Saunders and Allen 1997, 3; Webb et al.
1971). However, one unrecorded Paleo-
indian site in Gregg County, Texas, con-
tains an abundance of large early side-
notched points made from novaculite,
along with a Dalton point of Ouachita
Mountains chert and a single San Pa-
trice lanceolate on a local raw material
(Fig. 13.4).

The distributions of Paleoindian arti-
facts within the region suggest that these
early occupations were principally situ-
ated within the valleys of major stream
basins (see D. Anderson 1996a; Thur-
mond 1990a, tables 53 and 54), as well
as resource-rich areas like the Ouachita
Mountains escarpment (D. Anderson
1996b, ﬁg. 3.2). It appears that Paleo-
indian foraging groups occupied small
camps and had only a general tool kit.

David G. Anderson (1996b) has pos-
tulated that the initial and most intensive
Paleoindian settlement of the Southeast
(which would include east Texas) took
place in the resource-rich valleys of the

site (41VN6) on the upper Sabine River
were employed by Johnson (1962) to
bring chronological and cultural order to
the diverse Archaic (ca. 6000 –200 b.c.)
archeological record found in northeast-
ern Texas. Of particular import were
Johnson’s (1962, 208) temporal divisions
of the Archaic based on projectile point
sequences and on the introduction of
plain ceramics at the end of the Archaic.
Dee Ann Story (1990, ﬁg. 32) and J. Pe-
ter Thurmond (1990a, table 8) provide
the most current chronological classiﬁca-
tions of Archaic age dart points, with
straight and expanding-stem forms char-
acteristic of the Early and Middle Archaic
periods and the contracting stem darts
particularly diagnostic of the Late Archaic
(and much of the Woodland period as
well [Schambach 1982, 1998]).

What have we learned about the Ar-
chaic populations who lived in northeast-
ern Texas? Recent paleoenvironmental re-
search summarized by C. Reid Ferring
(1995c) suggests that much of the Ar-
chaic period, particularly the period be-
tween about four thousand and eight
thousand years ago, was drier than today,
with apparent reductions in biomass as
well as the local expansion of prairie habi-
tats along the western margins of the re-
gion. Nevertheless, drier conditions and
changing vegetation conditions “clearly
did not preclude occupations” (Ferring
1995c, 33) during these periods. While
the archeological data are still rather lim-
ited, it appears that group mobility re-
mained high for these hunting-gathering
foragers (who utilized hardwood nuts,
deer, shellﬁsh, turtles, and small mam-
mals) during the Early Archaic (about six
thousand to eight thousand years ago).
Jeff S. Girard’s excavations at the Conly
site (16BI19) in northwestern Louisiana,
occupied between seventy-ﬁve hundred
and eight thousand years ago, indicated
that the Archaic groups “focused on deer
and slack water aquatic species, but a wide
range of resources, from varied microen-
vironments, was exploited” (Girard 2000,
63). Hickory nuts and acorn were also
common in the archeological deposits.

Group territories were probably large

and poorly deﬁned at this time, with
most sites conforming to what Thur-
mond called “heavy” and “limited-use”
areas (Thurmond 1990a, 41), that is, re-
peated and recurrent occupations by

Mississippi River and its principal tribu-
taries. From there, Paleoindian groups
settled throughout the wooded Southeast
and East, with concentrations at 250 –
400 km intervals, indicating the scale of
movement of these highly mobile for-
agers. The relatively sparse Paleoindian
archeological record, in conjunction with
the dispersion of artifacts on many land-
forms and different settings within the re-
gion, seems to indicate that the Paleo-
indian groups were very mobile hunters
and gatherers rather than specialized

hunters of extinct megafauna (Fields and
Tomka 1993, 82). LeRoy Johnson (1989)
also suggests that some of the Paleoindian
archeological remains (Plainview and
Scottsbluff projectile points and Cody
knives) found in the region are from Late
Paleoindian (about nine thousand to ten
thousand years ago) Plains groups that
moved into parts of northeastern Texas to
exploit its resources (such as bison) dur-
ing periods when grassland habitat spread
eastward.

cluding the distinctive blade-notched
Evans point) and generalized cutting/
scraping tools, debris, groundstone tools,
and cores.

Burned rock features (possible hearths,

ovens, and cooking pits) and burned
rock concentrations are present in dated
Middle Archaic contexts at a few sites in
the Sulphur River drainage (see Cliff et al.
1996a; Gadus et al. 1992), suggesting
that an important activity was the cook-
ing and processing of plant foods, but
mainly by small groups for short-term
use (Fields et al. 1997, 90). A single
burned rock feature at the Unionville site
(41CS151; see Fig. 13.3) has a calibrated
date of 4161– 4040 b.c. (Cliff et al.
1996a). Lithic raw material data from a
possible Middle Archaic assemblage at
Lake Fork Reservoir in the upper Sabine
River basin indicate that the exchange of
nonlocal materials (particularly ﬁnished
tools) was commonplace (Perttula 1984),
although “patterns in raw material use
were not uniform across Northeast Texas”
(Fields and Tomka 1993, 92), and in
general, the use of nonlocal raw materials
was not common. At Cooper Lake in Ar-
chaic contexts, the nonlocal lithics that
are present primarily originated to the
north in the Red River basin (Fields
1995; Fields et al. 1997; see also Fields,
chapter 12, this volume). Mound com-
plexes of Middle Archaic age in northern
Louisiana at this time also suggest the
development of more complex hunter-
gatherer societies in the Trans-Mississippi
South (see J. W. Saunders et al. 1997;
J. W. Saunders and Allen 1997).

Late Archaic sites are widely distrib-
uted in the Pineywoods and Post Oak Sa-
vanna, occurring along the major streams,
near springs, on spring-fed branches, on
upland ridges, and on tributary drainages
of all sizes (see Cliff and Hunt 1995; Cliff
et al. 1996a; B. Dixon et al. 1997; Thur-
mond 1990a). In fact, the distribution of
Late Archaic sites suggests that these
groups moderately to extensively ranged
over and exploited almost every part of
the region. In particular, Anderson
(1996a) notes major concentrations of
Late Archaic sites along the Red and
Little Rivers in southwestern Arkansas
and northwestern Louisiana, as well as in
the Ouachita Mountains. Aboriginal
populations continued a generalized for-
aging adaptation, combined with appar-

small groups. David Anderson (1996a)
suggests that such Archaic groups had
highly mobile foraging adaptations along
the Red River, the central Sabine River,
and in interior uplands away from major
drainages, with expedient lithic technolo-
gies. Most sites of this age were brieﬂy
used but tended to be concentrated in the
larger drainages within the region.

By the Middle Archaic period (about
four thousand to six thousand years ago)

fairly substantial and extensive occupa-
tions are recognized within the major ba-
sins in the region, with a rather limited
use of smaller tributaries and headwater
areas (see Thurmond 1990a, ﬁg. 9, for
example, where Middle Archaic “heavy
use” sites occur along Big and Little Cy-
press Creeks, or on tributaries near their
conﬂuence with Big Cypress Creek).
Components of this period are open
camps dominated by hunting tools (in-

ent population growth. There are only a
few well-dated Late Archaic period com-
ponents known in northeastern Texas,
however.

Some Late Archaic occupations in
riverine settings in the Pineywoods and
Post Oak Savanna contain earthen mid-
dens (e.g., the Yarbrough site along the
Sabine River), but generally, sites of this
age contain burned rock features and/or
concentrations of burned rocks as well as
small pits. The Late Archaic occupation
in Area C at the Unionville site (41CS151)
had a buried anthrosol or surface that had
been darkened or stained by cultural ac-
tivities, while within the anthrosol were
two clusters of burned rock features (Cliff
et al. 1996a). Large pits and rock hearths
in a Late Archaic component at the Her-
man Bellew site (41RK222) have cali-
brated dates that range from 1590 to
380 b.c. (Nash and Perttula 2000). At the
Mockingbird site (41TT550) in the Big
Cypress Creek drainage, the Late Archaic
component (dated 830 – 410 b.c.) con-
tained only scattered burned rocks and
small amounts of stone tools and projec-
tile points, suggesting that it was used only
as a temporary encampment or “limited
use” area. There are many other Late Ar-
chaic sites or components with relatively
abundant amounts of burned rocks from
hearth construction and use, along with
projectile points, bifacial and ﬂake tools,
and ﬂake debris. Cases of extensive burned
rock features suggest that the cooking and
bulk processing of plant foods in ovens
and pits were important to some Late Ar-
chaic populations in the region.

These settlement data are compatible
with higher population densities and lim-
ited group mobility but also a wide dis-
persion of camp and foraging areas, the
possible establishment of deﬁnable terri-
torial ranges, and a well-developed forag-
ing economy based on the hunting and
gathering of local food resources. There is
no paleobotanical evidence to indicate
that the Late Archaic populations in
northeastern Texas cultivated native plant
species (such as sumpweed, sunﬂower,
and chenopod), as was the case by the
ﬁrst millennium b.c. in many parts of
eastern North America (G. J. Fritz 1994,
25 –27). Nutshells and prairie turnip
(Pediomelum sp.) are documented in Late
Archaic components at the Unionville
site (Cliff and Hunt 1995; Cliff et al.

1996a) along the lower Sulphur River.
The extensive use of local lithic raw mate-
rials during the Late Archaic in the Sul-
phur, Sabine, Cypress, and Neches/
Angelina basins speaks to a more limited
interregional interaction at this time
(Fields and Tomka 1993; Perttula and
Bruseth 1995). By contrast, in the Missis-
sippi River basin of northern Louisiana,
Late Archaic sites are marked by extensive
quantities of nonlocal lithic raw materials,
particularly novaculite and Boone and
Pitkin cherts ( J. W. Saunders and Allen
1997, 19).

Woodland Period

The Woodland period (ca. 200 b.c. to

ca. a.d. 800) in much of northeastern
Texas, particularly from the Sabine River
to the Red River, is recognized primarily
by plain and relatively thick ceramic
bowls and ﬂowerpot-shaped jars, double-
bitted axe heads, the smaller and thinner
Gary projectile points, and later in the
period by corner-notched arrow points
(Thurmond 1990a). In several instances,
as at the Resch, Bert Davis, Tankersley
Creek, Herman Bellew, and Folly sites in
the Sabine, Sulphur, and Big Cypress
drainage basins (see Fig. 13.3), Lower
Mississippi Valley (LMV) related ceram-
ics (such as Tchefuncte Stamped, Chu-
rupa Punctated, Marksville Incised, Troy-
ville Stamped, and Marksville Stamped)
occur with some frequency in Woodland
period components in northeastern Texas
(Story 1990, 246). These ceramics may
be trade items that provide evidence of
contact and interaction between Trans-
Mississippi South Native Americans and
groups in the LMV, or they were ceramics
whose stylistic decorative attributes were
borrowed by local potters (see Perttula and
Bruseth 1995; Schambach 1982, 1998).
At Woodland period sites along the
Red River in southwestern Arkansas and
northeastern Texas, ceramics are abun-
dant and constitute a signiﬁcant propor-
tion of the artifact assemblages, while in
many other Woodland period sites in
much of northeastern Texas (particularly
between the Sulphur and Sabine Rivers),
the use of ceramics was not as prevalent.
This situation suggests regional differ-
ences in Woodland period food process-
ing (i.e., boiling of foods in vessels to
make them palatable and a change from
stone to wooden food preparation tools)

and dietary habits (i.e., an increased con-
sumption of carbohydrate-rich foods,
probably including some amounts of
maize). It is probable that there were also
differences in sedentism between Wood-
land populations across the region, based
on strong correlations between sedentism
and pottery making (e.g., Skibo and Blin-
man 1999, 172).

Later LMV Coles Creek period ceram-

ics (and expanding-stem arrow points
similar to the Colbert and Friley types)
are present in notable quantities in several
sites along the Sabine River and the Red
River, particularly at James Pace in a con-
text dated between ca. 1300 and 1000
years b.p. (Girard 1994) and at the gener-
ally contemporaneous Ray site (41LR135)
(Bruseth 1998). Similar ceramics occur in
stratiﬁed contexts at the Crenshaw (3MI6)
and Mounds Plantation (16CD12) sites
in burial mound features (Schambach
1997; Webb and McKinney 1975), and
the Woodland period is also when larger
villages and multiple mound centers
begin to be constructed on the major
streams (e.g., the Red and Sabine Rivers)
in the Trans-Mississippi South. Generally
contemporaneous components in the up-
per Sabine River basin have ceramic as-
semblages dominated by horizontally in-
cised decorative motifs on vessel rims,
and Friley arrow points also occur in as-
sociation (Bruseth and Perttula 1981).

To the south of the Sabine River, but
concentrated in the Angelina and Attoyac
drainage basins, Woodland period sites
contain plain sandy-paste ceramics of the
Mossy Grove tradition (Story 1990,
ﬁg. 39) as well as decorated ceramics
with LMV afﬁliation. Woodland period
components account for at least 25 to
50 percent of the known prehistoric ar-
cheological sites in the Angelina-Neches
conﬂuence area and points west (W. Mar-
tin et al. 1995, table 2; Perttula et al.
1993c) and represent the camp sites and
habitation locales of peoples that had sea-
sonal foraging-gathering and hunting
adaptations. Aboriginal pottery was
adopted and used by Mossy Grove groups
for the cooking and processing of plant
and animal foods by about two thousand
years ago, and by a.d. 600/700, if not
earlier (see L. Patterson 1995), the Mossy
Grove populations were using a variety of
stemmed arrow points for hunting.

PREHISTORIC AND CADDOAN ARCHEOLOGY OF THE PINEYWOODS / 377

of Woodland period sites across the land-
scape—particularly focusing on sandy in-
terﬂuves—have led James E. Corbin
(1998, 114 –15) to suggest that horticul-
ture may have been introduced in the
Neches-Angelina River basins at that
time. Corbin also suggests that the num-
ber and distribution of Woodland period
sites in that part of east Texas “may have
been tied to . . . moving closer to a sig-
niﬁcant plant food source (i.e., plants
that were restricted to valley margins
and/or the ﬂoodplain) whose use was fa-
cilitated by processing via cooking in ce-
ramic vessels” (Corbin 1998, 115). Settle-
ment data from the McGee Bend area at
the conﬂuence of the Angelina River and
Attoyac Bayou indicates that middens
and occupational components are present
in Woodland period contexts that range
from 0.5 to 8 acres in size (Dufﬁeld 1963;
Jelks 1965).

While there is much archeologists do
not know about the aboriginal peoples of
northeastern Texas during this period,
what has been learned over the last forty
or so years of the twentieth century is that
they were still primarily hunter-gatherers
who lived in increasingly larger groups
and resided for longer periods of time at
certain sites. The fact that some of these
sites have relatively substantial midden
deposits (particularly along the Red River
and in the upper Sulphur River basin
[Fields et al. 1997; Schambach 1982])
and some evidence for structures (proba-
bly daubed pole and thatch structures)
suggests more intensive occupations, de-
creased residential mobility, and higher
population densities, but the degree of
permanence is still less than that seen in
the subsequent long-term Caddo settle-
ment of northeastern Texas (Perttula et al.
1993c, 99). At the Ray site, for example,
portions of several late Woodland period
structures and two middens were inves-
tigated by the Texas Archeological So-
ciety in the early 1990s (Bruseth 1998).
Frank F. Schambach suggests that Wood-
land (or Fourche Maline) period settle-
ments along the Great Bend of the Red
River included “small to medium sized
villages of from 1 to 4 ha” (Schambach
1983, 5).

On the basis of the available paleo-
botanical information, Woodland period
groups may have cultivated squash (see
McGregor 1996) and used native seeds

and tubers/roots, as well as a variety of
woodland and aquatic animal resources,
particularly white-tailed deer. At the
Resch site, a typical case, the rather exten-
sive midden deposits (dated from cal b.c.
555 –354 to a.d. 71–261 at 1-sigma)
contained only burned rock features
(probably used for the cooking and bak-
ing of plant foods) and dense quantities
of charred nutshells and poorly preserved
animal bones (C. Webb et al. 1969). The
presence of chipped stone axes and hoe-
shaped tools in Woodland occupations
suggests that some horticultural practices
(perhaps the use of colonizing weedy an-
nuals) and forest clearance may have be-
gun. James E. Bruseth (1998) also sug-
gests that maize was also being cultivated
during the later portions of the period,
but stable isotope analyses of human re-
mains of some twenty-ﬁve or more Late
Archaic, Fourche Maline, and Forma-
tive–Early Caddoan period samples indi-
cate that maize was not a major part of
the diet of Woodland period groups (see
Rose et al. 1998). The examination of
skeletal pathologies in Woodland period
contexts from the Red River area and east
Texas indicates low levels of infection but
high levels of degenerative diseases rela-
tive to subsequent Caddoan populations
(Rose et al. 1998, table 6-4). These data
further support the idea that Woodland
period populations were primarily hunter-
gatherers with a nutritionally adequate
diet, who probably lived across the region
in relatively low population densities but
whose lifestyle was characterized by
chronic stress (on the joints) and heavy
workloads (Rose et al. 1998, 121). Maize
is also poorly represented in the archeo-
logical record before ca. a.d. 700 –900.

In much of northeastern Texas, Wood-

land period sites are not very common,
perhaps because much of the area was not
heavily settled during this time (e.g.,
Story 1990, 310). In the Cypress Creek
basin, for instance, most Woodland pe-
riod components were “limited use sites
(i.e., rather short term camps) and . . .
only a few . . . were small settlements”
(Story 1990, 310). Dated components at
sites such as 41TT370, 41TT372, and
41TT409 (on upland projections and up-
land slopes) in that basin had burned
rock features and quantities of burned
rock from the apparent cooking and pro-
cessing of plant foods, and ceramics were

notably absent (Barnhart et al. 1997;
Kotter et al. 1993). One of the few well-
studied Woodland period components in
the Sabine River drainage is at the Her-
man Bellew site (41RK222; see Fig. 13.3),
where the component dates between
70 b.c. and a.d. 685 (Nash and Perttula
2000) and which had rock concentrations
as well as small and large pits, contracting-
stemmed dart points, and a small amount
of mainly plain ceramics. By contrast,
settlements of this period are common
throughout the Sulphur (see Fields, chap-
ter 12, this volume) and Neches-Angelina
River basins (Corbin 1998). In the Sul-
phur River sites, the Woodland period
components (with calibrated dates rang-
ing from 195 b.c. to a.d. 896) have mid-
dens, burials, and other features, and the
Hurricane Hill site (41HP106) had
ﬂexed, bundle, and cremation burials in
a small cemetery on a prominent sandy
rise (Perttula 1999) that dates between
cal a.d. 59 and 449.

No Woodland period burial mounds

have been documented in the Piney-
woods and Post Oak Savanna of north-
eastern Texas, although they have been
found in blufftop and alluvial valley set-
tings on the Red River in northwestern
Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas
(Schambach 1982, 1997; C. Webb 1984)
and on the Angelina, Neches, and Sabine
Rivers in deep east Texas (Story 1990,
310; see also Jelks 1965 and Jensen 1968).
Associated with the construction and use
of mounds in the Woodland period were
the procurement and dispersal of costly
nonlocal raw materials and artifacts, in-
cluding cherts, copper, and LMV ceramic
vessels that were included as grave goods
or caches in the burial mounds.

The two or three mounds at James
Pace (16DS268) on the Sabine River ap-
parently did not, however, serve as plat-
forms for burials or structures, or as caps
for these features, and their functional sig-
niﬁcance is equivocal (Girard 1994, 15).
The appearance of burial mounds (and
mounds covering crematoria) in the
broader region around northeastern Texas
does suggest that more complexly orga-
nized local groups did develop during the
Woodland period in these localities (see
Schambach 1996, 1997).

In nonmound contexts, there is also
evidence of mortuary or ritual practices in
the Woodland period. The Hurricane

communities. In the broadest sense, the
establishment of cemeteries clearly corre-
lates with an increasing sedentism in the
western Gulf Coast Plain of northeastern
Texas after ca. 200 b.c.

The Formative and the Early
and Middle Caddoan Periods

When we turn to a consideration of
the Formative (ca. a.d. 800 –1000) and
the Early (ca. a.d. 1000 –1200) and
Middle (ca. a.d. 1200 –1400) Caddoan
period occupation of the Pineywoods and
Post Oak Savanna of northeastern Texas,
there is an abundance of archeological in-
formation to draw upon. Many an arche-
ologist has been captivated by the beauti-
fully manufactured ceramics and other
material goods, the earthen mounds, the
well-preserved villages and hamlets, and
the existence of an ethnohistorical record
(e.g., Bolton 1987; Swanton 1942) that
has helped to bring to light behavioral
analogs with which to interpret the arche-
ological story of the Caddo people. Con-
sequently, our view of the lifeways of
these prehistoric Caddo groups is much
fuller, and perhaps more behaviorally
meaningful, than has been the case for
the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Woodland
regional archeological record.

First, Caddo archeological sites of
these ages are quite common throughout
the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna
(Cliff et al. 1996b; Story 1990; Thur-
mond 1990a). About 80 percent of the
more than ﬁve hundred radiocarbon
dates available from northeastern Texas
archeological sites pertain to occupations
at prehistoric and protohistoric Caddoan
sites (Fig. 13.5). The largest number of
dates fall in the Middle Caddoan period
(ca. a.d. 1200 –1400), followed by the
Early Caddoan period (ca. a.d. 1000 –
1200). Using calibrated ages and age
midpoints of 1-sigma calibrated age
ranges (Fig. 13.6), the largest number
of Caddoan radiocarbon dates fall within
the a.d. 1201–1300 interval (Perttula
1998b). While the number of dates in
this period is probably inﬂated to some
degree by the extensive series of dates
from the George C. Davis site (n!130;
see Story 1997; Story and Valastro 1977),
it does appear to be the case that Middle
Caddoan period occupations are rather
commonplace throughout much of north-
eastern Texas (Middlebrook and Perttula
1997), which conﬁrms the results of the
radiocarbon dates from the region.

Caddoan sites of Formative to Middle
Caddoan period age are situated primar-

Fig. 13.5. Number of radiocarbon dates for the Paleoindian, Early/Middle Archaic, Late Ar-

Hill site contained a small cemetery on a
prominent hill, and the Mahaffey site on
the Kiamichi River in southeastern Okla-
homa also had a large cemetery with
ﬂexed and semiﬂexed burials without
grave goods (Perino and Bennett 1978).
Later Woodland period cemeteries with
nine to twenty-one or more burials—
dating after ca. a.d. 200 –500 —have also
been identiﬁed at sites such as Snipes
(41CP8; Jelks 1961) in the lower Sulphur
River basin (see Fig. 13.3) and at several
sites in southwestern Arkansas, including
Shane’s Village (Schambach 1982). These
later, shallow extended burials contained
an occasional whole vessel, boatstone,
celt, or chipped biface. The vessels in-
clude ﬂowerpot-shaped Williams Plain
and Coles Creek Incised types (see Jelks
1961, plate 4). The Crenshaw site also
had many late Woodland period extended
burials in village midden contexts (the
large village is estimated to cover 8 ha),
and these midden contexts also contained
ceramic vessels as funerary objects
(Schambach 1982, 152).

Comparable burial cremation practices

at the Hurricane Hill site in the upper
Sulphur River basin and the contempora-
neous Johnny Ford site (3LA5), an early
Fourche Maline village (ca. 200 b.c.– a.d.
300) in the Great Bend area of the Red
River valley (Stewart 1993), suggest the
existence of similar belief systems among
aboriginal Woodland period groups in
the Red and Sulphur River basins. Scham-
bach (1996, 36) describes the burials at
Johnny Ford as occurring in a “cremation
cemetery,” and he further suggests that
everyone in the village may have been cre-
mated (adults and children were also cre-
mated at Hurricane Hill) in the bluff-
edge crematoria at mound sites such as
Cicero Young and Bellevue (Schambach
1997, 57).

The identiﬁcation of formally bounded

cemeteries at a number of Woodland
period habitation sites in the Trans-
Mississippi South (see Rose et al. 1999) is
consistent with the existence and settle-
ment of distinctive social groups (based
on kinship and/or residence) of afﬁliated
individuals at sites and various locales
during that time. It appears that children
and adults were buried together in these
cemeteries, suggesting that these Wood-
land populations had an egalitarian social
organization within local settlements and

PREHISTORIC AND CADDOAN ARCHEOLOGY OF THE PINEYWOODS / 379

1997). Similar kinds of Early Caddoan
components have been identiﬁed at the
Spike, Thomas (41DT80), Doctors
Creek (41DT124), and Spider Knoll
(41DT11) sites at Cooper Lake. The lat-
ter site had numerous postholes (from
two possible structures and drying racks
or arbors), pits, and a large midden de-
posit (Fields et al. 1997, 93 –96). The
North rise at Hurricane Hill had a similar
array of features and extensive midden
deposits dating from ca. a.d. 1000 –1200,
including portions of two structures, sev-
eral middens, hearths, burials, and pits,
while the South rise had three structures
(two superimposed), middens, burials, a
dog burial, features, and an extensive
Caddoan ceramic assemblage from a
Middle Caddoan period component
dated about a.d. 1250 –1375 (Perttula
1999).

The Middle Caddoan Tigert site
(41TT36) on Hart Creek had a small
midden and an associated burial with
grave goods (K. Brown 1975), while the
contemporaneous component at the
Grifﬁn Mound site (41UR142) in the
Little Cypress Creek drainage contained
a dense midden and a large (more than
2 m in diameter and 1 m in depth) stor-
age pit feature, probably associated with
a Caddoan structure (Nelson et al. 1994).
The Musgaño site (41RK19) covered
about ﬁve acres and had at least one cir-
cular structure, midden deposits, numer-
ous pits (including two with charred
corncobs [Clark and Ivey 1974, 22]), and
an extensive ceramic and faunal assem-
blage (Fig. 13.7). One area of features to
the east of the one excavated circular
structure was suggested by John W. Clark
and James E. Ivey (1974) to have been a
granary built on stilts, with smoky ﬁre
pits under it (i.e., the feature was ﬁlled
with charred corncobs, which would
have produced a large amount of smoke).
William G. Driggers (1985, 96) suggests
that the Caddoan occupation/midden at
the Benson’s Crossing site (41TT110),
situated on an alluvial terrace along Big
Cypress Creek and occupied perhaps dur-
ing the late part of the Middle Caddoan
period (ca. a.d. 1300 –1400), was the
product of at least two extended families
living in a farmstead or small hamlet for
more than twenty to thirty years.

Larger communities (covering more
than ten acres) that occur in association

Fig. 13.6. Number of calibrated radiocarbon dates at twenty-ﬁve-year intervals, A.D. 800 –1675.

ily on elevated landforms (alluvial terraces
and rises, natural levees, and upland edges)
adjacent to the major streams, as well as
along minor tributaries and spring-fed
branches. Settlement locations near arable
sandy loam soils were preferred, presum-
ably because of good drainage for habita-
tion and for cultivation purposes.

The majority of these Caddo sites are

“permanent settlements that have evi-
dence of the structures, including posts,
pits, and features marking their residency,
along with the cemeteries and graves
where the dead were buried; the middens
where the animal and plant food refuse
was discarded amidst broken stone tools
and pottery vessels; and the material re-
mains of tools and ceramics used in the
procurement and processing of the boun-
tiful resources of the region. They repre-
sent the settlements of Caddoan commu-
nities and sociopolitical entities, and the
civic-ceremonial centers that were their
focus” (Perttula 1993c, 125). The distri-
bution of Caddoan settlements across the
landscape suggests that all habitats were
used to some extent, either intensively as
locations for the sedentary communities
and farmsteads (that may have been occu-
pied for single or multiple generations) or
periodically by groups in logistical camps
where speciﬁc natural resources could be
procured in bulk by the Caddos. Along
the Red River, a particular focus of settle-
ment was the natural levees in recently
abandoned meander belts, and these

habitats “served as an ideal context for a
dispersed community” in a major ﬂood-
plain landscape (Girard 1997, 156).

The most common types of Caddoan
settlements in the region during these pe-
riods of time appear to be small year-
round hamlets and farmsteads with circu-
lar to rectangular structures (Bruseth
1998; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Cliff
1997; Cliff et al. 1996a; Cruse 1994,
1995; Largent et al. 1997; Middlebrook
1994, 1997; Perttula et al. 1986; Thur-
mond 1990a). These settlements some-
times occur in association with small
household cemeteries (see Goldschmidt
1935; Middlebrook and Perttula 1997).
A larger cemetery, with at least twelve to
eighteen burials, has been documented at
the Vasturtium site (41UR209) in the
Little Cypress Creek basin (Nelson and
Perttula 1997).

In the Big Cypress drainage, for ex-
ample, Early and Middle Caddoan period
components at 41TT372 are interpreted
as a “seasonal campsite or a small family-
based agricultural farmstead, at least on a
periodic basis” (Barnhart et al. 1997,
235), principally because of the lack of
middens or structural features. At the
Unionville site, Area C, 41CS150,
41CS155/156, Area B, 41BW553, and
41TT670 along White Oak Creek, Early
and Middle Caddoan components had
well-preserved middens, hearths, post-
holes, and other features (Cliff and Hunt
1995; Cliff et al. 1996a; Largent et al.

with mound centers (such as the large
settlements at George C. Davis [41CE19],
Hale [41TT12], and Hudnall-Pirtle
[41RK4; see Bruseth 1991]) have been
recognized as well. Shaft burials of high-
status individuals have been documented
in mound contexts at the George C.
Davis site (Story 1997, 1998) and a few
other mound centers (such as Washing-
ton Square [41NA49], Boxed Springs
[41UR30], and Sanders [41LR2]; see
Corbin and Hart 1998; Hamilton 1997),
and they also occur in nonmound contexts
at several sites along the Red River during
Formative period times (see Bruseth
1998). Multiple burials were present on
the slopes of the burial mound at the
Sanders site (Fig. 13.8), and Donny L.
Hamilton (1997, 128) suggests that these
multiple burials were immolations that
accompanied the high-status adult males
on the crest of the mound (Fig. 13.9).

Certainly the most thoroughly studied
Formative and Early Caddoan period site
in the region is the George C. Davis site,
a large village and mound center on the
Neches River (Fig. 13.10). Calibrated ra-
diocarbon dates from village contexts es-
tablish that the site was occupied begin-
ning in the ninth century a.d. and then
was continuously settled through the end
of the thirteenth century a.d. (Story
2000). A large number of structures were
built on and adjacent to Mound A, and
the extensive structure rebuilding there
indicates that the Caddos preferred the
area for settlement (Fig. 13.11). Cali-
brated dates from a few contexts (such as
Units 11, 43, and 109; see Story 1997)
suggest that the site was inhabited to
some degree as late as ca. a.d. 1350.
There were three mounds at the Davis
site, including Mound A (ﬂat-topped
platform) and Mound C (burial mound),
built over the large pre-mound burial pit

F134 (Fig. 13.12) in the latter part of the
Formative Caddoan period and contain-
ing an estimated twenty-ﬁve to thirty elite
burial pits (Fig. 13.13), and Mound B
(ﬂat-topped platform), constructed about
a.d. 1200 or slightly earlier (Story 1997,
1998).

One of the more signiﬁcant Caddoan

sites investigated recently in the north-
eastern Texas Pineywoods, the Oak Hill
Village (41RK214), estimated to date be-
tween ca. a.d. 1200/1300 and 1450, has
at least forty-two circular and rectangular
structures. Some of the structures had
been rebuilt and some overlapped earlier
structures, particularly at the northwestern
end of the ridge and plaza (Fig. 13.14),
and they were arranged over the 3.5-acre
village in a circular pattern around a cen-
tral plaza area (Cruse 1994, 1995; Rogers
et al. 1994, ﬁg. 11; Rogers and Perttula
1999). Several small structures on the
eastern side of the plaza have been iden-

tiﬁed as possible granaries for the storage
of harvested corn (Rogers and Perttula
1999). A small mound (covering a burned
structure) is at the north end of the site,
and several midden deposits (including a
large, possibly communal trash dump
near the south end of the site) have been
identiﬁed and appear to be associated
with individual structures. Two large
circular structures have extended en-
tranceways that pointed toward the plaza
(Fig. 13.15), and their special form and
orientation suggest that they were proba-
bly public buildings used by the Oak Hill
Village community for special (public
and/or ritual) purposes. Ceramic analyses
and radiocarbon dating indicate these
structures were built after ca. a.d. 1350
during the extensive Late Village (Rogers
and Perttula 1999).

Another important Middle Caddoan

site is Tyson (41SY92) in the Attoyac
Bayou basin (Middlebrook 1994), dating

between cal a.d. 1336 and 1490. This
settlement contains evidence for struc-
tures and cooking as well as storage pit
features (Fig. 13.16), and it has extensive
midden deposits, well-preserved plant
and animal remains, and a small cemetery
containing child burials. Tom Middle-
brook (1994, 1997) suggests that the
Tyson site represents the residence of a
caddi or chieﬂy elite.

One of the calibrated dates from the
Tyson site was on mussel shell included as
grave goods with Feature 14, the burial of
a three- to four-year-old child accompa-
nied by many grave goods (Middlebrook
1994, 16). Among the burial offerings
were eight ceramic vessels near the head
and feet of the child (Fig. 13.17), two
large paired deer antlers over the child’s
head (perhaps as part of a headdress),
carved shell inlays near the head, two
carved bone earspools, thirty-two Olivella
shell beads, three columella beads from a

necklace, a turtle rattle, a cache of mussel
shell, smoothed stones, two pitted stones,
a cache of six deer ulna awls and two
beaver teeth, and a cache of lithic pebble
cores, ﬂakes, preforms, and a notched
shell point (Middlebrook 1994, 16). John
E. Dockall and Helen D. Dockall (1999,
557 and app. 1) suggest that the latter
two caches represent a generalized knap-
ping tool kit.

These Formative-Middle Caddoan
groups seem to have been horticulturists,
cultivating maize and squash along with
several kinds of native seeds (Perttula and
Bruseth 1983); they also gathered nuts
and tubers/storage roots and were proﬁ-
cient hunters of deer, ﬁsh, and many
other animal species. The available paleo-
botanical and bioarcheological evidence
(including stable carbon isotopes on hu-
man remains) from northeastern Texas
(and elsewhere in the Caddoan area; see
Rose et al. 1998) does not indicate, how-

ever, that Caddoan groups became de-
pendent upon maize and other domesti-
cated crops until after about a.d. 1300;
by ca. a.d. 1450, maize comprised more
than 50 percent of the diet (see Burnett
1990; Perttula 1996; Rose et al. 1998). In
portions of the Sulphur River basin, par-
ticularly the upper basin in the Cooper
Lake area, however, the use of cultivated
plants appears to have been rather limited
during these periods, with only small
amounts of maize and squash being re-
covered from the ﬂotation of feature con-
tents (Cliff 1997; Largent et al. 1997;
Perttula 1999; see also Fields, chapter 12,
this volume).

Both temple and burial mounds were
built by these Pineywoods and Post Oak
Savanna Caddoan groups. The larger sites
are important civic-ceremonial centers
containing multiple mounds and associ-
ated villages, and these generally date af-
ter ca. a.d. 900. The multiple mound

of postulated local Early-Middle Cad-
doan networks in the Sabine River basin
(Fig. 13.19). Two calibrated dates from
one of the eight mounds at Hudnall-
Pirtle are in a range between a.d. 1152
and 1250. The McKenzie (41WD55) site
in the middle Sabine River drainage has a
single substructural mound that dates be-
tween a.d. 1298 and 1470 (see Granberry
1995), and there are contemporaneous
mounds covering structures with ex-
tended entranceways at the Redwine
(41SM193) and Bryan Hardy (41SM55)
sites (see Walters et al. 1998). The Middle
Caddoan occupation at Redwine also
included an extensive midden deposit,
hearth and pit features, and a small ceme-
tery with extended supine burials; the
cemetery contained 7.0 ceramic vessels per
burial, 0.75 ceramic pipes per burial, and
6.0 arrow points (primarily the Perdiz
type) per burial (Walters et al. 1998, 26).

The Hale (41TT12) and Keith
(41TT11) multiple mound sites (see
Fig. 13.18) may also have had a civic-
ceremonial function in the Big Cypress
Creek basin, and the same may be said
for the Roitsch (41RR16), Wright Plan-
tation (41RR7), Fasken (41RR14), and
Sanders (41LR2) sites in the Red River
basin (Bruseth 1998; Hamilton 1997). At
Roitsch–Sam Kaufman, four calibrated
dates from a rectangular structure near
the East Mound (Skinner et al. 1969)
range between a.d. 982 and 1250 (Pert-
tula 1998a, table 1).

Only a few possible Caddoan mounds
are known in the lower Sulphur River ba-
sin of northeastern Texas (see Fig. 13.18)
and southwestern Arkansas (Cliff 1997;
J. Miller 1986), and they appear to con-
sist of single mounds rather than large
mound centers with both earthen plat-
forms and burial mounds. The distribu-
tion, number, and spacing of mound cen-
ters, particularly the sites with multiple
mounds in east Texas and adjoining parts
of southwestern Arkansas and northwest-
ern Louisiana, clearly indicate that the
Caddoan peoples who built and used
these mounds were integrated into socie-
ties of considerable sociopolitical com-
plexity. The premier mound centers in
the Neches-Angelina River basins include
George C. Davis and Washington Square
(Corbin and Hart 1998; Story 1997).

centers are rather evenly spaced along the
Red River, the Sabine River, and Big Cy-

are contemporaneous may represent hier-
archical systems of an “integrated . . . re-
gional network of interaction and redis-
tribution” (Thurmond 1990a, 234).

is well dated, with pooled radiocarbon
dates on charcoal, hardwood nutshells,
and charred corn ranging between cal
a.d. 1268 and 1302 (Corbin and Hart
1998, 74 and table 4). Extensive excava-
tions documented a circular structure un-
der Mound 1/2, an assortment of pits
and postholes in nonmound contexts,
and several large burial pits in a mortuary
mound (the Reavely-House Mound). No
clear evidence for on-site permanent Cad-
doan habitation was identiﬁed at Wash-
ington Square, although an interesting
assortment of large sherd-ﬁlled pits (rep-
resenting many vessels) was encountered
in one area between Mound 1/2 and the
mortuary mound (see Corbin and Hart
1998, ﬁg. 14). These pits may represent
deposits from public feasting activities led
by Caddo elite (see, e.g., S. Scott and
Jackson 1998) who used the Washington
Square mound site as a ceremonial center
from a.d. 1200 –1400.

The radiocarbon dating of the Wash-
ington Square and George C. Davis sites
hints at the possibility that the Washing-
ton Square Mound center began to ﬂour-
ish about the time (after ca. a.d. 1250)
that the George C. Davis site was losing
power and social authority. This change
suggests that the Caddoan community
that built and used the Washington
Square Mound site—more advanta-
geously located eastward at the nexus of
north-south (later known as the Caddo
trace) and east-west (later known as the
Camino Real) aboriginal trails—achieved
preeminence at the expense of the long-
lasting (four hundred years) polity on the
Neches River. The George C. Davis site
was abandoned by the early fourteenth
century.

The Formative, Early, and Middle
Caddoan Pineywoods groups possessed a
rich material culture. Well-made, corner-
notched, and rectangular-stemmed arrow
points were common, along with silt-
stone and greenstone celts, perforators
and borers (Fig. 13.20), large Gahagan
bifaces, and a variety of more expedient
stone tools (unifacial ﬂake scraping and
cutting implements). Long-stemmed Red
River (Hoffman 1967) and cigar-shaped
ceramic pipes were made by the Caddos
at this time, as were ceramic earspools
and ﬁgurines (see Newell and Krieger
1949).

The Character of Prehistoric
Caddoan Ceramics

The most distinctive material culture
item of the Caddo groups living in north-
eastern Texas was the ceramics they made
for cooking, storage, and serving needs
(see Perttula et al. 1995b). The styles and
forms of ceramics found on sites in the
region hint at the variety, temporal span,
and geographic extent of a number of
prehistoric Caddoan groups spread across
the landscape (see Thurmond 1985,
1990a). The diversity in decoration and
shape in Caddoan ceramics is substantial,
both in the utility ware jars and bowls, as
well as in the ﬁneware bottles, carinated
bowls, and compound vessels. However,
prehistoric ceramics had been manufac-
tured in northeastern Texas for about one
thousand years before the development of
the Late Prehistoric Caddoan ceramic tra-
dition (after ca. a.d. 800/900).

Story (1990, 246 – 47, 277–319) indi-

cates that the earliest ceramics in the re-
gion date between ca. 500 and 100 b.c.
and are closely related to the kinds of ce-

Table 13.1. Caddoan Vessel Forms

ramics being produced in the Lower Mis-
sissippi Valley (LMV). Groups manufac-
turing these early ceramics were relatively
sedentary hunter-gatherers. South of the
Sabine River, the earliest locally produced
ceramics are plainwares with sandy pastes
(sharing similarities with the coastal and
inland southeast Texas ceramic Goose
Creek Plain; see Ricklis, chapter 6, this
volume), while north of the Sabine River
to the Red River, the early ceramics are
principally from thick, plain grog (Wil-
liams Plain) and bone-tempered (Cooper
Boneware) vessels (see Schambach 1998),
although sandy-paste wares are also pres-
ent in low numbers (Story 1990, 246).

Between the introduction of ceramics
in the region, and the emergence of dis-
tinctive Caddoan vessel forms and deco-
rative motifs around a.d. 800, the local
plainware traditions seem to have contin-
ued relatively unchanged. Also present,
although not in great numbers, are LMV-
related ceramics, including distinctive
Marksville, Troyville, and Coles Creek
Incised and Stamped vessels (see Phillips

1970) from sites such as Resch, Coral
Snake, Tankersley Creek, Herman Bellew,
and James Pace in the Sabine River and
Cypress Creek basins.

As Story notes, “sometime probably
between a.d. 700 and a.d. 900 (there is a
lot of room for arguing the age), Caddoan
ceramics came to dominate the northeast-
ern part of [Texas]. These ceramics are
distinguished by certain vessel forms (es-
pecially a long-necked bottle with a glob-
ular body and a carinated bowl), engraved
decorations, and other attributes. Al-
though the bottle form and engraving
may have an exotic origin, most of the
Caddoan ceramics can be recognized as
local developments with strong inﬂuences
from the LMV” (Story 1990, 247). A
diverse and distinctive ceramic assem-
blage characterizes the Caddoan ceramics
from northeastern Texas. Ceramics are
quite common in domestic contexts on
habitation sites across the region (i.e.,
it is not unusual to recover more than
10,000 sherds from hundreds of vessels
on Caddo settlements on excavation proj-

PREHISTORIC AND CADDOAN ARCHEOLOGY OF THE PINEYWOODS / 389

ects, and assemblages with upwards of
100,000 sherds are not uncommon at the
larger sites), and they also occur as grave
goods in mortuary contexts (see, for ex-
ample, the large, well-analyzed sherd as-
semblages from George C. Davis [Newell
and Krieger 1949; Stokes and Woodring
1981], Deshazo [Fields 1981, 1995],
Benson’s Crossing [Driggers 1985], and
41MX5 [Brewington et al. 1995]). Much
attention has been paid by archeologists
over the years to the well-made ceramics
manufactured by the Caddo peoples, and
the analysis of Caddo ceramics is integral
to the study of any Caddo site in the
four-state Caddoan archeological area.

The Caddos made ceramics in a wide

variety of vessel shapes (see Reynolds
1992) and with an abundance of well-
crafted and executed (L. Johnson 1992)
body and rim designs and surface treat-
ments (Table 13.1). From the archeologi-
cal contexts in which Caddo ceramics
have been found, as well as inferences
about their manufacture and use, it is evi-
dent that ceramics were important to the
prehistoric Caddos in the cooking and
serving of foods and beverages, in the
storage of foodstuffs, as personal posses-
sions, as beautiful works of art and crafts-
manship (i.e., some vessels were clearly
made to never be used in domestic con-
texts), and as social identiﬁers (certain
shared and distinctive stylistic motifs and
decorative patterns marked closely related
communities and constituent groups)
(David et al. 1988; Thurmond 1985).
The Caddos made both ﬁnewares
(with very ﬁnely crushed temper [Scham-
bach and Miller 1984, 109]), including
bottles and many bowls, and utility wares
(some of the simple bowls, as well as the
jars that were made in a variety of sizes).
Almost without exception, Caddoan ce-
ramics were tempered with grog (crushed
sherds) or bone, although burned and
crushed shells were used as temper after
ca. a.d. 1300 among most of the Red
River Caddo groups (see Bruseth 1998;
Schambach and Miller 1984) and on later
Caddoan sites in the lower and upper
Sulphur River basin (see Cliff and Perttula
1995; Fields et al. 1994b). After adding
the temper to the clay, the kneaded clay
was formed into clay coils that were added
to ﬂat disk bases to form the vessel, and
the coils were apparently smoothed with
a round river pebble to create the ﬁnished

vessel form. Decorations and slips were
added before as well as after baking in an
open ﬁre, and commonly the vessels were
then burnished and polished; red ochre
and white kaolinite clay pigments were
often added to or painted onto the deco-
rations on bottles and carinated bowls.

These kinds of ceramics were designed

to serve different purposes within Cad-
doan communities and family groups—
from use as a cooking pot to the mortuary
function of a ceremonial beaker—and
this functional variety is reﬂected in dif-
ferences in paste, surface treatment, ﬁring
methods, decoration, and vessel form be-
tween the two wares. Both the early and
the later Caddoan ﬁnewares were usually
well polished and decorated with ﬁne-
line incised and engraved designs. The
earlier Caddoan ﬁneware designs are cur-

vilinear, rectilinear, and horizontal and
frequently cover the entire vessel surface
(Figs. 13.21a–n and 13.22a–p); other
ﬁneware designs simply are placed on the
rim, or sometimes on the interior rim sur-
face. In general, the earlier Caddoan ﬁne-
wares across northeastern Texas (and
indeed extending across much of the
Caddoan area itself ) are quite uniform
in style and form, suggesting broad and
extensive social interaction between
Caddoan groups across the region. The
use of a red hematite slip on interior
and/or exterior surfaces of carinated
bowls and bottles occurs with some regu-
larity in Early and Middle Caddoan pe-
riod ceramic assemblages in various parts
of northeastern Texas (particularly the
upper Sabine and Cypress drainage ba-
sins), and in the case of Maxey Noded

13-A2946  4/13/04  12:32 PM  Page 390

ceramics in individual drainages, or even
within speciﬁc smaller segments of river
and creek basins (e.g., Thurmond 1985,
1990a; Perttula et al. 1993a). This diver-
sity can be reasonably interpreted to be
representative of speciﬁc Caddoan social
groups. In historic Caddoan times, ce-
ramic vessel forms and decorations are
considerably more homogeneous across
much of the Caddoan area, suggesting ex-
tensive intraregional contact between
contemporaneous Caddoan groups (Pert-
tula 1992a, 154 and Table 14).

There is an interesting temporal trend
in the Caddoan ceramics from parts of the
Red River valley (in northwestern Louisi-
ana) below the Great Bend, the middle
Sabine River basin, and the Neches-
Angelina River basins for larger portions
of vessel surfaces to be decorated, particu-
larly with the introduction of brushing on
the bodies of utility jars. Consequently,
through time, ceramic assemblages have
lower proportions of undecorated sherds
(see Girard 1996, 24). Analyses of the
ceramics from several different contexts
in the Red, middle Sabine, and Neches-
Angelina River basins document this trend
nicely, with pre– a.d. 1200 Caddoan sites
such as Festervan (16BO327), 41SY81
(Robinson 1997b), and Bison (Mc-
Clurkan et al. 1966) having plain/deco-
rated sherd ratios between 2.97 and 4.80.
Thirteenth- and fourteenth-century sites,
including Vanceville (16BO7, submound
midden and residential areas) and Tyson,
have plain/decorated sherd ratios of 1.30
to 1.61. Late Caddoan sites at McGee
Bend Reservoir (including Walter Bell,
Etoile, and Wylie Price; see Jelks 1965),
Toledo Bend Reservoir (Salt Lick, Goode,
and Bison, Area B; see McClurkan et al.
1966; Woodall 1969), and Vanceville dat-
ing between ca. a.d. 1450 and 1650 have
ratios of 0.56 to 1.03. Just the opposite
trend is apparent, however, on the middle
Red River in Late Caddoan contexts, as
the plain/decorated sherd ratio in Mc-
Curtain phase contexts at the Roitsch–
Sam Kaufman site is 49.0. This ratio
clearly indicates that the McCurtain
phase ceramics are from a different Late
Caddoan stylistic tradition, one compris-
ing predominantly plain vessels and large
rim-decorated vessels with plain bodies.

Table 13.1 indicates the impressive di-

versity of vessel forms among the Cad-
doan ﬁnewares. This diversity includes

Fig. 13.22. Early Caddoan bottles, bowls, and jars: a– e, l, curvilinear and scroll engraved;

Redware the squat, long-necked bottles
also have appliquéd and/or punctated de-
signs below the neck of the bottle (see
Krieger 1946; D. Suhm and Jelks 1962).
The later Caddoan ﬁneware designs in
northeastern Texas include scrolls, scrolls
with ticked lines, scrolls and circles, nega-
tive ovals and circles, pendant triangles,
diagonal lines and ladders, and S-shaped
motifs (Fig. 13.23a– e, h; also Fields et al.
1994b, ﬁg. 13; Middlebrook 1994; Perino
1994, ﬁgs. 9 –14; Shafer 1981b; D. Suhm
and Jelks 1962). These kinds of decora-
tive elements continued in use in historic
Caddoan ceramics (that is, until about
a.d. 1800 [Gregory 1973]). They are best
exempliﬁed by the intricate scrolls, ovals,

and circles on Hudson Engraved and
Keno Trailed bottles and Natchitoches
Engraved bowls among Red River Cad-
doan groups; the scrolls and ticks of Pat-
ton Engraved among Hasinai Caddo
groups south of the Sabine River (Fields
1981, 1995); and the pendant triangles
and engraved scrolls on Womack En-
graved bowls on the upper Sabine (Duf-
ﬁeld and Jelks 1961; Jelks 1967) and the
middle Red River (Harris et al. 1965).

The later Caddoan ﬁnewares (that is,
dating after ca. a.d. 1300/1400) are also
more stylistically diverse across northeast-
ern Texas, and there are very speciﬁc dif-
ferences in vessel shapes, designs, and
decorative attributes between Caddoan

carinated bowls, deep compound bowls,
double and triple vessels (joined bowls and
bottles [D. Suhm and Jelks 1962, plates
38k, 51e, 59d]), bottles, ollas, zoomorphic
and anthropomorphic efﬁgy bowls and
bottles, ladles, platters, peaked jars, gourd-
and box-shaped bowls, and chalices.

The Caddoan utility vessels usually
have a coarser paste, a rougher surface
treatment, and thicker body walls than the
ﬁnewares, probably because the cooking
pot needed to withstand thermal shock
and cracking during use (see the experi-
mental studies by Schiffer et al. 1994 on
the thermal response of cooking pots).
Typical utility vessel shapes included small

to large jars (see Figs. 13.21t, 13.22q, and
13.23f, g) as well as a variety of conical
and simple bowl forms, most of the latter
in the earlier Caddoan ceramics (and the
historic Caddoan ceramics) having been
plain and unpolished. The utility vessels
have carbon encrustations, food residues,
and soot stains, suggesting they were em-
ployed by the Caddos as cooking pots.
Some of these kinds of vessels (those with
large oriﬁce diameters and vessel volumes)
were used primarily for storage of food-
stuffs and liquids.

While plain utility vessels were com-
monly used by Caddoan groups in north-
eastern Texas, particularly before ca. a.d.

1300 –1400 (see Table 13.1), they were
also decorated in a variety of ways. The
earlier Caddoan utility wares had hori-
zontal (see Fig. 13.21o–r) and cross-
hatched incised lines; ﬁngernail impres-
sions (see Fig. 13.21s, t); pinching,
ﬁngernail, and tool punctates on the rim
and bodies; and neck-banding, at least
south of the Sabine River (see Newell and
Krieger 1949; also Fig. 13.22q). Brushing
of vessel bodies is a form of surface treat-
ment that is notable after ca. a.d. 1300 in
the Cypress Creek basin, in Middle Cad-
doan period sites such as Carlisle and
Bryan Hardy on the middle reaches of
the Sabine River (Perttula et al. 1993b),

392 / EASTERN AND NORTHERN TEXAS

Caddoan ceramics were apparently
widely traded in Texas, as they have been
found in signiﬁcant quantities at north-
central, east-central, central, and inland
southeastern Texas archeological sites
(Story 1990, 247). The earlier Caddoan
ceramics (dating before ca. a.d. 1300)
were most widely distributed in the upper
Trinity and Brazos River basins of north-
central Texas (see Perttula et al. 1995b,
190), and in inland southeastern Texas,
while the Late Caddoan ceramic wares
appear to have been most commonly ex-
changed with east-central and central
Texas groups after a.d. 1300, as well as
with prehistoric peoples living along the
Trinity River in inland southeastern Texas
(McClurkan 1968). Caddoan ceramic
ﬁnewares were also traded extensively in
parts of the Midwest and southeastern
United States, most notably after ca.
a.d. 1300 –1400 with Native American
groups living in the Lower Mississippi
Valley of Arkansas and Louisiana (Early
1993, 232 –33), as well as far aﬁeld (such
as central Kansas [Wedel 1959]).

Other types of ceramic artifacts manu-

factured by prehistoric Caddoan groups
include ceramic earspools and disks, ﬁgu-
rines, and a variety of pipe forms (A. Jack-
son 1933, 71). The earliest types of Cad-
doan clay pipes were plain, tubular, and
cigar-shaped forms, followed by the long-
stem “Red River” pipes (Hoffman 1967)
with burnished and polished stems and
bowls; rectangular platform pipes and
some elbow pipe forms (Bruseth and Pert-
tula 1981, ﬁgs. 5 –11a, b) have also been
recovered in Caddoan sites dating before
a.d. 1200. The later Caddoan pipe forms
in northeastern Texas are biconical and
elbow pipe forms with small bowls (less
than 25 mm) and small stem diameters
(less than 25 mm) (see A. Jackson 1933,
plates 16 –18).

Two recent advances in the study of
Caddoan ceramics hold great promise for
increasing our knowledge about prehis-
toric stylistic, technological, and func-
tional changes in this material culture.
First, compositional analyses using petro-
graphic and chemical characterizations
are now being used on samples of Cad-
doan ceramics (see Fischbeck et al. 1989;
Steponaitis et al. 1996) to discern manu-
facturing techniques, the source and re-
gional distributions of particular wares,
and the functional characteristics of dif-

and at Knight’s Bluff on the lower Sul-
phur River (Cliff 1997; see also Jelks
1961).

Engraved curvilinear, scroll, and hori-
zontal and/or diagonal motifs were com-
monly employed on the carinated bowls
and bottles. These designs include such
deﬁned types as Hickory Engraved, Holly
Fine Engraved, Spiro Engraved, Sanders
Engraved, and Haley Engraved for pre–
a.d. 1400 sites (D. Suhm and Jelks 1962;
R. Turner 1995). The types of decora-
tions and/or surface treatments on later
Caddoan utility vessels included neck-

banding or corrugation (Fig. 13.24c),
brushing, ridging, appliqué (Perino 1994,
ﬁgure 7e, f, h), and combinations of
zoned and diagonal incised and punc-
tated designs on the rim and body of jars
(see Fig. 13.24b, d). In historic Caddoan
times, dating after ca. a.d. 1650/1700,
rows of ﬁngernail punctations on the rims
of everted-rim Emory Punctated-Incised
jars are also a common decorative treat-
ment in artifacts from Caddoan sites
along the Red River and in the Sabine
River basin. Handles and lugs were pres-
ent on some of the utility vessels.

1961), while Belcher phase sites are dis-
tributed from about Fulton, Arkansas, to
below Shreveport, Louisiana (D. Kelley
1997; Schambach 1983; C. Webb 1959).
Upstream from the Texarkana phase, the
McCurtain phase represents another Late
Caddoan archeological complex (Bruseth
1998) (Fig. 13.26).

In the Texarkana and Belcher phase ar-

eas, sites include large, permanent settle-
ments with mounds and cemeteries,
hamlets, and farmsteads. The mound
centers were marked by the construction
of earthen mounds that were used as
temples, burial mounds, or ceremonial
ﬁre mounds (see D. Kelley 1998; C. Webb
1959). These settlements were inhabited
by sedentary Caddo agricultural commu-
nities with complex societies led by indi-
viduals with high status who lived at the
mound centers (e.g., Story 1990). Sites
such as Belcher (16CD13), Battle Mound
(3LA1), Hatchel (41BW3), Moore/
Higginbotham (3MI3/30), and Cabe
Mounds (41BW14) represent the larger
villages or towns (Creel 1996; D. Kelley
and Coxe 1998; Kelley and Guccione
1997; Perttula et al. 1995a; Sierzchula
et al. 1995), while known Texarkana
phase and Belcher phase hamlets or farm-
steads have been investigated at the Sher-
win, Atlanta State Park (Harris et al.
1980), and 41MX5 (Brewington et al.
1995) sites for the Texarkana phase,
and Cedar Grove (3LA97), Spirit Lake
(3LA83), and Cox for the Belcher phase.
These settlements—both the larger com-
munities and the smaller hamlets/farm-
steads—had pole and grass structures,
outdoor ramadas or arbors, household
cemeteries, and midden deposits from
household refuse. The 1691 Terán de los
Rios map of the Nasoni village on the
Red River documented the likely charac-
ter of individual farmstead compounds
(see Perttula et al. 1995a, ﬁg. 3) and the
layout of a dispersed village. In north-
western Louisiana, Belcher phase sites are
distributed along recently abandoned Red
River channels and its inactive meander
belt, including Cowhide Bayou and Red
Chute Bayou in the Shreveport area (Gi-
rard 1997, ﬁg. 1).

Christine Lee’s bioarcheological analy-

ses of Middle to Late Caddoan burials
from the Hatchel-Mitchell-Moores com-
plex on the Red River near Texarkana
conclude that the “health of the Caddo

ferent kinds of vessels (Neff et al. 1998;
Perttula 1998c, 2000; Reese-Taylor
1995). For example, recent analyses of
the chemical and petrographic constitu-
ents in the pastes of Caddoan ceramic as-
semblages in the Sabine River, Cypress
Creek, and Sulphur River basins have
shown that there appear to be consistent
paste differences between the ceramics
in each of the river and creek basins
(Fig. 13.25). These differences in turn
seem to reﬂect the local basin-speciﬁc
production by Caddoan groups of ce-
ramic vessels from locally available clays
(Neff et al. 1998; Reese-Taylor 1995),
with limited evidence for the exchange of
vessels from one group to another in dif-
ferent basins. This type of analysis should
continue to prove of great utility in exam-
ining the archeological record in north-
eastern Texas (and adjacent regions) for
considerations of cultural afﬁliation, and
trade and exchange between Caddo and
non-Caddo groups, as well as for discern-
ing manufacturing techniques, raw mate-
rial use, source/regional distributions of
particular wares, and speciﬁc functional
characteristics of different kinds of vessels
(Neff 1995; O’Brien et al. 1994).

Second, a very detailed analytical clas-
siﬁcation system for decorative motifs and
patterns has been developed for Caddoan
ceramics by Frank F. Schambach of the

Arkansas Archeological Survey (Scham-
bach 1981; Schambach et al. n.d.) that
has proved useful in detecting ﬁne-scale
temporal and stylistic changes (on the or-
der of twenty to thirty years) in ceramic
decoration among prehistoric Caddoan
groups on the Red and Ouachita Rivers
in Arkansas and Louisiana (e.g., Early
1993; D. Kelley 1994, 1997; Schambach
and Miller 1984). The deﬁnition of such
stylistic attributes is well suited to the rec-
ognition of comparable design, vessel, and
rim sets across the Caddoan area. With
this kind of speciﬁc and idiosyncratic in-
formation on prehistoric vessel decora-
tions (element as well as placement) and
forms, as well as the character of stylistic
variation present at different times among
related groups (e.g., Neiman 1995), we
can conﬁdently explore the nature of so-
cial relationships among Caddo groups
“from the message and meaning ascribed
to ceramic design” (Early 1995, 4).

The Late Caddoan Period

In the Great Bend area of the Red
River, Late Caddoan archeological sites
are included in the contemporaneous
Belcher and Texarkana phases (Scham-
bach 1983). Texarkana phase sites occur
on the Red River northwest of Texarkana
to the Arkansas/Oklahoma state lines, as
well as on the lower Sulphur River ( Jelks

C. Sierzchula et al. (1995) suggest that
the Moore/Higginbotham mound center
and community a few miles downstream
from the Cabe site represents the upper
Kadohadacho village that was eventually
abandoned in 1788 (see F. Smith 1995,
77). The Belcher phase is thought to date
from ca. a.d. 1500 to the late seventeenth
century (D. Kelley 1998; Perttula 1992a).
Bruseth (1998) provides the most cur-
rent discussion of the archeological char-
acter of the Late Caddoan McCurtain
phase. As stable isotope and bioarcheo-
logical evidence has shown, the McCur-
tain phase Caddos were agricultural
peoples, depending heavily on the culti-
vation of maize as the main staple of the
diet (Colby 1997; Rose et al. 1998). Like
other Late Caddoan groups on the Red
River (see Fig. 13.26), the McCurtain
phase settlement pattern includes numer-
ous habitation sites (with household
cemeteries and substantial midden depos-
its) and mound centers, though the
mounds appear to have mainly been con-
structed between ca. a.d. 1300 and 1500.
In some instances, mound centers were
not directly associated with permanent
settlements or middens (see Wyckoff
1967). The McCurtain phase mounds
were generally constructed in one or two
stages over important public structures,
with the structure abandoned, dismantled
and/or burned, then capped with a ﬁll
zone of soil scraped from nearby deposits.
Simple and elaborate single and multiple
burials were also placed in the mounds, as
with the East Mound at the Roitsch–
Sam Kaufman site on the Red River
(Skinner et al. 1969).

Bruseth (1998) suggests that the
Caddo settlements along this stretch of
the Red River resembled the Terán-Soule
model (Schambach et al. 1983; Trubo-
witz 1984) in that Caddo villages were
composed of individual compounds of
houses and other structures associated
with mounds and the residence of a caddi
or chief. The density of McCurtain phase
sites indicates that “greater numbers of
people are living in closer proximity than
before” (Bruseth 1998, 90). At the Roitsch
site, the mound was used in McCurtain
phase times as a place for the burial of the
social elite. The mound contained a shaft
tomb with ten individuals near its center,
and many grave goods were placed in the

tances, perhaps for marriage and trade”
(Lee 1997, 176). Mean stable carbon iso-
tope values of "14.8 # 1.35 ‰ (n!28)
from ca. a.d. 1450 –1650 Caddoan sites
and of "14.2 # 1.17 ‰ (n!18) in
post-1650 protohistoric or Caddoan sites
in northeastern Texas, southwestern Ar-
kansas, and northwestern Louisiana indi-
cate the development and maintenance of

an agricultural economy (D. Kelley 1997;
Perttula 1996, 321; Rose et al. 1998).

Although poorly dated, the Texarkana
phase Caddoan sites appear to date from
ca. a.d. 1300 –1700, and mound con-
struction seems to coincide with the main
period of settlement at the Hatchel site,
from about a.d. 1400 to 1700 (Creel
1996). Both archeological and historical
information suggests that the main plat-
form mound at the Hatchel site may be
the templo or temple mound shown on the
1691 Terán de los Rios map (M. Wedel
1978, 8). The Cabe mound may also have
been occupied at this time, and Michael

tomb (Skinner et al. 1969). Special pur-
pose salt-processing areas (such as the Salt
Well Slough site [41RR204]) are also com-
mon in the vicinity of the Roitsch site.
Radiocarbon dates from McCurtain

phase contexts at the Roitsch–Sam
Kaufman, Holdeman (41RR11; Perino
1995), and Rowland Clark (41RR77;
Perino 1994) sites indicate that the Mc-
Curtain phase can be divided into early
(ca. a.d. 1300/1350 –1500) and late (ca.
a.d. 1500 –1700) contexts (see Bruseth
1998), with corresponding changes in ce-
ramic decorative styles and arrow point
shapes. The early McCurtain phase resi-
dential and mortuary features at the
Holdeman site date to a.d. 1392 –1478 at
1-sigma and a.d. 1332 –1513 at Roitsch-
Sam Kaufman (Perttula 1998a, table 1),
while calibrated dates from later ceramic
features at the Rowland Clark site range
from a.d. 1502 to 1603. Calibrated ra-
diocarbon dates from the Peerless Bot-
toms site (41HP175) in the upper Sul-
phur River basin, having virtually the
same variety of Caddoan ceramics as early
McCurtain phase sites on the Red River,
range between a.d. 1330 and 1524
(Fields et al. 1994b).

The Frankston phase comprises farm-
steads, hamlets, and small villages in the
Neches and Angelina River basins in
northeastern Texas (see Fig. 13.26) that
date from ca. a.d. 1400 –1650. Only a
single Frankston phase mound is known,
the A. C. Saunders site (41AN19; see
A. T. Jackson 1936; Kleinschmidt 1982).
This small mound (2.2 m in height and
26 by 33 m in length and width) had a
thick ash beds and ﬁll zones and probably
represents a Caddoan ﬁre temple used
by the social and political elite of one
Frankston phase “afﬁliated group” (Story
and Creel 1982, 36 and ﬁg. 8). South of
the mound a short distance was a large
midden deposit that capped a circular
structure, perhaps an important public fa-
cility based on its impressive size (14 by
13 m), and several large interior hearths.
The structure was built and dismantled in
the sixteenth century (based on Klein-
schmidt’s seriation of Frankston phase ce-
ramics, then capped by the midden de-
posits [Kleinschmidt 1982, 240 and 46,
respectively]). The midden deposits con-
tained an abundance of Caddoan artifacts
from apparent residential settlement, in-

cluding an estimated 1,291 ceramic vessel
sections (dominated by Poynor Engraved
bowls, Bullard Brushed and Maydelle In-
cised jars, and LaRue Neck-Banded jars),
elbow pipes, Perdiz arrow points, stone
drills, mussel shell digging tools, an as-
sortment of bone tools (awls, needles, and
beamers), and columella shell beads.
Other Frankston phases are repre-
sented by small residential settlements in
dispersed agricultural communities, with
small family and/or community cemeter-
ies not used for long periods of time (see
K. Anderson 1972; K. Anderson et al.
1974; L. Johnson 1961b; Shafer 1981b).
Keith M. Anderson notes that the con-
centration of Frankston phase sites in one
section of the upper Neches River basin
comprises “base settlement clusters [with
middens, burials, and structures, likely
representing permanent settlements] on
streamside ﬂats with fertile soils in the . . .
uplands. Other site types include scat-
tered sherds, gathering stations in which
pitted stones are found with a few sherds,
and small campsites” (K. Anderson 1972,
163) The Omer and Otis Hood cemetery
with twenty burials (Kleinschmidt 1982;
D. Suhm et al. 1954) is one of the larger
known Frankston phase cemeteries.
Many others have fewer than ten individ-
uals (Kleinschmidt 1982, 214), laid out
individually in extended supine position,
with a variety of grave goods (principally
ceramic vessels). In at least one instance, a
Frankston phase cemetery in the upper
Neches River basin in Smith County,
Texas, contains the burial of socially elite
individuals in a family and/or village
cemetery context. This particular burial
was in a pit 3.6 m wide and had three in-
dividuals. Among the funerary objects
placed with the multiple burial were
twenty-one pottery vessels, a groundstone
celt, and a large chipped biface ( Jowell
knife); baskets or matting were apparently
also present in the grave (K. Anderson
1972, 139 – 40).

Tom Middlebrook (1994, 26 –29, and

ﬁg. 4) discusses the character of “late”
Angelina focus or phase sites in the McGee
Bend Reservoir (Lake Sam Rayburn; see
Jelks 1965), segregating them from other
earlier Caddoan sites in the lake and
nearby areas (such as the Tyson site) on
the basis of: (1) an abundance of ceramic
elbow pipes; (2) high proportions of

brushed sherds (from Broaddus Brushed
jars); and (3) lower proportions of Pine-
land Punctated-Incised sherds compared
to the brushed utility wares. He identiﬁes
the Walter Bell (41SB50) and Etoile
(41NA11) sites as “late,” and Wylie Price
(41SA94) also appears to have a “late”
component. Additionally, these late or
ca. post–a.d. 1450/1500 Angelina focus
or phase sites have plain/decorated sherd
ratios between 0.80 and 1.03 (see dis-
cussion above), while ratios of 1.53 to
1.83 at the Sawmill (41SA89), Blount
(41SA123), and Tyson sites indicate that
they date to the Middle Caddoan period.
Both the Walter Bell and the Etoile
sites have small midden deposits, evi-
dence for circular structures, pit features,
and/or burials. The three structures at
Walter Bell range from 6.4 to 12 m in di-
ameter ( Jelks 1965, 56 – 60, and ﬁg. 22).
This site also had a small cemetery with
extended and ﬂexed burials of children
and adults. Funerary objects placed with
the deceased included one to six vessels
per individual, Perdiz arrow points, conch
shell beads, deer ulna tools and deer food
offerings, mussel shells, and engraved bird
bone ﬂageolets ( Jelks 1965, ﬁg. 93b, c).
The engraved designs included small and
large rows of triangles.

Late Caddoan communities are pres-

ent in the Toledo Bend area along the
Sabine River and tributaries in north-
western Louisiana and extreme eastern
Sabine and Shelby Counties in northeast-
ern Texas (see Fig. 13.26), particularly
along Palo Gaucho Creek near the La
Nana and Camino Arriba crossings of El
Camino de los Tejas, an ancestral Caddo
trace (W. Martin et al. 1995; McClurkan
et al. 1966; Woodall 1969). These sites—
such as Goode (16SA1), Bison, Area B
(16SA4), and Salt Lick (16SA37a)—
have extensive midden deposits (0.3 to
1.5 acres) with evidence of residential fea-
tures (postholes, hearths, and trash pits)
and small cemeteries. At Bison, Area B,
J. Ned Woodall (1969) encountered two
large trash/storage pits, ﬁve possible char-
coal-ﬁlled smudge pits, and a number of
postholes from a possible rectilinear
structure or an arbor near a family resi-
dence. Plain/decorated sherd ratios of
0.69 to 1.21 from Bison, Area B, Salt
Lick, and Goode indicate the Late Cad-
doan settlements along this stretch of the

Sabine River were contemporaneous with
Angelina phase Caddoan communities in
the Angelina-Attoyac drainage basins to
the west some forty to ﬁfty kilometers.
Cemeteries of a size and character
comparable to those of the Frankston and
Angelina phase groups were also present
in these Late Caddoan archeological sites
in the Toledo Bend Reservoir area. At
Salt Lick, there were four extended buri-
als and ﬁve ﬂexed burials (McClurkan
et al. 1966), while the Bison site, Area B,
had ﬁfteen extended burials and a single
ﬂexed burial. Common mortuary goods
included ceramic vessels, Perdiz and Bas-
sett arrow points, ceramic elbow pipes,
mussel shells, deer bones, and clay pig-
ments; one burial at the Bison site had
sandstone pulley-shaped earspools. In
terms of their ceramics, these Caddoan
groups have afﬁliations with Titus phase
groups to the north and with contempo-
raneous Caddoan groups living to the
west in the Neches-Angelina River basins.
Using the same mortuary treatment crite-
ria employed in identifying elite burials in
Titus phase cemeteries (burial in shaft
tomb, burial in mound, burials with large
chipped bifaces, burials with large quanti-
ties of grave goods, and multiple burials
with quantities of grave goods), Perttula
and Nelson (1998, 394 and table 24)
have identiﬁed Burial 4 at the Bison site,
Area B (16SA4; see Woodall 1969) as
that of an adult male of presumed high
rank and comparable (based on quantities
of grave goods) to elite adult male burials
among his Titus phase neighbors.

The Titus Phase: Boundaries,
Time, and People

The Late Caddoan Titus phase (ca.
a.d. 1430 –1680) represents the archeo-
logical remains of a number of Caddoan
groups who lived between the Sabine and
Sulphur Rivers in the northeastern Texas
Pineywoods. These Caddoan peoples
lived in dispersed year-round settlements
where they farmed and hunted, buried
their dead in planned cemeteries, and
manufactured culturally distinctive ce-
ramics of considerable stylistic and func-
tional diversity. The same may be said for
the contemporaneous Frankston phase
groups in the upper Neches and Angelina
River basins (Kleinschmidt 1982; Story
and Creel 1982) and Late Caddoan
groups living in the Angelina River and

Attoyac Bayou basins (Middlebrook
1994).

Sociopolitically, these Pineywoods
Caddos were somewhat akin to the Kado-
hadacho Caddo groups on the Red River
that had elite-controlled and hierarchi-
cally ranked societies (see Barker and
Pauketat 1992). There are considerable
archeological similarities in patterns of
mound construction and mortuary be-
havior between the Titus phase groups
and the Belcher, McCurtain, and Texar-
kana phase groups along the Red River
(Bruseth 1998; Gregory 1980; Thur-
mond 1990a; C. Webb 1959) and in
terms of inferred sociopolitical organiza-
tion (e.g., F. Smith 1994). In historic
times, however, Europeans described
these Pineywoods Caddo groups in the
Sabine and Cypress basins in only a cur-
sory fashion, unlike the Kadohadacho
and Hasinai groups to the north, east,
and south (see F. Smith 1995). Scrutiny
of the archeological record of these Piney-
woods Caddos illustrates their social, eco-
nomic, and political dynamism during
times of signiﬁcant cultural change in the
Caddoan area (e.g., Jeter et al. 1989; Pert-
tula 1992a; Story 1990).

Several hundred Titus phase compo-
nents have been identiﬁed in the Piney-
woods of northeastern Texas. The largest
concentration of Titus phase components
is found in the Cypress Bayou (or Big
Cypress Creek) valley (Perttula 1995b,
ﬁg. 10; Thurmond 1990a, ﬁg. 35), with a
scattering of sites throughout the Little
Cypress Creek valley, the middle portions
of the Sulphur River, the middle and up-
per portions of the White Oak Creek
drainage, and the upper and middle
reaches of the Sabine River drainage
(Fig. 13.27). Related Late Caddoan com-
munities are present in the Toledo Bend
area along the Sabine River in north-
western Louisiana and extreme eastern
Sabine and Shelby Counties in north-
eastern Texas, and J. Peter Thurmond
(1991, personal communication) refers
to them as the Toledo Bend subcluster
within the Titus phase Cypress cluster
(see above).

For the most part, the general regional

limits of the Titus phase are well estab-
lished, but information on the intra-
regional density of sites (including large
cemeteries) is still rather biased due to
limited professional investigations across

the region as a whole (see Perttula et al.
1986, 35 –59; Thurmond 1990a, ﬁg. 5),
extensive pot hunting on Cypress Bayou,
and the lack (until quite recently) of an
avocational archeological network in the
Pineywoods (Nelson and Perttula 1993,
1997). Thus, “apparent site density
within the Cypress basin . . . is largely a
function of survey intensity” (Thurmond
1990a, 32).

The Late Caddoan period as currently
deﬁned extends from a.d. 1400 to 1680
(Story 1990, 334). In the northeastern
Texas Pineywoods, both the Whelan and
Titus phases extend into this period. Cal-
ibrated radiocarbon dates for the Whelan
phase indicate it began around a.d. 1350,
with the Titus phase dated from ca. a.d.
1450 to the mid- to late 1600s (Perttula
1992a, 102 –107; Perttula et al. 1998;
Thurmond 1990a). The chronological
span of the earlier of the two phases is
poorly developed because of the virtual
absence of absolute dates for the Late
Caddoan period sequence (Story 1990,
table 81; Thurmond 1990a, table 60),
but archeologists undertaking recent ex-
cavations in the Big Cypress Creek, White
Oak Creek, and Sulphur River basins
(e.g., Fields et al. 1994b; Galan 1998;
Horizon Environmental Services 1995;
Kotter et al. 1991, 1993; Nash et al.
1995; Parsons 1998; Perttula et al. 1998;
Perttula n.d.) have aggressively pursued
site dating strategies. More than 80 cali-
brated radiocarbon dates and more than
160 oxidizable carbon ratio (OCR) dates
(see, e.g., Frink 1994) from Titus phase
contexts suggest that this phase dates
from ca. a.d. 1430 –1680 (Perttula n.d.;
Perttula and Nelson 1998, table 21).

Thurmond (1985, 1990a) has pro-
posed that the Titus phase is composed of
four contemporaneous spatial subclusters
within the larger Cypress cluster: the
Three Basins, Tankersley Creek, Swauano
Creek, and Big Cypress Creek (Thur-
mond 1990a, ﬁg. 35). This spatial sub-
cluster model is in contrast to the inter-
pretations of Robert L. Turner (1978),
who proposes early and late chronological
subdivisions within the Titus phase based
on motif variations on Ripley Engraved
carinated bowls and on changes in vessel
form. Examination of the association of
vessel forms, motifs, arrow point types,
and available radiocarbon dates for the
Titus phase suggests a simple alternative:

that both spatial and temporal factors con-
tribute to the archeological character of
the Titus phase and its subclusters (Pert-
tula 1992a). The subclusters appeared to
have maintained a regional or local spatial
integrity, “while at the same time there
were diachronic changes in their formal
composition that . . . permit establishing
a detailed temporal sequence” (Perttula
1992a, 106).

Each of the subclusters are deﬁned by
Thurmond (1985, 1990a) on the basis of
different Ripley Engraved bowl motifs or
motif combinations, other shared pottery

types of the engraved ﬁnewares, and dif-
ferent proportions of various arrow point
styles. The subclusters are characterized
by a distinctive constellation of ceramic
and lithic styles (Thurmond 1985, 193 –
94). In Period 2 of the Cypress cluster,
dating from ca. a.d. 1450 to 1550/1600
(estimated), Ripley Engraved is most
common, along with Maydelle Incised,
Bullard Brushed, and Harleton Appliqué
ceramic types. Period 3 of the Cypress
cluster, the “classic” Titus phase, may
have lasted only into the early 1600s, and
it certainly seems to have ended by 1700

at the latest (Thurmond 1990a, 1990b).
Again, Ripley Engraved is the most com-
mon ﬁneware in the grave lots. There are
also a number of Red River valley trade
wares present in the Period 3 burials of
the Titus phase, such as Avery Engraved
(see Fig. 13.24a) and Simms Engraved.
Thurmond (1985, 191) has argued
that the Titus phase spatial groups denote
sociopolitically integrated separate tribes
or subtribes similar to the confederacies
known historically among the Hasinai or
the Red River Kadohadacho groups.
Thus, the larger Cypress cluster is “the

archeological manifestation of a series of
social groups banded together in a so-
ciopolitical structure analogous to and at
least partially contemporaneous with that
of the Hasinai to the south and the Kado-
hadacho to the northeast. Four subclus-
ters . . . are believed to represent the indi-
vidual component groups comprising this
afﬁliated group” (Thurmond 1985, 196).
No direct measurements of prehistoric

demography are possible for the Titus
phase, but changes in settlement count
over time in the Cypress Creek and Lake
Fork Creek basins do indicate that there
was a steady increase in the number and
relative frequency of prehistoric sites
through the lengthy Archaic period
(6000 b.c. to a.d. 1), followed by a de-
crease in the Woodland period (a.d. 1–
800), and then a substantial increase in
the Early and Middle Caddoan periods
(Bruseth 1987; Thurmond 1990a). The
highest number and density of compo-
nents occur during the Late Caddoan
period (Table 13.2).

Studies in the Lake Fork Creek basin

(Bruseth 1987; Bruseth and Perttula
1981; Perttula et al. 1993a) and investi-
gations in portions of the Big Sandy
Creek (Perttula et al. 1986) and Little
Cypress Creek basins (Glander et al.
1993; Horizon Environmental Services,
Inc., 1993, 1995), as well as at Caddo
Lake (Cliff and Peter 1994a, 141), are
similar to Thurmond’s overall results for
the Cypress Creek Basin in conﬁrming
the high frequency of Late Caddoan oc-
cupations. Clearly, regional Caddoan

populations were extensive throughout
much of the Pineywoods after ca. a.d.
1350. Nevertheless, certain areas within
the region, such as the upper portions of
the Sulphur River basin (see Fields et al.
1994b; Cliff et al. 1996b) and much of
the middle reaches of the Sabine River
basin, were not apparently regularly occu-
pied on a permanent basis by Late Cad-
doan groups. Ross Fields and his coau-
thors suggest that after ca. a.d. 1400, the
upper Sulphur River basin area was the
scene of “nonintensive, presumably lim-
ited-purpose use” (Fields et al. 1997, 115).
Late Caddoan period settlements in the

Pineywoods of northeastern Texas have
been termed rural Caddoan community
systems (Perttula 1992a, 96) because they
were distributed along secondary streams,
were widely dispersed, and consisted of
functionally equivalent farmsteads and
hamlets. Similar kinds of rural communi-
ties occur throughout much of the Cad-
doan area ( Jeter et al. 1989; Story 1982,
1990).

Small mound centers were being con-
structed and used by Titus phase groups
and other Late Caddoan societies up to
ca. a.d. 1500 (and possibly later) in north-
eastern Texas, but they lack evidence of
burial mounds or large platforms; rather,
they contained mounds that buried
burned structures. The larger Caddoan
“towns” were distributed along the major
stream valleys, such as the Red, Ouachita,
and Little Rivers. These communities
were hierarchically arranged. At the top
were civic-ceremonial centers (those with

platform and burial mounds), then asso-
ciated “towns” of linear but dispersed
farmstead compounds with several struc-
tures, such as bark- or brush-covered shel-
ters and storage platforms (Schambach
1983, 7–8), then hamlets, farmsteads,
and specialized processing and/or pro-
curement locales (such as salt-making
sites [Early 1993]) (see also Gregory
1980, 356 –57).

Thurmond (1990a) recognizes three
types of Titus phase settlements: limited
use areas, small settlements, and large
settlements. The limited use areas were
seasonally occupied locations where ex-
tractive/processing activities took place,
while the settlements were year-round
habitations. Small settlements (ranging
between 0.2 and 1.8 ha in size, with mid-
den accumulations and wattle-and-daub
concentrations) account for 73 percent of
the known Titus phase settlements in the
Cypress Creek basin, the limited use areas
account for 23 percent, and the large
settlements (those larger than 1.8 ha, with
midden accumulations as well as wattle-
and-daub concentrations) account for
only 4 percent of the sample. One of the
more intensively investigated large Titus
phase settlements is the Pilgrim’s Pride
site (41CP304) along Big Cypress Creek
at its conﬂuence with Walkers Creek
(Perttula n.d.). Residential areas at the
site cover between 5 and 10 acres, with
more than one hundred pit features, sev-
eral circular structures, midden deposits,
and more than twenty burials, along with
an open, plaza-like area. Several of the
burials appear to have been placed in and
near the ﬂoors of structures, but the Pil-
grim’s Pride site also had a planned ceme-
tery with at least nineteen burials.

The settlements appear to have been
composed of one to several family units,
with house middens/daub concentrations
and trash midden mounds. The range of
domestic materials recovered in the mid-
den mounds (see, e.g., Perttula et al.
1993c), along with limited evidence of
structure rebuilding, suggests that most
Titus phase settlements were occupied
only about a generation, when the settle-
ment was moved to another area where
farming was possible. Small family ceme-
teries typically occurred nearby (Bruseth
1987; Perttula et al. 1993c; Thurmond
1990a) (Fig. 13.28).

avocational focus on the cemeteries that
occur on Titus phase settlements, few
speciﬁcs are available on the types of
houses and storage structures used by
these groups. (Recent excavations at the
Rookery Ridge [41UR133] and Earspool
[41TT653] sites have uncovered houses
of this period that will provide much use-
ful information when the results of the
excavations are published; see Galan 1998
and Parsons 1998.) Based on a few exca-
vated Late Caddoan structures in the
Pineywoods (some of which were in
mounds and may thus not be at all
characteristic of domestic structures
[Fig. 13.29]), the single pole structures
were probably circular in shape, were
thatched and wattled, measured between
5 and 8 m in diameter, and may have
had, on occasion, extended entranceways
(Clark and Ivey 1974; Galan 1998; Par-
sons 1998; Perttula n.d.; Thurmond
1990a, 144, 146, 148, 168, 210 –11).
Structures had central hearths and center
posts, possible interior benches and racks
for sleeping and above-ground storage
purposes, as well as storage and trash pits.
Residential structures had some midden
accumulation on their ﬂoors (i.e., house
middens), which were not prepared or
lined with clay, but the vast majority of
the daily trash and refuse was deposited
on the nearby trash midden mound.

When Pedro Vial visited the Nadaco
Caddo “village” near the Sabine River
in 1788 (probably in the vicinity of
Longview and Marshall, Texas), he de-
scribed it as having thirteen to ﬁfteen
houses scattered over a distance of three
leagues (about eight miles) (Nasatir and
Loomis 1967, 344 – 45). The houses or
ranchos of the Nadaco were evidently dis-
tributed mainly along tributaries of the
Sabine River (B. Jones 1968; Perttula
1992a, 177).

The best information on the distribu-

tion of Titus phase settlements in the
Pineywoods comes from Thurmond’s
(1990a) study of the archeology of the
Cypress Creek basin. Titus phase sites
tend to occur on valley terraces, upland
projections, and upland slope landforms,
with the greatest use of minor (2 to
10 km2) and upland basins. Fifty-four
percent of all Titus phase components
(including farmsteads, hamlets, villages,
cemeteries, and a small number of ex-
tractive/processing sites) occur in the up-

Fig. 13.28. Settlement plan at the Burks site (41WD52), Wood County, Texas.

cultural materials at the small settlement
at the Burks site (41WD52), a Three Ba-
sins subcluster component, indicate that
the disposal of broken pottery vessels,
tools, and animal bones was patterned
across the site itself (Perttula 1995b, ﬁg.
13). The materials were concentrated in
trash midden deposits (Middens A and
D) adjacent to other middens that may
mark the locations of two to four struc-
tures; a family cemetery was present
south of the residential compound (see
Fig. 13.28). Midden mounds up to one

meter in height were common on Titus
phase settlements before they began to be
plowed in historic times. Excavations at
Late Caddoan Pineywoods settlements
also suggest that many activities occurred
outside the houses, resulting in trash-
ﬁlled pits, hearths, and posts in these ar-
eas. There may also have been ramadas
and granaries in these areas, along with
concentrations of artifacts and debris
(Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Thurmond
1990a; Woodall 1969).

Because of the intense professional and

mond 1990a), but recently obtained ra-
diocarbon and OCR dates from the Camp
Joy mound (41UR144) and Shelby
Mound at the Tracy site (41CP71) sug-
gests that mound building may have con-
tinued in the Titus phase “heartland” un-
til about a.d. 1600 or later (Perttula n.d.;
Perttula and Nelson 1998). Only a small
number of Late Caddoan period mounds
are known in the region (Fig. 13.30),
ranging from one to four small mounds
per site, and they are unlike the types of
mound complexes typically constructed
in the major river valleys at this time
(Story 1990). Pineywoods mounds were
substructural mounds; no pyramidal plat-
form or burial mounds are known for this
time period. Substructural mounds are
generally restricted to mounds that cap a
burned circular structure that was con-
structed on the ground surface or in a
small, shallow pit. In at least two in-
stances, the mounds contained sequent
structures, but the “structures originated
at higher levels in the mound[s] due to
occupational accumulations of soil and
ash, and not the result of any deliberate
capping” (Thurmond 1990a, 168).

Thurmond suggests that the locations

of Late Caddoan period mounds in the
Cypress Creek basin appear to be associ-
ated with clusters of contemporaneous
settlements, cemeteries, and limited use
areas, “and it is therefore possible that
these concentrations of components rep-
resent the archeological manifestation
of . . . Cypress cluster constituent groups
during the [preceding] Whelan phase”
(Thurmond 1990a, 234 –35). A similar
association has been noted for Middle
Caddoan mounds and settlements in
part of the middle Sabine River basin
(see Fig. 13.19 and Perttula 1989b,
1994a, ﬁg. 9).

There are two types of cemeteries used
by the Titus phase groups: the small fam-
ily cemetery and the large supralocal or
community cemetery. More than 115
Titus phase cemeteries have been docu-
mented to date (Perttula and Nelson
1998, table 22 and ﬁg. 137). Demo-
graphic proﬁles from these small cemeter-
ies appear to be representative of a family
group in that they contain roughly equal
numbers of adult males and females (see,
e.g., Rose 1984, 240). The family ceme-
tery is typically situated in immediate
proximity to the farmstead or hamlet (as
at the Burks site described above), con-

Fig. 13.29. Mound B, House No. 3, Harroun site (41UR10) (from Jelks and Tunnell 1959).

lands. Given that the majority of archeo-
logical survey efforts in the Cypress Creek
basin have concentrated on major streams
and stream valleys in general, “the fre-
quent occurrence of sites along smaller
streams is indicated. One suspects that
the occurrence of sites in upland areas
may be higher than the present data
would indicate” (Thurmond 1990a, 220).
This distribution of Titus phase settle-
ments indicates that both farmsteads and
hamlets were equally dispersed in prehis-
toric times; they were usually situated near
springs, on arable soil and level ground,
but the banks along tributary streams also
seemed to be preferred settings.

The permanent settlements and ceme-

teries of the Titus phase tend to occur in
association with freshwater springs (Thur-
mond 1990a, table 58 and ﬁg. 33).
Known Late Caddoan mound centers,
however, typically do not occur in prox-
imity to a spring but rather are on the
ﬂoodplain ﬂoor in major and intermedi-
ate basins, or they are situated on upland
projections. Associated occupations are
present on terraces, ﬂoodplain rises, or
upland projections, but are not found on
ﬂoodplain ﬂoor landforms.

Mound building in the Late Caddoan
period in the Pineywoods outside of the
Red River valley was once thought to
have ceased between roughly a.d. 1400
and 1500 (Perttula 1989a, 1993c; Thur-

PREHISTORIC AND CADDOAN ARCHEOLOGY OF THE PINEYWOODS / 401

tains few interments (typically about ten
to twenty individuals in cemeteries along
the western margins of the Titus phase
and between twenty and forty individuals
in the “heartland” along Big Cypress
bayou [Perttula and Nelson 1998]), and
offers no evidence of differential status or
social rank in grave goods associations
and burial treatment.

Burials within the family cemeteries

include single extended inhumations
within a patterned arrangement of burials
in rows; burials are oriented roughly east-
west (see M. Bell 1981; Hunt et al. 1996;
R. Turner 1978). Children were typically
buried in subﬂoor pits within the house-
hold structures themselves. According to
Thurmond, artifact associations in family
cemeteries differ only by age and sex:
“Adolescents were buried with more of-
ferings than children or infants, and with
fewer offerings than adults. The graves of
males often contain clusters of arrow-
points in patterns suggesting quivers of
arrows, and those of females contain pol-
ishing stones or more numerous pottery
vessels. Items of exotic material . . . are
extremely rare. The occurrence of graves
containing very large numbers of artifacts
is also quite limited” (Thurmond 1990a,
235 –36).

The large community cemeteries of
the Titus phase (Fig. 13.31) are the prod-
uct of interments from a number of com-
munities in the vicinity, and thus they are
reﬂective of a wider community-based
participation in ceremonial and mortuary
activities (Perttula and Nelson 1998; Story
1990, 338 –39). These cemeteries usually
contain at least 60 to 70 individuals, but
some are known that contained at least
150 to 300 individuals (Perttula 1993c;
Perttula and Nelson 1998, 1999; Story
1990; Thurmond 1990a; R. Turner
1978).

The large community cemeteries con-
tain excellent evidence for the existence of
social differentiation within the Titus
phase Caddoan communities. Since com-
munity cemeteries are recognized by the
type of burial interment, their relative
size, grave goods associations, and their
relative separation from habitation sites,
they are analogous in functional context
to the mound centers. Known commu-
nity cemeteries are not uniformly distrib-
uted among the Titus phase groups (see
Fig. 13.31) but are concentrated on Big
Cypress Bayou and several of its eastward-

ﬂowing tributaries (Walker Creek, Dry
Creek, Greasy Creek, Meddlin Creek,
and Arms Creek), which is in the Titus
phase “heartland,” with a few large ceme-
teries also known on Little Cypress and
White Oak Creeks (see Perttula et al.
1998). Presumably, this locality had the
most regionally complex sociopolitical or-
ganization and/or the highest population
densities during Late Caddoan times
(e.g., Story 1990, 339 – 40).

The larger community cemeteries are
internally organized by space and struc-
turally divided by rank (Thurmond
1990a, ﬁg. 20; R. Turner 1978, ﬁg. 3).
There is little evidence for graves’ overlap-
ping, but instead the cemeteries appeared
to have regularly expanded over time (see
Perttula 1992a, ﬁgs. 18 and 19). Since
the cemetery plan was consistently main-
tained, they may reﬂect community par-
ticipation over several generations; the
varying position of the higher-status buri-
als (as at the Tuck Carpenter and H. R.
Taylor sites) provides evidence of this spa-
tial expansion through time.

The social status ranking apparent in
the Cypress cluster burials is based on four
criteria seen in the archeological record:

1. High-status burials include large
shaft tombs and multiple interments; all
other Titus phase burials are single, individ-
ual burials. Family cemeteries do not con-
tain shaft tombs or multiple interments.

2. Quantities of grave goods are signiﬁ-

cantly higher (approximately fourteen to
ﬁfteen per burial [Perttula 1992a, table 7])
than the mean average for the regional bur-
ial population as a whole. Higher-status
burials differ from the population primarily
in the frequency of arrow points and ce-
ramic vessels placed as grave offerings (Pert-
tula 1992a, table 8).

3. Certain types of artifacts are found in
higher-status burials. One such example in
the Cypress and upper Sabine basins is the
large chipped Galt-style biface (Thurmond
1990a, 235).

4. The burials are always of adult males.

Burials of presumed high-status indi-
viduals occur in eighteen known Piney-
woods Titus phase sites, such as J. E. Galt,
Caldwell, Lower Peach Orchard, Tuck
Carpenter, H. R. Taylor, and others (see
Perttula 1992a, table 8; Perttula and Nel-
son 1998, table 24); these burials are

ies, particularly in the Titus phase “heart-
land” between the dam site at Lake Bob
Sandlin and the Lake O’ the Pines dam,
and western and southern tributaries such
as Dry Creek, Greasy Creek, and Arms
Creek. Other cemeteries with high-rank
burials occur in the Little Cypress Creek
valley, along a Sabine River tributary, and
on White Oak Bayou (Fig. 13.32). Cer-
tainly the best known and studied com-
munity cemeteries with high-status buri-
als are the Tuck Carpenter (R. Turner
1978, 1992) and H. R. Taylor (Thur-
mond 1990a) sites.

At Tuck Carpenter, high-status burials

dating between ca. a.d. 1350 and 1550
are at the center of the more than seventy
interments in the cemetery, while the lat-
est high-status burials (estimated to date
after ca. a.d. 1550 to the early 1600s) are
alongside the outside cemetery bound-
aries (see Perttula 1992a, ﬁg. 18; R. Tur-
ner 1978). With the exception of the
two multiple interments, other single,
extended interments were placed in the
cemetery in roughly aligned north-south
rows (Fig. 13.33). As to grave goods, the
high-status burials contained on average

37 items per burial (large numbers of ce-
ramic vessels and arrow points), compared
to the 14.8 items per burial for the ceme-
tery as a whole (R. Turner 1978, 1992).

The same type of burial program noted

at the Tuck Carpenter site was in use at
the H. R. Taylor site (see Perttula 1992a,
ﬁg. 19). Mean values of ceramic vessels
(8.3 per individual), arrow points (5.09
per individual), and total number of spec-
imens (14.5 per individual) as grave goods
at H. R. Taylor are not signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent from those at other Titus phase
cemeteries, but the high-status burials

Perttula and Nelson 1998). Burials from
prior to a.d. 1550 demonstrate consider-
able intraregional variability in the man-
ner of treatment, as well as in the types of
artifactual remains placed in the burials as
offerings. For example, in addition to the
multiple interments at Tuck Carpenter,
shaft tombs are represented in a pre–
a.d. 1550 cemetery at the Lower Peach
Orchard site. At the J. E. Galt site, the
high-status burial included such offerings
as a large number of celt fragments and
other native stone implements, rather
than caches of arrow points (Thurmond
1990a, table 29). Galt bifaces were also
recovered from the cemetery.

The large Titus phase cemeteries with
individuals of high status are distributed
within each of the four spatial subclusters
identiﬁed by Thurmond (1985, 1990a)
in the Cypress Creek basin (see Figs. 13.31
and 13.32). The earliest appearance of this
type of community integration occurs in
the Tankersley Creek, Three Basins, and
Swauano Creek subclusters, with the lat-
est being present in the Swauano Creek
and Big Cypress Creek subclusters. No
post–a.d. 1550 –1600 community ceme-
teries are known in the Three Basins and
Tankersley Creek subclusters, with the ex-
ception of Tuck Carpenter, which sug-
gests that many of these areas were aban-
doned by resident Caddoan groups about
this time.

In general, these community cemeter-

ies are relatively short-term mortuary
phenomena that were used intensively in
portions of the Pineywoods after about
a.d. 1550 to the early 1600s. It is proba-
bly no coincidence that the intensive use
of community cemeteries in the region
occurs generally contemporaneously with
the initial contact between Titus phase
Caddoan populations and the Spanish De
Soto/Moscoso entrada of 1542 – 43 (see
Thurmond 1990b). Bruseth (1992, 91)
interprets the short-term use of these
cemeteries as reﬂecting the passage of the
army as well as increased mortality from
European diseases. The timing in the in-
tensiﬁcation of this form of community
cemetery in the region is also of consider-
able signiﬁcance because the Titus phase
community cemeteries appear to have
replaced the use of mounds for commu-
nity ceremonial and religious functions
by about the 1550s. I have argued that
this process of replacement is a reﬂection

each contained on average between 27
and 55 items (Perttula 1992a, table 7;
Thurmond 1990a).

The segregation of interments by pre-

sumed status indicates that high-status
individuals account for 8 to 9 percent of
the burials at H. R. Taylor and Tuck Car-
penter, respectively. Low-status inter-
ments, namely those with quantities of
grave goods two standard deviations be-
low the mean average for the two sites
(between 0 to 9.0 items at Tuck Carpen-

ter and 0 to 6.7 items at H. R. Taylor),
account for 19 and 23 percent of the
burials at the two sites. Lower-status indi-
viduals at these community cemeteries
were usually adult females, juveniles, or
children. Overall, in the Titus phase mor-
tuary populations high-status individuals
account for less than 2 percent of all
known burials (Thurmond 1990a, 235).
The majority of Titus phase burials of
presumed high status appear to date after
ca. a.d. 1550 –1600 (see Perttula 1992a;

sity of vessel forms is impressive: cari-
nated bowls, compound bowls, bottles,
conoidal bowls, ollas, everted-rim jars,
square bowls, globular peaked jars, and
chalice forms. Other ﬁnewares include
zoomorphic efﬁgies and rattle bowls.

The utility vessels were tempered with

grog and grit and had a coarser paste
along with a thicker body. Small to large
jars (more than 30 cm in height with
oriﬁce diameters greater than 25 to 30
cm) and plain conical bowls were typical
utility vessel shapes. The presence of car-
bon encrustations, food residues, and
soot on many of the utility vessels indi-
cates that these pots were used for cook-
ing (e.g., Skibo 1992); the large oriﬁce
diameters and vessel volumes also sug-
gest that some utility vessels were used
primarily for storage of foodstuffs and
liquids.

The types of decorations and/or
surface treatment on the utility vessels
(Fig. 13.35) included neck banding or
corrugation, brushing, appliqué, incision,
punctation, or various combinations
thereof (Perttula et al. 1995a; R. Turner
1995, table 1). Small handles or lugs were
present on some of the utility vessels.
Based on sherd samples from domestic
contexts, utility vessels probably com-
prised between 50 and 70 percent of the
ceramic assemblages in Titus phase sites,
with proportionally fewer utility vessels in
mortuary contexts (Perttula and Nelson
1998; Thurmond 1990a).

Other ceramic artifacts manufactured
by Late Caddoan Pineywoods groups in-
clude ceramic earspools, as well as biconi-
cal and elbow pipes (see A. T. Jackson
1933). Different types of earspools in-
clude ones manufactured from siltstone
and sandstone as well as wood (R. Turner
1992, 84). One set of earspools from the
Tuck Carpenter site had been covered
with copper plate. The elbow pipes are
commonly decorated with engraved lines
that have been painted with hematite or
kaolin clay.

Generally speaking, lithic tools and
debris are uncommon on Late Caddoan
period sites in the Pineywoods, and pre-
sumably this rarity reﬂects the strong de-
velopment of wood and bone tool indus-
tries, few examples of which are preserved
in the archeological record. The tool di-
versity is low, consisting primarily of tri-
angular and corner-notched arrow points,

of changes in social complexity and the
scope of community integration, per-
haps accompanied by a spatial coales-
cence and/or decrease in settlement
density within the Pineywoods (Perttula
1992a, 115).

One of the most notable aspects of the
Late Caddoan Pineywoods archeological
record is the diverse and distinctive ab-
original ceramics that occur in domestic
and mortuary contexts. The wide variety
of vessel shapes and decorations, as well
as their frequency in domestic contexts,
demonstrates the importance of ceramics
in the Titus phase for the cooking and
serving of food, as personal possessions,
and as social identiﬁers. Both ﬁnewares
and utility wares were manufactured in
the Titus phase. Differences in paste (and
decoration) between the two wares pre-

sumably relate to technological and func-
tional variability in the way these kinds
of vessels were made and designed to be
used (e.g., Steponaitis 1984, 85 –114; see
also Reese-Taylor 1995).

The ﬁnewares were tempered with
ﬁnely crushed grog and bone and were
well polished; shell-tempered vessels are
quite rare and, when found, are typically
trade wares from the Red River Caddos.
The ﬁneware was decorated with en-
graved lines, with scrolls, scrolls and
circles, pendant triangles, and other cur-
vilinear motifs being the most common
decorative elements in the Titus phase
ceramics (Fig. 13.34). Other forms of
decoration were the application of a red
hematite slip on both interior and exte-
rior surfaces and the painting of engraved
lines with hematite or kaolin. The diver-

have been of lesser importance in the
Titus phase than they were between ca.
a.d. 900 and 1400 (Crane 1982; Perttula
and Bruseth 1983; Perttula et al. 1982).
In fact, the subsistence evidence from the
Titus phase in the Pineywoods, as well as
elsewhere in the Caddoan area, suggests
the successful development of a Caddoan
maize-based economy at this time (G. J.
Fritz 1990, 421, 425).

Vertebrate species identiﬁed in Titus
phase trash middens include deer, turkey,
cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, squirrel, and
beaver. Turtle and ﬁsh were also present
but were relatively uncommon compared
to mammals and birds. Deer and turkey
appear to have been the dominant ex-
ploitable species (Perttula et al. 1982,
1993a).

The examination of bioarcheological
remains sheds some additional light on
the subsistence character of the Titus
phase populations, but to date the results
have not been substantial because of the
relatively small samples of human remains
that have been analyzed from Pineywoods
Late Caddo sites (Burnett 1990, 402 –
408). Based on admittedly limited bio-
archeological evidence, principally the
low frequency of dental caries and porotic
hyperostosis in the few studied human re-
mains from Titus phase sites, Barbara
Burnett suggests that the Late Caddoan
inhabitants of the Cypress/upper Sabine
and the middle Sabine consumed little to
no maize and “were not dependent upon
a maize-rich diet” (Burnett 1990, 405,
408). The lack of conditions such as os-
teoarthritis and osteoporosis in the Late
Caddoan samples, while again rather
small, may indicate both a different life-
style and workload than Caddoan resi-
dents on the Red River, as well as a high
measure of adaptive success (Burnett
1990, 404). It is important for current
Pineywoods Caddo research that better
archeological and bioarcheological evi-
dence regarding the nature of Titus phase
subsistence be obtained.

Although many of the details are

sketchy, mortuary goods and other exotic
artifacts (such as conch shell, lithic raw
materials, and so forth) suggest that intra-
regional contacts and the exchange of re-
sources between rural and town Caddoan
communities ﬂourished at the time of ini-
tial European contact in the sixteenth cen-
tury. Interregional exchange and contact

ﬂake tools (drills, scrapers, and retouched
pieces), lithic debris and cores, and an ar-
ray of groundstone implements. These in-
clude petaloid and tabular celts, metates
and manos, battered and polished cobbles
and pebbles, hematite and limonite pig-
ment stones, and abrading slabs (Thur-
mond 1990a; R. Turner 1992).

Although bone is not usually well pre-

served on Titus phase sites, bone tools
have been recognized at a number of sites.
They include deer mandibles, deer beam-
ers, ulna punches, antler tines, and deer
and bird bone pins. Turtle carapace
rattles have also been noted.

Titus phase subsistence remains with

interpretive signiﬁcance are currently lim-
ited to a few sites in the upper Sabine
River and upper Cypress Creek basins,
near the western edge of its settlement
distribution (e.g., Perttula 1993c). How-
ever, well-preserved subsistence remains
are known from a number of other sites
of this age in northeastern Texas, but they
have as yet received little professional
attention (Perttula 1993a; Thurmond
1990a). Floral evidence from trash mid-
den deposits suggests that the tropical
cultigen maize (Zea mays) was a dietary
staple, and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were
also an important food source. Nuts and
seeds were gathered, but they appear to

were also well developed between Caddoan
polities and the horticulturists living in the
southwestern United States, the Southern
Plains, and the Lower Mississippi Valley
(see Baugh 1998; Kidder 1998).

Ceramic wares imported from the Red
River Caddoan groups are present in the
Titus phase. They include such ﬁnewares
as Belcher Ridged, Belcher Engraved, Glas-
sell Engraved, and Hodges Engraved from
the Belcher phase to the east (C. Webb
1959, 153) and shell-tempered Avery En-
graved and Simms Engraved pottery types
of the McCurtain and Texarkana phases
to the north some one hundred kilometers
(see Bruseth 1998).

An analysis of the grave goods associa-

tions in a large sample of Whelan and
Titus phase burials indicates that a mod-
icum of interaction occurred between the
Pineywoods groups and Caddoan popula-
tions to the north between a.d. 1350 and
1450, and this interaction increased dur-
ing the Titus phase proper. Glassell En-
graved is a signiﬁcant item of ceramic
trade after a.d. 1450, with interaction to
the north and east seemingly intensifying
after about the mid-1500s. In fact, be-
tween 3.2 and 7.6 percent of ceramic
vessels in this sample of Titus phase buri-
als are Red River trade wares (Perttula
1992a, 249).

Signiﬁcant quantities of nonlocal lithic

raw materials are also present in Titus
phase assemblages. Detailed examination
of lithic raw materials in Three Basins sub-
cluster components in the upper Sabine
River basin indicates that Red River gravel
cherts and chalcedonies comprised about
20 percent of the lithic tools and debris
(Perttula 1984). These lithic raw materi-
als were available from Red River Cad-
doan groups who lived in the vicinity of
the large McCurtain phase Arnold Roitsch
(41RR16) civic-ceremonial center. Hat-
ton tuff and siliceous shales (e.g., Banks
1990) were obtained from the Ouachita
Mountains for the manufacture of celts.

In one study of the lithic raw materials

present in Three Basins subcluster sites
(Perttula 1984), Edwards chert from cen-
tral Texas (Banks 1990) represented about
8 percent of the lithic tools and debris.
This material had to have been obtained
by Caddoan peoples through trade and
exchange with non-Caddoan peoples liv-
ing more than 150 kilometers to the west
and southwest of the Pineywoods Caddo.

Large Galt bifaces, possible “badges of

rank or ofﬁce” (Thurmond 1990a, 35),
found with high-status Titus and Belcher
phase burials from a number of sites
(Perttula and Nelson 1998, table 24), are
made from nonlocal high grade cherts as
well as novaculite. Documentation of sev-
eral Galt bifaces from the Pleasure Point
(41MR63) community cemetery on Big
Cypress Bayou indicate that they were
also manufactured from a dark brown
Edwards chert (Mike Turner 1993, per-
sonal communication).

The presence of Norteño phase ceram-
ics (Womack Engraved) from Titus phase
sites in the Three Basins subcluster sug-
gests that the Norteños (or Wichita-
speaking groups who moved into Texas)
interacted to some extent with the Piney-
woods Caddo. None of the sites with Nor-
teño ceramics contained European trade
goods (e.g., Scurlock 1962), though, and
the period when there was Norteño and
Titus phase contact can only be suggested
to have occurred in perhaps the early to
late seventeenth century.

Gulf Coast conch shell was obtained
by Pineywoods Late Caddo peoples for
the manufacture of conch columella
beads and pendants. This exotic material
is rarely used in the Titus phase (R. Tur-
ner 1978), however, compared to what
has been found at sites inhabited by the
Red River Belcher and McCurtain phase
Caddo groups (D. Kelley 1994; Skinner
et al. 1969; Trubowitz 1984; C. Webb
1959).

The Demise of the
Titus Phase

A reconsideration of Titus phase chro-

nologies, in combination with new as-
sessments of the route of the De Soto/
Moscoso 1542 – 43 entrada through
northeastern Texas (Bruseth 1992; Hud-
son 1990, 1997; Kenmotsu et al. 1993;
Schambach 1989; Thurmond 1990b),
suggests that: (1) the Spanish entrada en-
countered the Titus phase peoples—
probably described by the chroniclers as
the Lacane province—and (2) that within
100 to 150 years of that encounter the
area occupied by the Titus phase had been
virtually abandoned. There was a consid-
erable interval of time between the initial
European-Caddo encounters in the Piney-
woods and the abandonment of the re-

gion by the Titus phase Caddo groups.
While it is likely that some Titus phase
peoples went to live with either the Red
River Kadohadacho or among the Hasinai
Caddo south of the Sabine River, current
explanations for the demise of the Titus
phase peoples hinge on the introduction
and, more importantly, the continued ex-
posure of Caddoan groups to European
epidemic diseases (Perttula 1992a; Thur-
mond 1990a, 233; 1990b), which led
eventually to substantial depopulation
among these Pineywoods groups.

Late Caddoan period Pineywoods
sites, such as those of the Titus phase,
hold great promise for documenting the
nature of sociopolitical, demographic,
and economic changes in the region dur-
ing an eventful time in Caddoan prehis-
tory and protohistory. This promise is due
in large part to their potential for ﬁne-
scale chronological control, say on the
order of twenty to thirty years. As other
studies of Caddoan archeology make
clear, there were substantial changes in
Caddoan societies from ca. a.d. 800 to
European contact (see Jeter et al. 1989;
Story 1990), with one of the more im-
portant being the development and elab-
oration of complex versus egalitarian so-
ciopolitical systems after ca. a.d. 1400 in
many regions of the Caddoan area, in-
cluding the Pineywoods of northeastern
Texas (Perttula 1996).

The apparent intensiﬁcation of maize-

based economies after ca. a.d. 1400 in
much of the Caddoan area may be in
large part responsible for the elaboration
as well as the demise of many of the civic-
ceremonial centers at a time when there
was a reorganization of social and politi-
cal relationships within Caddoan culture
on a regional level. The tangible develop-
ment of predictable maize surpluses at all
levels, the “quality of abundance” referred
to by Mary W. Helms (1992, 188), would
have led to the development of sizable
populations of Titus phase groups and a
strong leadership. Through time, how-
ever, the agricultural surpluses would
have led to the social homogeneity noted
above among Late Caddoan groups in the
Pineywoods because household agricul-
tural sufﬁciency eventually negated the
regionally expansive role of the elite-
controlled social and political economy.
After this time, therefore, social and po-
litical integration appears to have been re-

gionally and locally redeﬁned at a smaller
community scale.

Subsequent to the discontinuation of
large community cemeteries in the early
to mid-seventeenth century, most of the
upper Sabine River and Cypress Creek
basins were abandoned (Perttula 1992a;
Thurmond 1990b). The only post-1680
Caddoan occupations that can be related
to earlier use of the Pineywoods are to be
found in the lower Sulphur and Sabine
Rivers (Perttula 1995b, ﬁg. 19a) at known
trade portages or along trail crossings of
these major streams (Harris et al. 1980;
B. Jones 1968; Perttula 1992a, 172 –77).
None of the Caddoan communities in
the Cypress Creek/upper Sabine basins
appears to have been ethnographically de-
scribed, and what is known from ethno-
graphic and archival documents pertains
principally to the Nadaco or Anadarko
Caddo (Perttula 1995b, ﬁg. 19b). This
group’s prehistoric antecedents are poorly
known, and they appear to have settled in
the Sabine River basin only after ca. 1770

Concluding Remarks

Since the 1950s, a great deal has been

learned by a dedicated group of avoca-
tional and professional archeologists about
the prehistory of this part of northeastern
Texas, particularly regarding the last one
thousand to two thousand years, when
the ancestors of the Caddo Tribe of Okla-
homa are known to have settled in the
area and thrived (Carter 1995; F. Smith
1995). The knowledge gained about the
native American past in the region, about
the challenges faced during times of pre-
historic cultural change, and during the

wrenching episode (still ongoing) of
contact and interaction between the
Caddo peoples and European and Anglo-
American colonizers and settlers (Perttula
1998b) helps to make “native history” an
integral part of—rather than a footnote
to—the ongoing study of Texas’ cultural
heritage.

While there is every reason to think
that our knowledge of northeastern Texas
prehistory will continue to grow by leaps
and bounds, there are tremendous re-
search and preservation challenges ahead
for each prehistoric era. On a mundane
level, it is important that we continually
cast a critical and discerning eye at our re-
search priorities for prehistoric and Cad-
doan archeological sites, the value of our
methodological approaches, and the
worth of our cultural resource manage-
ment planning documents. From the in-
novative use of these tools come the new
perspectives and conceptions that lead to
a broader understanding of the past.

Changes in research strategies are criti-

cal, but in northeastern Texas they are,
unfortunately, only part of the archeolog-
ical story. Of the utmost concern for the
long-term protection and preservation of
the region’s priceless archeological heri-
tage is dealing directly with the unabated
looting and vandalism of prehistoric
Caddo villages and cemeteries— on pri-
vate as well as state and federal lands
(Perttula and Nelson 1999). The archeo-
logical landscape is pitted and pocked
with the looter’s holes and backdirt piles.
Many of the most important archeologi-
cal sites in the region have been irretriev-
ably damaged and destroyed, and it is
questionable that the looting frenzy can
be quelled even should an unmarked

burial protection bill ever be made law in
Texas; the situation is not much better in
Arkansas, Louisiana, or Oklahoma. The
cultural patrimony of the Caddo peoples
is being taken from them, with almost no
hand being lifted to help protect these
signiﬁcant cultural treasures. This chal-
lenge is our greatest in the years ahead:
to ﬁnd a way, in concert with the Caddo
people, to protect and preserve this cul-
tural legacy: “In 1541 when the Span-
iards arrived, every place in the Caddo
country had, of course, a Caddo name
but almost all of those names are gone
now, like the people who bestowed them”
(Schambach 1993, 7).

Acknowledgments

I would particularly like to thank Bo
Nelson for all his assistance and research
collaboration these last several years,
along with that of Mark Walters, as their
considerable help has been invaluable
in coming to terms with the character of
the archeological record in large parts of
east Texas. Thanks also to my Caddo
friends— Cecile Carter, Bobby Gonzalez,
LaRue Parker, Stacey Halfmoon, and Jeri
Redcorn—and Robert Cast of the Caddo
Tribe’s Historic Preservation ofﬁce for
their support of my efforts to understand
the prehistoric and historic archeology of
the Caddo peoples. Dr. Tom Middle-
brook provided me with information on
deep east Texas archeology, along with
ﬁgures from the Tyson site used in this
chapter, and Robert L. Turner provided
information on the Shelby Mound. Fi-
nally, I want to acknowledge the help and
support I received from Barbara Stein
during the preparation of this chapter.
