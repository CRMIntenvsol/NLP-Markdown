Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 89-084616 ISBN 1-56349-063-3 Arkansas Archeological Survey Fayetteville, Arkansas 72702 Printed in the United States of America Third printing June 1997 Offset Printing by the Arkansas Department of Corrections, Wrightsville. Fourth printing July 2001 University of Arkansas Copy Services Abstract This volume presents an overview of archeology -and the nature of archeological resources -in the Southern Great Plains, specifically, the Great Plains subregion of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Southwest Division. A brief sketch of the region’s environment is presented as well as an account of the history and development of archeological research in the Southern Plains. The area of concern is bordered by the foothills of the Rocky Mountains on the west and by the Cross Timbers on the east. The north to south extent is from the Arkansas to Pecos rivers, respectively. A tradi- tional cultural-historical summary including mention of the numerous archeological taxonomic units from the earliest prehistoric groups to the fully historic period is presented in a series of chapters. The Native American groups who are represented in the area in historic times are surveyed in Appendix I, although almost no archeology has been conducted on the sites of most of these groups. The current status and limited history of bioarcheological research is summarized for the region and significant new data are presented especially concerning Late Prehistoric cultural groups. A detailed summary of known prehistoric and historic skeletal remains from the region is provided. Bioarcheology is already add substantially to our understanding of prehistoric cultural events and processes in the region. A synthesizing chapter is presented using the concept of Adaptation Types in which the various archeological taxa are grouped and discussed in general economic terms disregarding the problems caused by modern political boundaries and archeological research histories. The various prehistoric and historic adaptation types are summarized with regard to economy, technology, bioarcheology, environment, important research problems, and significant data gaps. The concluding chapter presents some of the highlights of the study and discusses some of the current problems confronting archeological research in the region. ii

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The completion of this archeological overview has been the result of continuing support of numerous people for more than three years. There are several people who have contributed significantly since the inception of this project and without whose help the project would not have been initiated, much less completed. Special thanks are extended to Larry Banks, Fred Limp, and Don Wyckoff. Specialists from several states took time to review the manuscript or portions of it in various stages of completion. Others provided key source materials. These individuals include Jan Guy, Tom Hester, Dee Ann Story, Carolyn Spock, and Helen Simmons in Texas; Marsha Jackson in New Mexico; Martin Stein and Tom Witty in Kansas; personnel from the Colorado Historical Society; Marvin Jeter, Ann Early, Fred Limp, George Sabo, and Mary Lynn Kennedy of the Arkansas Archeological Survey, and Marshall Gettys of the Oklahoma Historical Society. Substantial assistance with the bibliography was provided by Ines Pennella, Kent Buehler and Mary McClain. Graphic assistance was provided by Julie Rachel. Others at the Oklahoma Archeological Survey who helped in various ways such as critical reading and providing references include Debbie Farris, Richard Drass, Larry Neal, Neva Grotts, Lois Albert, and Don Wyckoff. To these and all who have helped in various ways during this effort, but whom we have failed to mention, our sincere appreciation. Jack L. Hofman and Robert L. Brooks The bioarcheology section was completed with support and information provided by several colleagues. We greatly appreciate their assistance. Special recognition is due William Bass, Billy Harrison, Jack Hughes, and P. Willey for allowing access to their personal files and assisting with interpretation of field records. Our literature survey was enhanced by information provided by James Boone, Mei Wan Campbell, Henry Case, Belinda Cullen, G. Meeks Etcheison, Michael Finnegan, Vivian Forsythe, Neva Grotts, Elaine Guthrie, Jeff Homburg, Alicia Hughes-Jones, David Hughes, Alfred Johnson, Sandy Karhu, Robert Mann, Pat Mercado-Allinger, Sondra Ridgway, Dwight Schmidt, Roberta Speer, Martin Stein, Dee Ann Story, Robert Timberlake, and Thomas Witty. Computer and statistical analysis of the data was aided by Janet Beck, Douglas Bryant, and Jimmy Ringo. Editorial and bibliographic assistance was provided by Dana Bovee. Robert Brooks, Jack Hofman and Joe Hays provided archeological and environmental data essential for interpretation of the osteological data and burial provenience. Examination of collections curated at the Archeological Research Laboratory, West Texas State University, the Panhandle Plains Historical Museum, the Oklahoma Archeological Survey, The Museum, Texas Tech University, and Stovall Museum of Science and History was essential to this investigation. Permission to examine the collections was provided by Julie Droke, Billy Harrison, Jack Hughes, Eileen Johnson and Donald Wyckoff. Visits to research institu- tions were a highlight of the project. Timothy Baugh made arrangements that enabled osteological study of the Grant, Heerwald, and McLemore site skeletal collections. Physical anthropologists working on other sections of the Southwestern Division Overview provided back- ground information, site records, and guidance that assisted our research. We thank Ben Olive, Jerry Rose, Gentry Steele and Am Stodder. Jerry Rose fostered our interest in this project and helped plan our research design. Support for this overview was provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division, as administered by the Arkansas Archeological Survey. Additional financial assistance was provided by Louisiana State University, the Smithsonian Institution, and grants from the National Science Foundation (BNS-8311117 to Timothy Baugh and BNS-8510588 to Douglas Owsley). Larry Banks and W. Fredrick Limp deserve special credit for their guidance, moral support, and patience. Douglas W. Owsley vi

Although sample sizes are often western Europe (Hooton 1933). The skull was considered small, it is now possible to integrate the Southern Plains data most useful in establishing population relationships. More into larger comparative data sets developed during the past recent publications have shifted the emphasis from solely on 15 years for the Northern and Central Plains.
